according to frost and sullivan report 
in december  we relocated our cuba  missouri brake rotor manufacturing facility  to improve our competitive position  to our alsip  illinois facility 
over the last several years  there has been double digit pricing compression on brake rotors and drums purchased from china 
this pricing compression combined with improvement in china supplied products has reduced demand for our domestically manufactured brake rotors 
we have the flexibility to supply purchased brake rotors or internally manufactured brake rotors depending on the customer s preference 
we believe the relocation of the brake rotor facility will enable us to operate this product line profitably at reduced sales volume 
we believe the brake rotors we manufacture in the usa are superior in quality and value to the same parts supplied through plants located in china 
we believe that our us manufactured brake rotors add value to our customer relationships and provide the company with a competitive advantage over competitors who are exclusively marketers of imported brake rotors and drums 
we also believe that we have improved our ability to source product in china through our recent strategic relationship with wanxiang america corporation  china s leading auto parts supplier to the oem and aftermarket 
see further detail regarding our relationship with wanxiang america corporation under line of credit and recent financings 
the trend over the last year has favored growth in the private label segment as customers choose to support their own brands 
we believe there has been a shift over the last several years  by national buying groups and retailers  to build their brand equity as opposed to supporting the big three brake manufacturing companies dana  federal mogul and honeywell brands 
this shift in customer preference supports our business model 
our interests run parallel to the customer s  since our primary focus is to support the growth of our customers private label 
recently  federal mogul announced their intention to acquire honeywell s bendix friction material group  thus  potentially reducing the number of major brands brake part suppliers to two 
we have positioned ourselves as one of the only viable alternatives to the big three brake companies 
our other competitors specialize primarily in one brake category  which makes it more difficult for a customer to manage one supplier for each category from a marketing  supply and inventory management function 
the success of our business model can be demonstrated through the expansion of approved product lines with existing national buying groups such as parts plus  national pronto association  iwda and independent auto parts association  in which we are an approved supplier for two or more brake categories 
industry background braking systems there are two primary types of braking systems for cars and light trucks 
the first is a drum brake system  in which the braking action is created by a brake shoe being forced outward against the inside of a rotating drum 
the second  and newer  system is a disc braking system  in which the braking action is created by two brake pads squeezing a rotor 
each vehicle has either one drum or one rotor at each wheel 
in either case  the braking is initiated by the driver pressing a brake pedal  which causes a master cylinder to compress fluid in the vehicle s braking system  which  in turn  causes the fluid pressure to pass through a brake line to a hydraulic system which causes the action of the brake shoes in a drum system or brake pads in a disc system 
distribution in the aftermarket according to the motor equipment manufacturing association mema aftermarket product sales of all product groups in the united states reached billion in mema believes aftermarket sales will eventually reach billion in the ultimate consumers for automotive aftermarket products can be divided into two primary categories 
the first category consists of customers who choose to have their cars repaired at a commercial service establishment  such as a service station  repair shop or car dealer  and is known as the installer segment 
customers in the second category  the do it yourself segment  are those customers who choose to make the repairs themselves 
traditionally  many car parts have been distributed though a system under which products are sold from manufacturers to warehouse distributors  who then sell to jobbers  who  in turn  sell to installers and consumers 
we believe that in recent years there has been an industry shift away from the traditional channels of distribution toward alternative distribution channels  including manufacturers who sell parts to mass market retailers who serve do it yourself customers  and manufacturers who sell parts to warehouse distributors  who sell directly to installers that provide repair and installation services 
we believe the traditional warehouse jobber distribution system has suffered  and may continue to suffer  some erosion of total market share as a result of the expansion of these alternative distribution channels  particularly as a result of the increased presence in the marketplace of the mass market retailer 
eg autozone  advance auto parts 
however  we believe that these shifts in distribution channels will benefit us  as our principal brake parts customers include these mass market retailers 
frost sullivan estimates that sales of brake parts in the united states aftermarket for passenger cars  sports utility vehicles and light trucks totaled billion in sales in  growing an estimated over we believe the demand for aftermarket brake parts  particularly value line parts  will continue to grow because of the following factors an increasing number of vehicles on the road 
new car sales were strong from through  we expect vehicles sold during this time period to require replacement parts in to an aging vehicle population  which creates the need for more replacement parts 
in  the average age of a vehicle in the united states was years old 
increased production of front wheel drive vehicles  which create more wear on brake parts than rear wheel drive vehicles 
over of all new vehicles are designed with front wheel drive 
a trend toward the use of affordable replacement brake rotors rather than resurfacing existing rotors 
historically  due to the high cost of new rotors  consumers and installers generally chose to resurface brake rotors rather than purchase replacement rotors 
however  due to the availability of lower cost replacement rotors  in recent years  consumers and installers are increasingly choosing to purchase replacement rotors 
modern design innovations  including the automotive industry s shift to the production of an increased number of lighter weight rotors and metallic brake pads 
the newer metallic brake pads are abrasive and wear rotor surfaces much faster than the non metallic pads used in the past 
lighter weight rotors are less costly than heavier rotors  and  when the rotors have worn down  it is generally more cost effective to discard rather than refurbish them 
we believe the private label market category will continue to grow  as customers are looking for the best value for their dollar  and often will not pay extra for premium priced products 
in response to these consumer preferences  mass market retailers have grown in popularity and increasingly seek to sell less expensive private label parts 
in addition  we believe distributors will increase their purchases of private label parts as a means of improving their profit margins 
our growth strategy our strategy is to capitalize on the increasing demand for brake parts by focus on marketing additional brake categories to existing customers 
less than of our existing customers purchase all three brake parts categories from us 
leading the market by first to enter late model applications 
sustaining promotion of ceramic disc brake pads 
expanding sales to automobile manufacturers for the aftermarket and service business  and considering acquisitions of other specialty brake parts distributors and manufacturers 
products the brake parts we sell can be divided into three main categories drums and rotors  friction parts  and hydraulic parts 
the friction category of parts consists of brake shoes for drum systems and brake pads 
cylinders and brake hoses are examples of hydraulic parts 
we manufacture some of these parts and act as a distributor for others 
we market approximately of our products under our trademarks  universal brake parts  or ubp  and to a lesser extent  ultimate  and the remainder under our customers private labels 
we manufacture disc brake rotors in our alsip  illinois facility 
in december  we relocated our cuba  missouri brake rotor manufacturing facility  to improve our competitive position  to our alsip  illinois facility 
we formulate and manufacture disc brake pads at our north american friction plant  located in toronto  canada 
since november  our toronto facility has expanded its product offering to include ceramic disc pads 
ceramic disc pads are a relatively new product segment to the aftermarket without a clearly defined market leader 
increased usage of ceramic disc brake pads at the oem level will continue to drive increased demand for ceramic disc pads in the aftermarket 
at our plant in walkerton  virginia  we manufacture brake pads  brake shoes and drum brake lining 
the hydraulic parts we sell are all purchased from suppliers 
we supply value line brake parts ie  parts sold at prices below those of certain leading national brand name parts  to mass market retailers  traditional warehouse distributors and specialty undercar distributors in north america 
many of our competitors specialize in only one category  such as friction parts or drums and rotors 
by offering a full line of products in several categories  we believe we have an advantage over those competitors offering products in fewer categories  in light of the industry trend toward consolidation of the number of suppliers of products 
commodity operations we conduct a wholesale product operation from our headquarters facility in alsip  illinois  purchasing automotive items such as spark plugs  motor oil and freon  in large volume  at below market prices  and reselling these products at slightly higher prices 
we make large volume purchases of products on the open market  generally buying from domestic and foreign manufacturers and other warehouse distributors  and reselling these products to other warehouse distributors  mass market retailers and jobbers 
these operations  while historically profitable  result in gross margins that are significantly lower than gross margins from our other operations 
for the years ended december   and  excluding sales from our former hungarian foundry  net sales from our wholesale product operations accounted for approximately  and  respectively  of our total net sales  and  and  respectively  of our total gross profits 
sales and marketing we organize our marketing operations around two principal customer groups traditional aftermarket warehouse distributors and mass market retailers 
we employ six full time sales personnel 
sales responsibility is split among the sales personnel between the traditional warehouse distributors and mass market retailers national accounts 
our senior vice president of sales manages our independent sales representative network and other marketing efforts 
the majority of our products  approximately are sold under our customers private brand labels 
most aftermarket distributors are members of national buying marketing groups  which have developed their own private brand labels 
traditional aftermarket distributors this group consists primarily of independent warehouse distributors who market to independently owned auto parts stores and company owned stores 
typically  the traditional aftermarket distributor belongs to a national buying group 
generally  these groups promote their own private label in addition to national brands 
we supply one or more brake product lines to the following marketing groups under the groups private label national pronto association  iapa  apa and aftermarket auto parts alliance 
the rpm group purchases our ubp and ultimate brands 
mass market retailers we also supply national retailers such as advance auto parts  discount auto parts and o reilly s under their private brand labels 
other retailers such as pep boys and murray s discount auto parts purchase brake parts from us under our ubp and ultimate brand 
independent sales representatives we believe we have retained some of the best independent sales representatives across the country 
these representatives assist us with direct sales efforts  customer field work  trade shows and other marketing and sales activities 
these independent sales representatives are compensated on a commission basis 
agreements with our independent sales representatives may be terminated at any time by either party  upon notice 
distributon we seek to provide rapid delivery of a wide variety of brake parts to our customers 
we operate a  square foot distribution center at our headquarters facility located in alsip  illinois 
we also have a  square foot distribution facility in southern california 
we generally are able to fulfill customer orders quickly  as the industry demands  and  therefore  typically do not have a large order backlog 
we generally deliver orders to our brake parts customers within four to five days from the time the order is placed 
in addition  we seek to maintain high fill rates for orders  and  accordingly  do not generally have a large number of back orders 
customers may place their stock orders by telephone  electronically or by facsimile 
deliveries are made from all warehouses  almost exclusively by common carrier 
manufacturing we operate two friction plants  a  square foot disc pad plant located in brampton  ontario  canada and a  square foot brake drum lining and brake shoe remanufacturing plant in walkerton  virginia 
our friction business has experienced substantial growth  and unlike the brake rotor and drum product group  there is no material competition from offshore friction suppliers 
we believe the barrier to entry in the friction category is significant due to the following reasons i building brand acceptance is difficult due to safety related concerns  ii capital requirements are intensive  iii friction formulations are usually patented or highly classified  and iv the business is an art as much as a science and requires highly experienced management 
today we have approximately  square feet dedicated to friction manufacturing 
in  we relocated our rotor machining facility from laredo  texas to cuba  missouri  which was closer to our source of supply of castings and our primary distribution center in alsip  illinois  to reduce our costs 
the cuba facility had a capacity to machine approximately  rotors on a two shift basis 
during the fourth quarter of  the cuba facility was closed and the equipment and related production relocated into our alsip  illinois facility 
this was done to further reduce costs and to lower the break even profit level for this operation 
at present  we have a capacity to machine approximately  rotors annually on a one shift basis 
in  we acquired north american friction  which at the time occupied a  square foot facility near toronto  ontario 
today  as a result of significant growth in the sales of friction products since we entered that market segment  north american friction occupies a  square foot facility in suburban toronto  ontario 
we now offer a full line of friction grades in both riveted and integrally molded disc brake pads 
north american friction was awarded iso certification in july we acquired total brake industries assets in november and operate these assets from a  square foot leased facility in walkerton  virginia 
this facility remanufactures brake shoe lining and remanufactures brake shoes 
in addition  we sell drum brake shoe lining to third party customers 
suppliers and raw materials suppliers we centralize product selection and purchasing functions for our warehouse distribution business at our headquarters located in alsip  illinois 
most of the drums  rotors and hydraulic parts we sell are purchased from a variety of suppliers 
we manufacture the vast majority of the friction parts that we sell 
currently  of the drums  rotors and hydraulic parts we purchase  approximately are manufactured in the peoples republic of china and the remainder in taiwan  italy  canada and the united states 
in connection with a transaction under which we issued  shares of series a preferred stock to venture equities management  inc  an affiliate of wanxiang america corporation and wanxiang group corporation  one of the leading manufacturers of automotive parts in the peoples republic of china  we entered into a supply agreement with wanxiang america corporation 
under the supply agreement  we agreed to make annual purchases of parts from wanxiang america corporation totaling  provided the prices of the products we purchase from wanxiang america are substantially comparable to the prices charged by other suppliers in the peoples republic of china for similar products 
in the event we do not purchase  in products from wanxiang america in a year  we are obligated under the agreement to pay wanxiang america of the difference between  and the amount we have paid to wanxiang america for products during the year 
the agreement provides wanxiang america with a right of refusal with respect to products we seek to purchase from other suppliers located in the peoples republic of china 
the supply agreement has an indefinite term  but can be terminated by wanxiang america at any time and by us if wanxiang america materially fails to perform its obligations under the agreement  or if the number of shares of our common stock underlying the shares of series a preferred stock owned by venture equities management falls below a specified level 
during  we purchased products with an aggregate value of  from wanxiang america 
some of our suppliers may provide a majority or all of our requirements for a particular product or product subcategory 
however  we believe that the loss of any one or more of our suppliers would not have a material adverse effect on us and that alternative sources of supply are readily available at comparable prices in all product categories 
we believe that our relationships with our suppliers are good 
the international trade commission has ruled that rotor sales from china materially injured us rotor manufacturers 
as a result of this determination  the us customs service has imposed anti dumping duties on some chinese suppliers 
these duties can be reviewed annually if requested by a chinese manufacturer or by a us brake rotor manufacturer and depending on the results of the review  the tariff may be decreased or increased 
the dumping duties are plant specific and are retroactive to the importer of record 
however  we are not the importer of record for this purpose and  therefore  to date  have not been affected by dumping duties 
raw materials the main components used in our brake rotor manufacturing operations are iron castings 
we primarily purchase castings from waupaca foundry  inc the prices of castings fluctuate based on the scrap metal and energy costs 
in the most recent three year period  these prices have generally stayed within a range of below to above the price at the beginning of the period 
in addition to waupaca foundry  we purchase castings from a foundry in canada 
although we believe that we have developed good relationships with the foundries that supply our iron castings  any of these foundries could discontinue producing these castings for us at any time 
we believe that the number of foundries equipped to produce iron castings such as the ones used by us in our manufacturing operations is limited 
the loss of any major foundry as a supplier of iron castings and our inability to identify new foundries for the production of iron castings in a timely manner could have a material adverse effect on our business 
in addition  we cannot provide assurances that the foundries currently producing our iron castings will be able to accommodate the anticipated expansion of our manufacturing capabilities 
we are continuously seeking to locate additional foundries that would be suitable for the production of our iron castings 
corporate history our wholly owned subsidiary  universal automotive  inc  an illinois corporation  began operations in as a warehouse distributor of a wide variety of automotive aftermarket replacement parts servicing the chicago area market 
we were incorporated in delaware in january to act as the holding company for several subsidiaries 
in the early s  we started shifting our focus to the brake parts segment of the business  and in  we elected to discontinue our non brake parts warehouse distributor operations due to the lower margins and declining growth prospects of this segment of the business 
we currently conduct our business through the following subsidiaries universal automotive  inc  universal brake parts  inc  an ontario  canada corporation  and universal automotive of virginia  inc  a virginia corporation 
we have discontinued the operations of two other subsidiaries as set forth in discontinued operations below 
our principal executive offices are located at south central  alsip  il  and our telephone number is discontinued operations we have discontinued operations in two areas in order to focus on our core business of manufacturing and distributing brake parts 
the first area in which we have discontinued operations is that of our business to business online auto parts exchange 
this business was operated through a subsidiary  which we formed in december  known as eparts exchange  inc  or epx 
the epx website was activated in august  however  in january we decided to terminate the operations of the online exchange 
the second area in which we have discontinued operations involves our hungarian foundry 
ubp hungary  inc  our wholly owned subsidiary  acquired the assets of csepel iron foundry works  a producer of iron and iron casting products located in budapest hungary  in october this business was operated through ubp csepel  iron foundry  kft  a hungarian corporation and second tier subsidiary of ours 
we decided to exit the foundry business in due to continuing losses at the foundry and our belief that our stable relationship with waupaca foundry eliminated the need to develop an in house capacity for manufacturing rotor castings 
in our financial statements  we wrote down the carrying value of the foundry property to its estimated net realizable value 
we also provided a reserve for costs of disposal and losses of the foundry before its disposal or liquidation 
ubp hungary  inc  sold its ownership interest in ubp csepel  iron foundry  kft 
to euro industrial limited  llc  as of december   for  paid with a promissory note 
also in connection with the sale  several instruments evidencing debt owed by ubp csepel to ubp hungary  inc were replaced by a single promissory note in the amount of  under the terms of the promissory note for the purchase price  the  was to be paid in quarterly installments beginning in april and ending in january this note does not bear interest unless there is a default under the note 
as of march   this note was in default  as no payments have been received 
the  promissory note is to be repaid in monthly installments beginning in november and ending in october this promissory note bears interest at the rate of per year 
as of december   we have fully reserved for amounts due under these notes 
sales of ubp hungary  inc generated by its subsidiary ubp csepel  iron foundry  kft 
were  and  for the years ending december  and  respectively 
the amount of the gain on the sale is subject to substantial uncertainty  because the proposed payments will be made over time and the proposed purchaser is not well capitalized 
accordingly  we have fully reserved the value of these notes 
competition our markets are highly competitive 
we compete primarily on the basis of service  quality  price  inventory availability  delivery time and responsiveness 
we offer a full line of brake parts with the exception of brake calipers 
we compete directly with other companies that offer full or multiple product offerings as well as single category value line distributors 
we believe our complete product offering gives us an advantage over single line competitors and  thus  provides an attractive alternative to the full line big three competitors 
according to frost sullivan  a leading industry analyst  the big three brake companies  dana corporation raybestos  federal mogul wagner brake products and honeywell bendix comprised an estimated of the brake parts aftermarket in we believe the high concentration of business among the big three favors us for the following reasons federal mogul accounts for the second largest share of the aftermarket brake business  a market share  and voluntarily filed for protection under chapter of the united states bankruptcy code in october honeywell  with a market share  has publicly stated its desire to divest itself of the original equipment manufacturer and aftermarket brake business 
dana corporation s raybestos product line  which accounts for the largest share of the aftermarket brake business  a market share  is estimated to be less than of the company s aggregate business and  therefore  must compete with other divisions for resources 
in addition to the above mentioned full line brake suppliers  trw  under its auto specialty brand  services an estimated million in aftermarket brake business 
trw has publicly discussed a spin off or sale of its automotive divisions 
it appears that among the leading full line aftermarket brake suppliers  this is a time of uncertainty 
we also compete with single category value line friction suppliers such as morse automotive and satisfied brake 
both companies are highly respected competitors that each account for of the friction aftermarket according to frost sullivan report 
we believe our full line offering offers an advantage for many customers who utilize these single line competitors because we believe that our full product line offering effectively provides products of comparable quality  price and value 
intellectual property we believe that our labels  ubp and ultimate  are important to our marketing efforts 
the ubp and ultimate braking power trademarks have been registered with the united states patent and trademark office and canadian trademarks office 
we cannot provide assurance that prior registrations or uses of these trademarks  or confusingly similar marks  do not exist in the united states 
if prior registrations or uses exist  we might be precluded from using these trademarks in the united states 
we cannot provide assurance that our trademarks would be upheld if challenged or that we would not be prevented from using the trademarks  either of which could have a material adverse effect on us 
the formulations for our integrally molded brake pads  pucks and drum brake lining are trade secrets  which we maintain as confidential information 
we believe these trade secrets to be valuable 
we could be subject to claims by others that we infringe upon their intellectual property rights 
any litigation regarding our proprietary rights could be costly and divert our management s attention from our operations  result in the loss of certain of our proprietary rights or the payment of substantial monetary damages  require us to seek licenses from third parties or prevent us from selling our products 
employees as of december   we had full time employees  in the following areas in manufacturing  in distribution  in sales and marketing  and in administration 
insurance we maintain insurance in amounts and with coverages and deductibles that our management believes are adequate 
the primary risks that we insure against are professional liability  workers compensation  personal injury  bodily injury  property damage  business interruption and fidelity losses 
we cannot provide assurance that our insurance will adequately protect us from potential losses and liabilities 
we maintain key man term life insurance policies covering the life of mr 
scott in the amount of  and mr 
tzur in the amount of  the proceeds of these policies would be payable to us 
we paid premiums of approximately  for these key man life insurance policies in line of credit and recent financings line of credit 
in september  we entered into a credit agreement with lasalle bank national association and one of its subsidiaries  lasalle business credit  llc  in connection with the renewal and restructuring of a line of credit and term loan with the bank 
the original amount of the term loan  which bears interest at the rate of prime plus 
per year  was  our borrowing limit under our line of credit is based on a percentage of the value of our accounts receivable and inventory  up to a current maximum of  the line of credit currently bears interest at the rate of prime plus  subject to an option on our part  if we are not in default under the credit agreement  to convert the interest rate to libor plus 
both the term loan and the line of credit must be repaid by may  the term loan and the line of credit are both secured by a first lien on substantially all of our assets 
as of december   we owed  under the line of credit and  under the term loan 
the credit agreement with lasalle bank contains limitations on our payment of dividends and making of capital expenditures  and requires us to maintain compliance with financial covenants relating to  among others  defined tangible net worth  earnings before interest taxes  depreciation and amortization  or ebitda  and our fixed charge coverage ratio 
at december   we were in compliance with these financial covenants 
the entire credit facility is secured by a first lien on substantially all of our assets 
at december   approximately  was available for borrowing under the revolving credit line 
issuance of series a preferred stock to venture equities management  inc on august   we issued  shares of series a preferred stock to venture equities management  inc  or vemi  an affiliate of wanxiang america corporation  for consideration of  net of issuance costs of  we used  of the proceeds of the series a preferred stock to make the payment to finova mezzanine capital inc under the restructuring of a debenture discussed below  and reserved an additional  to make the remaining principal payments under the restructuring agreement 
the balance of the proceeds was used to reduce the amount outstanding on our revolving loan indebtedness 
wanxiang america is based in elgin  illinois  and is the united states home office of wanxiang group companies  a leading supplier of auto parts to the automotive aftermarket and original equipment manufacturers based in the peoples republic of china 
the shares of series a preferred stock are currently convertible into a total of  shares of our common stock 
in connection with the purchase agreement for the series a preferred stock  we also issued to wanxiang three warrants to purchase a total of  shares of our common stock 
however  one of the warrants  to purchase  shares of our common stock  is only exercisable upon the occurrence of events of default specified in the warrant 
the purchase agreement relating to the series a preferred stock and related documents contain other agreements among the parties  including a registration rights agreement between us and vemi granting vemi the right to register the shares of our common stock into which the series a shares are convertible  a stockholders agreement among us  vemi and three of our founders  arvin scott  yehuda tzur and sami israel and granting to vemi certain rights of first refusal  a contingent proxy as to some of the their shares and a voting agreement to ensure two of nine board seats to vemi s designees  and a supply agreement between us and wanxiang america requiring us to purchase a minimum quantity of product from wanxiang america each year and giving wanxiang america a right of first refusal to supply chinese manufactured parts on competitive terms and conditions 
restructuring of subordinated debenture held by finova mezzanine capital inc on july   we sold a  subordinated debenture to finova mezzanine capital  inc formerly tandem capital  inc 
calling for payments of interest at per annum through maturity on july  through august   we had issued finova warrants to purchase  shares of our common stock at exercise prices ranging from to  based on of the average closing bid price of our common stock for the days preceding the respective issuance dates 
the warrants were exercisable at any time through the sixth anniversary of the debenture issue date 
during  finova elected to exercise one of its warrants to purchase  shares of our common stock at an exercise price of per share  using a cashless exercise provision whereby finova received a net of  shares of common stock after surrendering  shares  which had a fair market value equal to the aggregate exercise price 
we received no cash proceeds from this transaction when such shares were issued 
on october   we completed a restructuring of the  subordinated debt held by finova 
the restructuring resulted in the following i finova surrendered to us all of its holdings in our common stock and warrants  shares and warrants to purchase an additional  shares at prices ranging from to per share  ii our payment of  to finova  iii issuance to finova of  of series b preferred stock par value  and iv the amendment of the debenture to a reduced principal balance of  the amendment to the debenture also reduced the interest rate from to and requires us to reduce the outstanding balance by making five  payments every days beginning december   for which payments were made with a final payment of  due july  the surrendered warrants had cashless exercise features which  based on the closing price of our common stock of per share on the date of the restructuring  would have allowed finova to receive  shares of common stock 
this transaction resulted in an extraordinary gain of  inclusive of an accrual of all remaining interest to be paid of approximately  for the year ended december  the series b preferred stock has no fixed dividend  entitles the holder to a liquidation preference  is redeemable at any time at our option and is convertible into  shares of common stock for which we provided finova with registration rights 
risk factors in evaluating us and our business  you should carefully consider the following risk factors 
this report contains  in addition to historical information  forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
our actual results could differ significantly from the results discussed in the forward looking statements 
factors that could cause or contribute to such differences include  but are not limited to  those discussed below as well as those discussed elsewhere in this report 
the order in which the following risks are presented is not intended to represent the magnitude of the risks described 
we have not earned profits on a consistent basis and cannot assure you that we will continue to be profitable 
from through  we lost a total of approximately  excluding losses from our hungarian foundry and eparts exchange operations  which were sold as of the end of however  for the year ended december  we made a profit of approximately  we have a plan for continuing profitability which involves improving our balance sheet  gaining market share in the market for friction brake products  enhancing the efficiency of our manufacturing operations  improving brand awareness for our products and developing new  higher margin friction products 
see business our strategy 
however  we cannot assure you that this plan will succeed and  if it does not  we may not be able to sustain profitability 
we have a substantial amount of debt  which could reduce our ability to expand our business and limit our financial flexibility 
we have now  and will continue to have  a significant amount of debt 
as of december   we had approximately million in debt and stockholders equity of approximately million 
our debt to equity ratio is  therefore  approximately four times 
the amount of our debt could have important consequences to you 
for example  it could increase our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions  require us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to payments on our debt  thereby reducing the availability of our cash flow to fund capital expenditures  product development efforts and other general corporate requirements  limit our flexibility in planning for  or reacting to  changes in our business and the industry in which we operate  place us at a competitive disadvantage compared to those of our competitors who have less debt  limit our ability to pay dividends  limit  along with the financial and other restrictive covenants relating to our debt  among other things  our ability to borrow additional funds  and make it more difficult for us to complete acquisitions 
if we are unable to renew our line of credit or if interest rates should rise significantly  this could have a significant negative effect on our financial condition 
we have a line of credit under a credit agreement we entered into with lasalle bank national association and lasalle business credit 
as of december   we owed  under the line of credit 
we depend significantly on the line of credit to fund our purchases of inventory  payroll  freight charges  commission expenses and other expenses 
the line of credit is scheduled to expire on may  we may not be able to renew this line of credit  or obtain another line of credit  on similar terms  if at all 
if we cannot renew this line of credit or obtain a replacement line of credit  this will significantly impair our ability to fund our operations 
if we are able to renew this line of credit or obtain a replacement line of credit only on less favorable terms  the increased interest expense or other costs of the new line of credit will make it more difficult for us to achieve profitability 
additionally  our line of credit contains several covenants  which are tied to our operations and certain financial ratios 
should we breach any of these covenants  there is a potential that the lender will seek to terminate the line of credit 
our ability to grow and improve our financial performance depends on factors such as our ability to gain additional market share  expansion of our manufacturing capabilities  possible acquisitions of other manufacturers or distributors and increasing sales to existing customers 
our ability to grow and improve our financial performance will depend in part on the following factors our ability to gain additional market share for friction brake products  the purchase of additional manufacturing machinery and brake rotor molds to increase the different types of brake rotors we manufacture  the possible acquisition of other brake parts manufacturers or distributors on favorable terms  and our ability to increase sales to current customers and maintain or increase our profit margins with them 
while we regularly evaluate and discuss possible acquisitions  we have not entered into any commitment  agreement or understanding with any potential acquisition candidates  and we cannot assure you that we will be successful in locating suitable acquisition candidates or that any additional acquisitions will be completed in the future 
see item  business our strategy 
in addition  we cannot provide any assurance that any operations that we may acquire can be effectively and profitably integrated into our business  or that any future expansion of our operations or acquisitions will not have a negative effect on our operating results  particularly during the periods immediately following any expansion or acquisition 
the trading price of our common stock has dropped below per share and trading in our common stock on the nasdaq smallcap market may be terminated on january   nasdaq notified us that our stock price had dropped below per share and that if the trading price did not increase to over per share for a minimum of ten consecutive trading days by july   nasdaq would initiate proceedings to cause our common stock to be delisted from trading on the nasdaq smallcap market 
in such an event  our shares could only be traded on the over the counter bulletin board system 
this method of trading could significantly impair our ability to raise new capital and adversely impede future trading of our stock 
in the event that our common stock were delisted from the nasdaq smallcap market due to low stock price  we likely would become subject to special rules  called penny stock rules  which impose additional sales practice requirements on broker dealers who sell our common stock 
the rules require  among other things  the delivery  prior to the transaction  of a disclosure schedule required by the securities and exchange commission relating to the market for penny stocks 
the broker dealer also must disclose the commissions payable to both the broker dealer and the registered representative and current quotations for the securities 
monthly statements must also be sent disclosing recent price information 
in the event that our common stock were characterized as a penny stock  our market liquidity could be severely affected 
the regulations relating to penny stocks could limit the ability of broker dealers to sell our common stock and the ability of owners of our common stock to sell shares in the secondary market 
our ability to expand our business depends on our obtaining additional financing  and there is no guarantee we will be able to obtain this financing 
we will be required to seek additional financing to fund any expansion we undertake through acquisitions or the upgrade of existing facilities 
we have no current commitments or arrangements for additional financing and we cannot assure you that additional financing will be available on acceptable terms  or at all 
we may also issue common stock or other securities in connection with future acquisitions  resulting in additional dilution to existing stockholders 
the automotive industry is cyclical  and a downturn in the industry could have a substantial negative effect on our business 
our business is dependent upon sales of the automotive industry  which creates the total number of vehicles available for repair 
this industry is cyclical and has historically experienced periodic downturns 
these downturns are difficult to predict and in the past have not had an immediate impact on the aftermarket 
the primary market for replacement parts is vehicles that have been on the road for at least five years 
although we believe that downturns in the industry generally benefit us because they result in longer holding periods for cars and further wear and tear on brakes  a protracted downturn in the automotive industry could have a negative effect on the performance of the aftermarket parts industry  in general  and our performance  in particular 
our future performance may be harmed by automotive industry downturns 
our business will suffer if we cannot successfully compete with other companies in our industry  many of whom have far greater resources than us 
our markets are highly competitive 
as a brake parts manufacturer and distributor  we compete directly with other brake parts manufacturers and distributors  including aimco and raybestos brake products  which are divisions of dana corporation  wagner brake products  a division of federal mogul  and bendix  a division of honeywell 
we also compete with numerous value line distributors specializing in one or more specific brake categories 
many of our competitors are larger and have greater capital  management and other resources than we have  and we cannot assure you that we will continue to compete successfully with these businesses 
our success depends on the continued services of key personnel 
our continued success will depend to a significant degree upon the efforts and abilities of our senior management  particularly yehuda tzur  our chairman of the board  and arvin scott  our president and chief executive officer 
if we were to lose the services of mr 
tzur or mr 
scott  this could have a material adverse effect on us 
we have employment agreements with mr 
tzur and mr 
scott 
our supplies of raw materials and finished goods could be disrupted for a variety of reasons  and any disruption would have a material adverse effect on our business 
the primary components used in our brake rotor manufacturing operations are raw iron castings 
most of the finished rotor castings are purchased from china and most of our raw iron castings are produced by  and purchased from  one foundry located in wisconsin 
we duplicate raw iron casting molds used for the production of our better selling brake rotors  and place these molds primarily at this foundry 
although we believe that we have developed a good relationship with this foundry  it could discontinue producing these castings for us at any time 
the number of foundries equipped to produce raw iron castings such as the one used by us in our manufacturing operations is limited 
our inability to identify new foundries for the production of raw iron castings in a timely manner could have a substantial negative effect on our business 
the imposition of anti dumping duties on products we import from china could substantially increase our costs and hamper our efforts to achieve profitability 
on march   a petition was filed before the united states department of commerce and international trade commission seeking the imposition of anti dumping duties on some brake drums and rotors imported from the people s republic of china 
the international trade commission later ruled that rotor sales from china materially injured united states manufacturers of rotors 
as a result of the decision by the international trade commission  the united states customs service has imposed anti dumping duties on several chinese suppliers 
see item  business suppliers and raw materials 
these duties are specific to particular plants at which rotors are manufactured  and  to date  none of the plants from which we purchase rotors has been subject to a duty 
however  if any of the plants from which we purchase rotors become subject to duties  this could increase our costs of purchasing these rotors and make it more difficult for us to achieve profitability 
we are obligated to purchase a substantial portion of our supplies from wanxiang america corporation  which could limit our ability to negotiate favorable terms with other suppliers 
in connection with the issuance of our series a preferred stock  we entered into a supply agreement with wanxiang america corporation  an affiliate of the purchaser of the series a preferred stock  which obligates us  with certain exceptions  to purchase at least  worth of products each year from wanxiang america  provided it is able to supply the products on substantially competitive terms 
see item  business suppliers and raw materials 
our obligations under this contract could have the effect of limiting our ability to negotiate favorable terms with other suppliers 
our executive officers and directors control a substantial minority block of our voting power and their interests may be different from yours and  as a result  you may have no effective voice in our management 
our executive officers and members of our board of directors  as a result of their ownership of common stock and options to purchase shares of our common stock  beneficially own  shares  or  of our voting stock 
see item  security ownership of certain beneficial owners and management 
by virtue of this ownership  these individuals can exercise control over our business  policies and affairs and exert substantial influence over the election of our directors  and the approval or disapproval of actions requiring a shareholder vote 
accordingly  you may have no effective voice in our management 
this concentration of stock ownership could have the effect of delaying or preventing  and may discourage attempts to bring about  a change in control or the removal of our existing management 
these negative effects would become even more likely if these members of our management and board of directors agreed to vote their shares in a similar manner as venture equities management  inc  which  as discussed below  owns a substantial percentage of our voting stock 
venture equities management  inc  or vemi  by virtue of its holding  shares of series a preferred stock  currently convertible into  shares of our common stock  beneficially owns approximately of our voting stock assuming conversion of all preferred stock to common 
in connection with the issuance of the series a preferred stock  vemi and its affiliates were granted numerous rights  including vemi s right to designate two members of our board of directors 
as a result  vemi has significant influence over decisions on matters such as a change of control  the removal of our management or similar matters 
if vemi agreed to vote its shares in the same manner as the members of our management and board of directors  these shareholders would have the ability to ensure the approval of any of these types of decisions 
the calculation of vemi s beneficial ownership takes into account vemi s ownership of two warrants to acquire a total of an additional  shares of our common stock  which are exercisable through august  however  vemi also owns a default warrant to purchase  shares of our common stock which would become exercisable if any of several events of default  as defined in the default warrant  occur 
there are numerous events which would constitute an event of default under the default warrant  and if our financial condition deteriorates or should we fail to make timely payments on our accounts payable to wanxiang america corporation  an affiliate of vemi  or otherwise default in our supply agreement with wanxiang america corporation and fail to cure the same  vemi could be entitled to purchase the shares underlying this warrant at a substantial discount to the current price of our common stock 
in addition  mr 
tzur and mr 
scott  our two largest individual shareholders  have granted a proxy to vemi or its designees  which will give it power to vote their shares if specified events of default of occur  in some cases without exercising the default warrant 
if any of these events of default occurred  and vemi exercised all of the warrants held by it  it could acquire approximately of our voting power  assuming exercise of the default and common stock warrants 
if vemi held this percentage of our voting power  it could control the outcome of votes on matters such as a change of control  the removal of our management  or similar matters  regardless of whether it voted its shares in the same manner as our executive officers and directors 
we could be subject to claims based on the use of asbestos brake parts have continued to evolve over the years  with substantial improvements in product formulations over time 
for example  new materials such as ceramics have been introduced into the marketplace 
in  we purchased our factory in walkerton  virginia  which had been using asbestos in products 
we immediately discontinued the manufacturing of asbestos disc brake pads and continued to sell through the existing asbestos brake drum lining and raw materials for a period of time 
we are not aware of any claims having been made at any of our facilities related to asbestos exposure  but a risk exists that persons may seek to assert that this exposure was related to our operations  which could subject us to liability 
additionally  persons may seek to assert that our operation as a warehouse distributor prior to may have resulted in the sale of products that contained asbestos 
we do not anticipate paying dividends in the foreseeable future 
we do not intend to declare or pay any cash dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future and anticipate that earnings  if any  will be used to finance the development and expansion of our business 
moreover  agreements with our primary and mezzanine lenders and the certificate of designations for our series a preferred stock prohibit us from paying dividends without the consent of these lenders and the holders of a majority of the series a preferred stock 
you should not expect us to pay dividends on our common stock until such time  if any  that we are able to obtain a release of these prohibitions on the payments of dividends imposed by the terms of these documents 
we do not anticipate obtaining a release on these prohibitions in the foreseeable future 
any payment of future dividends and the amounts thereof will depend upon our earnings  financial requirements  and other factors deemed relevant by our board of directors  including our contractual obligations 
there are numerous outstanding warrants to purchase shares of our common stock  which could impair our ability to obtain additional capital on favorable terms 
the  units we sold in connection with our initial public offering in december were comprised of one share of common stock and one redeemable common stock purchase warrant entitling the holder of the warrant to purchase one share of common stock at an exercise price of per share  subject to certain adjustments  at any time until december  in december  we extended the expiration date of these warrants to december   and reduced their exercise price from to per share 
we later extended the expiration date of these warrants on four additional occasions 
the latest extension  in may  changed the expiration date to september  as of march   there were  of these warrants outstanding 
we also have issued warrants to purchase a total of  shares of our common stock to venture equities management  inc warrants to purchase  of these  shares are exercisable through august   and the warrant to purchase the remaining  shares would become exercisable if any of several events of default specified in the warrant occur 
we have also issued warrants for various other purposes  which are still outstanding 
as of march   there were other warrants to purchase a total of  shares of our common stock outstanding  in addition to the other warrants referred to above 
our ability to issue blank check preferred stock could discourage takeover attempts and  therefore  cause the price of our stock to decline 
our certificate of incorporation authorizes the issuance of blank check preferred stock with designations  rights and preferences as may be determined from time to time by our board of directors 
accordingly  our board of directors has the ability  without stockholder approval  to issue preferred stock with dividend  liquidation  conversion  voting or other rights  which could diminish the voting power or other rights of the holders of our common stock 
we have already issued a substantial number of shares of series a and series b preferred stock 
the existing preferred stock  together with any shares of preferred stock we may issue in the future  could be utilized  under certain circumstances  as a method of discouraging  delaying or preventing a change in control 
this possible impact on takeover attempts could cause the price of our common stock to decline 
future sales of securities held by our officers  directors or the holders of our preferred stock could cause the price of our stock to decline 
approximately  of our outstanding shares of common stock which includes  shares beneficially owned by officers and directors   shares issuable upon conversion of preferred stock and  shares issuable upon exercise of outstanding warrants are restricted securities under rule promulgated under the securities act and may not be resold except pursuant to a registration statement effective under the securities act or pursuant to an exemption from registration  including the exemption provided by rule in general  under rule as currently in effect  subject to the satisfaction of other conditions  a person who has owned restricted shares of common stock for at least one year is entitled to sell these shares subject to the volume limitations prescribed by rule shares issuable upon conversion of our series a and series b preferred stock are presently eligible for sale under rule in addition  the holders of some of the shares issuable upon the exercise of the outstanding warrants have registration rights  which could cause these shares to be registered under the securities act of  and  therefore  become freely tradable  at an earlier date 
the shares held by our officers  directors and affiliates are presently eligible for sale under rule future sales of shares of common stock by our officers and directors under rule  or by the holders of the series a and b preferred stock to the extent these shares are converted into the common stock  could cause the price of our common stock to decline

as of march   a total of approximately  shares of common stock have been sold pursuant to these plans 
the market for our stock is less active than that of many other stocks included in the nasdaq stock market  which could make it difficult to sell shares when desired 
although our stock is included in the nasdaq stock market  it is less actively traded than the shares of many of the other companies included in nasdaq 
in addition  there has been no trading in our stock or public warrants on the chicago stock exchange over the last several years and the chicago stock exchange delisted our shares of common stock and warrants effective march  the volume of trading in our stock on the nasdaq smallcap market is frequently low  which means that you may have difficulty selling the shares at a time when you desire 
we provide extensive indemnification to our officers and directors  which limits our ability to recover damages from our officers and directors and could greatly increase the costs to us in the event of shareholder litigation 
we intend to indemnify our officers and directors to the fullest extent permissible under the law 
under most circumstances  our officers and directors may not be held liable to us or our shareholders for errors in judgment or other acts or omissions in the conduct of our business unless these errors in judgment  acts or omissions constitute fraud  gross negligence or malfeasance

we rely on internally generated funds  credit made available from suppliers and senior and subordinated lines of credit 
our working capital needs are generally not seasonal in nature  although business slows down slightly during the winter months 
we have incurred significant indebtedness  to date  in connection with our operations 
as of december   our total consolidated indebtedness was approximately  a substantial portion of this indebtedness is secured by substantially all of our assets and by a pledge of all of the outstanding capital stock of our subsidiaries 
as a result of such indebtedness  we i are prohibited from paying cash dividends pursuant to certain covenants and restrictions contained in the loan agreements governing such indebtedness  ii could be hindered in our efforts to obtain additional financing in the future for working capital  capital expenditures  acquisitions or general corporate or other purposes  and iii would be vulnerable to increases in interest rates since substantially all of our borrowings are at floating rates of interest 
on september   we completed a renewal and restructuring of our credit agreement with lasalle bank national association and one of its subsidiaries lasalle for a a revolving line of credit of up to  based on eligible accounts receivable and inventory and b a term loan in the amount of  the term loan was reduced by  in october from the proceeds of the sale of our chicago facility 
the credit agreement was amended in to increase the revolving line of credit to  at december   we were in compliance with all financial covenants 
on july   we sold a  subordinated debenture to finova mezzanine capital  inc formerly tandem capital  inc 
calling for payments of interest at per annum through maturity on july  through august   we had issued finova warrants to purchase  shares of our common stock at exercise prices ranging from to  based on of the average closing bid price of our common stock for the days preceding the respective issuance dates 
the warrants were exercisable at any time through the sixth anniversary of the debenture issue date 
during  finova elected to exercise one of its warrants to purchase  shares of our common stock at an exercise price of per share  using a cashless exercise provision whereby finova received a net of  shares of common stock after surrendering  shares  which had a fair market value equal to the aggregate exercise price 
we received no cash proceeds from this transaction when such shares were issued 
on october   we completed a restructuring of the  subordinated debt held by finova 
the restructuring resulted in the following i finova surrendered to us all of its holdings in our common stock and warrants  shares and warrants to purchase an additional  shares at prices ranging from to per share  ii our payment of  to finova  iii issuance to finova of  of series b preferred stock par value  and iv the amendment of the debenture to  the amendment to the debenture also reduced the interest rate from to and allowed us to pay the remaining balance by making five  payments every days beginning december   for which payments were made with a final payment due july  the surrendered warrants had cashless exercise features which  based on the closing price of our common stock of per share on the date of the restructuring  would have allowed finova to receive  shares of common stock 
this transaction resulted in an extraordinary gain of  inclusive of an accrual of all remaining interest to be paid of approximately  for the year ended december  the series b preferred stock has no fixed dividend  entitles the holder to a liquidation preference  is redeemable at any time at our option and is convertible into  shares of common stock for which we provided finova with registration rights 
on august   we issued  shares of series a preferred stock par value to venture equities management  inc vemi an affiliate of wanxiang america corporation see note to our financial statements in exchange for  in cash 
the series a preferred stock has no fixed dividend  entitles the holder to a liquidation preference  is redeemable at our option subject to certain conditions  and is convertible into  shares of our common stock with registration rights  subject to certain antidilution provisions 
in connection with the issuance of the series a preferred stock  we also issued to vemi three warrants to purchase common stock 
the first and second warrants for  shares were exercisable at any time through august  at an exercise price of per share 
the exercise date for the first and second warrants was extended to august  and the exercise price was increased to per share 
the third warrant for  shares is exercisable only upon the occurrence of events of default at an exercise price to be determined based on a defined computation 
we believe that cash generated from operations  borrowings under our bank line of credit  the restructuring of the finova subordinated debt and the issuance of preferred stock to vmei and credit from our suppliers is sufficient to fund our working capital requirements and capital expenditures through our future contractual obligations are as follows contractual obligations next after total months years years revolving loan   subordinated debt    long term debt   capital leases     other long term obligations    operating leases     seasonality our business is slightly seasonal in nature  primarily as a result of the impact of weather conditions on the demand for automotive replacement parts 
historically  our sales and profits have been slightly higher in the second and third calendar quarters of each year than in the first or fourth quarters 
effects of inflation we historically have been able to diminish the effects of inflationary cost expenses through increased prices to customers and productivity improvements 
non inventory cost increases  such as payroll  supplies and services have generally been offset through price increases 
critical accounting policies  recent accounting pronouncements our significant accounting policies are described in note to the consolidated financial statements 
the application of these policies may require management to make judgments and estimates about the amounts reflected in the financial statements 
management uses historical experience and all available information to make these estimates and judgments  and different amounts could be reported using different assumptions and estimates 
in april  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued no  rescission of fasb no

in june  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities 
sfas no 
 which requires that a liability for costs associated with an exit or disposal activity be recognized in the period in which the liability is incurred  is effective for exit and disposal activities initiated after december  the adoption of sfas no 
is not expected to have a significant effect on the company s results of operations or it financial position 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk we believe that we do not have significant exposure to market risk associated with derivative financial instruments  other financial instruments or derivative commodity instruments 
we had previously utilized only limited derivative financial instruments and did not use them for trading purposes and have never used derivative commodity instruments 
at december   there were no such derivative instruments 
the fair value of financial instruments  other then debt instruments  closely approximates their carrying value 
because the interest rate of the revolving loan and the term loan with lasalle bank national association adjusts with the changes in the market rate of interest  we believe that the fair value is equivalent to the carrying value 
we believe that the interest rate of on the subordinated debenture is approximately equal to the current rate available for similar debt 
accordingly  the fair value of this debenture approximates its carrying value
