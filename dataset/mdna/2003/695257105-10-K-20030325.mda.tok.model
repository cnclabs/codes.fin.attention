cumulative effect of change in accounting principles in july  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued sfas no 
effective january   the company adopted sfas no 
and recorded a goodwill impairment charge for certain protective and flexible packaging businesses of million  million after tax  or per share  as a cumulative effect of change in accounting principles in the first quarter of liquidity and capital resources capitalization december in millions short term debt  including current maturities of long term debt long term debt   total debt   minority interest shareholders equity  total capitalization   shareholders equity decreased million from december   to december   primarily as a result of recognizing a minimum pension plan liability and reducing net pension plan assets 
the recording of these transactions was necessitated by requirements of sfas no 
 employers accounting for pensions  in that the fair market value of pension plan assets fell below the company s accumulated pension benefit obligations as of the annual measurement date for us september and foreign december plans 
this resulted from the impact of the sharp decline in equity markets on the value of the pension plans assets and the reduction from to for us plans in the discount rate used to measure pension plan obligations 
these factors gave rise to a million decrease in shareholders equity  which had no effect on net income  cash flow  bank covenant compliance  or requirements to make contributions to the pension plans 
this decline was offset partially by net income of million 
the ratio of debt to total capitalization rose to at december   from at december   primarily because of the decrease in shareholders equity 
cash flows in millions cash provided used by operating activities investing activities financing activities cash provided by operating activities was million in  compared with million in the million improvement reflected the increase in income from continuing operations  offset partially by the impact of various other items  primarily higher receivables driven by increased sales and a decline in the level of asset securitization 
investing activities used million of cash in  principally for capital expenditures million and acquisitions million 
cash used by investing activities was million in  primarily reflecting the net of expenditures for property  plant  and equipment million and proceeds from the sale of businesses million and pca stock million 
cash used by financing activities was million in  driven primarily by the repurchase of company stock million and the retirement of debt million 
financing activities used million of cash in  primarily for the retirement of debt 
capital commitments commitments for authorized expenditures totaled approximately million at december  it is anticipated that the majority of these expenditures will be funded over the next months from existing cash and short term investments and internally generated cash 
liquidity and off balance sheet financing the company uses various sources of funding to manage liquidity  including off balance sheet financing vehicles 
sources of liquidity include cash flow from operations and a year  million revolving credit facility  under which million was outstanding at december  the company was in full compliance with financial and other covenants included in the revolving credit agreement at year end off balance sheet financing consists of an asset securitization program and a synthetic lease facility 
asset securitization totaled million and million at december   and december   respectively 
the synthetic lease agreement  which will expire in  contains customary terms and conditions covering  among other things  residual value guarantees  default provisions  and financial covenants  and requires the company to satisfy certain financial ratio tests 
termination of the lease agreement  either before or at expiration  would require the company to make a termination payment million at december   and  which  in essence  represents off balance sheet debt in that the company might be required to obtain alternative financing to fund such a payment 
likewise  termination of the asset securitization program would require the company to increase its debt or decrease its cash balance by a corresponding amount 
see critical accounting policies for more information on the company s synthetic lease agreement 
management believes that cash flow from operations  available cash reserves  and the ability to obtain cash under the company s credit facilities and asset securitization program will be sufficient to meet current and future liquidity and capital requirements

 accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities 
sfas no 
requires companies to recognize costs associated with exit or disposal activities when they are incurred rather than at the time that a commitment to an exit or disposal plan is made 
examples of costs covered by the statement include lease termination expenses and certain employee severance costs that are associated with a restructuring  discontinuing an operation  a plant closing  or other exit or disposal activities 
sfas no 
is to be applied prospectively to exit or disposal activities initiated after december  in november  the fasb issued interpretation fin no 
 guarantor s accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees  including guarantees of indebtedness of others 
fin no 
requires that certain guarantees be recorded at fair value and requires guarantors to make significant new disclosures  even if the likelihood of making payments under the guarantees is remote

 accounting for stock based compensation 
while not requiring companies to use the fair value method of accounting for stock based compensation  sfas no

 consolidation of variable interest entities 
fin no 
addresses accounting for variable interest entities vies  defined as separate legal structures that either do not have equity investors with voting rights or have equity investors with voting rights that do not provide sufficient financial resources for the entities to support their activities 
fin no 
requires that a vie be consolidated by a company if that company is subject to a majority of the vie s gains and losses and disclosures be made regarding vies that a company is not required to consolidate but in which it has a significant variable interest 
consolidation requirements apply immediately to vies created after january   and in the first fiscal year or interim period beginning after june   for existing vies 
certain of the disclosure requirements apply to financial statements issued after january   regardless of when the vie was created 
upon pactiv s july   adoption of fin no 
 the company is likely to consolidate the vie associated with the properties covered by its synthetic lease facility  resulting in an increase in long term debt and property  plant  and equipment of million and million  respectively 
consolidation of the vie also would require the company to recognize  as a cumulative effect of change in accounting principles  depreciation expense on the leased assets from lease inception to june   which would negatively impact net income by approximately million  or per share 
on a going forward basis  consolidation of the vie would reduce net income by approximately million  or per share  annually 
critical accounting policies following are the accounting policies of pactiv that  in management s opinion  are the most important in portraying the company s financial condition and results of operations 
these policies involve a degree of judgment and or estimation regarding inherently uncertain factors 
sales deductions in arriving at net sales  the company estimates the amount of sales deductions likely to be earned or taken by customers in conjunction with incentive programs such as volume rebates  early payment discounts  and coupon redemptions 
such estimates are based on historical trends and are reviewed quarterly for possible revision 
the company believes the amount of sales deductions reflected in net sales for the months ended december   is reasonable 
in the event that future sales deduction trends vary significantly from past or expected trends  reported sales might increase or decrease by a material amount 
inventory valuation the company s inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market 
a portion of inventories at december   and is valued using the last in  first out lifo method of accounting 
management prefers the lifo method in that it reflects in cost of sales the current cost of the company s raw materials primarily plastic resins  which can be volatile 
if the company had valued these inventories using the first in  first out fifo accounting method  net income would have been million  or per share  and million  or per share  lower in and  respectively  and would have been million  or per share  higher in the company s protective and flexible packaging businesses value their inventory using fifo or average cost methods 
many of these businesses are located in countries where use of the lifo method is not permitted 
management believes that the cost and complexity of using multiple inventory accounting methods in these countries would outweigh the benefits 
management periodically reviews its inventory balances to identify slow moving or obsolete items 
this determination is based on a number of factors  including new product introductions  changes in consumer demand patterns  and historical usage trends 
pension plans the company accounts for pension plans in accordance with requirements of sfas no 
pension plan income million  million  and million for the months ended december    and  respectively is included in the statement of income as an offset to selling  general  and administrative expenses 
projections indicate that the company s noncash pension income will decline to approximately million in  principally reflecting the decline in equity market values  the reduction in the discount rate used to measure pension obligations from to  and the impact of the company s decision to reduce the expected long term rate of return on pension assets for from to 
pension income is based on a number of factors  including estimates of future returns on pension plan assets  amortization of actuarial gains losses  expectations regarding employee compensation  and assumptions pertaining to participant turnover  retirement age  and life expectancy 
in developing its assumption regarding the rate of return on pension plan assets  the company receives input from its outside actuary and investment advisors on asset allocation strategies and projections of long term rates of return on various asset classes  risk free rates of return  and long term inflation rates 
since inception in  the pension plans annual rate of return on assets has averaged 
over its history  the plan has invested approximately of its assets in equities and in fixed income 
after consideration of all of these factors  the company concluded that a rate of return assumption was appropriate for holding all other assumptions constant  a one half percentage point change in the rate of return assumption would impact the company s pension income by approximately million pretax 
the company s discount rate assumption is based on returns on long term corporate bonds that receive the second highest credit rating from recognized rating agencies as of its measurement date approximately at september  
consequently  the company lowered its discount rate assumption for to from 
holding all other assumptions constant  a one half percentage point change in the discount rate would impact the company s pension income by approximately million pretax 
the company utilizes a market related method for calculating the value of plan assets 
this method recognizes the difference between actual and expected returns on plan assets over years 
the resulting unrecognized gains or losses  along with other actuarial gains and losses  are amortized using the corridor approach outlined in sfas no 
holding all current assumptions constant  the company s pension income will decline by approximately million pretax in  principally reflecting the amortization of unrecognized actuarial losses 
synthetic leases the company has entered into a synthetic lease agreement with a third party lessor and various lenders to finance the cost of its headquarters building and certain of its warehouse facilities 
the synthetic lease agreement  which will expire in november  contains customary terms and conditions covering  among other things  residual value guarantees  default provisions  and financial covenants  and requires the company to satisfy certain financial ratio tests  with which it was in full compliance at december  termination of the lease agreement  either before or at expiration  would require the company to make a termination payment million at december   which  in essence  represents off balance sheet debt in that the company might be required to obtain alternative financing to fund such a payment 
in january  the fasb issued fin no 
 which revises the accounting and disclosure requirements for vies  such as the company s synthetic lease agreement
