the company derives substantially all of its revenue from fees for consulting services  which are billed on a time and materials or fixed price basis 
invoices are typically issued bi weekly to monitor client satisfaction and manage outstanding accounts receivable balances 
recently  more of the company s consulting engagements are fixed price projects 
as a result  the company s revenue before expense reimbursements derived from fixed price contracts increased to of revenue before expense reimbursements in as compared to and in and  respectively 
the company also realizes a limited amount of revenue before expense reimbursements from product sales as a value added reseller of software products 
the company currently resells software products primarily as an occasional accommodation to clients who prefer to retain a single source provider 
in  product sales accounted for of revenue before expense reimbursements as compared to and in and  respectively 
business conditions continued to deteriorate further in the second half of  with revenue before expense reimbursements declining by million or in the third quarter as compared to the second quarter  and  or in the fourth quarter as compared to the third quarter 
revenue before expense reimbursements in the fourth quarter was lower than any quarterly period since the third quarter of and was negatively impacted by the loss of our largest client  pharmacia  who accounted for of our revenue before expense reimbursements during accordingly  management took further actions to better match the company s capacity with the lower demand level 
during the year  project personnel headcount was further reduced to as of december  through both restructuring programs and voluntary attrition 
furthermore  additional office space consolidation was undertaken in boston  chicago  denver and minneapolis with resulting write offs of office furniture and fixtures as well as leasehold improvements 
additional measures to reduce our operating expense may be required in the future depending on market conditions and revenue growth 
throughout  the company announced several cost reduction measures to address challenging business conditions see note 
the measures  which included office consolidations and headcount reductions  resulted in restructuring and other related charges of million 
the company anticipates that these actions will provide savings of approximately million in cost cutting measures undertaken in were anticipated to result in cost savings of approximately million in the company realized actual cost savings of approximately million in existing clients from the previous fiscal year generated approximately of revenue before expense reimbursements in and approximately and of revenue before expense reimbursements in and  respectively 
the company manages client development efforts through specific account management efforts 
the company s most significant expense is project personnel and expenses  which consists primarily of project personnel salaries and benefits  and non reimbursed direct expenses incurred to complete projects 
the company continues to manage employee expenses by calculating a variable portion of employee compensation payable upon the achievement of measurable performance goals 
the company s project personnel and expenses as a percentage of revenue are also related to consultant utilization 
the company manages utilization by monitoring project requirements and timetables 
the number of consultants assigned to a project varies according to the size  complexity  duration and demands of the project 
project completions and scheduling delays may result in periods when consultants are not fully utilized 
an unanticipated termination of a significant project could also cause us to experience lower consultant utilization  resulting in a higher than expected number of unassigned consultants 
in addition  the company does not fully utilize consulting personnel on billable projects during the initial months of their employment 
during that time they undergo training and become integrated into the company s operations 
selling and marketing expenses consist primarily of salaries  employee benefits and travel costs of selling and marketing personnel and promotional costs 
general and administrative expenses consist primarily of costs associated with executive management  finance and administrative groups  including personnel devoted to recruiting  employee retention and training  occupancy costs including depreciation  amortization and office equipment leases  travel  and all other branch and corporate costs 
the company has made substantial investments in infrastructure  including senior management and other experienced administrative personnel  experienced business development managers and advanced management reporting systems 
in november  the company hired craig b 
lashmet   as president of the company 
mr

management s use of estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements  and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting periods 
for example  significant estimates and assumptions have been made with regard to the revenue recognition under fixed price contracts  deferred taxes  and estimated costs associated with restructuring charges 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
critical accounting policies revenue recognition 
the company recognizes the majority of its revenue before expense reimbursements on fixed price projects 
revenue on these projects is based upon the ratio of hours worked to total estimated hours to complete the project 
the cumulative impact of any revision in estimates of the percentage of completion is reflected in the period in which the revision becomes known 
losses on contracts  if any  are provided for in full in the period when first determined 
in certain instances  client arrangements require that a project milestone must be reached and written acceptance received from the client prior to billing 
in these cases revenue is recognized when milestones are reached and written acceptance from the client is received 
in addition  the company recognizes a portion of its revenue before expense reimbursements on a time and materials basis 
the company provides an allowance for doubtful accounts against the portion of accounts receivable that are estimated to be uncollectible 
the balances owed by several clients could materially impact the financial statements if such balances are not collected 
in prior years  the company s collection experience has varied substantially from quarter to quarter and accordingly  has resulted in quarterly fluctuations of write offs and bad debts expense 
deferred taxes 
we recorded a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
in making this assessment  we considered future taxable income  feasible tax planning strategies  and other factors in determining the need for a valuation allowance 
in the event that we determine that we would not be able to realize all or part of our net deferred tax assets  we record a valuation allowance in the period such determination is made 
conversely  if we later determine that it is more likely than not that the net deferred tax assets would be realized based on changes in facts and circumstances at the time of our assessment  then the previously provided valuation allowance would be reversed 
the company s current valuation allowance covers all deferred tax assets see note 
restructuring charges 
during and  we recorded significant charges in connection with our restructuring programs 
the related reserves reflect judgments and estimates of our ultimate costs for severance  asset abandonments and settlement of contractual obligations under our operating leases  including sublease rental rates  absorption period to relet space  brokerage commissions and other related costs 
we reassess the reserve requirements to complete each individual plan under our restructuring programs at the end of each reporting period 
such charges have been recorded under emerging issues task force issue no 
 liability recognition for certain employee termination benefits and other costs to exit an activity including certain costs incurred in a restructuring  and securities and exchange commission staff accounting bulletin no 
 restructuring and impairment charges 
actual experience may differ from these estimates and changes to our previous estimates are adjusted when first determined see note
