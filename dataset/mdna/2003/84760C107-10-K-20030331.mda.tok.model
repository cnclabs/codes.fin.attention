item business general we develop  manufacture  market and distribute single use medical devices used in minimally invasive surgical procedures within the cardiovascular system in conjunction with our proprietary excimer laser system 
excimer laser technology delivers comparatively cool ultraviolet energy in short  controlled energy pulses to ablate or remove tissue 
our excimer laser system includes the cvx laser unit and various fiber optic delivery devices  including disposable catheters and sheaths 
our excimer laser system is the only excimer laser system approved in the united states and europe for use in multiple  minimally invasive cardiovascular applications 
our excimer laser system is used in complex atherectomy procedures to open clogged or obstructed arteries in the coronary vascular system 
it is also used to remove lead wires from patients with implanted pacemakers or cardioverter defibrillators  which are electronic devices that regulate the heartbeat 
we also have regulatory approval to market our products in two key international markets 
in conjunction with our distributor heiwa bussan co  ltd  we have received approval to market some of our coronary atherectomy products in japan  and are seeking additional approvals there for our newer coronary products and our lead removal product line 
in europe  in addition to our coronary atherectomy and lead removal product lines  we also have approval to market our products to treat artery blockages in the upper and lower leg 
we are currently sponsoring clinical trials in order to obtain regulatory approval in the united states to market our products domestically for use in the upper and lower leg

strategy our strategy includes the following key points leverage technical expertise in generation and delivery of excimer energy 
we have designed our excimer laser platform to support multiple existing and potential therapeutic applications for the treatment of cardiovascular disease 
we are exploring additional applications of our core excimer laser technology for novel treatments of coronary and vascular conditions 
during  we completed two major clinical trials laci laser angioplasty to treat critical limb ischemia and pela peripheral excimer laser angioplasty 
we submitted a pre market approval supplement pmas to the food and drug administration fda in january  which requests clearance to commercially market certain products for the treatment of critical limb ischemia 
we anticipate fda approval in late for this new application of our technology 
we are currently analyzing the data from the pela trial and  if the clinical data warrants  a submission to the fda is expected during we are also exploring the use of our technology to treat blockages caused by the formation of thrombus blood clots 
we are currently gathering clinical data for laser based treatment of acute myocardial infarction ami  or heart attack and performing laboratory animal studies for laser treatment of ischemic stroke 
both heart attacks and ischemic stroke result from blockages largely as a result of thrombus formation 
expand disposable device revenues from existing customer base 
by training additional cardiologists  surgeons and other specialists at existing customer hospitals and introducing physicians already familiar with our products to new products and applications  we intend to increase our revenue stream from sales of current and future disposable devices to existing customers 
in  we trained physicians in the general use of our equipment to address blockages in the coronary vasculature and physicians for the removal of problematic pacemaker and defibrillator leads 
there is no assurance that the physicians trained will become routine laser catheter users 
expand installed customer base 
we intend to expand our customer base by continuing to focus our sales efforts on cardiac centers that perform the majority of interventional procedures 
for the years ended december  and december   respectively  we placed and laser systems in new accounts 
at december  our total worldwide installed base was laser systems in the united states 
in early  we implemented a temporary price promotion of  on our laser systems compared with our list price of  the price promotion contributed to the increased number of laser systems placed in compared with the price promotion for laser systems officially ended on september   however  quotes that were outstanding and contained promotional pricing as of september  will be honored 
in addition to an outright sale of our laser systems  we offer several alternatives to our customers to allow the acquisition of our excimer lasers in  including evaluation  fee rental and leasing through a third party leasing organization 
technology excimer laser ablation removes plaque  thrombotic materials  or tissue by delivering relatively cool excimer laser energy to a blockage or lesion 
this laser beam breaks down the molecular bonds of plaque or tissue in a process known as photoablation  without significant thermal damage to surrounding tissue 
we believe that the ablation of the material reduces the particles to about the size of a red blood cell  which is easily absorbed into the blood stream 
this helps to avoid a potential complication known as distal embolization  which is caused by particles dislodged during an angioplasty or atheretectomy procedure that create a blockage elsewhere in the vascular system 

table of contents laser ablation involves the insertion of a laser catheter or sheath into an artery or vein through a small incision 
when the tip of the catheter or sheath has been placed at the site of the blockage or lesion  the physician activates the laser beam to ablate the plaque or tissue 
cvx excimer technology our proprietary cvx excimer laser unit is designed for use in a variety of cardiovascular applications 
when coupled with our fiber optic laser devices  the system generates and delivers nanometer wavelength ultraviolet energy pulses to a lesion to remove plaque or tissue 
on february   the food and drug administration fda approved the spectranetics cvx excimer laser unit and and millimeter diameter fiber optic catheters for the following six indications for use in the treatment of coronary artery disease saphenous vein grafts  total occlusions crossable by a guidewire  ostial lesions blockages at the beginning of arteries  lesions with moderate calcification  long lesions  and lesions where angioplasty balloon failures have occurred 
additional catheter sizes and improved models to treat the six original indications have been approved by the fda over the ensuing years 
on october   we received fda approval for the use of the spectranetics excimer laser and related catheters for an additional coronary indication for use within restenosed stents prior to brachytherapy radiation therapy 
in all of these coronary atherectomy indications  we offer an alternative or adjunct to traditional balloon angioplasty  stents and atherectomy rotational cutters and burrs devices 
unlike conventional balloons that merely compress arterial plaque against the stent or vessel wall  laser atherectomy dissolves the material  resulting in a larger diameter opening 
the cvx excimer laser unit was initially approved for lead removal procedures on december   with several additional approvals following in later years as we expanded our lead removal product line 
in november  we received iso certification from the t v product service gmbh t v in munich  germany  which allows us to market our products in the european community within compliance of the manufacturing quality regulations 
we hold ec cert g  g and g  qa cert qz with en supplement with inclusion of iso in addition the cmdcas canadian certification was recommended by t v during our last audit in january we have received ce communaute europeene mark registration for all of our current products 
the ce mark indicates that a product is certified for sale throughout the european union and that the manufacturer of the product complies with applicable safety and quality standards 
on september   in conjunction with our distributor heiwa bussan co  ltd  we received regulatory approval from the japanese ministry of health and welfare mhw to market our laser and various sizes of our extreme  vitesse e and vitesse c coronary catheters in japan 
we have submitted our application for reimbursement approval for these products in japan  which may take up to two years to obtain 
we do not expect our sales in japan to increase unless and until reimbursement approval is attained 
in addition  we are in various stages of the submission process to obtain regulatory approval in japan for some of our newer products 
since receiving fda approval in  more than  patients have been safely treated with excimer laser coronary atherectomy 
initial fda approval for use of the excimer laser for coronary applications was based on the results of the percutaneous excimer laser coronary angioplasty pelca study  which evaluated a registry of laser usage in blocked coronary arteries in  patients with a mean age of years 
clinical success ie  reduction in the size of the lesion to less than percent of the diameter of the artery 
table of contents without heart attack  death  or the need for emergency bypass surgery during hospitalization was achieved in of these patients 
of note  there was no difference in success rate or complications for long lesions  total occlusions crossable with a guidewire  saphenous vein grafts and aorto ostial lesions  suggesting that complex lesions could be safely and effectively treated with excimer laser coronary atherectomy 
we believe that the cvx system provides the following benefits reduced procedure time 
patient outcome audits  which compare excimer laser procedures to rotational atherectomy  reveal the excimer laser method shortens procedure times and reduces radiation exposure to the patient from fluoroscopic imaging used during the procedure 
ease of use 
during a laser procedure  it may be necessary to adjust laser energy output 
the cvx laser unit is computer controlled  which allows the physician to change energy levels without interrupting the treatment to remove the catheter from the patient for recalibration 
this feature also enables the physician to begin the procedure with the minimum level of energy that might be required and  if necessary  to easily adjust the energy level upward during the procedure 
dissolves underlying tissue 
the process of photoablation dissolves the tissue causing the blockage as opposed to merely compressing it against the arterial wall  as with balloon angioplasty 
we believe that the process of photoablation helps to reduce the incidence of distal embolization  whereby particles are dislodged from the lesion being treated  causing a blockage elsewhere in the vascular system 
product applications excimer laser atherectomy background 
percutaneous coronary intervention  or pci  is a minimally invasive medical procedure used to treat coronary artery disease  or atherosclerosis  and is performed by interventional cardiologists and radiologists 
we estimate there are approximately  pci procedures performed in the united states 
we estimate that approximately percent of these patients could benefit from the use of our products  particulary in complex lesions 
in these indications  we offer an alternative or adjunct to traditional balloon angioplasty or the need for coronary bypass surgery 
unlike conventional balloons that merely compress arterial plaque against the stent or vessel wall  laser atherectomy actually dissolves the material 
we focus our marketing efforts on seven approved coronary indications saphenous vein grafts  pretreatment of restenosed stents prior to brachytherapy 
total occlusions crossable by a guidewire  ostial lesions blockages at the beginning of arteries  lesions with moderate calcification  long lesions  and lesions where angioplasty balloon failures have occurred 
in europe  we focus our marketing efforts on the approved coronary indications shown above as well as laser treatment of all in stent restenoses and blockages in the arteries of the upper and lower legs 
disposable laser catheters 
we have developed a broad selection of proprietary laser devices designed to meet physician needs and multiple indications for use  including excimer laser coronary atherectomy and peripheral excimer laser atherectomy in the upper and lower leg in europe 
early laser catheters contained amounts were estimated by spectranetics based on extrapolation from available industry data 
patient population estimates are subject to inherent uncertainties 
we are unable to determine with any degree of certainty the number of procedures for any indication or the number of patients who are suitable for treatment using these procedures 

table of contents only a few large optical fibers to transmit the laser energy 
these early devices were stiff  had difficulty accessing arterial anatomy and suffered from poor ablation characteristics 
current innovative laser catheter designs contain hundreds of very small diameter  flexible glass fibers that can access more difficult to reach coronary anatomy 
the smaller fibers also produce better laser energy distribution at the tip of the catheter for more uniform ablation 
laser catheters are designed to provide several advantages over other atherectomy devices 
these catheters  which we produce in sizes ranging from to millimeters in diameter  consist of concentric or eccentric bundles of optical fibers mounted within a thin plastic tubing 
fibers are coupled to the laser using a patented intelligent connector  which requires no adjustments by the physician 
this connector provides information about the device being used to the cvx laser unit computer  which controls the calibration cycle and energy output 
the catheter s combination of trackability  flexibility and ablation characteristics enables the physician to access difficult to treat lesions 
our line of disposable catheters includes the following extreme laser catheter 
in october  the fda approved the extreme laser concentric catheter  which was our first high performance coronary laser catheter 
it is an over the wire otw catheter with good flexibility and an active ablation area covering a high percentage of the catheter tip 
other catheter features include the patented metal rim tip designed for visualization and alignment and a proprietary lubricious coating for easy access 
the extreme laser catheter is available in   and millimeter tip diameters 
spectranetics has received the ce mark of approval for use of its extreme atherectomy line of catheters in europe  and has received approval from the mhw to market the  and millimeter size extreme catheters in japan but has not yet received reimbursement approval in japan 
vitesse e laser catheter 
the vitesse e eccentric rapid exchange rx laser catheter is our first directional coronary laser catheter 
the millimeter diameter catheter was approved by the fda in july  and the millimeter catheter was approved by the fda in september spectranetics received the ce mark of approval for use of these atherectomy catheters in europe in march and mhw approval for use in japan in september  but we are still awaiting japanese reimbursement approval 
this catheter utilizes an eccentric or one sided fiber array at the tip that can be rotated by the operator to create a larger channel through the blockage 
vitesse cos catheter 
the vitesse cos concentric laser catheter  which succeeded the vitesse c catheter  was approved by the fda in january like its predecessor which received regulatory approval in the united states in october and in japan in september  with reimbursement approval in japan still pending  this is a rapid exchange rx catheter  which incorporates a monorail design that can be threaded onto and exchanged over a guidewire more conveniently than over the wire models 
it is also compatible with a wide range of guidewires 
the fibers in the vitesse cos are optimally spaced and laboratory tests have demonstrated that it produces greater debulking  or plaque removal  compared with its predecessor catheter 
the vitesse cos laser catheter is available in  and millimeter tip diameters 
in europe  we received the ce mark of approval for this laser catheter in december point tm millimeter catheter 
the point tm concentric catheter comes in both the extreme otw and vitesse rx models 
the vitesse model received ce mark and fda approvals in july and august  respectively 
the extreme model received ce mark approval in europe in august and fda approval in the united states in july the point millimeter catheters are our smallest diameter atherectomy catheters and are designed for use in vessels as small as millimeters in diameter  as well as larger vessels with total occlusions passable by a guidewire or where angioplasty balloon failures have occurred 
on june   spectranetics received fda approval to market the point x catheter  which has the ability to use higher laser parameters to penetrate lesions where balloon failures have occurred and other difficult to treat lesions crossable by a guidewire 
spectranetics support catheter tm 
in november we received clearance from the fda to market the spectranetics support catheter in the 
and 
inch models 
a larger 
inch model was 
table of contents approved by the fda in september this is a non laser based accessory product designed for use in the cardiovascular system to assist in accessing and or crossing lesions 
the primary function is to support an angioplasty guidewire 
we also received the ce mark of approval in march to market the 
and 
inch support catheter in europe  and the 
inch model received the ce mark of approval in july cardiac lead removal systems background 
over  patients worldwide are implanted with pacemakers and implantable cardioverter defibrillators  or icds  annually 
pacemakers and icds are electronic devices that regulate the heartbeat 
we believe that approximately of these patients will eventually require pacemaker or icd lead removal 
competitive methods available to remove implanted leads include open chest surgery and transvenous removal with plastic sheaths  each of which has significant drawbacks 
for example  open chest surgery is costly and traumatic to the patient 
the plastic sheath method sometimes results in damage to the cardiovascular system  thereby necessitating surgery  and may cause the lead to disassemble during the removal procedure 
spectranetics laser sheath sls tm 
we have designed a laser assisted lead removal device  the spectranetics laser sheath sls  to be used with our cvx excimer laser unit to remove implanted leads with minimal force 
the sls uses excimer laser energy focused through the tip of the sls to facilitate lead removal by removing scar tissue surrounding the lead 
in addition to resulting in less trauma and a lower complication rate  procedure time is reduced significantly 
the sls consists of optical fibers arranged in a circle between inner and outer polymer tubing 
the inner opening of the device is designed to allow a lead wire to pass through it as the device slides over the lead wire and toward the tip in the heart 
following the removal of scar tissue with the sls  the lead wire is removed from the heart with counter traction 
we have been marketing our french fr sls since december in september  we received fda market approval for our fr and fr spectranetics laser sheaths  which are designed to free larger diameter implanted pacemaker and icd leads 
on february   spectranetics received fda approval to market an improved model of its fr laser sheath 
spectranetics received the ce mark of approval for use of its first generation laser sheath devices in europe in february and july  and second generation devices received the ce mark october and october lead locking device lld tm 
in october  we received clearance from the fda to market the lld under a k application 
this product was the first spectranetics product to go through the k regulatory process  which typically takes less time than other regulatory approval processes  such as pre market approval or a pre market approval supplement 
we also received the ce mark of approval for this product in europe in march the lld product complements our current sls product line and  since it is not laser based  can also be used in connection with the mechanical removal of pacemaker or defibrillator leads 
the lld is a novel mechanical device that assists in the removal of faulty leads by providing traction to the leads  which are typically wire spirals 
the lld is inserted into the center opening ie  lumen of the lead and then a braid surrounding the lld expands to fill and grip the entire length of the lead s inner circumference  in effect converting a spiral into a solid pipe  which can more easily be extracted 
other devices on the market  which merely grip the lead at the far end  provide less stability and frequently release their grip on the lead 
in a randomized clinical trial completed in october  the sls increased the complete lead removal success rate to percent from percent with other techniques 
a more recent study completed in and published in december reported that using both the sls and lld increased the success rate to percent 
amounts were estimated by spectranetics based on extrapolation from available industry data 
patient population estimates are subject to inherent uncertainties 
we are unable to determine with any degree of certainty the number of procedures for any indication or the number of patients who are suitable for treatment using these procedures 

table of contents peripheral vascular disease therapy background 
the prevalent treatment options for total blockages in the upper leg are medical management to minimize symptoms and bypass surgery 
amputation below the knee may be required for critical limb ischemia 
we estimate that approximately  upper bypass surgeries and  amputations are performed annually in the united states as a result of peripheral vascular blockages 
in addition  we estimate that about  people in the united states are treated for leg pain through either balloon angioplasty  stent implantation  or drug therapy 
laser therapy is being evaluated as an alternative treatment to bypass surgery  amputation and conventional medical management 
our catheters for these applications are approved in europe for use in treating peripheral vascular disease 
clinical trials 
on january   spectranetics received fda approval to begin phase of the laci trial  which deals with multi vessel peripheral vascular disease in patients presenting with critical limb ischemia cli 
patients with cli have severe circulatory disease resulting in resting leg pain  non healing ulcers of the foot or lower leg  or gangrenous areas that are likely candidates for amputation rutherford categories   and 
frequently  these patients also suffer from coronary artery disease  hypertension and diabetes 
the phase trial enrolled patients at domestic and several european sites the primary endpoint of phase is limb salvage ie  freedom from major amputation for a month follow up period 
the last patient enrolled in the laci trial in april and the six month follow up phase was completed in october the data from this trial was submitted in the form of a pma supplement to the fda in january and we anticipate fda approval in late data from the trial indicated a success rate as compared with in the control group of patients treated with a variety of standard therapies  including bypass surgery  in the incidence of serious adverse events was in laci compared with in the control group 
on november   the last patient was enrolled in the pela trial  a patient randomized clinical trial  coordinated in the united states and europe  to evaluate the use of laser technology in patients with total occlusions at least centimeters in length in the upper leg 
this trial is designed to treat intermittent claudication  or leg pain while walking  which generally occurs as a result of a blockage in the superficial femoral artery in the upper leg 
the primary endpoint for the pela trial is clinical patency  which is a measurement of the degree to which the artery is open  twelve months following the procedure 
the one year follow up phase of the pela trial was completed in december and we are currently analyzing the data from the trial 
if the clinical data warrants  a submission to the fda requesting clearance to commercially market our products for the treatment of blockages in the upper leg  will be completed later this year 
on december   spectranetics received approval from the fda to begin the pela phase trial at sites 
pela phase is a registry of up to patients with total occlusions at least centimeters in length in the upper leg 
we cannot assure that the clinical trials using excimer laser catheters to unblock peripheral arteries will demonstrate our technology is safe  will result in favorable success rates or  if the trials are successful  that we will receive fda approval for these devices 
we have received ce mark of approval for our line of peripheral catheters in europe 
restenosed stents background 
stents are thin  steel  slotted tubes or coils that are implanted through a percutaneous procedure to support the walls of coronary arteries 
we estimate that approximately  stents are implanted in united states annually 
twenty to percent of stents may develop blockages due to restenosis  or tissue ingrowth  which can lead to partial or total occlusion of the arteries  and percent of them may be amounts were estimated by spectranetics based on extrapolation from available industry data 
patient population estimates are subject to inherent uncertainties 
we are unable to determine with any degree of certainty the number of procedures for any indication or the number of patients who are suitable for treatment using these procedures 

table of contents candidates for brachytherapy radiation therapy 
several clinical trials are underway and some have concluded evaluating the use of drug eluting stents  the next generation of stent technology 
these stents are coated with various types of drugs designed to inhibit restenosis 
clinical data from these trials demonstrate that restenosis rates are reduced to rates less than for certain lesions 
clinical trials 
on october   we received approval from the fda to market our coronary atherectomy products to pretreat instent restenosis prior to brachytherapy 
as a result  we concluded enrollment in our laser angioplasty in restenosed stents lars trial  which had been conducted to study the use of our laser catheters in debulking stents which have restenosed 
we no longer intend to pursue the broader instent restenosis label with or without brachytherapy in the united states 
spectranetics has received ce mark approval to allow us to market our excimer laser atherectomy catheters throughout europe for the treatment of restenosed stainless steel coronary stents  with or without brachytherapy 
sales and marketing our sales goals are to increase the use of laser catheters and other disposable devices and to increase the installed base of excimer laser systems 
we plan to introduce new physicians and institutions to the efficacy  safety  ease of use and growing indications of excimer laser technology through published studies of clinical applications 
by leveraging the success of existing product applications  we hope to promote the use of our technology in new applications 
providing customers with answers about the cost of acquisition  use of the laser and reimbursement codes is critical to the education process 
through the following marketing and distribution strategy  both in the united states and internationally  we believe that we will be positioned to capitalize not only on the core competency of excimer laser technology in coronary atherectomy  but also in lead extraction and in other new areas of development for excimer laser technology in the cardiovascular system 
domestic operations we estimate that there are about  interventional cardiac catheterization laboratories in hospitals in the united states 
our united states sales efforts focus on the major cardiac catheterization labs  including teaching institutions  which perform the majority of interventional procedures 
our united states sales and marketing team consists of marketing managers  district sales managers and clinical account managers 
we are focused on expanding our product line and developing an appropriate infrastructure to support sales growth  and have increased our sales and marketing capabilities over the last few years through the addition of personnel to our marketing and sales team 
since the use of excimer laser technology is highly specialized  we believe that our marketing managers and direct sales team must have extensive knowledge about the use of our products and the various physician groups we serve 
our marketing activities are designed to support our direct sales team and include advertising and product publicity in trade journals  newsletters  continuing education programs  and attendance at trade shows and professional association meetings 
we currently have three marketing managers who are responsible for global marketing activities for a given market segment  ie  coronary artery disease therapy  cardiac lead removal systems and peripheral vascular disease therapy 
we currently have field sales employees consisting of six district sales managers and clinical account managers 
the roles of each member of the sales team are outlined below district sales managers are responsible for the overall management of a district  including sales of lasers and disposable products 
they are directly responsible for the performance of the clinical account managers in their district 
amounts were estimated by spectranetics based on extrapolation from available industry data 
patient population estimates are subject to inherent uncertainties 
we are unable to determine with any degree of certainty the number of procedures for any indication or the number of patients who are suitable for treatment using these procedures 

table of contents clinical account managers  who have experience working in hospital catheter labs  support the district managers 
their primary function is to assist in training our customers by standing in on cases  assisting in catheter and laser parameter selection  and helping ensure proper protocol and technique is used by clinicians 
our field team also includes service engineers who are responsible for installation of each laser and participate in the training program at each site 
we provide a one year warranty on laser sales  which includes parts  service and replacement gas 
upon expiration of the warranty period  we offer service to our customers under annual service contracts or on a fee for service basis 
international operations in europe  there are approximately  balloon angioplasty procedures performed annually in approximately interventional cardiac catheterization laboratories 
in  we began marketing and selling our products in europe and surrounding areas through spectranetics international  bv  a wholly owned subsidiary  as well as through distributors 
in the fourth quarter of  we made the decision to restructure our european operations and utilize a distributor in germany  our largest european market

government regulation in the united states  all medical devices are subject to fda regulation under the medical device amendments of the federal food  drug and cosmetics act  or ffdca  and are classified into one of three categories class i  class ii  and class iii 
products in class i are the least invasive and pose the least amount of risk  while products in class ii pose more potential risk to patients  and class iii products provide the most potential risk 
the fda approval process becomes more rigorous for products classified as higher potential risk 
section k devices section k of the ffdca is available in certain instances for class i and class ii products 
it requires that before introducing most class ii and some class i devices into interstate commerce  the company introducing the product must first submit information to the fda demonstrating that the device is substantially equivalent in terms of safety and effectiveness to a device legally marketed prior to march when the fda determines that the device is substantially equivalent  the agency issues a clearance letter that authorizes marketing of the product 
the support catheter and the lld have been precleared by the fda under the k process 
amounts were estimated by spectranetics based on extrapolation from available industry data 
patient population estimates are subject to inherent uncertainties 
we are unable to determine with any degree of certainty the number of procedures for any indication or the number of patients who are suitable for treatment using these procedures 

table of contents subsequent to its initial introduction  a manufacturer may make changes to its previously cleared products 
under certain circumstances  a new k is required when a manufacturer makes a change that could significantly affect the device s safety or effectiveness or the manufacturer makes a major change to the device s intended use 
before implementing the change  the manufacturer is responsible for evaluating each change to determine whether to file a new k 
there is a risk that the fda will not agree with the manufacturer s decision and will require the filing of a new k 
pma devices the cvx laser unit and related devices are designated as class iii devices 
class iii devices are devices that are represented to be life sustaining or life supporting  or that present potential serious risk of illness or injury 
class iii devices are subject to the most rigorous fda approval process  the pre market approval  or pma  process 
pre market approval of a class iii device generally requires the completion of three major steps 
the first step involves the granting of an investigational device exemption  or ide  by the fda  which permits the proposed product to be used in controlled human clinical trials 
upon completion of a sufficient number of clinical cases to determine the safety and effectiveness of the proposed product for specific indications  a pre market approval application is then prepared and submitted to the fda for review 
the pre market approval application must contain the results of the clinical trials  the results of all relevant bench tests  laboratory and animal studies  a complete description of the device and its components  and a detailed description of the methods  facilities  and controls used to manufacture the device 
in addition  the submission must include the proposed labeling and promotional literature 
if the fda determines that the pre market approval application is sufficiently complete to permit a substantive review  the fda will accept the application for filing 
once the submission is accepted for filing  the fda begins an in depth review of the pre market approval application  which represents the second major step in pre market approval of a class iii device 
an fda review of a pre market approval application generally takes one to two years from the date the pre market approval application is accepted for filing  but may take significantly longer 
the review time is often significantly extended by the fda asking for more information or clarification of information already provided in the submission 
during the review period  an advisory committee  typically a panel of clinicians  will likely be convened to review and evaluate the application and provide recommendations to the fda at a public panel meeting as to whether the device should be approved 
companies are typically requested to make a presentation at the public panel meeting 
the fda is not bound by the recommendations of the advisory panel 
toward the end of the pre market approval review process  the fda will generally conduct an inspection of the manufacturer s facilities to ensure that the facilities are in compliance with applicable good manufacturing practice requirements  which are outlined under fda s quality system regulation 
if the fda s evaluations of both the pre market approval application and the manufacturing facilities are favorable  the fda will either issue an approval letter or an approvable letter  which usually contains a number of conditions that must be met in order to secure final approval of the pre market approval application 
when and if those conditions have been fulfilled to the satisfaction of the fda  the agency will complete the third major step by issuing a pre market approval letter  authorizing commercial marketing of the device for certain indications 
if the fda s evaluations of the pre market approval application or manufacturing facilities are not favorable  the fda will deny approval of the pre market approval application or issue a not approvable letter 
the fda may also determine that additional clinical trials are necessary  in which case pre market approval may be delayed for several years while additional clinical trials are conducted and submitted in an amendment to the pre market approval application 
the pre market approval process can be expensive  uncertain and lengthy and a number of devices for which fda approval has been sought by other companies have never been approved for marketing 
modifications to a device that is the subject of a pre market approval  its labeling  or manufacturing process may require approval by the fda of pre market approval supplements or new pre market approval applications 
supplements to a pre market approval application often require the submission of the same type 
table of contents of information required for an initial pre market approval application  except that the supplement is generally limited to that information needed to support the proposed change from the product covered in the original pre market approval application 
the chart below summarizes the month and year we obtained approval from the united states and major world market regulatory approval status of each of our products and procedures for their particular indications

the absence of such approvals could have a material adverse impact on our ability to generate future revenues 
for more information  see risk factors failures in clinical trials may hurt our business set forth in item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations filed herewith 
any products we manufacture or distribute pursuant to fda approvals are subject to pervasive and continuing regulation by the fda 
device manufacturers are required to register their establishments and list 
table of contents their devices with the fda  and are subject to periodic inspections by the fda and certain state agencies 
the ffdca requires devices to be manufactured in accordance with quality system regulation requirements  which impose certain process  procedure and documentation requirements upon us with respect to product development  manufacturing and quality assurance activities 
we have developed systems and controls that we believe will enable us to comply with quality system regulation requirements  however  we cannot assure that we will be able to maintain compliance with these requirements 
in addition  the medical device reporting  or mdr  regulation obligates us to inform the fda whenever there is reasonable evidence to suggest that one of our devices may have caused or contributed to death or serious injury  or when one of our devices malfunctions and  if the malfunction were to recur  the device would be likely to cause or contribute to death or serious injury 
there can be no assurance that the fda will agree with our determinations as to whether particular incidents meet the threshold for mdr reporting 
labeling and promotional activities are also subject to scrutiny by the fda and  in certain instances  by the federal trade commission 
the fda actively enforces regulations prohibiting marketing of products for unapproved uses 
noncompliance with requirements under the ffdca or accompanying regulations can result in  among other things  fines  injunctions  civil penalties  recall or seizure of products  total or partial suspension of production  failure of the government to grant pre market approval  withdrawal of marketing approvals  and criminal prosecution 
the fda also has authority to request repair  replacement or refund of the cost of any device manufactured or distributed by us 
international sales of our products are subject to foreign regulations  including health and medical safety regulations 
the regulatory review process varies from country to country 
many countries also impose product standards  packaging and labeling requirements  and import restrictions on devices 
exports of products that have been approved by the fda do not require fda authorization for export 
however  foreign countries often require a fda certificate to foreign government verifying that the product complies with ffdca requirements 
to obtain a certificate to foreign government  the device manufacturer must certify to the fda that the product has been granted approval in the united states and that the manufacturer and the exported products are in substantial compliance with the ffdca and all applicable or pertinent regulations 
the fda may refuse to issue a certificate to foreign government if significant outstanding quality system regulation violations exist 
we are subject to certain federal  state and local regulations regarding environmental protection and hazardous substance controls  among others 
to date  compliance with such environmental regulations has not had a material effect on our capital expenditures or competitive position 
see risk factors regulatory compliance is very expensive and can often be denied or significantly delayed set forth in item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations filed herewith 
competition methods for the treatment of cardiovascular disease are numerous and we expect them to increase in number 
almost all of our competitors have substantially greater financial  manufacturing  marketing and technical resources than we do 
consequently  we expect intense competition to continue in the marketplace 
although our excimer laser technology competes against stents and balloon angioplasty catheters  direct competition comes from manufacturers of atherectomy and thrombectomy devices 
in the lead removal market  we compete worldwide with lead removal devices manufactured by cook vascular inc and we compete in europe with devices manufactured by vascomed 
we estimate that approximately of coronary interventions involve the placement of a stent 
the leading stent providers in the united states are scimed life systems  inc a subsidiary of boston scientific corporation  cordis corporation a subsidiary of johnson johnson interventional systems  guidant corporation  medtronic  inc and jomed nv the leading balloon angioplasty manufacturers are scimed  cordis  guidant and medtronic 
manufacturers of atherectomy or thrombectomy devices include scimed  guidant and possis medical  inc 
table of contents we believe that the primary competitive factors in the interventional cardiovascular market are the ability to treat a variety of lesions safely and effectively  the impact of managed care practices and procedure costs  ease of use  size and effectiveness of sales forces  and research and development capabilities 
for more information  see risk factors we may be unable to compete successfully in our highly competitive industry in which many other competitors are bigger companies set forth in item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations filed herewith 
patents and proprietary rights we hold issued united states patents  four issued patents in each of france  germany  italy and the netherlands and one issued patent in japan 
also  we have three united states patent applications pending and foreign patent applications pending 
any patents for which we have applied may not be granted 
furthermore  our patents may not be sufficiently broad to protect our technology or to provide us with any competitive advantage 
our patents could be challenged as invalid or circumvented by competitors 
in addition  the laws of certain foreign countries do not protect our intellectual property rights to the same extent as do the laws of the united states 
we could be adversely affected if any of our licensors terminates our licenses to use patented technology 
we do not have patents in any foreign countries other than those listed above 
it is our policy to require our employees and consultants to execute confidentiality agreements upon the commencement of an employment or consulting relationship with us 
each agreement provides that all confidential information developed or made known to the individual during the course of the relationship will be kept confidential and not disclosed to third parties except in specified circumstances 
in the case of employees  the agreements provide that all inventions developed by the individual shall be our exclusive property  other than inventions unrelated to our business and developed entirely on the employee s own time 
there can be no assurance that these agreements will provide meaningful protection for our trade secrets in the event of unauthorized use or disclosure of such information 
we also rely on trade secrets and unpatented know how to protect our proprietary technology and may be vulnerable to competitors who attempt to copy our products or gain access to our trade secrets and know how 
litigation concerning patents and proprietary rights is time consuming  expensive  unpredictable and could divert the efforts of our management 
an adverse ruling could subject us to significant liability  require us to seek licenses and restrict our ability to manufacture and sell our products 
we hold several non exclusive  royalty bearing license agreements for patents covering basic areas of laser technology 
in addition  we acquired an exclusive  royalty bearing license for a proprietary catheter coating 
additional licenses held by us include an exclusive license to patents covering laser assisted lead removal and an exclusive license relating to certain aspects of excimer laser technology in our products 
research and development from inception through  our primary emphasis in research and development was on the cvx laser unit 
since  our research and development efforts have focused on refinement of the cvx laser unit and laser device technology 
we are also exploring additional applications for the cvx laser unit and are developing advanced laser devices designed to facilitate greater use in existing applications 
our team of research scientists  engineers and technicians performs substantially all of our research and development activities 
our research and development expense  which also includes clinical studies and regulatory costs  totaled  in   in  and  in 
table of contents manufacturing we assemble and test substantially all of our product line and have vertically integrated a number of processes in an effort to provide increased quality and reliability of the components used in the production process 
many of the processes are proprietary and were developed by us 
we believe that our level of manufacturing integration allows us to control costs  quality and process advancements  to accelerate new product development cycle time and to provide greater design flexibility 
raw materials  components and subassemblies used in our products are purchased from outside suppliers and are generally readily available from multiple sources 
our manufacturing facilities are subject to periodic inspections by regulatory authorities  including quality system regulations compliance inspections by the fda and t v  which is the european governing body equivalent to the fda 
we have undergone eight inspections by the fda for quality system regulations compliance since  and the t v has conducted an inspection each year since each inspection resulted in a limited number of noted observations  to which we believe we have provided adequate responses 
we purchase certain components of our cvx laser unit from several sole source suppliers 
we do not have guaranteed commitments from these suppliers  as we order products through purchase orders placed with these suppliers from time to time 
while we believe we could obtain replacement components from alternative suppliers  we may be unable to do so 
in addition  we may encounter difficulties in scaling up production of laser units and disposable devices and hiring and training additional qualified manufacturing personnel 
any of these difficulties could lead to quarterly fluctuations in operating results and adversely affect us 
third party reimbursement our cvx laser unit and related fiber optic laser devices are generally purchased by hospitals  which then bill various third party payers for the health care services provided to their patients 
these payers include medicare  medicaid and private insurance payers 
most public and private insurance payers base their payment systems upon the medicare program 
the medicare program reimburses hospitals based on predetermined amounts per diagnosis code for inpatient hospital services those lasting hours or more and predetermined amounts per procedure performed for outpatient hospital services those lasting less than hours  and it reimburses physicians based on a fee schedule per procedure performed 
at present  many of our customers using the cvx for laser atherectomy are obtaining reimbursement for inpatient hospital services under the same code as for balloon angioplasty  or for balloon angioplasty with stent 
lead removal procedures using the sls are reimbursed using the same inpatient hospital codes for non laser lead removal or lead removal and replacement 
hospital outpatient codes and physician services codes differentiate atherectomy procedures from pci procedures utilizing only balloons or only balloons and stents 
reimbursement amounts are generally adequate to cover the cost of laser ablation procedures 
procedure costs and payment rates vary depending on the complexity of the procedure  various patient factors and geographical location 
while we believe that a laser atherectomy procedure offers a less costly alternative for the treatment of certain types of heart disease  we cannot assure that the procedure will be viewed as cost effective under changing reimbursement guidelines or other health care payment systems 
for more information  see risk factors failure of third parties to reimburse medical providers for our products may reduce our sales set forth in item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations filed herewith 
product liability and insurance our business entails the risk of product liability claims 
we maintain product liability insurance in the amount of  per occurrence with an annual aggregate maximum of  we cannot assure  
table of contents however  that product liability claims will not exceed such insurance coverage limits or that such insurance coverage limits will continue to be available on acceptable terms  or at all 
see risk factors potential product liability claims and insufficient insurance coverage may hurt our business and stock price set forth in item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations filed herewith 
employees as of february   we had employees  including nine in research and development and clinical affairs  in manufacturing and quality assurance  in marketing  sales and administration in the united states and eight in marketing  sales and administration in europe 
none of our employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements 
we believe that the success of our business will depend  in part  on our ability to attract and retain qualified personnel 
we believe that our relationship with our employees is good 
item properties we lease a total of approximately  square feet in three buildings in colorado springs  colorado 
these facilities contain approximately  square feet of manufacturing space and approximately  square feet devoted to marketing  research and administrative activities 
the leases for two of these facilities expire december  and june  the lease for the third facility expires december   but we have the option to renew it for an additional year 
spectranetics international bv leases  square feet in leusden  the netherlands 
the facility houses our operations for the marketing and distribution of products in europe  and the lease expires june  we believe these facilities are adequate to meet our requirements for the foreseeable future 
item legal proceedings we are involved in a dispute over royalties payable to one of our licensors  interlase lp  which has been in receivership since september under the supervision of a state court in virginia 
in addition  because the general partner of interlase  lucre investments  ltd  filed a voluntary chapter petition on behalf of interlase in  there is also a pending bankruptcy proceeding in the united states bankruptcy court in the eastern district of virginia 
in october  the licensor completed an audit of our records relating to the license agreement and is claiming past royalties due of approximately million related to lead removal products as well as certain service revenue 
they are also claiming forward royalties on these items for periods subsequent to october in connection with this dispute the licensor has threatened patent litigation  but no lawsuit has been filed to date 
we disagree with the licensor s assertion that additional royalties are due and have filed a complaint in the united states district court in denver  colorado seeking a declaratory judgment that spectranetics and the products at issue do not infringe patents that are subjects of the agreement  and spectranetics does not owe any additional sums as contended by the licensor under the terms of the agreement and the licensor does not have the right to terminate the agreement as a result of its improper claims 
no ruling has been made on the filed complaint 
in march  interlase filed a complaint in the united states district court for the eastern district of virginia claiming spectranetics is in breach of a patent license agreement entered into in and is infringing on the patents that are the subject of the license agreement 
in the complaint  interlase claims an amount in controversy in excess of million  exclusive of interest and costs  in addition to certain other forms of relief  such as treble damages  a declaratory judgment and injunctive relief  all relating to royalties allegedly owed to or due interlase in the future associated with certain lead removal products and certain services the company provides to its customers 
we intend to vigorously defend our position on this matter 
the company is involved in legal proceedings in the normal course of business and does not expect them to have a material adverse effect on our business

corporate overview we develop  manufacture  market and distribute single use medical devices used in minimally invasive surgical procedures within the cardiovascular system in conjunction with our proprietary excimer laser system 
excimer laser technology delivers comparatively cool ultraviolet light in short  controlled energy pulses to ablate or remove tissue 
our excimer laser system includes the cvx laser unit and various fiber optic delivery devices  including disposable catheters and sheaths 
our excimer laser system is the only excimer laser system approved in the united states and europe for use in multiple  minimally invasive cardiovascular applications 
our excimer laser system is used in complex atherectomy procedures to open clogged or 
table of contents obstructed arteries in the coronary vascular system 
it is also used to remove lead wires from patients with implanted pacemakers or cardioverter defibrillators  which are electronic devices that regulate the heartbeat 
in addition to our core business described above  we also manufacture and distribute certain products as an original equipment manufacturer for other medical device companies 
revenue from this business represents less than of consolidated revenue and gross margin and has historically been in the range of  to  per year 
revenue within this business is derived primarily from one customer and we have been notified by this customer that it is in the process of moving the business to another supplier 
as a result  we do not expect revenue in future quarters from this customer 
our business strategy is to increase utilization of our fda approved products  expand our installed base of laser systems  and develop additional applications for our excimer laser system 
in  the fda approved for commercialization our cvx laser system and the first generation of our fiber optic coronary atherectomy catheters 
several improvements and additions to our coronary angioplasty product line have been made since and have been approved for commercialization by the fda 
in  we secured fda approval to use our excimer laser system for removal of pacemaker and defibrillator leads  and we secured fda approval in to market our product for use in restenosed clogged stents thin steel mesh tubes used to support the walls of coronary arteries as a pretreatment prior to brachytherapy radiation therapy 
in  we completed two clinical trials evaluating the use of our excimer laser system to treat blocked arteries in the upper pela and lower leg laci 
we submitted the clinical data from the laci trial to the fda in january and anticipate an fda approval in late  however  there are no assurances that an fda approval will be received 
we are currently evaluating the clinical data from the pela trial and  if the clinical data warrants  anticipate submitting the clinical data to the fda during the year ended december   was the second full year of profitability  excluding the impact of the costs associated with the proxy contest and settlement obligations 
net loss was  or per diluted share during the year ended december  compared with net income of  or per diluted share in excluding the impact of the proxy contest and settlement obligations  income was  for the year ended december  our financial guidance for is for revenue growth in the range of two percent to five percent compared with  which would yield net income in the range of  to  this financial guidance does not assume any revenue associated with a potential approval to market our products for the treatment of critical limb ischemia  since approval of this new indication is not expected until late however  this guidance does reflect key investments  such as costs to prepare for market launch of our products to treat critical limb ischemia 
geographical results of operations overview revenue in thousands united states europe total net income loss from continuing operations in thousands united states europe total 
table of contents year ended december   compared with year ended december  revenue in was  up  or one percent  from the increase is due to a percent increase in equipment revenue and a two percent increase in service revenue 
disposable catheter revenue in was consistent with levels 
equipment revenue increased percent primarily as a result of increased laser sales resulting from a  special price promotion  which ended september  for the year ended december   we placed sold from inventory  rented or provided for evaluation excimer laser systems compared with in  bringing our total installed base of laser systems to in the united states 
we sold either an outright sale from inventory or a sale conversion from evaluation or rental programs laser systems during as compared with laser systems sold in note that laser units sold as a result of a sales conversion from an evaluation or rental program are not counted as a placement that increases the installed base since they were counted originally when the unit was placed as an evaluation or rental unit 
disposable products revenue  which primarily consists of single use catheter products  was essentially unchanged from a three percent increase in revenue from lead removal devices was offset by a three percent decline in coronary atherectomy catheters 
the decline in coronary atherectomy catheters reflects large orders during the first nine months of from several accounts 
we have not observed decreased catheter utilization in these accounts and expect them to re order as inventory levels are reduced 
service revenue increased two percent in  due to the larger installed base of the company s excimer laser systems 
gross margin decreased to percent in  from percent in this decrease was due to a shift in product mix to a higher proportion of excimer laser systems  which generate lower margins than disposable products and service revenue  especially during the  special price promotion 
operating expenses  excluding proxy contest charges and settlement obligations of  were  compared with  in selling  general and administrative expenses increased percent to  from  in  due to the following selling expenses increased approximately  primarily as a result of the following four additional field sales employees were hired in as compared with  which resulted in increased costs of approximately  approximately  was spent in to prepare for the launch of our products to treat critical limb ischemia 
these costs include the hiring of a dedicated product manager  consulting costs to explore medicare medicaid reimbursement issues  and creative concepts related to the development of marketing materials 
no costs of this nature were incurred in approximately  of physician training costs due to a higher number of physicians trained compared with last year for use of our technology in coronary atherectomy and lead removal procedures 
general and administrative expenses decreased approximately  in as compared with last year as a result of the following approximately  related to reduced personnel costs associated with the termination of the company s president and chief executive officer  chief financial officer  and vice president  corporate relations during the second quarter of approximately  associated with reduced legal expenses due to the settlement of litigation with cook vascular  inc in no litigation costs of this nature were incurred during research  development and other technology expense includes research and development  clinical studies  regulatory  and royalties expenses 
this category of expenses declined  or eight percent  in to  the overall decrease is primarily due to a decrease in clinical studies as a result of reduced 
table of contents costs associated with the lars trial  which was substantially completed in the fourth quarter of these costs were partially offset by increased costs associated with the clinical trials to treat peripheral leg arteries which were both completed in late proxy contest charges and settlement obligations totaled  during further discussion of these costs is contained in footnote to our financial statements 
interest income decreased percent to  due primarily to lower yields on our investment securities  which consist primarily of us government and agency obligations with original maturities of less than two years 
interest expense of  compares with  in and relates primarily to the discount calculated on the settlement obligation for patent infringement litigation concluded in the final payment on this settlement obligation was made in november net loss was  in  or per diluted share  compared with net income of  or per diluted share  in excluding proxy contest charges and settlement obligations  income would have been  or per diluted share 
year ended december   compared with year ended december  revenue in was  up  or three percent  from the increase is due to an eight percent increase in equipment revenue  a two percent increase in disposable products revenue and a seven percent increase in service revenue 
equipment revenue increased eight percent due to increased rental revenue under the company s evergreen rental program 
revenue from laser units sold in was approximately the same as for the year ended december   we placed sold  rented or provided for evaluation excimer laser systems compared with in the decrease in laser placements is primarily a result of fewer placements under our laser evaluation program  which does not generate up front equipment revenue 
at december   the installed base included excimer laser systems in the united states  compared with at december  in the united states 
the increase in disposable products revenue  which primarily consists of single use catheter products  is comprised of a three percent increase in lead removal devices and a significant increase in peripheral atherectomy catheters from a small base  partially offset by a two percent decline in coronary atherectomy catheters 
service revenue increased seven percent in  as the larger installed base of the company s excimer laser systems in the united states offset the impact of utilizing distributors to perform service in europe in gross margin increased to percent in  from percent in this improvement was a combination of higher average selling prices on lasers and disposable products sales  combined with increased manufacturing efficiencies 
operating expenses declined percent in to  compared with  in in  net litigation settlement costs of  and reorganization costs of  were recognized 
excluding those costs  operating expenses declined percent in for the reasons discussed below 
for the year ended december   we consolidated several operating expense line items 
selling  general and administrative includes marketing and sales and general and administrative expenses 
research  development and other technology includes research and development  clinical studies  regulatory expenses and royalties 
for the year ended december   we reclassified regulatory expenses as part of research and development costs  in prior years  regulatory expenses had been included in general and administrative expense 
all prior years have been reclassified to conform to the current presentation 
selling  general and administrative expenses of  were down percent from  in  due to a percent decline in marketing and sales expense and a seven percent decline in general and administrative expense 
the restructuring of our european operation  which eliminated our direct sales force 
table of contents in germany and switched to a distributor based sales model  accounted for more than half of the decline in marketing and sales expense 
the remainder was due to widespread expense reductions within the us sales and marketing organization  including lower travel and entertainment expenses  and decreased expenditures for conventions and advertising 
general and administrative expenses were down due to a variety of cost reductions  the most significant of which was reduced legal expenses 
research  development and other technology expense includes research and development  clinical studies  regulatory  and royalties expenses 
this category of expenses declined  or seven percent  in to  the overall decrease is primarily due to a percent reduction in research and development expenses  primarily attributable to the cancellation of a research contract with an outside entity 
clinical studies and regulatory expenses were consistent with prior year levels 
royalties expense increased three percent from the prior year amount  primarily due to additional royalties related to the litigation settlement in october interest income decreased percent to  due primarily to lower yields on our investment securities  which consist primarily of us government and agency obligations with original maturities of less than two years 
interest expense of  increased percent from the prior year due to the interest related to installments on past royalties in connection with the litigation settlement entered into during the year ended december  net income was  in  compared with a loss of  in in  the company recognized a  litigation settlement expense   of reorganization costs  and  of tax expense related to the sale of a discontinued operation 
excluding these costs  our net loss was  in the improvement in net income  excluding these costs  of  was primarily due to  of operating expense reductions combined with slightly higher revenue  which was primarily a result of increased selling prices for lasers and disposable products  and improved manufacturing efficiencies 
income taxes at december   we had net operating loss carryforwards for us federal income tax purposes of approximately million  which are available to offset future federal taxable income  if any  and expire at varying dates from through the annual use of the net operating loss carryforwards is limited under section of the internal revenue code of an alternative minimum tax credit carryforward of  is available to offset future tax liabilities and has no expiration date 
the company also has tax loss carryforwards in the netherlands  which have no expiration date  of approximately million euros million us dollars available to offset future taxable income  if any 
we also had research and experimentation tax credit carryforwards for federal income tax purposes at december   of approximately million  which are available to reduce future federal income taxes  if any  and expire at varying dates through the annual use of portions of the research and experimentation credit carryforwards is also limited under section of the internal revenue code of liquidity and capital resources as of december   we had cash  cash equivalents and investment securities of  down  from  at december  for the year ended december   cash used by operating activities totaled  which was primarily a result of a reduction in accounts payable and accrued liabilities of  and a  increase in equipment held for rental or loan 
these uses of cash were partially offset by cash earnings net income plus depreciation and amortization of  a  reduction of accounts receivable resulting from focused working capital management and a  increase in deferred revenue 
the reduction in accounts payable and accrued liabilities related primarily to the final installment on past royalties agreed upon as part of the litigation settlement in for the year ended december   cash provided by investing activities was  the increased cash provided by investing activities is primarily due to fluctuations in our investment portfolio mix between 
table of contents cash  cash equivalents and investment securities 
this was partially offset by capital expenditures during the year ended december   of  compared with  during the same period last year 
we do not expect our capital requirements to change significantly in compared with levels 
net cash provided by financing activities was  during the year ended december  financing activities consist primarily of proceeds from sale of common stock to employees  either through the exercise of stock options or the employee stock purchase plan  partially offset by principal payments on long term debt and capital lease obligations 
at december   total debt  including capital lease obligations  was  in october  we funded an escrow account in connection with a dispute from one of our licensors 
the licensor claims that additional royalties totaling million are due relating to lead removal products and other service based revenue 
the licensor threatened to seek an injunction to prohibit us from selling lead removal devices 
we believe all royalties due under the license agreement have been paid and  in response to the licensor s threats  we set aside in an escrow account the disputed amount of million  which has been reclassified to restricted cash until the dispute is resolved 
we have filed a complaint in colorado against the licensor 
to date  no legal action has been taken by the licensor 
at december  and  we had placed a number of systems on rental or loan programs 
a total of  and  was recorded as equipment held for rental or loan at december  and  respectively  and is being depreciated over three to five years 
in  we used two placement programs in addition to the sale of laser systems evergreen rental program this rental program was introduced in july rental revenue under this program varies on a sliding scale depending on the customer s catheter purchases each month 
rental revenue is invoiced on a monthly basis and revenue is recognized upon invoicing 
the laser unit is transferred to the equipment held for rental or loan account upon shipment  and depreciation expense is recorded within cost of sales based upon a three to five year expected life of the unit 
evaluation programs we loan a laser system to an institution for use over a short period of time  usually three to six months 
the loan of the equipment is to create awareness of our products and their capabilities  and no revenue is earned or recognized in connection with the placement of a loaned laser although sales of disposable products result from the laser placement 
the laser unit is transferred to the equipment held for rental or loan account upon shipment  and depreciation expense is recorded within selling  general and administrative expense based upon a three to five year expected life of the unit 
as of december   laser units were in place under the evaluation program 
at the beginning of  we ran a price promotion in which we offered lasers for sale at  compared with a list price of  the  price promotion ended september   however  we will continue to honor special pricing for quotes that were outstanding as of september  as of december   laser units were in place under the evergreen program 
we believe our liquidity and capitalization as of december  are sufficient to meet our operating and capital requirements at least through december  conversion to the euro for the year ended december  spectranetics international  bv  used the euro as its functional currency 
the euro was adopted as its functional currency on january  the conversion to the euro did not have a material effect on our consolidated financial results of operations 
critical accounting policies our consolidated financial statements are affected by the accounting policies used and the estimates and assumptions made by management during their preparation 

table of contents below is a discussion of our critical accounting policies and their impact on the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
use of estimates 
on an ongoing basis  management evaluates its estimates and judgments  including those relating to product returns  bad debts  inventories  income taxes  warranty obligations  royalty obligations  reorganization costs  contingencies  and litigation 
we base our estimates and judgments on historical experience and on various other factors we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
these judgments and estimates form the basis for the carrying values of certain assets and liabilities that are not objectively available from other sources 
carrying values of these assets and liabilities may differ under different assumptions or conditions 
revenue recognition 
revenue from the sale of our products is recognized when products are shipped and title transfers to the customer 
revenue from product maintenance contracts is deferred and recognized ratably over the contract period 
revenue from the rental of our excimer laser systems is recognized on a monthly basis based on a calculated rental fee 
for evergreen rental units  the calculated rental fee depends on the monthly catheter purchases of each customer 
allowance for sales returns 
we estimate product sales returns based on historical experience 
the provision for sales returns is recorded as a reduction of revenue based on our estimates 
actual sales returns may vary depending on customer inventory levels  new product introductions and other factors 
although we believe our estimates are reasonable based on facts in existence today  these facts are subject to change 
warranty liability 
we generally provide a one year warranty on the sale of our excimer laser 
we record warranty expense for the one year warranty period as cost of revenue at the time of sale 
warranty expense is an estimate based on historical experience related to warranty repairs 
as warranty costs are incurred  they are charged against the warranty liability 
royalty liability 
we license certain patents from various licensors pursuant to license agreements 
royalty expense is calculated pursuant to the terms of the license agreements and is included in research  development and other technology in the accompanying financial statements 
we have established liabilities for royalty payment obligations based on these calculations  which involve management estimates that require judgment 
although we believe the estimates to be reasonable based on facts in existence today  the estimates are subject to change based on changes in the underlying facts and assumptions used to develop these estimates 
stock based compensation 
we account for our stock based compensation plans for employees in accordance with the provisions of accounting principles board opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees apb  and related interpretations 
as such  compensation expense is recorded on the date of grant only if the current market price of the underlying stock exceeds the market price 
no compensation cost has been recognized for original stock option grants to employees in the accompanying financial statements as all options granted had an exercise price equal to or above the market value of the underlying common stock on the date of grant 
under statement of financial accounting standard no 
 accounting for stock based compensation sfas no 
 entities are permitted to recognize as expense the fair value of all stock based awards on the date of grant over the vesting period 
alternatively  sfas no 
also allows entities to continue to apply the provisions of apb and provide pro forma earnings loss and pro forma earnings loss per share disclosures for employee stock option grants as if the fair value based method defined in sfas no 
had been applied 
the company has elected to continue to apply the provisions of apb and provide the pro forma disclosures required by sfas no 
we account for nonemployee stock based awards in accordance with sfas no 
and related interpretations 
we calculate compensation expense for the disclosures required by sfas no 
through the use of the black scholes option pricing model  which incorporates assumptions as to volatility and expected option terms  among others 
should these underlying assumptions change  the calculated compensation expense 
table of contents could be materially different 
compensation expense as calculated under a fair value based model has historically been material to our financial statements 
for the years ended december   and  compensation expense related to stock option grants to employees totaled   and  respectively  which have been included in pro form disclosures  but not included in determining net income 
as such  our statement of operations would be adversely affected should new accounting pronouncements be adopted that require the recording of compensation expense within our statement of operations 
restricted cash 
during  we established an escrow account in connection with a dispute over royalty obligations owed to one of our licensors 
we believe we have paid all royalties due under the license agreement 
the funds may be disbursed from the escrow account upon the earlier of the resolution of the dispute or two years 
the funds in the escrow account totaling  have been recorded as restricted cash on our balance sheet at december  income taxes 
we account for income taxes pursuant to statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for income taxes  which requires the use of the asset and liability method of accounting for deferred income taxes 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases 
a valuation allowance is required to the extent it is more likely than not that a deferred tax asset will not be realized 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in operations in the period that includes the enactment date 
as of december   we have a net deferred tax asset of  we have established a valuation allowance equal to the deferred tax asset due to the uncertainty of realization because of our history of operating losses 
should we demonstrate consistent and continued profitability  the valuation allowance will be evaluated and a deferred tax asset may be recorded within our financial statements 
new accounting pronouncements in june  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for exit or disposal activities 
sfas no 
addresses financial accounting and reporting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities and nullifies eitf issue no 
 liability recognition for certain employee termination benefits and other costs to exit an activity including certain costs incurred in a restructuring 
sfas no 
requires that a liability for a cost associated with an exit or disposal activity be recognized when the liability is incurred instead of the date of an entity s commitment to an exit plan 
this statement also establishes that fair value is the objective for initial measurement of the liability 
severance pay under statement no 
 in many cases  would be recognized over time rather than upfront for employees who render future services beyond a minimum retention period 
the minimum retention period would be based on the legal notification period  or if there is no such requirement  days 
the provisions of sfas no 
are effective for the company for disposal activities initiated after december  management does not believe adoption of this statement will have a material impact on the company s financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure an amendment of fasb statement no 
sfas no 
amends fasb no 
 accounting for stock based compensation to provide alternative methods of transition for a voluntary change to the fair value based method of accounting for stock based employee compensation 
in addition  sfas no 
amends the disclosure requirements of statement to require prominent disclosures in both annual and interim financial statements about the method of accounting for stock based employee compensation and the effect of the method used on reported results 
the provisions of sfas no 
are effective for the company in fiscal and in fiscal for certain disclosures 
management does not believe the adoption of this statement will have a material impact on the company s financial position  results of operations or cash flows as the company does not currently plan to change to the fair value based method of accounting for stock based employee compensation 

table of contents risk factors we have a history of losses and may not be able to maintain profitability 
we incurred net losses from operations since our inception in june until the second quarter of  and we incurred net losses in the first and second quarters of at december   we had accumulated million in net losses since inception 
we expect that our research  development and clinical trial activities and regulatory approvals  together with future selling  general and administrative activities and the costs associated with launching our products for additional indications will result in significant expenses for the foreseeable future 
no assurance can be given that we will be able to achieve and maintain profitability in the future 
our small sales and marketing team may be unable to compete with our larger competitors or to reach all potential customers 
many of our competitors have larger sales and marketing operations than we do 
this allows those competitors to spend more time with potential customers and to focus on a larger number of potential customers  which gives them a significant advantage over our team in making sales 
our products may not achieve market acceptance 
excimer laser technology competes with more established therapies for restoring circulation to clogged or obstructed arteries such as balloon angioplasty and stent implantation 
market acceptance of the excimer laser system depends on our ability to provide adequate clinical and economic data that shows the clinical efficacy and cost effectiveness of  and patient benefits from  excimer laser atherectomy and lead removal 
we may be unable to compete successfully with bigger companies in our highly competitive industry 
our primary competitors are manufacturers of products used in competing therapies  such as balloon angioplasty  which uses a balloon to push obstructions out of the way  stent implantation  open chest bypass surgery  and atherectomy and thrombectomy  using mechanical methods to remove arterial blockages 
we also compete with companies marketing lead extraction devices or removal methods  such as mechanical sheaths 
in the lead removal market  we compete worldwide with lead removal devices manufactured by cook vascular inc and we compete in europe with devices manufactured by vascomed 
almost all of our competitors have substantially greater financial  manufacturing  marketing and technical resources than we do 
larger competitors have a broader product line  which enables them to offer customers bundled purchase contracts and quantity discounts 
we expect competition to intensify 
we believe that the primary competitive factors in the interventional cardiovascular market are the ability to treat a variety of lesions safely and effectively  the impact of managed care practices  related reimbursement to the health care provider  and procedure costs  ease of use  size and effectiveness of sales forces  and research and development capabilities 
we estimate that approximately percent of coronary interventions involve the placement of a stent 
the leading stent providers in the united states are scimed life systems  inc a subsidiary of boston scientific corporation  cordis corporation a subsidiary of johnson johnson interventional systems  guidant corporation  medtronic  inc  and jomed nv the leading balloon angioplasty manufacturers are scimed  cordis  guidant and medtronic 
manufacturers of atherectomy or thrombectomy devices include scimed  guidant and possis medical  inc 
table of contents laser placement is a barrier to accessing patient cases for which our disposable products may be suited 
many competing products do not require an up front investment in the form of a capital equipment purchase  lease  or rental 
failure of third parties to reimburse medical providers for our products may reduce our sales 
we sell our cvx laser unit primarily to hospitals  which then bill third party payers  such as government programs and private insurance plans  for the services the hospitals provide using the cvx laser unit 
unlike balloon angioplasty  laser atherectomy requires the purchase or lease of expensive capital equipment 
in some circumstances  the amount reimbursed to a hospital for procedures involving our products may not be adequate to cover a hospital s costs 
we do not believe that reimbursement has materially adversely affected our business to date  but continued cost containment measures by third party payers could hurt our business in the future 
in addition  the fda has required that the label for the cvx laser unit state that adjunctive balloon angioplasty was performed together with laser atherectomy in most of the procedures we submitted to the fda for pre market approval 
adjunctive balloon angioplasty requires the purchase of a balloon catheter in addition to the laser catheter 
while all approved procedures using the excimer laser system are reimbursable  some third party payers attempt to deny reimbursement for procedures they believe are duplicative  such as adjunctive balloon angioplasty performed together with laser atherectomy 
third party payers may also attempt to deny reimbursement if they determine that a device used in a procedure was experimental  was used for a non approved indication  or was not used in accordance with established pay protocols regarding cost effective treatment methods 
hospitals that have experienced reimbursement problems or expect to experience reimbursement problems may not purchase our excimer laser systems 
technological change may result in our products becoming obsolete 
we derive substantially all of our revenue from the sale or lease of the cvx laser unit  related disposable devices and service 
technological progress or new developments in our industry could adversely affect sales of our products 
many companies  some of which have substantially greater resources than we do  are engaged in research and development for the treatment and prevention of coronary artery disease 
these include pharmaceutical approaches as well as development of new or improved angioplasty  atherectomy  thrombectomy or other devices 
our products could be rendered obsolete as a result of future innovations in the treatment of vascular disease 
regulatory compliance is expensive and can often be denied or significantly delayed 
the industry in which we compete is subject to extensive regulation by the fda and comparable state and foreign agencies 
complying with these regulations is costly and time consuming 
international regulatory approval processes may take longer than the fda approval process 
if we fail to comply with applicable regulatory requirements  we may be subject to fines  suspensions or revocations of approvals  seizures or recalls of products  operating restrictions  criminal prosecutions and other penalties 
we may be unable to obtain future regulatory approval in a timely manner  or at all  if existing regulations are changed or new regulations are adopted 
for example  the fda approval process for the use of excimer laser technology in clearing blocked arteries in the upper and lower leg has taken longer than we anticipated due to requests for additional clinical data and changes in regulatory requirements 
failures in clinical trials may hurt our business and our stock price 
all of spectranetics potential products are subject to extensive regulation and will require approval from the fda and other regulatory agencies prior to commercial sale 
the results from pre clinical testing and early clinical trials may not be predictive of results obtained in large clinical trials 
companies in the medical device industry have suffered significant setbacks in various stages of clinical trials  even in advanced clinical trials  after apparently promising results had been obtained in earlier trials 
the development of safe and effective products is uncertain and subject to numerous risks 
the product development process may take several years  depending on the type  complexity  novelty and intended use of the product 
larger competitors are able to offer larger financial incentives to their customers to support their clinical trials 
enrollment in our clinical trials may be adversely affected by clinical trials financed by our 
table of contents larger competitors 
product candidates that may appear to be promising in development may not reach the market for a number of reasons 
product candidates may be found ineffective  take longer to progress through clinical trials than had been anticipated  or require additional clinical data and testing 
we cannot guarantee that we will gain fda approval to market the use of our excimer laser system to treat blocked arteries in the upper and lower leg 
if we do not receive these fda approvals  our business will suffer 
our european operations may not be successful or may not be able to achieve revenue growth 
in january we established a distributor relationship in germany  and now utilize distributors throughout most of europe 
the sales and marketing efforts on our behalf by distributors in europe could fail to attain long term success 
we are exposed to the problems that come from having international operations 
for the year ended december   our revenue from international operations represented percent of consolidated revenue 
changes in overseas economic conditions  war  currency exchange rates  foreign tax laws or tariffs or other trade regulations could adversely affect our ability to market our products in these and other countries 
as we expand our international operations  we expect our sales and expenses denominated in foreign currencies to expand 
we have important sole source suppliers and may be unable to replace them if they stop supplying us 
we purchase certain components of our cvx laser unit from several sole source suppliers 
we do not have guaranteed commitments from these suppliers and order products through purchase orders placed with these suppliers from time to time 
while we believe that we could obtain replacement components from alternative suppliers  we may be unable to do so 
potential product liability claims and insufficient insurance coverage may hurt our business and stock price 
we are subject to risk of product liability claims 
we maintain product liability insurance with coverage and aggregate maximum amounts of  the coverage limits of our insurance policies may be inadequate  and insurance coverage with acceptable terms could be unavailable in the future 
our patents and proprietary rights may be proved invalid  which would enable competitors to copy our products  we may infringe other companies rights 
we hold patents and licenses to use patented technology  and have patent applications pending 
any patents we have applied for may not be granted 
in addition  our patents may not be sufficiently broad to protect our technology or to give us any competitive advantage 
our patents could be challenged as invalid or circumvented by competitors 
in addition  the laws of certain foreign countries do not protect our intellectual property rights to the same extent as do the laws of the united states 
we do not have patents in many foreign countries 
we could be adversely affected if any of our licensors terminates our licenses to use patented technology 
although we have established reserves for royalty payment obligations based on a process of calculating royalty obligations associated with our licensed technology  the process involves management estimates that require judgement and there can be no assurance that these reserves will be adequate 
there may be patents and patent applications owned by others relating to laser and fiber optic technologies  which  if determined to be valid and enforceable  may be infringed by spectranetics 
holders of certain patents  including holders of patents involving the use of lasers in the body  may contact us and request that we enter into license agreements for the underlying technology 
for example  we have been made aware of a patent issued for a certain catheter with a diameter of less than 
millimeters 
we are in the process of reviewing the patent to determine its validity and enforceability 
we cannot guarantee a patent holder will not file a lawsuit against us and prevail 
if we decide that we need to license technology  we may be unable to 
table of contents obtain these licenses on favorable terms or at all 
we may not be able to develop or otherwise obtain alternative technology 
litigation concerning patents and proprietary rights is time consuming  expensive  unpredictable and could divert the efforts of our management 
an adverse ruling could subject us to significant liability  require us to seek licenses and restrict our ability to manufacture and sell our products 
our stock price may continue to be volatile 
the market price of our common stock  similar to other small cap medical device companies  has been  and is likely to continue to be  highly volatile 
the following factors may significantly affect the market price of our common stock fluctuations in operating results  announcements of technological innovations or new products by spectranetics or our competitors  governmental regulation  developments with respect to patents or proprietary rights  public concern regarding the safety of products developed by spectranetics or others  past or future management changes  general market conditions  and financing of future operations through additional issuances of equity securities  which may result in dilution to existing stockholders and falling stock prices 
protections against unsolicited takeovers in our rights plan  charter and bylaws may reduce or eliminate our stockholders ability to resell their shares at a premium over market price 
we have a stockholders rights plan that may prevent an unsolicited change of control of spectranetics 
the rights plan may adversely affect the market price of our common stock or the ability of stockholders to participate in a transaction in which they might otherwise receive a premium for their shares 
under the rights plan  rights to purchase preferred stock in certain circumstances have been issued to holders of outstanding shares of common stock  and rights will be issued in the future for any newly issued common stock 
holders of the preferred stock are entitled to certain dividend  voting and liquidation rights that could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire spectranetics 
our charter and bylaws contain provisions relating to issuance of preferred stock  special meetings of stockholders and amendments of the bylaws that could have the effect of delaying  deferring or preventing an unsolicited change in the control of spectranetics 
our board of directors is elected for staggered three year terms  which prevents stockholders from electing all directors at each annual meeting and may have the effect of delaying or deferring a change in control 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk our primary market risks include changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates 
market risk is the risk of potential loss arising from adverse changes in market rates and prices  such as foreign currency exchange and interest rates 
we do not use financial instruments to any degree to manage these risks 
the company does not use financial instruments to manage changes in commodity prices and does not hold or issue financial instruments for trading or other speculative purposes 
our debt consists of obligations with fixed interest rates ranging from percent to percent 
the company does not consider the potential losses in future earnings  cash flows and fair values from reasonable near term changes in exchange rates or interest rates to be material
