item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations this discussion is intended to further the reader s understanding of our financial condition and results of operations and should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere herein 
this discussion also contains statements that are forward looking 
our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward looking statements as a result of the risks and uncertainties set forth elsewhere in this annual report and in our other sec filings 
readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on any forward looking statements  which speak only as of the date hereof 
overview we are a non asset based third party logistics services company providing supply chain solutions on a global basis 
we offer a full range of time definite transportation and distribution solutions through our domestic services platform where we manage and arrange the movement of raw materials  supplies  components and finished goods for our customers 
these services are offered through our domestic air and ground freight forwarding business 
we offer a full range of international logistics services including international air and ocean transportation as well as customs house brokerage services through our international services platform 
in addition to these core service offerings  we also provide a broad range of value added supply chain management services  including warehousing  order fulfillment and inventory management solutions 
we service a customer base of manufacturers  distributors and national retail chains through a network of offices in major metropolitan areas in north america  plus two international locations  using an extensive network of over independent carriers and over service partners strategically located around the world 
as a non asset based provider of third party logistics services  we seek to limit our investment in equipment  facilities and working capital through contracts and preferred provider arrangements with various transportation providers who generally provide us with favorable rates  minimum service levels  capacity assurances and priority handling status 
the volume of our flow of freight enables us to negotiate attractive pricing with our transportation providers 
our strategic objective is to build a leading global logistics services organization that integrates established operating businesses and innovative technologies 
we plan to achieve this objective by broadening our network through a combination of synergistic acquisitions and the organic expansion of our existing base of operations 
we are currently pursuing an aggressive acquisition strategy to enhance our position in our current markets and to acquire operations in new markets 
the focus of this strategy is on acquiring businesses that have demonstrated historic levels of profitability  have a proven record of delivering high quality services  have a customer base of large and mid sized companies and which otherwise may benefit from our long term growth strategy and status as a public company 
our acquisition strategy relies upon two primary factors first  our ability to identify and acquire target businesses that fit within our general acquisition criteria and  second  the continued availability of capital and financing resources sufficient to complete these acquisitions 
our growth strategy relies upon a number of factors  including our ability to efficiently integrate the businesses of the companies we acquire  generate the anticipated economies of scale from the integration  and maintain the historic sales growth of the acquired businesses so as to generate continued organic growth 
the business risks associated with these factors are discussed at item of this report under the heading risks particular to our business 
our principal source of income is derived from freight forwarding services 
as a freight forwarder  we arrange for the shipment of our customers freight from point of origin to point of destination 
generally  we quote our customers a turn key cost for the movement of their freight 
our price quote will often depend upon the customer s time definite needs first day through fifth day delivery  special handling needs heavy equipment  delicate items  environmentally sensitive goods  electronic components  etc 
and the means of transport truck  air  ocean or rail 
in turn  we assume the responsibility for arranging and paying for the underlying means of transportation 
we also provide a range of other services including customs brokerage  warehousing and other services which include customized distribution and inventory management services  fulfillment services and other value added supply chain services 
gross revenues represent the total dollar value of services we sell to our customers 
our cost of transportation includes direct costs of transportation  including motor carrier  air  ocean and rail services 
we act principally as the service provider to add value in the execution and procurement of these services to our customers 
our net transportation revenues gross transportation revenues less the direct cost of transportation are the primary indicator of our ability to source  add value and resale services provided by third parties  and are considered by management to be a key performance measure 
management believes that net revenues are also an important measure of economic performance 
net revenues include transportation revenues and our fee based activities  after giving effect to the cost of purchased transportation 
in addition  management believes measuring its operating costs as a function of net revenues provides a useful metric as our ability to control costs as a function of net revenues directly impacts operating earnings 
with respect to our services other than freight transportation  net revenues are identical to gross revenues 
our operating results will be affected as acquisitions occur 
since all acquisitions are made using the purchase method of accounting for business combinations  our financial statements will only include the results of operations and cash flows of acquired companies periods subsequent to the date of acquisition 
accordingly  our results of operations only reflect the operations of air plus for periods subsequent to october   global for periods subsequent to april   united american for periods subsequent to may   and tsi for periods subsequent to october  our operating results are also subject to seasonal trends when measured on a quarterly basis 
our first and second quarters are likely to be weaker as compared with our other fiscal quarters  which we believe is consistent with the operating results of other supply chain service providers 
this trend is dependent on numerous factors  including the markets in which we operate  holiday seasons  consumer demand and economic conditions 
since our revenues are largely derived from customers whose shipments are dependent upon consumer demand and just in time production schedules  the timing of our revenues are often out of our control 
factors such as shifting demand for retail goods and or manufacturing production delays  could unexpectedly affect the timing of our revenues 
as we increase the scale of our operations  seasonal trends in one area may be offset to an extent by opposite trends in another area 
we cannot accurately predict the timing of these factors  nor can we accurately estimate the impact of any particular factor  and thus we can give no assurance that historical seasonal patterns will continue in future periods 
critical accounting policies accounting policies  methods and estimates are an integral part of the consolidated financial statements prepared by us and are based upon our current judgments 
those judgments are normally based on knowledge and experience with regard to past and current events and assumptions about future events 
certain accounting policies  methods and estimates are particularly sensitive because of their significance to the consolidated financial statements and because of the possibility that future events affecting them may differ from our current judgments 
while there are a number of accounting policies  methods and estimates that affect our consolidated financial statements as described in note to the consolidated financial statements  areas that are particularly significant include the assessment of the recoverability of long lived assets  specifically goodwill and acquired intangibles  the establishment of an allowance for doubtful accounts and the valuation allowance for deferred income tax assets 
in certain instances  accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america allow for the selection of alternative accounting methods 
two alternative methods for accounting for stock options are available  the intrinsic value method and the fair value method 
we use the intrinsic value method of accounting for stock options  and accordingly  no compensation expense has been recognized for options issued at an exercise price equal to or greater than the quoted market price on the date of grant to employees  officers and directors 
under the fair value method  the determination of the pro forma amounts involves several assumptions including option life and volatility 
if the fair value method were used  basic earnings per share and diluted earnings per share would have decreased by and  respectively  in as discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements  the goodwill arising from the our acquisitions is not amortized  but instead is tested for impairment at least annually in accordance with the provisions of sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
the impairment test requires several estimates including future cash flows  growth rates and the selection of a discount rate 
in addition  the acquired intangibles arising from those transactions are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable 
the recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by comparing the carrying amount of the asset to the future net undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by the asset 
we cannot guarantee that our assets will not be impaired in future periods 
we maintain reserves for specific and general allowances against accounts receivable 
the specific reserves are established on a case by case basis by management 
a general reserve is established for all other accounts receivable  based on a specified percentage of the accounts receivable balance 
we continually assesses the adequacy of the recorded allowance for doubtful accounts  based on our knowledge concerning the customer base 
while credit losses have historically been within our expectations and the provisions established  we cannot guarantee that we will continue to experience the same credit loss rates that we have in the past 
our discontinued operations  which focused on the development of early stage technology businesses  generated significant net operating loss carryforwards nols which could have value in the future 
after giving effect for certain annual limitations based on changes in ownership as defined in section of the internal revenue code  we estimate that as much as million in nols may be available to offset current and future federal taxable income 
under sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes  we are required to provide a valuation allowance to offset any net deferred tax assets  if  based upon available evidence  it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
given our historical losses and our limited track record of profitability to date  we maintained a full valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets as of december  which is consistent with what was done in the prior year 
if we continue to operate profitably in  we believe that we may be able to demonstrate that it is more likely than not that we will be able to use some or all of the nols in the future 
when  and if  we can cross the threshold of more likely than not  we would reduce our valuation allowance against all or a portion of the deferred tax asset 
discontinued operations prior to the first quarter of  our principal business was developing early stage technology businesses with significant internet features and applications 
largely as a result of the significant correction in the global stock markets which began during  and the corresponding decrease in the valuation of technology businesses and contraction in the availability of venture financing during  we elected to shift our business strategy to focus on the acquisition of operating businesses within a particular industry segment 
following a wind down of the technology business  during the second quarter of we focused our acquisition efforts specifically within the transportation and logistics industry 
this decision occurred in conjunction with our june  appointment of dennis l 
pelino as our chairman and chief executive officer 
mr 
pelino brings to us over years of logistics experience  including most recently  as president and chief operating officer of fritz companies  inc  where he was employed from to to reflect the change in business model  our financial statements have been presented in a manner in which the assets  liabilities  results of operations and cash flows related to our former business have been segregated from that of our continuing operations and are presented as discontinued operations 
results of operations basis of presentation our results of operations are presented in a manner that is intended to provide meaningful data with respect to our transition to and ongoing operations as a third party logistics company 
accordingly  unaudited pro forma results of operations for and are first presented as if we had discontinued our former business model and acquired air plus  global and united american collectively the material acquisitions as of january  the unaudited pro forma results reflect a consolidation of the historical results of operations of the material acquisitions  as adjusted to reflect contractual adjustments to officers compensation at the companies comprising the material acquisitions and to reflect amortization of acquired intangibles 
the unaudited pro forma results also exclude losses associated with our discontinued operations as well as the impact of the july  exchange transaction with the holders of our series c preferred stock 
we have also presented our historical results of operations for and for  our historical results only reflect the operations of air plus for the period of october  through december  for  our historical results include months of operations for air plus  but they only reflect the results of global  united american and tsi from their various acquisition dates in as a result of the non comparative nature of our business in and  we have only provided limited comparative analysis of our historical results

other selling  general and administrative expenses were million for  relatively flat compared to million in as a percentage of net revenues  other selling  general and administrative expenses decreased to from in and is indicative of the scalability of our business model 
income from operations was million in  an increase of over million for income from operations as a percentage of net revenues increased to from in other income and expenses improved modestly in compared to with year over year cash balances being reduced as a result of our acquisition strategy  interest income was insignificant to the company s overall financial performance for falling to less than million compared to million in the overall positive variance relates to million in interest expense and losses incurred on the sale of marketable securities in as a result of historical losses related to investments in early stage technology businesses  the company has accumulated net operating loss carryforwards for federal and state income tax purposes amounting to approximately million and million  respectively 
although a portion of this loss may be subject to certain limitations  it appears that we may be able to use approximately million of the loss to offset current and future federal taxable income 
as a result  the company is currently only subject to certain state and local taxes which on a pro forma basis results in a tax provision of million for and million for net income was million in  an increase of compared to million in pro forma net income per share in was per basic share and per diluted share 
year ended december  historical compared to year ended december  historical the following table summarizes our historical net transportation revenues and revenues by service line percent change transportation revenues   cost of transportation   net transportation revenues   net transportation margins customs brokerage  nm warehousing and other value added services  total net revenues   the following table summarizes certain historical consolidated statement of operations data as a percentage of our net revenues change amount percent amount percent amount percent net revenue    personnel costs    other selling  general and administrative    total operating costs    income loss from operations    other income expense   income loss from operations before income taxes    income taxes nm income loss from continuing operations    loss from discontinued operations   net income loss    preferred stock dividends    net income loss attributable to common stockholders    gross revenues were million in  compared to million in net transportation revenues were million in  compared to million in net revenues were million in  compared to million in personnel costs were million for  compared to million for other selling  general and administrative expenses were million for  compared to million in income from operations was million in  compared to a loss of million for other income and expense was million in  a decrease from million in as a result of historical losses related to investments in early stage technology business  the company has accumulated a federal net operating loss carryforwards 
although a portion of this loss may be subject to certain limitations  the company expects it will be able to use approximately million of the loss to offset current and future federal taxable income 
as a result  the company is currently only subject to certain state and local taxes which resulted in a state tax provision of million in there were no losses from discontinued operations in as compared to losses from discontinued operations of million in these losses reflect the costs associated with our holdings in early stage technology businesses for our previous business model  including investment losses  personnel and office costs 
net income was million in  compared to a net loss of million in the company recorded a net non cash benefit of million associated with the restructuring of our series c preferred stock  after giving effect to million in preferred stock dividends  compared to preferred stock dividends of million in see note to the consolidated financial statements 
net income attributable to common stockholders was million in  compared to a net loss attributable to common stockholders of million in basic earnings per share was for compared to a loss of per basic share for diluted earnings per share for excludes the net effect of the series c exchange transaction and was per diluted share for compared to a loss of per diluted share for financial outlook we completed our transformation into a global logistics enterprise in and now we offer a robust set of domestic and international supply chain services 
based on existing operations  we expect to generate approximately million of pre tax operating income in on an estimated million in revenues 
our revenue and net income estimates have been developed based on a number of principal assumptions including  among others i that revenue and net income will continue to grow at an annual rate that is consistent with recent results  ii that operating margins will remain at least at current levels  iii that no material economic or customer disruptions will occur  iv that each of our operating companies on a stand alone basis will deliver the level of pre tax operating income necessary to fully achieve the earn out payments under each of their acquisition agreements  and v that the risks otherwise identified in risks particular to our business will not have an adverse effect on our operations 
we may record a non cash tax benefit in in recognition of the value associated with our net deferred tax assets 
given the possibility of recognizing this non cash benefit some time in the future and under the assumption that over time we will make use of the nols available to us and become a full taxpayer  a key measurement of our on going financial performance will be the period on period change in pre tax operating income 
we look to continue to drive shareholder value through four areas of growth o organic growth although the overall industry is projected to grow at a rate in the range of per year  we are targeting organic annual growth rates in the range of 
o acquisitive growth we expect to deploy to million in acquisition capital over the course of  funded through a combination of existing cash  draws upon our credit facility  the proceeds of new financings and the value of newly issued securities 
based on our acquisition model  this could generate incremental annualized pre tax operating income in the range of to million per year 
o margin expansion our business model is scaleable in nature and as we aggregate and leverage our purchasing power and grow our business  we expect to deliver year on year improvement in our operating margins 
o price earnings p e expansion on a p e basis  we are trading at a considerable discount to other publicly traded third party logistics companies 
as we execute our plans and become better known by the investment community  we would expect to receive a p e closer to that of our peers 
assuming we can continue to execute on our business plan and acquisition model without any material disruptions  and identify and close transactions similar to transactions accomplished to date  it is our goal to generate million in run rate revenues by the end of notwithstanding our expectations regarding our ability to deliver these results  we can never be certain that future revenue or earnings will be achieved at any particular level 
estimates of future financial performance are forward looking statements and are subject to uncertainty created by the risk elements identified in risks particular to our business 
furthermore  even though we believe our current operations will achieve a certain level of earnings on an annual basis  our results are subject to seasonal trends 
for and  on a pro forma basis  approximately of our annual revenues and a small percentage of our annual income were generated in the first quarter 
thereafter  volume and income accelerates for the remainder of the year  with the third and fourth quarters showing the greatest improvement 
disclosures about contractual obligations the following table aggregates all contractual commitments and commercial obligations that affect the company s financial condition and liquidity position as of december  payments due by period less than more than contractual obligations year years years years total operating lease obligations      other long term liabilities reflected on the registrant s balance sheet under gaap   letter of credit   total contractual obligations      contingent earn out obligations a     total contractual and contingent obligations      a consists of potential obligations related to earn out payments to the former owners of our existing subsidiaries  as discussed under liquidity and capital resources 
liquidity and capital resources prior to the adoption of our current business model  our operations consisted of developing early stage technology businesses 
these operations did not generate sufficient operating funds to meet our cash needs  and  as a result  we funded our historic operations with the proceeds from a number of private placements of debt and equity securities 
with the advent of our new business model  we expect to be able to fund our operations with the cash flow generated by the subsidiaries we acquire 
we are also in an acquisition mode and expect to deploy material amounts of capital as we execute our business plan 
therefore  it is likely that we will need to raise additional capital in the future 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to raise additional capital on terms acceptable to us  if at all 
cash and cash equivalents totaled million and million as of december  and working capital totaled million and million at december  and cash used in operating activities was million for compared to million used in before growth in working capital accounts driven principally by the acquisition of new businesses  the company generated cash from operations in of million compared to a net use of million in cash from operations in net cash used in investing activities was million in compared to million in investing activities were driven principally by the acquisition of new businesses 
the company deployed million for the acquisition of new businesses in compared to million in the cash used in the acquisition of air plus in was partially offset by approximately million from the sale of our interest in webmodal  inc including million from the repayment of prior advances 
cash from financing activates generated million in compared to a use of cash of million in the use of cash was primarily related to the repayment of short term notes payable to the former shareholders of air plus 
we expect to pay approximately million in earn outs on april   based on the performance of our acquired companies relative to their respective pre tax earnings targets 
approximately million will be paid in cash with the balance payable through the issuance of shares of our common stock 
on july  we completed a private exchange transaction that eliminated approximately million of our series c preferred stock 
the terms of the series c preferred stock would have significantly constrained our future growth opportunities 
in return for eliminating the series c preferred stock  we issued  shares of common stock  warrants to purchase  shares of common stock at an exercise price of per share for a term of three years  and a new class of series d preferred stock that will convert into  shares of our common stock no later than december  the terms of the series d preferred stock were structured to make it much like a common equity equivalent in that it receives no dividend  it is subordinated to new rounds of equity  and it holds a limited liquidation preference expiring at the end of 
in addition  the holders of the series d preferred stock are restricted from selling the common stock received upon exercise of the series d preferred stock until july  or earlier if the stock trades at and then permits limited resale based on trading volume through july  in march  we completed a private placement of  shares of our common stock in exchange for gross proceeds of approximately million 
this placement yielded net proceeds of million for the company  after the payment of placement agent fees and other out of pocket costs associated with the placement 
we may also receive proceeds in the future from the exercise of existing options and warrants 
as of march   approximately  options and warrants were outstanding 
of the outstanding securities  there are approximately  that have an exercise price of per share or higher 
if we exclude those options and warrants from our fully diluted share count  our outstanding fully diluted shares  as adjusted  would be approximately  shares 
excluding options and warrants with an exercise price of or higher  the proceeds received by the company  if all of the remaining options and warrants were exercised  would be approximately million 
we believe that our current working capital and anticipated cash flow from operations are adequate to fund existing operations 
through cash resources and our existing credit facility  we believe we have sufficient capital to implement our acquisition strategy in the short term 
however  we will need additional financing to pursue our acquisition strategy in the longer term 
we intend to finance these acquisitions primarily through the use of cash  funds from our debt facility  and shares of our common stock or other securities 
in the event that our common stock does not attain or maintain a sufficient market value or potential acquisition candidates are otherwise unwilling to accept our securities as part of the purchase price for the sale of their businesses  we may be required to utilize more of our cash resources  if available  in order to continue our acquisition program 
if we do not have sufficient cash resources through either operations or from debt facilities  our growth could be limited unless we are able to obtain such additional capital 
to ensure that we have adequate near term liquidity  we maintain a revolving credit facility of million the facility with lasalle business credit  inc that is collateralized by accounts receivable and other assets of the company and its subsidiaries 
the facility requires the company and its subsidiaries to comply with certain financial covenants 
advances under the facility are available to fund future acquisitions  capital expenditures or for other corporate purposes 
there were no advances against the facility at december  we expect that the cash flow from our existing operations and any other subsidiaries acquired during the year will be sufficient to support our corporate overhead and some portion  if not all  of the contingent earn out payments or other cash requirements associated with our acquisitions 
therefore  we anticipate that our primary uses of capital in the near term will be to finance the cost of new acquisitions and to pay any portion of existing earn out arrangements that cash flow from operations is otherwise unable to fund 
the acquisition of air plus was completed subject to an earn out arrangement of million 
we agreed to pay the former air plus shareholders installments of million in  million in  million in and million in  with each installment payable in full if air plus achieves pre tax income of million in each of the years preceding the year of payment 
in the event there is a shortfall in pre tax income  the earn out payment will be reduced on a dollar for dollar basis to the extent of the shortfall 
shortfalls may be carried over or carried back to the extent that pre tax income in any other pay out year exceeds the million level 
based upon performance  former air plus shareholders are entitled to receive million on april   and will have excess earnings of million as a carryforward to future earnings targets 
former air plus shareholders have elected to take million in cash with the balance payable in company stock 
on april   we acquired global  a seattle based privately held company that provides a full range of international air and ocean logistics services 
the transaction was valued at up to million  consisting of cash of million paid at the closing and up to an additional million payable over a five year earn out period based upon the future financial performance of global 
we agreed to pay the former global shareholders a total of million base earn out payments in installments of million in  million in through and million in  with each installment payable in full if global achieves pre tax income of million in each of the years preceding the year of payment or the pro rata portion thereof in and 
in the event there is a shortfall in pre tax income  the earn out payment will be reduced on a pro rata basis 
shortfalls may be carried over or carried back to the extent that pre tax income in any other pay out year exceeds the million level 
the company has also provided former global shareholders with additional incentive to generate earnings in excess of the base million annual earnings target tier two earn out 
under global s tier two earn out  former global shareholders are also entitled to received of the cumulative pre tax earnings in excess of million generated during the five year earn out period subject to a maximum additional earn out opportunity of million 
global would need to generate cumulative earnings of million over the five year earn out period to receive the full million in contingent earn out payments 
based upon performance  former global shareholders will receive million on april   and will have excess earnings of million as a carryforward to future earnings targets 
on may  we acquired united american  a detroit based privately held provider of expedited transportation services 
the united american transaction provided us with a new time definite service offering focused on the automotive industry 
the transaction is valued at up to million  consisting of cash of million paid at closing and a four year earn out arrangement based upon the future financial performance of united american 
we agreed to pay the former united american shareholder a total of million base earn out payments in installments of million in through  with each installment payable in full if united american achieves pre tax income of million in each of the years preceding the year of payment 
in the event there is a shortfall in pre tax income  the earn out payment will be reduced on a dollar for dollar basis to the extent of the shortfall 
shortfalls may be carried over or carried back to the extent that pre tax income in any other pay out year exceeds the million level 
the company has also provided the former united american shareholder with additional incentive to generate earnings in excess of the base million annual earnings target tier two earn out 
under united american s tier two earn out  the former united american shareholder is also entitled to receive of the cumulative pre tax earnings generated by a certain pre acquisition customer in excess of million during the four year earn out period subject to a maximum additional earn out opportunity of million 
united american would need to generate cumulative earnings of million over the four year earn out period to receive the full million in contingent earn out payments 
based upon performance  the former united american shareholder will receive million on april   and has an earnings shortfall of million 
in future years  earnings in excess of the million earnings target would first be applied against the million shortfall 
on october  we acquired tsi  a northern virginia based privately held provider of expedited domestic and international transportation services 
the tsi transaction capitalized on tsi s existing base of government contract work in the washington metropolitan area and served as a supplement to an existing company operated facility in that area 
the transaction was valued at up to million  consisting of cash of million paid at closing  and a three year earn out arrangement 
the company agreed to pay the former tsi shareholder million for each year in the three year earn out period ending december   based upon the annual net revenue targets of million 
in the event there is a shortfall in net revenues  the earn out payment will be reduced proportionally to the extent of the shortfall  provided no earn out payment shall be made if net revenues for the year fall below million 
shortfalls may be carried over or carried back to the extent that net revenues in any other pay out year exceeds the million level 
we are also in the process of closing a transaction that will significantly increase our presence in asia 
on march   we announced our agreement to acquire a interest in singapore based g link group g link  a platform acquisition that will provide the foundation for our service offering in southeast asia 
as currently structured  we are expected to pay at closing approximately million in cash and million of our common stock to the g link shareholders 
we would also expect to pay the g link shareholders for working capital balances 
the amount  estimated to be in the range of to million  would be paid using company common stock 
the g link shareholders would be entitled to a four year earn out arrangement based upon the future financial performance of g link 
the earn out is expected to be million  payable in installments of million per year 
the transaction is expected to close by no later than june   and is subject to customary closing conditions  including the securing of third party and regulatory consents  as well as the completion of an audit of g link for the year ended december  we will be required to make significant payments in the future if the earn out installments under our various acquisitions become due 
while we believe that a significant portion of the required payments will be generated by the acquired subsidiaries  we may have to secure additional sources of capital to fund some portion of the earn out payments as they become due 
this presents us with certain business risks relative to the availability and pricing of future fund raising  as well as the potential dilution to our stockholders if the fund raising involves the sale of equity 
the following table summarizes our contingent base earn out payments in thousands total earn out payments domestic     international      total earn out payments      prior year pre tax earnings targets domestic     international      total pre tax earnings targets      earn outs as a percentage of prior year pre tax earnings targets domestic international combined excludes the impact of prior year s pre tax earnings carryforwards excess or shortfalls versus earnings targets 
during the earn out period  there is an additional contingent obligation related to tier two earn outs that could be as much as million if the applicable acquired companies generate an incremental million in pre tax earnings 
the company is a defendant in a number of legal proceedings 
although we believe that the claims asserted in these proceedings are without merit  and we intend to vigorously defend these matters  there is the possibility that the company could incur material expenses in the defense and resolution of these matters 
furthermore  since the company has not established any reserves in connection with such claims  any such liability  if at all  would be recorded as an expense in the period incurred or estimated 
this amount  even if not material to the company s overall financial condition  could adversely affect the company s results of operations in the period recorded 
new accounting pronouncements on january   the company adopted statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  which establishes criteria and methodologies for the measurement  recognition and classification of long lived assets 
the adoption of sfas no 
did not have a material impact on the company s consolidated financial statements 
in june  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities  requiring companies to recognize liabilities and costs associated with exit or disposal activities initiated after december  when they are incurred  rather than when management commits to an exit or disposal plan 
sfas no 
also requires that such liabilities be measured at fair value 
sfas no 
had no impact on the company s consolidated financial statements but may affect the measurement and recognition of any future restructuring activities 
in november  the fasb issued interpretation no 
 guarantor s accounting and disclosure of requirements for guarantees  including indirect guarantees of indebtedness of others  which elaborates on the existing disclosure requirements for guarantees and provides clarification on when a company must measure and recognize a liability related to guarantees issued 
the disclosure requirements of interpretation no 
are effective for the company s consolidated financial statements for the year ended december  the measurement and recognition provisions are to be applied on a prospective basis for guarantees issued or modified after december  the adoption of interpretation no 
did not require additional disclosures and is not expected to impact the company s consolidated financial statements as the company does not typically issue guarantees related to third party indebtedness or performance 
in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure  which i amends sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  to provide alternative methods of transition for an entity that voluntarily changes the fair value based method of accounting for stock based employee compensation  ii amends the disclosure provisions of sfas no 
to require prominent disclosure about the effects on reported net income of an entity s accounting policy decisions with respect to stock based employee compensation and iii amends accounting principles board opinion no 
 interim financial reporting  to require disclosure about those effects in interim financial information 
items ii and iii in the new requirements of sfas no 
are effective for financial statements for fiscal years ending after december  the company has included the requirements of item ii in note summary of significant accounting policies and will include the requirements of item iii beginning with its first interim report as of and for the period ending march  in january  the fasb issued interpretation no 
 consolidation of variable interest entities  which provides new guidance with respect to the consolidation of all unconsolidated entities  including special purpose entities 
the adoption of interpretation no 
in is not expected to impact the company s consolidated financial statements as the company does not have investments in any unconsolidated special purpose or variable interest entities 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our exposure to market risk relates primarily to changes in interest rates and the resulting impact on our invested cash 
we place our cash with high credit quality financial institutions and invest that cash in money market funds and investment grade securities with maturities of less than days 
we are averse to principal loss and ensure the safety and preservation of our invested funds by investing in only highly rated investments and by limiting our exposure in any one issuance 
if market interest rates were to increase immediately and uniformly by from levels at december   the fair value of our portfolio would decline by an immaterial amount 
we do not invest in derivative financial instruments
