industry overview the pay television industry is comprised primarily of program suppliers  pay television channel providers and pay television distributors 
program suppliers  from whom we acquire or license a portion of our programming  include many of the major production studios and other independent production companies and independent owners of programming 
these program suppliers create  develop and finance the production of  or control rights to  movies  television miniseries  series and other programming 
due to our acquisition of the crown media library  we are a program supplier 
program suppliers generate revenue by licensing their programming to broadcasters and video distributors pay television channel providers around the world 
these licenses are typically specific by territory and are limited to a certain number of showings within specified periods of time 
we are also a pay television channel provider 
pay television channel providers include all channel providers except over the air broadcasters and major us and international networks 
pay television channel providers often produce programming and acquire or license programming from program suppliers and generally package the programming according to an overriding theme and brand strategy 
pay television restricts viewership through security encryption devices that limit viewership to paying subscribers 
pay television channel providers compete with each other for distribution and to attract viewers and advertisers 
pay television providers generally target audiences with a certain demographic composition  so that they can then sell advertising to advertisers seeking to reach the providers demographic audiences 
pay television distributors own and operate the platforms used to deliver channels to subscribers 
these distributors use several different technologies to reach their subscribers as described below 
distributors attempt to create a mix of channels that will be attractive to their subscriber population in an attempt to gain new subscribers and to reduce subscriber turnover 
distributors have different levels of service for subscribers  with each service level containing some different channels 
more recently  distributors  particularly in the us  have begun to offer additional broadband services such as internet access  telephony and video on demand over their systems 
as a result of the recently increased competition for limited analog channel space in the united states and increased use of the digital cable capacity for new broadband services  pay television channel providers are often required to pay subscriber acquisition fees to pay television distributors for carriage on their systems 
these subscriber acquisition fees are paid to television distributors on a per subscriber basis and generally in advance of any receipt of subscriber fee revenue from such pay television distributors 
distribution platforms four major distribution platforms are currently used to transmit programming 
first  cable television systems use coaxial or fiber optic cable to transmit multiple channels between a central facility  known as a headend  and the individual subscriber s television set 
second  analog and digital satellite broadcast systems such as direct to home or dth use satellite transponders to broadcast television programming to individual dwellings with satellite reception equipment  including a dish and a decoder 
third  digital terrestrial television broadcasters dtt typically broadcast locally or through regional or national ground based transmission networks 
in general  such broadcasters use landline  microwave or satellite transmission systems to distribute programming to terrestrial transmission facilities for broadcast directly to viewers homes 
finally  channels can also be distributed through satellite master antenna television smatv 
smatv is used primarily for buildings  such as apartments and hotels that receive programming from 
table of contents satellites by means of a single antenna that is connected to the buildings headend 
the television signals are then distributed to individual units in the building by cable 
sources of revenue subscriber fees pay television customers subscribe to basic services by paying monthly fees for basic channels to pay television distributors 
the customers can also subscribe to additional packages of premium or pay per view services upon payment of additional fees 
primarily in international markets  pay television distributors generally pay a fee per subscriber for all or some subscribers to channel providers 
we are a channel provider

advertising revenue the advertising market differs greatly around the world 
in the united states  the most developed television market  it was estimated by advertising age that  as of december   of all advertising expenditures were spent on broadcast television and of all advertising expenditures were spent on cable television 
in other parts of the world  the amount spent by advertisers on television varies according to the development of each country s television market 
in general  advertising expenditures are less in other countries than in the united states  both in terms of percentage of advertising expenditures as well as absolute dollars 
program ratings systems in many non united states markets are growing rapidly  and as a result  advertisers are relying less on subscriber counts and more on empirical measurements when buying advertising time 
television advertising is sold in a variety of formats 
many pay television channels rely largely upon the spot advertisement format 
spot advertisements are normally seconds long and air during or between programs 
they are often sold in packages of a certain number of spots or to deliver a certain number of viewers 
an alternative to spot advertising is sponsorship  by which a company sponsors a program or selection of programs on a channel by applying their branding around the programming 
the ability of a television channel to generate advertising revenue largely depends on estimated or actual viewing levels  primarily based on ratings  and on advertising rates 
typically  in the united states and some other markets  independent ratings systems on which advertising sales can be based are well established and widely accepted within the industry 
in addition  pay television channel providers and distributors may also provide estimated or actual subscriber information 
our us channel sells the majority of its advertising in the up front season  generally in august  for the last quarter of the same year and the first three quarters of the following year 
we hold back a small percentage of our inventory for audience deficiency units  adus  and sell the remainder in the spot market 
adus are units of inventory that are made available to advertisers as compensation for inventory the advertiser purchased that ran in programs that under delivered on the guaranteed ratings 
historically  advertisers have spent more on advertising through traditional broadcast television than through pay television 
we believe that as pay television continues to gain viewership relative to broadcast television  it should attract a larger percentage of the total available dollars spent on television advertising 
also  as pay television draws audience share from broadcast television  audience demographics become fragmented  and  as a result  advertisers are able to target groups of viewers with specific demographic profiles 
since february  paid commercial programming  infomercials  has been carried on a limited basis in several international regional feeds of the hallmark channel 
ratings for the year  the domestic hallmark channel was rated the fastest growing cable network in terms of annual audience percentage growth in ratings for compared to according to nielsen media research  with a increase in ratings for total day and nearly a two fold increase in household impressions 

table of contents the channel experienced increases of more than over in all of its key demographics for adults and women for total day 
internationally  during the international hallmark channel ranked in the top ten cable and satellite channels in the uk according to the broadcaster audience research board 
in the uk  the channel enjoyed a strong and sustained increase in ratings over the past two years  and the most recent research shows that the channel has by far the highest loyalty index of any entertainment channel 
additionally  significant ratings growth has been achieved in the scandinavian market with the quadrupling of audience share in denmark over the last two years according to gallup 
the channel in poland  our most important central and east european territory  experienced a increase in viewing levels during the same period according to agb polska 
australia continues to be an important market for us  with a loyal audience that improved throughout resulting in the channel delivering its highest ratings to date in january licensing revenue program suppliers sell or license programming to broadcasters and video distributors pay television channel providers who pay a license fee for the right to exploit air the programming over a certain period in their program package 
as a program supplier  we recognize revenue from television and distribution licensing agreements when the film is available for exhibition by the licensee  the license fee is known  collectibility is reasonably assured and the cost of each film is known or reasonably determinable 
payments received from licensees prior to the availability of a film are recorded by us as deferred revenue 
long term receivables arising from licensing agreements are recorded at their net present value

significant sources for our programming are the crown media library and programming produced since january   by hallmark entertainment  inc hallmark entertainment  which is available to us through our program agreements 
prior to the purchase of the crown media library  we licensed substantially all of the titles in that library from hallmark entertainment distribution 
we enjoy access to new hallmark entertainment programming through an amended five year program license agreement with hallmark entertainment distribution

hallmark entertainment currently provides family programming for audiences worldwide  generally delivering more than projects each year 
for the year ended december   approximately of our international programming was from the crown media library or licensed from hallmark entertainment distribution 
we licensed for that same time period the 
table of contents remaining portion of the international channel s programming line up from third parties 
this third party programming is consistent with the themes and quality of the material we own or license from hallmark entertainment distribution 
we license programming from third party suppliers such as carlton international media limited  cbs broadcast international  beyond distribution pty ltd  southern star sales limited  hearst entertainment  inc  paramount pictures australia pty ltd  columbia tri star international and buena vista disney

distribution in the countries where we offer the international channel  we distribute the channel through a variety of distribution platforms  including cable  dth  dtt and smatv 
we distribute the channel through distribution agreements with local pay television operators such as bskyb  measat  pramer  sky network  telepiu  via digital and videoland 
our distribution agreements with such operators generally last two to five years 
we have the capability to create and deliver our channel to new platforms in a short period of time through our broadcast infrastructure based in greenwood village  colorado 
we have entered into a strategic relationship with pramer  sca pramer  which perform all day to day operations including program acquisitions  scheduling  marketing  advertising and affiliate sales  playback and uplink for our operations in mexico  central and south america 
we regularly review existing and potential markets to assess their prospects 
as the number of international channel subscribers increases in a market  we assess our ability to increase revenue or develop new revenue sources by subdividing the market through the addition of satellite signals to individual countries within that market as opportunities particularly advertising arise 
when we subdivide a market  we are able to customize the channel to appeal to a more specific audience 
the delivery of the international channel to more targeted audiences also increases the number of potential advertisers on the channel by creating more targeted advertising opportunities for local or regional businesses in the markets in which we operate

sources of revenue like most international pay television channels  we currently derive the majority of our international revenue from subscriber fees and  to a lesser extent  advertising sales 
we generally charge our pay television distributors a fee per subscriber for the right to broadcast our international channel 
we have increased the number of subscribers to our international channel in the past year  and as a result  have achieved an increase in revenue generated from subscriber fees 
international fees per subscriber have and will continue to experience downward pressure due to the competitive nature of the industry  the growth of digital cable  political and economic turmoil in latin america and the shift in the industry in the more developed countries from subscriber fee revenue to advertising revenue 
we also expect our international fees to decline as we exit certain markets and utilize strategic alliances in other markets 
for the years ended december    and revenue derived from subscriber fees for the international channel were approximately million  million  and million  respectively 
we also derive revenue from the sale of advertising time on our international channel 
we generate revenue directly from advertisers as well as from our pay television distributors under distribution agreements that may provide for a sharing of net revenue from advertising 
we believe that the number of subscribers to our international channel and the favorable demographics of its family focused audience provide us with the opportunity to substantially increase revenue from the sale of advertising time 
currently advertising revenue from our international channel is derived primarily from activities in a limited number of countries  including east asia  mexico  poland  south africa  the united kingdom and certain countries in latin america 
for the years ended december    and revenue from the sale of advertising on our international channel were million  million  and million  respectively 
during and  we built and commenced operation of a network operations center  which enables us to control delivery of our channels to our pay television distributors

channel operations the programming departments at each of our channels are responsible for ensuring the consistent quality of the programming we offer 
the programming  scheduling and acquisitions departments work in conjunction with the traffic department and creative services to create the distinctive appearance of our channels 
some of these functions are outsourced on an as needed basis 
the creation of our channels begins with the acquisition of programming 
we acquired in over titles from the hallmark entertainment distribution library  which comprise the crown media library 
in addition  we license programming from hallmark entertainment distribution and other program suppliers 
our staff or contractors review and summarize all potential programming to ensure compliance with our quality and content standards 
the acquisitions staff in our regional offices licenses programming based on the amount of new programming required on the channels 
each of the acquisitions offices work together to leverage multi channel acquisitions across many territories to reduce license fees  but remain sensitive to specific markets with targeted localized programming 
in most of our international markets  we customize the hallmark channel by dubbing or subtitling program elements into local languages 
the decision to customize the channel into local languages is based on local market practices  viewer preferences and cost considerations 
language preparation is coordinated in the regional headquarters in london and hong kong and by pramer in buenos aires 
program language elements are typically shipped to the specific region to ensure that nuances in dialect of the particular language are captured 
the language versions are then combined with the other programming elements 
the creation of on air promotional segments interstitials  which are broadcast between the feature movies  miniseries and series  are typically outsourced to external vendors 
promotional segments are prepared in many languages for broadcast worldwide 
these interstitials are intended to invite viewership  guide viewers to specific programming  and promote brand awareness for the hallmark channel 

table of contents the scheduling department in each region creates the play list  which contains a list of daily programming 
the scheduling department works with marketing personnel to continuously monitor the programming mix 
the play list is then forwarded to the traffic department 
the traffic department inserts promotional segments and advertising into the play list and creates the daily log  which contains a detailed schedule of the stream of programming  commercials and promotional materials that will ultimately be viewed by the subscriber for each regional feed of the hallmark channel 
the daily log  together with digital tapes that contain the corresponding programming  are then forwarded to either our network operations center or  to the third party facility  which is performing the playback and uplink services for the feed 
digital tapes that contain the promotional segments are forwarded to either our network operations center or to the third party origination and playback facility separately 
channel delivery we deliver the daily log and digital tapes to our network operations center or to a third party origination and playback facility for each market  where the programming  promotional and advertising elements are combined and compressed into a single signal  and delivered to an uplink facility 
the uplink facility then transmits the signal to the satellite transponder that covers the relevant geographic market  and the transponder reflects the signal back within its designated geographic area to head end facilities and direct to home satellite services operated by pay television distributors who receive and decode our signal and transmit our channel

competition the pay television industry is highly competitive 
our channels compete for distribution  viewers and advertisers with other pay television channels  broadcast television channels and with other general forms of entertainment 
there are several sources of competition within our industry  each of which affects our business strategy 
our domestic channel competes with other general entertainment programming from tnt  usa network  a e  the discovery channel  lifetime  abc family and other similarly targeted channels 
our international channel competes with general entertainment programming from axn  i sat  canal fox  tnt  uk gold and usa network 
we compete with these channels for viewers and advertising dollars based upon quality of programming  number of subscribers  ratings and subscriber demographics 
we compete with all channels for carriage on cable and satellite systems that may have limited capacity 
competition continues to intensify as the industry shifts from analog distribution to digital distribution 
many pay television distributors have upgraded their physical infrastructures to accommodate digital delivery  which provides significantly more channel capacity 
we believe that it will take several years for the majority of current subscribers to convert to  and begin paying for  upgraded services 
in an effort to accelerate the conversion  pay television distributors are attempting to place new channels on their digital tier as opposed to their limited  yet more widely distributed  analog tiers 
as a result  the competition for the remaining widely distributed analog channel space is intense 
however  as more and more subscribers are converted  the digital tier is expected to become the dominant platform 
competitive strengths we have established a track record of providing high quality programming throughout the world 
we believe that our primary competitive strengths include the following pay television channels branded with the well known hallmark name our channels are branded with the hallmark name 
we believe that viewers and distributors associate the hallmark brand with family values and high quality content and that our association with this brand facilitates our efforts to achieve increased distribution and to attract additional viewers that leads to higher ratings and advertising revenue 
long term distribution contracts that call for increasing subscriber counts and fees we currently have long term distribution agreements with at t  adelphia  cablevision  charter  cox  directv  echostar  mediacom  nctc  and time warner in the united states  as well as a number of other distributors 
we are also seeking to enter into a similar long term distribution agreement with comcast 
the terms of our major distribution agreements generally provide for subscriber count increases and rate increases to us over time  although some provide for lower or no subscriber fees if certain levels of subscribers are achieved 

table of contents a library of popular and award winning programming and guaranteed access through long term agreements to other similar programming our library of more than titles gives us control over a significant amount of popular and award winning programming that we can either air on our channels or license to third parties 
these titles provide us with a portion of our core programming  and by owning these titles  we have the flexibility to use them as needed to create the most effective program schedules 
owning these titles also eliminates the license fees we otherwise would have to pay for these titles and provides a revenue stream for us from licensing the titles to third parties 
we have a five year program agreement with hallmark entertainment ending december   that provides us with access to new quality productions  as well as the titles in the hallmark entertainment distribution library that we did not purchase

another valuable resource is cable q  a research service that advertisers and networks have subscribed to for more than thirty years 
cable q data is useful for monitoring the level of viewer satisfaction 
the tvq cable q system is distinguished by its ability to measure the commitment viewers develop over time to specific shows and cable networks

table of contents regulation the operations of television channels in the markets in which we operate  including the united states  are regulated 
the scope of regulation varies from country to country  although in many significant respects  a similar approach is taken to the regulation of broadcasting across all of the markets in which we operate 
for example  throughout most of our western european markets  broadcasting regulation has been formally harmonized to a substantial degree under the regulatory structure of the european union 
typically  broadcasting regulation in each of the countries in which we operate requires that domestic broadcasters and platform providers secure broadcasting licenses from the domestic broadcasting authority 
additionally  many nations have broadcasting legislation and regulations  which set minimum standards regarding program content  and scheduling of television advertisements 
some provide that a certain portion of programming carried by broadcasters be produced domestically and  to some degree  be sourced from domestic production companies which are independent of the broadcaster 
local pay television distributors in foreign countries typically have a statutory duty to ensure that the programming and advertising that they re transmit on behalf of foreign broadcasters conforms to the regulatory scheme under which each local platform provider is licensed 
our contracts with many of our local platform providers require that our programming comply with domestic broadcasting regulations 
generally  each of our pay television distributors and thus our programming carried on their systems must adhere to the broadcasting and advertising regulations of each platform provider s licensing jurisdiction 
within the united states  program access rules applicable to channel providers with ownership ties to pay television distributors limit business combinations between these two types of companies that do not comply with these rules 
financial information about geographic areas information concerning revenue and long lived assets attributable to external customers  domestically and internationally  may be found in note of our notes to consolidated financial statements in this report 
risk factors if we do not successfully address the risks described below  our business  prospects  financial condition  results of operations or cash flow could be materially adversely affected 
the trading price of our class a common stock could decline because of any of these risks 
risks relating to our business our business has incurred net losses since inception and may continue to incur losses 
both our international and domestic channels have a history of net losses and we expect to continue to report net losses for the foreseeable future 
as of december   we had an accumulated deficit of approximately million  net goodwill of approximately million  and film assets of million 
we cannot assure you that we will achieve or sustain profitability 
if we are not able to achieve or sustain profitability  the trading price of our class a common stock may fall significantly 
to diminish our losses and become profitable  we will need to substantially increase our revenue  particularly advertising and licensing revenue 
this will require  among other things  increasing the distribution of our channels  attracting more viewers to our channels  attracting more advertisers  and increasing our advertising rates 
risks associated with these areas of our business are described below 
in addition  in order to accomplish these goals  the management of crown media holdings continues to believe that it is necessary to increase subscribers and enhance our programming  which results in increased subscriber acquisition fees and higher costs for programming 
over the last three years  these actions have resulted in increased net losses for crown media holdings 

table of contents our substantial indebtedness could adversely affect our financial health  and the restrictions imposed by the terms of our debt instruments may severely limit our ability to plan for or respond to changes in our business 
we have a substantial amount of indebtedness 
as of december   our total debt was million and we had  of cash and cash equivalents 
in addition  subject to the restrictions under our various debt agreements  we may borrow additional amounts under our line of credit with hc crown corp 
hc crown to cover the negative cash flow resulting from our current operations  and incur additional indebtedness from time to time to cover our operating losses  to finance acquisitions or capital expenditures or for other purposes 
our principal sources of funds for the next months will be cash generated from operating activities  borrowings under the hc crown line of credit  and cash generated from the tax sharing agreement with hallmark cards 
for further information on the hc crown line of credit and the tax sharing agreement  see part iii item certain relationships and related transactions hallmark demand notes and line of credit and tax sharing agreement 
as a result of our level of debt and the terms of our debt instruments our vulnerability to adverse general economic conditions is heightened  we will be required to dedicate a portion of our cash flow from operations to repayment of debt  limiting the availability of cash for other purposes  we are and will continue to be limited by financial and other restrictive covenants in our ability to borrow additional funds  consummate asset sales  enter into transactions with affiliates or conduct mergers and acquisitions  our flexibility in planning for  or reacting to  changes in our business and industry will be limited  we are sensitive to fluctuations in interest rates  and our ability to obtain additional financing in the future for working capital  capital expenditures  acquisitions  general corporate purposes or other purposes may be impaired 
our ability to meet our debt and other obligations and to reduce our total debt depends on our future operating performances and on economic  financial  competitive and other factors 
there can be no assurance that our leverage and such restrictions will not materially and adversely affect our ability to finance our future operations or capital needs or to engage in other business activities 
we have increasing interest expense  which may impact our future operations 
high levels of interest expense could have negative effects on our future operations 
interest expense  which is net of interest income and includes amortization of debt issuance costs and interest expense on borrowings under our demand notes  credit facility and private placement  increased million to million for the year ended december   from for the year ended december  interest expense increased million to million for the year ended december   from interest income of  for the year ended december  the increase in interest expense in the past twelve months resulted from an increase in the average borrowings outstanding  due to cash generated from operations being insufficient to cover operating expenses and capital expenditures 
consequently  we were required to make borrowings under our demand notes and credit facility during and and to enter into the private placement in december a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations must be used to pay our interest expense and will not be available for other business purposes 
in addition  we may need to incur additional indebtedness in the future 
we cannot assure you that our business will generate sufficient cash flow or that future financings will be available to provide sufficient proceeds to meet our obligations or to service our total debt 

table of contents our liquidity is dependent on external funds 
we believe that our line of credit with hc crown and our tax sharing agreement  together with cash generated from operations and cash on hand  will be sufficient for our liquidity needs through at least march  however  because we currently operate at a loss and have a negative cash flow  any unanticipated significant expense or any development that hampers our growth in revenue or decreases any of our revenue  would result in the need for additional external funds in order to continue operations 
we have no arrangements for any external financings  whether debt or equity  and are not certain whether any such new external financing would be available on acceptable terms 
any new debt financing would require the cooperation and agreement of existing lenders and preferred securities holders 
modification of any existing agreements with united states distributors could decrease our subscriber fees revenue but  if our distribution is increased  it could also result in higher advertising revenue 
several of the crown media united states existing distribution agreements contain most favored nations clauses 
these clauses typically provide that  in the event crown media united states enters into an agreement with another distributor on more favorable terms  these terms must be offered to the existing distributor  subject to certain exceptions and conditions 
in august  crown media united states entered into a new distribution agreement with directv  inc under which the hallmark channel was repositioned to directv s total choice package and our subscribers increased significantly 
several other distributors  whose agreements contain most favored nations provisions  have indicated an interest in some or all of the directv terms 
crown media united states is currently in discussions with several other of these distributors and has already amended its agreement with one of the distributors to incorporate some of the directtv terms 
for information concerning this amendment to an existing distribution agreement with a large domestic distributor  please see revenue under item below 
any further modification of these existing agreements to adopt the directv terms  or any other new terms  could result in the payment of cash or the issuance of stock by us and will negatively affect subscriber revenue 
if we are unable to obtain programming from third parties  we may be unable to increase our subscriber base 
we compete with other pay television channel providers to acquire programming 
if we fail to continue to obtain programming on reasonable terms for any reason  including as a result of competition  we could be forced to incur additional costs to acquire such programming or look for alternative programming  which may hinder the growth of our subscriber base 
if our programming declines in popularity  our subscriber fees and advertising revenue could fall and the additional revenue we expect as a result of the acquisition of film assets from hallmark entertainment distribution may be lower than we anticipate 
our success depends partly upon unpredictable and volatile factors beyond our control  such as viewer preferences  competing programming and the availability of other entertainment activities 
we may not be able to anticipate and react effectively to shifts in tastes and interests in our markets 
in particular  our ability to react effectively may be limited by our obligation to license programming from hallmark entertainment distribution  which has standards that limit the types of programming that it will provide to us 
our competitors may have more flexible programming arrangements  as well as greater amounts of production  better distribution  and greater capital resources  and may be able to react more quickly to shifts in tastes and interests 
as a result  we may be unable to maintain the commercial success of any of our current programming  or to generate sufficient demand and market acceptance for our new programming 
a shift in viewer preferences in programming or alternative entertainment activities could also reduce the amount of revenue we anticipate receiving from licensing of our film assets and cause a decline in both advertising and subscriber fees revenue 
the decline in revenue could hinder or prevent us from achieving profitability and could adversely affect the market price of our class a common stock 

table of contents we are currently dependent on hallmark entertainment to distribute and maximize licensing fees from the film assets 
currently  we are dependent on hallmark entertainment to distribute and license our film assets to third parties for us under the terms of a three year service agreement  which commenced january  this arrangement reduces our control over the sales and distribution of the film assets and might delay our realization of the full revenue stream from the film assets 
we and hallmark entertainment each have the right to terminate the service agreement after the first year 
if hallmark entertainment elects to terminate the agreement before we have established our own distribution network  we may not be able to establish our own or obtain alternative distribution services of equivalent quality or on terms as favorable to us 
this could hinder our ability  at least in the short term  to achieve the amount of additional revenue anticipated from these activities and could adversely affect the market price of our class a common stock 
we anticipate that in due course we will develop our own distribution sales network and hire employees to perform the services currently performed by hallmark entertainment under the service agreement 
our ability to do so is unproven and will require financial  operational and management resources 
we may not be able to hire the number of employees  or employees who are sufficiently qualified  to perform these services  or do so in a cost efficient manner 
if the cost to develop and maintain this employee base is greater  or if this process takes longer than anticipated  it could have a negative impact on the revenue we anticipate generating from the film assets 
if we are unable to increase our advertising revenue  we may be unable to achieve profitability 
if we fail to increase our advertising revenue  we may be unable to achieve or sustain profitability  or expand our business 
we expect that over time the portion of our revenue derived from the sale of advertising time on our channels will increase 
we have a limited history of marketing and selling advertising time  particularly internationally 
we may be unable to identify  attract and retain experienced sales and marketing personnel with relevant experience for our us channel  and our sales and marketing organization may be unable to successfully compete against the significantly more extensive and well funded sales and marketing operations of our current or potential competitors 
success in increasing our advertising revenue also depends upon the number and coverage of the distributors who carry our channels  our number of subscribers  and the viewership ratings for our programming 
in addition  if we fail to improve our ratings  we will not be able to increase our advertising sales rate card or may be required to run additional advertising spots which detract from our available advertising inventory for future sales 
the international cable advertising market is much less developed than in the united states  the united kingdom and central europe 
we believe that only certain international markets have the potential for growth in advertising revenues and intend to emphasize those markets 
most of our international advertising revenue is derived from operations in the united kingdom  poland and south africa 
hallmark entertainment investments controls us and this control could create conflicts of interest or inhibit potential changes of control 
hallmark entertainment investments controls all of our outstanding shares of class b common stock and owns shares of class a common stock  representing approximately of the voting power on all matters submitted to our stockholders 
hallmark entertainment investments control could discourage others from initiating potential merger  takeover or other change of control transactions that may otherwise be beneficial to our business or holders of class a common stock 
as a result  the market price of our class a common stock could suffer  and our business could suffer 
hallmark entertainment investments control relationship with us also could give rise to conflicts of interest  including conflicts between hallmark entertainment investments  as our controlling stockholder  and our other stockholders  whose interests may differ with respect to  among other things  our strategic direction or significant corporate transactions  
table of contents conflicts related to corporate opportunities that could be pursued by us  on the one hand  or by hallmark entertainment investments or its other affiliates  on the other hand  or conflicts related to existing or new contractual relationships between us  on the one hand  and hallmark entertainment investments and its affiliates  on the other hand 
in addition  persons serving as directors  officers or employees of both hallmark entertainment investments and us may have conflicting duties to each 
for example  robert a 
halmi  jr 
is chairman of our board and is a director and the chairman of hallmark entertainment investments and the president and chief executive officer of hallmark entertainment  which could create potential conflicts of interest 
as a result  it is possible that we may receive less favorable contractual terms from hallmark entertainment investments and its affiliates than if none of our officers or directors had any affiliation with hallmark entertainment investments 
we could lose the right to use the name hallmark because we have limited duration trademark license agreements  which could harm our business 
we license the name hallmark from hallmark cards and hallmark licensing  inc  for various uses  including in the name of our international and domestic channels 
the license agreement for our international channel permits the use of the hallmark trademarks outside the united states and canada through november   so long as hallmark cards and its wholly owned subsidiaries collectively own at least of our voting interest and at least of our equity interest and designate a majority of our board of directors  and so long as there is no event of default under the agreement 
the license agreement for our domestic channel permits the use of the hallmark trademarks in the united states through november   under terms substantially similar to the terms applicable to the license of our international channel 
if hallmark cards determines not to renew the trademark license agreements for any reason  including our failure to meet minimum programming thresholds dependent on programming provided by affiliates of hallmark cards or to comply with hallmark cards programming standards  we would be forced to significantly revise our business plan and operations  and could experience a significant erosion of our subscriber base and advertising revenue  particularly in the united states 
if our third party suppliers fail to provide us with network infrastructure services on a timely basis  our costs could increase and our growth could be hindered 
we currently rely on third parties to supply key network infrastructure services  including uplink  playback  transmission and satellite services to certain of our markets  which are available only from limited sources 
we have occasionally experienced delays and other problems in receiving communications equipment  services and facilities and may  in the future  be unable to obtain such services  equipment or facilities on the scale and within the time frames required by us on terms we find acceptable  or at all 
if we are unable to obtain  or if we experience a delay in the delivery of  such services  we may be forced to incur significant unanticipated expenses to secure alternative third party suppliers or adjust our operations  which could hinder our growth and reduce our revenue and profitability 
if our network operations center fails or its operations are disrupted  our costs could increase and our growth could be hindered 
we commenced operations at the network operations center in february we are currently using the network operations center for the origination and playback of signals for the hallmark channel internationally in europe and the middle east and will  in  also use the facility for origination and playback of our domestic and asian feeds 
like other single point facilities  the network operations center is subject to interruption from fire  tornadoes  lightning and other unexpected natural causes 
although we have redundant systems in place  equipment failure  employee misconduct or outside interference could also disrupt the network operations center s services 
we currently do not have and are not planning a duplicate operations facility 
any significant interruption at the network operations center affecting the distribution of our channels could have an adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition 

table of contents if our local distribution partner for the latin american region fails to perform  our operations could be disrupted and our business harmed 
in the first quarter of  we are moving the majority of our operations concerning the distribution of the hallmark channel in mexico  central and south america to a local distribution partner in argentina  pramer 
one purpose of the action is to substantially reduce our expenses for operations in this region 
if pramer is unable to adequately perform the functions of selling our channel to local operators  to gain sufficient advertising sales and to appropriately market the channel  we may not improve our performance in the region and our business in the region could be detrimentally affected 
in addition  pramer will perform locally the origination and playback services currently performed under our control in the network operations center for our feeds to latin america  although all but one of these the feeds will be sent by pramer back to denver for uplink and distribution to affiliates over our satellite capacity on pas any significant interruption of pramer s services  which affects the latin american feeds of our channel  could have an adverse effect on the results of our business in the region 
if we are unable to retain key executives and other personnel  our growth could be inhibited and our business harmed 
our success depends on the expertise and continued service of our executive officers and key employees of our subsidiaries 
if we fail to attract  hire or retain the necessary personnel  or if we lose the services of our key executives  we may be unable to implement our business plan or keep pace with developing trends in our industry 
we are subject to the risks of doing business outside the united states 
historically  a significant portion of our revenue has been generated from foreign operations 
in order to maintain or expand our presence in foreign markets  we have entered and may in the future enter into joint ventures or other strategic relationships with local operators in those markets 
certain foreign laws  regulations and judicial procedures may not be as protective of programmer rights as those applicable in the united states 
in addition  many foreign countries have currency and exchange laws regulating the international transfer of currencies 
to the extent that significant currency fluctuations result in materially higher costs to any of our foreign customers  those customers may be unable or unwilling to make the required payments 
we may be subject to delays in access to courts and to the remedies local laws impose in order to collect our payments and recover our assets 
we also may experience problems with collecting accounts due from foreign customers  which would adversely affect our revenue and income 
our growth and profitability may also suffer as a result of  among other matters  competitive pressures on video delivery  labor stoppages  recessions and other political or economic events adversely affecting world or regional trading markets or affecting a particular customer 
the united states foreign relations and the war with iraq also can affect our revenue from foreign operations 
distributors in the middle east and possibly those outside of that region may delay payments or attempt to use economic uncertainties as a reason to delay or halt payments to us for our channel 
our current and future operations in emerging markets may be harmed by the increased political and economic risks associated with these markets 
we currently broadcast in several foreign markets where market economies have only recently begun to develop  and we may expand these operations in the future 
if the governments in these markets adopt more restrictive economic policies  we may not be able to continue operating  or to implement our expansion plans  in those markets 
more generally  we are exposed to certain risks  many of which are beyond our control  inherent in operating in emerging market countries 
these risks include changes in laws and policies affecting trade  investment and taxes including laws and policies relating to the repatriation of funds and to withholding taxes  differing degrees of protection for intellectual property and the instability of emerging market economies  currencies  and governments 

table of contents the amount of our goodwill  as well as our film costs  may hinder our ability to achieve profitability 
as a result of our acquisitions of all the common interests in crown media united states and h h programming asia  we have generated a significant amount of goodwill 
we have amortized the goodwill from these acquisitions on a straight line basis over years and years  respectively 
the amount of goodwill that we amortized was treated as a charge against earnings under accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
in accordance with recent accounting pronouncements  we have ceased as of january   the amortization of this acquired goodwill  and we are required to periodically review whether the value of our goodwill has been impaired 
if we are required to write down our goodwill  our results of operations  stockholders equity or profitability could be materially adversely affected 
commencing with the fourth quarter of  we also have a film cost relating to the amortization of the purchase price for the film assets that we use and license to others 
this film cost is  and will continue to be  a significant component of our cost of services each quarter 
our stock price may be volatile and could decline substantially 
the stock market has  from time to time  experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations 
many factors may cause the market price for our class a common stock to decline  including our operating results failing to meet the expectations of securities analysts or investors in any quarter  downward revisions in securities analysts estimates  material announcements by us or our competitors  governmental regulatory action  technological innovations by competitors or competing technologies  investor perceptions of our industry or prospects  or those of our customers  and changes in general market conditions or economic trends 
in the past  companies that have experienced volatility in the market price of their securities have been the subject of securities class action litigation 
if we become involved in a securities class action litigation in the future  it could result in substantial costs and diversion of management attention and resources  harming our business 
shares eligible for public sale in the future could adversely affect our stock price 
the market price of our class a common stock could decline as a result of sales by our larger  existing stockholders in the future or the perception that these sales could occur 
these sales also might make it difficult for us to sell equity securities in the future at a time and price that we deem appropriate 
in addition  some of our existing stockholders who hold restricted stock have the ability to require us to register their shares for public sale 
similarly  holders of contingent appreciation certificates issued in connection with preferred securities of crown media trust  have the ability to require us to register for public sale shares of our class a common stock that these holders receive upon exercise of the contingent appreciation certificates 
risks relating to our industry competition could reduce our channel revenue and our ability to achieve profitability 
we operate in the pay television business  which is highly competitive 
if we are unable to compete effectively with large diversified entertainment companies that have substantially greater resources than we have  our operating margins and market share could be reduced  and the growth of our business inhibited 
in particular  we compete for distribution with other pay television channels and  when distribution is obtained  for viewers and advertisers with pay television channels  broadcast television networks  radio  the internet and other media 
we also compete  to varying degrees  with other leisure time activities such as movie theaters  
table of contents the internet  radio  print media  personal computers and other alternative sources of entertainment and information 
future technological developments may affect competition within this business 
a continuing trend towards business combinations and alliances in both the domestic and foreign communications industries may create significant new competitors for us or intensify existing competition 
many of these combined entities have more than one channel and resources far greater than ours 
these combined entities may provide bundled packages of programming  delivery and other services that compete directly with the products we offer 
these entities may also offer services sooner and at more competitive rates than we do 
in addition  these alliances may benefit from both localized content and the local political climate 
we may need to reduce our prices or license additional programming to remain competitive  and we may be unable to sustain future pricing levels as competition increases 
our failure to achieve or sustain market acceptance of our programming at desired pricing levels could impair our ability to achieve profitability or positive cash flow  which would harm our business 
distributors in the united states may attempt to increasingly pressure smaller pay tv channels in terms of viewership  such as our domestic hallmark channel  to accept decreasing amounts for subscriber fees  to pay higher subscriber acquisition fees or to allow carriage of the channel without the payment of subscriber fees 
factors that may lead to this pressure include the number of competing pay tv channels  the limited space available on services of distributors in the united states and the desire of distributors to maintain or reduce costs 
any reduction in subscriber fees revenue now or in the future could have a material impact on our ability to achieve profitability and cash flow 
new distribution technologies may fundamentally change the way we distribute our channels and could significantly decrease our revenue or require us to incur significant capital expenditures 
our future success will depend  in part  on our ability to anticipate and adapt to technological changes and to offer  on a timely basis  services that meet customer demands and evolving industry standards 
the pay television industry has been  and is likely to continue to be  subject to rapid and significant technological change  including continuing developments in technology which do not presently have widely accepted standards  and frequent introductions of new services and alternative technologies  including new technologies for providing video services 
for example  the advent of digital technology is likely to accelerate the convergence of broadcast  telecommunications  internet and other media and could result in material changes in the economics  regulations  intellectual property usage and technical platforms on which our business relies  including lower retail rates for video services 
these changes could fundamentally affect the scale  source  and volatility of our revenue streams  cost structures  and profitability  and may require us to significantly change our operations 
we also rely in part on third parties for the development of  and access to  communications and network technology 
as a result  we may be unable to obtain access to new technology on a timely basis or on satisfactory terms  which could harm our business and prospects 
moreover  the increased capacity of digital distribution platforms  including the introduction of digital terrestrial television  may reduce the competition for the right to carry channels and allow development of extra services at low incremental cost 
these lower incremental costs could lower barriers to entry for competing channels  and place pressure on our operating margins and market position 
in addition  a greater number of channels would likely increase competition among channels for viewers and advertisers  which could affect our ability to attract advertising and new distribution at desired pricing levels  and could therefore hinder or prevent the growth of our subscriber base 
if we fail to comply with applicable government regulations  our business could be harmed 
if  as a provider of television channels  we fail to comply with applicable present or future government regulations in any markets in which we operate  we could be prohibited from operating in those markets and 
table of contents could be subject to monetary fines  either of which would increase our operating costs  reduce our revenue and limit our ability to achieve profitability 
the scope of regulation to which we are subject varies from country to country  although in many significant respects a similar approach is taken to the regulation of broadcasting across all of the markets in which we operate 
typically  broadcasting regulation in each of the countries in which we operate requires that domestic broadcasters and platform providers secure broadcasting licenses from the domestic broadcasting authority 
additionally  most nations have broadcasting legislation and regulations  which set minimum standards regarding program content  and prescribe minimum standards for the content and scheduling of television advertisements 
some countries require that a certain portion of programming carried by broadcasters be produced domestically 
moreover  broadcasting regulations are generally subject to periodic and on going governmental review and legislative initiatives  which may  in the future  affect the nature of programming we are able to offer and the means by which it is distributed 
the timing  scope or outcome of these reviews could be unfavorable to us  and any changes to current broadcasting legislation or regulations could require adjustments to our operations 
we will make available free of charge through our website  www

subscriber fees are generally payable to us on a per subscriber basis by pay television distributors for the right to carry our channels 
subscriber fee revenue is recorded net of subscriber acquisition fee expense amortized over the life of the agreement 
in the united states  we pay certain television distributors up front subscriber acquisition fees to carry our channel 
however  such payments are not common in the international cable television markets 
subscriber acquisition fees paid are capitalized and amortized over the term of the applicable distribution agreement 
if the amortization expense exceeds the revenue recognized on a per distributor basis  the excess amortization is included as a component of cost of services 
at the time we sign a distribution agreement  and periodically thereafter  we evaluate the recoverability of the costs we incur against the revenue directly associated with each agreement 

table of contents subscriber fees vary according to the level of sophistication and degree of competition in the market  the relative position in the market of the distributor and the popularity of the channel  the packaging arrangements for the channel  and other commercial terms such as granting the distributor exclusivity to carry our channel only in territories outside the us and length of term of the contract 
in some circumstances  international distributors provide minimum revenue guarantees 
we are in continuous negotiations both with our existing distributors and new distributors to increase our subscriber base 
in the united states  we are often subject to requests by distributors to pay subscriber acquisition fees for these additional subscribers or to waive or accept lower subscriber fees if certain numbers of additional subscribers are provided 
in both domestic and international markets we also may help fund the distributors efforts to market our channels or we may permit distributors to offer limited promotional periods without payment of subscriber fees 
as we continue our efforts to add subscribers  our subscriber revenue will continue to be negatively affected by these subscriber acquisition fees  discounted subscriber fees and other payments  however  we believe that the resulting increase in subscribers will allow us to attract additional advertisers and command higher advertising rates 
several of crown media united states existing distribution agreements contain most favored nations clauses 
these clauses typically provide that  in the event crown media united states enters into an agreement with another distributor on more favorable terms  these terms must be offered to the existing distributor  subject to certain exceptions and conditions 
in august  crown media united states entered into a new distribution agreement with directv under which the hallmark channel was repositioned to directv s total choice package and our subscribers increased significantly 
several other distributors  whose agreements contain most favored nations provisions  have indicated an interest in some or all of the directv terms 
crown media united states is currently in discussions with several of these distributors and has amended its agreement with one of the distributors to settle the most favored nations provisions 
any further modification of these existing agreements to adopt the directv terms  or any other new terms  could result in the payment of cash or the issuance of stock by crown media holdings and will negatively affect subscriber revenue and increase operating expenses 
on november   we entered into an amendment of a distribution agreement with a large distributor in the united states 
the amendment extends the distribution agreement for two years to december   and provides for the payment of a substantial cash amount in settlement of the most favored nation clauses in regard to the directv terms and significantly increases the distributor s commitment to add full time subscribers to our channel 
we paid a portion of the amount upon execution and will make monthly cash payments through december   for the balance 
we are also required to pay a substantial market support payment  based on subscribers exceeding a final commitment number  through december  in addition  if the final commitment level of subscribers is achieved by the distributor  subscriber fees will not apply to subscribers above a specified number 
the amendment also contains a most favored nation provision relating to other distribution agreements 
a portion of the consideration given  totaling million  relating to new full time subscribers and term extension has been recorded as subscriber acquisition fees that are amortized over the remaining life of the distribution agreement 
the marketing support payments under the amendment will be marketing expenses when incurred 
the remaining portion of the consideration totaling million is related to the settlement of the most favored nation clause and has been expensed as a component of subscriber acquisition fee expense 
advertising sales generally are made on the basis of a price per advertising spot or per unit of audience measurement for example  a ratings point 
prices vary on a market by market basis 
rates differ among markets depending on audience demographics 
in markets where regular audience measurements are available  our advertising rates are calculated on the basis of an agreed upon price per unit of audience measurement in return for a guaranteed investment level 
table of contents by the advertiser 
in these countries  we commit to provide advertisers certain rating levels in connection with their advertising 
revenue is recorded net of estimated shortfalls  which are usually settled by providing the advertiser additional advertising time 
in other markets  our advertising rates are calculated on the basis of cost per advertising spot or package of advertising spots  and the price varies by audience level expected but not measured during a particular time slot 
this is the predominant arrangement in the countries outside the united states in which we sell advertising time 
advertising rates also vary by time of year based on seasonal changes in television viewership 
crown media distribution generates revenue from the film assets by granting licenses to exhibit the films to third parties 
hallmark entertainment provides services to us to assist in the administration  distribution and other exploitation of the film assets 
we are also using the films as programming for our television channels 
cost of services our cost of services consists primarily of program license fees  amortization of our film assets  subscriber acquisition fee expense  the cost of signal distribution  dubbing and subtitling  and the cost of promotional segments that are aired between programs 
we expect cost of services to continue to increase in the future as we expand our existing markets and third party programming to support our advertising strategy 
in connection with our purchase of film assets from hallmark entertainment distribution  we have signed a service agreement with hallmark entertainment 
under the service agreement  hallmark entertainment is providing services to us to assist in the administration  distribution and other exploitation of the film assets  and we pay hallmark entertainment approximately million per year for the three year term of the agreement ending on december  discussion of critical accounting policies our financial statements are presented on the basis that crown media holdings is a going concern 
our accounting policies are also determined on this basis 
in the ordinary course of business  our management has made a number of judgments  estimates and assumptions relating to the reporting of results of operations and financial condition in the preparation of our financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
actual results could differ significantly from those estimates under different assumptions and conditions 
the following discussion addresses certain accounting policies involving significant judgments  estimates  or assumptions 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue when an agreement is executed  services are provided  price is determinable  and collectibility is reasonably assured 
management makes certain judgments concerning collectibility 
in foreign markets  the company evaluates collectibility on a customer by customer basis 
prior to any revenue recognition in foreign markets from a new customer  the company must generally receive cash payment for the initial services provided 
once a payment is received  the company reevaluates the customer s financial condition  and  if continued collectibility remains reasonably assured  revenue recognition under normal terms occurs prospectively 
program license fees paid by us program rights acquired by us are deferred and amortized on a straight line basis over their license periods the airing windows or anticipated usage  whichever is shorter 
at the inception of these contracts and periodically thereafter  we evaluate the recoverability of these costs versus the revenue directly associated with the programming and related expenses 
this evaluation is based upon factors such as ratings  changes in programming content  and consumer demand 
where an evaluation indicates that a programming contract will ultimately result in a loss  additional expense is recorded 

table of contents film assets in the case of sales to third parties  we amortize our film assets using the individual film forecast computation method  which amortizes such assets in the same ratio that current period actual revenue to estimated unrecognized ultimate revenues as of the beginning of the current fiscal year 
for anticipated internal use of the film assets  we amortize our film assets using a year estimated useful life 
our projections regarding sales to third parties and anticipated internal use are based on the history of each film and similar films  sales and marketing plans  and other factors  all of which require significant judgment by management 
the year period used for sales to third parties and internal use commences on the date of acquisition and is the same time period used by an initial  external valuation of our film assets at the time of acquisition 
we also review the film assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of any such asset may not be recoverable 
if the carrying value of the individual film assets exceeds the fair value  the film assets are written down to their fair values 
at least annually  we are required by the covenants in our credit facility to have a valuation expert perform a valuation of the film assets property and equipment property and equipment is recorded at cost and is depreciated on a straight line basis over the estimated useful lives of such assets 
changes in circumstances such as technological advances  changes to our business model or changes in our capital strategy can result in an impairment or a change in the estimated useful lives 
in those cases where we determine that the useful life of property and equipment should be shortened  we depreciate the net book value in excess of the salvage value  over its revised remaining useful life thereby increasing depreciation expense 
factors such as changes in the planned use of equipment or facilities could also result in shortened useful lives 
subscriber acquisition fees subscriber acquisition fees are paid by us to increase the carriage of the hallmark channel on cable television and satellite systems and ultimately to enhance ratings and advertising rates 
subscriber acquisition fees are amortized over the life of the distribution agreements and such amortization is a reduction of subscriber fees revenue 
if the amortization expense exceeds the revenue recognized on a per distributor basis  the excess amortization is included as a component of the cost of services 
the company assesses the recoverability of these costs periodically  and when changes in distributor relationships or other indicators indicate a potential impairment 
private placement in december  crown media holdings completed a million private placement by issuing trust preferred securities with contingent appreciation certificates 
we recorded the trust preferred securities as guaranteed preferred beneficial interest in our debentures held by crown media trust  while the contingent appreciation certificates are recorded as convertible debt 
the agreement also included embedded derivatives  which are marked to fair value through income expense over the term of the agreement or until settlement  if earlier 
a fair value allocation was performed by the company to record the trust preferred securities  the debt and the derivative 
this calculation is discussed in note to notes of consolidated financial statements in this report 
the embedded derivatives are valued using a black scholes option pricing model 
this model requires estimation of the expected volatility of our common stock and a risk free rate of return 
the interest component of the private placement is also being allocated between interest expense and guaranteed preferred beneficial accretion in the consolidated statements of operations to correspond to the allocation of the components on the consolidated balance sheets 
on or after december   crown media holdings will have the right to redeem any and all of the outstanding debentures at a redemption price equal to of the aggregate principal amount of the debentures  together with any accrued and unpaid interest thereon 
since their issuance and through september   the company expected to redeem the debentures during in light of the decline in 
table of contents the market price of the company s class a common stock  which affects the desirability of offering stock in the future to redeem the preferred securities  management determined that the company will not make an optional early redemption of its trust preferred securities  but will wait until their final redemption date in december consequently  under the applicable terms of the preferred securities and related contingent appreciation certificates  the cumulative interest rate is expected to be  an increase of from the cumulative rate  which would have been payable if the securities were redeemed at the previously anticipated date of december the change in the interest rate from to has and will continue to result in higher interest expense and guaranteed preferred beneficial accretion that has and will continue to negatively impact the company s results of operations for all future periods until these securities are redeemed 
the required quarterly cash payments on the preferred securities remain unchanged  although the final redemption amount will be higher 
goodwill as a result of our acquisitions of all the common interests in crown media united states and h h programming asia  we have recorded a significant amount of goodwill 
in accordance with accounting pronouncements  we ceased the amortization of goodwill as of january   and we are required to periodically review whether the value of our goodwill has been impaired 
if we are required to write off our goodwill  the results of operations  stockholders equity or profitability could be materially adversely affected 
see goodwill in note to notes of consolidated financial statements in this report 
we completed a valuation of crown media united states and h h programming asia to assist us in our annual analysis of impairment of goodwill 
based on the results of this valuation as of november   our goodwill was not impaired 
valuation of goodwill requires management estimation of projected discounted cash flows 
changes to projected cash flows or the discount rate could lead to the determination that our goodwill is impaired

b we executed in early november an amendment to a distribution agreement with one of our domestic distributors 
this agreement and any other amendments to current domestic distribution agreements will significantly increase subscriber acquisition fees payable 
c can only be paid subsequent to repayment of credit facility per agreement 
d currently  the company expects to redeem the preferred securities at their maturity in our financial position and operations changed significantly during substantial revenue producing assets were acquired through the issuance of debt and stock with funds available under our credit facility 
in august  we issued million of common stock for additional carriage on a us pay television distributor 
in september  we acquired approximately films for million in common stock and assumption of million of debt 
the expectation is that these additional assets will provide revenue for the foreseeable future 
these acquisitions and our continuing use of cash in operations required several financing transactions during in september  we established a bank credit facility of million  which was subsequently increased in december  to million 
in december  we also issued preferred securities in a private placement transaction for million 
during we did not enter into any additional financings  but did borrow million on the remainder of our credit facility and were advanced million under our line of credit with hc crown 
in connection with our growth strategy  we expect that we will continue to make significant investments in programming and distribution 
programming expenditures for are expected to be in the range of million to million  and cash payments for subscriber acquisition fees in are expected to be million to million 
we also expect that the reorganization announced in october will reduce operating costs by million annually 
our principal uses of funds during the next months are expected to be the payment of operating expenses including but not limited to licensing programming from third parties and subscriber acquisition fees and debt service payments of million to million 

table of contents our principal sources of funds are currently continuing cash inflows from operations after expenditures for programming and subscriber acquisition fees  cash on hand  available borrowings under the million hc crown line of credit  and periodic cash inflows expected under the new tax sharing agreement described below 
on december   we had an available cash balance of  and million available under the hc crown line of credit 
we have been borrowing under the line of credit with hc crown in and in order to support the cash needs of our operations 
we expect that the tax sharing agreement with hallmark cards will result in receiving a minimum of million to million in cash during taking into account our projected revenues and expenditures  we believe that cash inflows from operations  cash on hand  the hc crown line of credit and periodic payments received under the tax sharing agreement will be sufficient for our liquidity needs through at least march  we project that advertising revenue and subscriber revenue will increase in  and that certain operating expenses will decrease due to the reorganization in the fourth quarter of any decline in the popularity of the hallmark channel  future modifications to our distribution agreements  a decline in the advertising market  unexpected increased competition or other adverse operating conditions could impact our ability to achieve our projected operating results 
if projected operating results are not achieved  we would need to obtain additional funding 
in that event  we would consider pursuing alternatives to raise additional cash  which could include the issuance of additional equity or debt securities 
there can be no assurance  however  that additional funding will be available  if at all  on terms acceptable to us 
any new debt financing would require the agreement of existing lenders and preferred securities holders 
cash flow risks our dependence on operating cash flow  in addition to other cash resources  means that risks involved in our businesses can significantly affect our liquidity 
we expect subscriber revenue and advertising revenue will increase in in addition  we expect our reorganization in the fourth quarter of will result in decreases in certain operating expenses 
any unexpected decrease in projected subscriber revenue or advertising revenue  or unanticipated expenses could result in the need to raise additional cash externally 
we have no arrangements for any additional external financings of debt or equity  and we are not certain whether any such financing would be available on acceptable terms or whether it would be permitted under our credit facility and preferred securities

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we do not use derivative financial instruments in our investment portfolio 
we only invest in instruments that meet high credit and quality standards  as specified in our investment policy guidelines 
these instruments  like all fixed income instruments  are subject to interest rate risk 
the fixed income portfolio will fall in value if there is an increase in interest rates 
if market interest rates were to increase immediately and uniformly by from levels as of december   the decline of the fair value of the fixed income portfolio would not be material 
as of december   our cash  restricted cash  cash equivalents and short term investments had a fair value of  which was invested in cash and short term commercial paper 
the primary purpose of these investing activities has been to preserve principal until the cash is required to fund operations 
consequently  the size of this portfolio fluctuates significantly as cash is raised and used in our business 
the value of certain investments in this portfolio can be impacted by the risk of adverse changes in securities and economic markets and interest rate fluctuations 
at december   all of our investments in this category were in fixed rate instruments or money market type accounts 
a decrease in interest rates has the effect of reducing our future annual interest income from this portfolio  since funds would be reinvested at lower rates as the instruments mature 
over time  any net percentage decrease in our interest rates could be reflected in a corresponding net percentage decrease in our interest income 
for the year ended december   the impact of interest rate fluctuations  changed business prospects and all other factors did not have a material impact on the fair value of this portfolio  or on our income derived from this portfolio 
we have not used derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes 
as of december   we are not hedged or otherwise protected against risks associated with any of our investing or financing activities 
as of december   we estimated the fair value of borrowings under our bank credit facility  excluding accrued interest  to be approximately million and the fair value of borrowings under our line of credit with hc crown  excluding interest  to be approximately million 
because the interest rates on these facilities are variable and are reset periodically  the fair value of our debt is affected by fluctuations in interest rates 
a hypothetical increase or decrease in assumed interest rates would decrease or increase the fair value of our debt by approximately million 
these calculations include the assumption that the balance of our outstanding debt as of december   would not change during the year and that a yearly interest rate was used 
to the extent interest rates increase  our costs of financing will also increase because of 
table of contents variable rates applicable to our outstanding debt 
a hypothetical increase in assumed interest rates of would have resulted in additional interest expense of million during the year ended december  as of december   we estimated the value of our preferred securities to be approximately million and the value of our derivative liability to be  using quoted market prices where available  or discounted cash flow analyses 
the value of our derivative liability is affected by fluctuations in our stock price and interest rates 
a hypothetical increase in our stock price would increase the value of our derivative liability by approximately  a hypothetical decrease in our stock price would decrease the value of our derivative liability by approximately  a hypothetical increase in the interest rate would decrease the value of our derivative liability by approximately  a hypothetical decrease in the interest rate would decrease the value of our derivative liability by approximately  these calculations include the assumption that the balance of our derivative liability as of december   would not change during the year and that a yearly interest rate was used 
we are exposed to market risk 
we are exposed to market risk  including changes to interest rates  foreign currency exchange rates and equity investment prices 
to reduce the volatility relating to these exposures  we may enter into various derivative investment transactions in the near term pursuant to our investment and risk management policies and procedures in areas such as hedging and counterparty exposure practices 
we did not and will not use derivatives for speculative purposes 
though we intend to use risk management control policies  there will be inherent risks that may only be partially offset by our hedging programs should there be any unfavorable movements in interest rates  foreign currency exchange rates or equity investment prices 
the estimated exposure discussed below is intended to measure the maximum amount we could lose from adverse market movements in interest rates  foreign currency exchange rates and equity investment prices  given a specified confidence level  over a given period of time 
loss is defined in the value at risk estimation as fair market value loss 
our interest income and expense is subject to fluctuations in interest rates and the price of our class a common stock 
our material interest bearing assets consisted of cash equivalents  restricted cash  and short term investments 
the balance of our interest bearing assets was  or less than of total assets  as of december  our material liabilities subject to interest rate risk consisted of a capital lease obligation  our bank credit facility  and our private placement 
the balance of those liabilities was million  or of total liabilities  as of december  the balance of our guaranteed preferred beneficial interest in crown media trust s debentures was million 
net interest expense for the year ended december   was million  or  of our total revenue 
our guaranteed preferred beneficial accretion for the year ended december   was million  or  of our total revenue 
our net interest expense and preferred beneficial interest expense is sensitive to changes in the general level of interest rates  primarily us interest rates  and the volatility of our class a common stock to the extent this volatility impacts the value of the derivative liability in our preferred securities 
in this regard  changes in us interest rates affect the interest bearing assets and our borrowings as do changes in the price of our class a common stock 
we are exposed to risks relating to foreign currency exchange rates and foreign economic conditions 
we evaluate our foreign currency exposure on a net basis 
we receive subscriber fees and advertising revenue from countries throughout the world 
increasingly  however  these are being offset by expenses arising from our foreign facilities as well as non us dollar expenses 
generally  payments required under our agreements are denominated in us dollars and  therefore  unaffected by foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations 
we have some exposure to changes in exchange rates in latin america  europe  asia  and africa 
however  our exposure to foreign exchange rates primarily exists with the british pound 
when the us dollar strengthens against the currencies in these countries  the us dollar value of us dollar 
table of contents based revenue decreases  when the us dollar weakens  the us dollar value of non us dollar based revenue increases 
accordingly  changes in exchange rates  and in particular  a strengthening of the us dollar  may adversely affect our revenue as expressed in us dollars
