item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations dollars in thousands  except share data  rental rates and capital expenditures per unit the following discussion is based primarily on the consolidated financial statements of amli residential properties trust the company or amli as of december  and and for the years ended december   and this information should be read in conjunction with the accompanying consolidated financial statements and notes thereto 
as of december   the company owned an approximate general partnership interest in amli residential properties  lp the operating partnership  which holds the operating assets of the company 
the limited partners hold operating partnership units op units that are convertible into common shares of the company on a one for one basis  subject to certain limitations 
during and  the company repurchased  of its common shares at an average price of per share with the operating partnership acquiring concurrently the same number of op units from the company 
at december   the company owned  op units including  preferred op units and the limited partners owned  op units 
the company has qualified  and anticipates continuing to qualify  as a real estate investment trust reit for federal income tax purposes 
at december   the company owned  or owned interests in   apartment homes in stabilized communities and an additional  apartment homes in communities under development or in lease up 
amli management company amc and amli institutional advisors  inc aia are each a service company subsidiary collectively the service companies  which provide property management  construction  and institutional advisory services for the company and its co investment partnerships 
these service companies elected taxable reit subsidiary trs status for irs reporting purposes as of january  amli residential construction  llc amrescon is a wholly owned subsidiary of amc and has also elected to be a trs 
through december   the company owned of the voting control and of the economic benefit of unconsolidated subsidiaries 
as of december   the company acquired from amli realty co 
arc  a wholly owned subsidiary of uici nyse uci  arc s voting control and approximate economic interest in the service companies  together with exclusive rights to the amli servicemark  for a purchase price of as a result of this transaction  the accounts of the subsidiaries were consolidated in the company s consolidated balance sheet at december  however  the subsidiaries results of operations have been reflected on the company s consolidated statements of operations using the equity method of accounting  but will be consolidated prospectively as of january  during  the company was limited in its ability to raise rents and increase occupancies at many of its communities because of relative weak demand in most of its markets 
the company continues to be exposed to potentially decreasing levels of rental income as a result of future declines in occupancy  increased levels of rent concessions  lower net effective rents  and possible higher delinquencies 
additional factors potentially contributing to future declines in community revenue include slow to negative new job creation  the overall condition of local economies  pockets of overbuilding  and loss of residents to home ownership made more affordable by the current low interest rate environment 
in general  operating expenses are continuing to increase  adding to the negative impact on net operating income from reduced revenue 
the september  attack on the world trade center has had  among other things  the effect of increasing the cost of insurance 
the company anticipates that its insurance costs for will increase by approximately  even with increased deductibles 
at least one state in which the company operates is considering changes in state tax law which may result in the imposition of additional annual taxes on the company 
it is not currently possible to determine the potential impact of such change in the tax law 
in response to a nationwide economic slowdown  the company has slowed or curtailed its development of new apartment communities  and has acquired fewer additional communities than in prior years in anticipation of better acquisition pricing 
although the company has recently moved to reduce its construction and development overhead  the reduced number of new developments may not be sufficient in future years to support this reduced level of overhead 
the company believes that the operating prospects for the existing development communities remain acceptable based upon current economic and other conditions existing in the areas in which the company s development activities are focused 
there are uncertainties and risks with any development project 
while the company has prepared development budgets and has estimated completion and stabilization target dates for each of the development communities based upon what it believes are reasonable assumptions  there can be no assurance that actual costs will not exceed current budgets or that the company will not experience construction delays due to the unavailability of building materials  weather conditions or other events beyond the company s control 
similarly  adverse market conditions at the time that the development communities become available for leasing could affect the rental rates that may be charged and the period necessary to achieve stabilization at the development communities 
the company is expecting to incur in increased general and administrative expenses during as it complies with various new legislation dealing with corporate governance 
such expenses include those associated with formalizing an internal audit function 
critical accounting areas accounting for investments in and transactions with unconsolidated partnerships the company does not control the partnerships in which it co invests the company shares decision making authority over all major decisions with various co investment partners  therefore  the company s investments in these partnerships are appropriately accounted for using the equity method of accounting 
as a result  more than half of the company s assets and related debt and all of the company s co investment partners equity is reported off balance sheet 
the condensed combined financial information for the company and its co investment partnerships at and for the year ended december   as shown below  is presented as supplementary information intended to provide a better understanding of the company s financial position 
the information presented in the following table includes the unconsolidated co investment partnerships at 
company effect of and co consol combining investment idated co invest partner company ment part ships gaap nerships combined rental communities    accumulated depreciation    land and rental communities under development    investments in co investment partnerships   other  net    debt company s share    debt partners share   total net assets    partners share of net assets   company s share of net assets   the information presented in the following table includes amli s proportionate share of unconsolidated co investment partnerships

the company is compensated in a variety of ways for the services it provides to these co investment partnerships or amli s partners 
most of the accounting policies that are deemed to be critical accounting policies relate to accounting for this compensation 
this compensation includes  among other fees  acquisition fees  disposition fees  development fees  asset management fees  financing fees and a possible promoted interest earned by the operating partnership 
in addition  construction and property management fees are earned by the service companies 
in general  fees are recognized upon completion of the earnings process  regardless of the timing of the receipt of cash 
for instance  acquisition and disposition fees are recognized only upon completion of an acquisition or disposition of property on behalf of a co investment partnership  and asset management and property management fees are recognized as they are earned as services are provided 
development and construction fees are recognized using the percentage of completion method eg  of total development fees are recognized when of total costs are incurred 
payment of a portion of development fees earned may  in some instances  be deferred until completion of development and lease up 
absent indications of inability to complete development or lease up  this payment deferral does not necessitate deferral of development fee income as recognized on the percentage of completion method 
at december  and  total development fees earned but not yet collected totaled and  respectively  and are included in other assets in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets at december  and a portion of any fees earned from a co investment partnership is eliminated to the extent of the company s ownership interest that is  amli does not recognize as income 
for instance  if the company earns a acquisition fee  which is earned from a partnership in which it holds a ownership interest  only in fee income is recognized 
because the co investment partnership has incurred of cost and capitalized this fee as part of its property acquisition cost  the company s share of equity on the books of this partnership will exceed its investment in this partnership by the eliminated fees and the other differences are being taken into earnings over years as the underlying properties are depreciated 
any remaining unamortized fees are taken into income upon a community s disposition 
at december   details of these differences between the company s aggregate investment in partnerships and its aggregate share of equity as recorded on the books of these partnerships  net of accumulated amortization  are as follows amli s share of equity in partnerships  negative investment balances presented in other liabilities  capitalized interest  eliminated fees  eliminated construction profits  other comprehensive loss  other  total investments in partnerships  the company capitalizes interest relating to its investments to the extent that qualified assets of each partnership those under development exceed debt of that partnership 
most of the  in capitalized interest relates to the company s capital contributions which funded its share of the development costs of communities owned by unleveraged partnerships 
capitalized interest is being amortized against earnings over years 
promoted interests in most of the co investment partnerships  the company is entitled to an increased share of any cash flow after the company and its co investment partners have received distributions equal to a minimum return on their contributions and return of capital contributions in the case of distribution of sale or refinancing proceeds 
the company views these promoted interests as back end compensation for having managed successful investments for its partners 
the promoted interest amounts are recognized in income when received in cash 
most of this additional compensation is recognized following the sale or refinancing of the community and distribution of the proceeds  although receipt of cash and recognition of income can occur earlier 
in february  the loan of amli at windbrooke  a co investment community  was refinanced 
this community acquired in for  had increased in value by the february maturity of its original  loan 
on february   the company received  as its share of refinancing proceeds from the placement of a new  non recourse first mortgage loan on the community 
the company s co investment partner s  share of the distribution  when taken together with prior distributions of operating cash flows  returned all original capital contributions plus the minimum return hurdle of the partnership 
as a result  notwithstanding the company s original interest in this partnership  the company will  in general  be receiving future cash flows in excess of amli s ownership interest of to its aggregate promoted interest of 
in may  the refinancing of the loan of amli at chevy chase  another co investment community  resulted in a similar situation 
the acquisition of the community was initially financed by a  first mortgage note bearing interest at 
on may   the loan agreement was amended to increase the principal amount to  and change the interest rate to 
part of the net proceeds was distributed to the partners and the remainder was used to repay the balance of the original loan 
the company received  from the proceeds of this loan 
with this distribution  the partners have received a return of their original capital plus a specified yield 
since this refinancing  amli s share of cash flows has been in excess of its ownership interest of to its aggregate promoted interest of  and amli will receive of any distribution from future sale or refinancing 
promoted interests recognized from the sales of amli at willowbrook in and amli at pleasant hill in contributed and per share  respectively  to ffo and operating earnings in those years 
accounting for investments in and transactions with the service companies each of the service companies is a trs established to provide services for fees  primarily to the company and its co investment partnerships 
through ownership of these subsidiaries  the company is able to participate in the costs and benefits of value added activities  which would be impermissible for a reit to undertake directly 
the company eliminates fee income generated by the service companies to the extent of the company s interest in the respective co investment partnerships 
capital needs of the service companies since the company s initial public offering in have resulted primarily from working capital requirements associated with construction activities undertaken on behalf of the company and its co investment partnerships  costs of management information systems development  especially in  to give amc the scalable systems needed to accommodate future growth  and costs of real estate acquired 
amc capitalizes costs of hardware and software acquired and installed and also capitalizes internal costs associated with software development  and amortizes all such costs over five years 
some accounting judgment is required in the determination of the costs appropriate for capitalization and in the determination of the appropriateness of the period over which such costs are amortized 
total deferred information technology costs  net of accumulated amortization  were  at december  in conjunction with the company s land acquisition activities  amrescon has acquired land that cannot or will not be developed for multi family development investment purposes 
in  amrescon has also commenced participation in two joint ventures  which are building multifamily developments intended for sale at or near completion 
the company recorded  as its after tax share of gains from amrescon s land sales in  but has not recorded any significant gain or loss in or cost capitalization the company capitalizes costs associated with developing real estate and significant costs incurred to improve or replace components of completed communities 
details of costs capitalized and expensed are provided later in this discussion 
there is diversity in accounting policies adopted by the real estate industry 
the company is of the opinion that its policies are generally consistent with industry practice 
one exception is that the company expenses the cost of exterior painting of existing communities 
the american institute of certified public accountants is in the process of developing additional formal guidance regarding cost capitalization 
such new rules may  if and when adopted  cause certain capitalized real estate development related costs to be expensed 
value of land the company s inventory of land is carried at cost  but not in excess of fair value 
accounting judgment is required to value the land appropriately in instances in which cost may exceed net realizable value 
late in  the company determined that most of the land in texas which the company had intended to develop was worth less than its carrying value 
accordingly  the company recorded a  provision for loss to appropriately state this land at its estimated fair market value at december  in  the company recorded an additional provision for loss on two of these land parcels 
results of community operations general at december   amli owned apartment communities wholly owned communities and owned interests in apartment communities co investment communities that  in the aggregate  were comprised of  apartment homes 
seventy two of these communities containing  apartment homes were stabilized as of december  and seven communities containing  apartment homes were under development or in lease up at that date 
stabilized communities are communities that are fully completed and have  in the opinion of management  completed their initial lease up 
operating results for the company s wholly owned communities are reflected on the company s consolidated statements of operations under revenue and expenses as well as under income from discontinued operations in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets sfas 
the company s share of operating results from all co investment communities is included in income from partnerships 
the company distinguishes stabilized communities which include same store communities  new communities and acquisition communities from development and lease up communities and communities sold or contributed to ventures  each of which are defined as follows 
same store communities communities that have had stabilized operations and were owned by the company as of january  
new communities communities that were developed by the company and began stabilized operations after january  
acquisition communities communities having stabilized operations that were acquired by the company after january  
development and lease up communities communities being developed by the company that are not yet stabilized 

communities sold or contributed to ventures reflects operations through the date a community was sold or contributed to a venture 
the company uses net operating income noi to measure the operating results of its communities 
noi is computed before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization and is the result of deducting community operating expenses from rental and other community revenue 
this performance measure is not intended as a replacement for net income determined in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles gaap 
wholly owned communities for the year ended december   revenue from wholly owned communities decreased from the same period a year ago  while operating expenses increased 
the overall decrease in noi was the result of weaker market conditions and the company s owning less wholly owned apartment homes during than in since january   the company has sold five stabilized communities containing a total of  apartment homes 
during the same period  the company has acquired a total of  apartment homes in six stabilized communities

   co investment communities for the year ended december   both revenue and operating expenses from co investment communities increased from the same period a year ago 
the increases were primarily the result of the co investment partnerships owning more apartment homes during than in during the same period the company  through joint ventures with institutional investors  has completed or has under development and begun rental operations of ten communities 
since january   five co investment communities having a total of  apartment homes were stabilized 
five co investment communities  containing a total of  apartment homes  were in lease up as of december  and are anticipated to reach stabilization in and in addition  the company invested in three co investment partnerships which acquired three stabilized communities containing a total of  apartment homes  and sold four communities containing a total of  apartment homes 
these sales and weak market conditions have contributed to a decrease in co investment communities noi and the company s share thereof

  same store communities as of december    apartment homes  or of total apartment homes in the company s stabilized communities  were categorized as same store communities  of which  apartment homes were in wholly owned communities and  apartment homes were in co investment communities 
the following commentary is based primarily on an analysis of the company s same store portfolio since the operating results of stabilized communities owned over comparable periods provide a valid perspective of market conditions affecting the company s portfolio as a whole 
for purposes of this discussion and analysis  of the results of operations of the co investment communities is combined with the results of operations of the wholly owned communities 
rental revenue the company experienced a reduction in rental revenue and a reduction in total revenue when comparing the fourth quarter of to the third quarter of these declines were slightly above those from the second to third quarter but not dramatically out of line with anticipated seasonal declines 
neither sequential decline was unexpected given the disequilibrium of supply and demand factors in the multifamily sector 
both total and rental revenue have continued to trend down throughout the year as the economy has been unable to generate sufficient job growth to absorb new supply pressures as well as pressure from homebuyers 
occupancy the following chart shows weighted average physical occupancy  calculated on a daily basis  for all same store communities for each of amli s markets and for the amli portfolio in total daily weighted average physical occupancy same store communities quarter ended dec sept jun mar dec dallas atlanta austin houston indianapolis kansas city chicago denver total port folio a a occupied apartments include community models and exclude apartments not in service due to fire  flood or otherwise 
in addition to physical occupancy as an indicator of market conditions  some in the apartment industry measure economic occupancy as well 
because the calculation of economic occupancy typically adjusts the value of vacancies and concessions among other items from market rents  many believe that it is a better indicator of market fundamentals 
since there is no consistent industry measurement of economic occupancy and the calculation is derived from many variable inputs  amli prefers to measure total revenue earned per each occupied apartment 
since the company s policy is to reserve as a bad debt any rent or other payments due from a resident that is more than days delinquent  revenue earned for purposes of this analysis is essentially equal to collected rent per unit  another metric used by some in the apartment industry 
the following chart shows weighted average total revenue per occupied apartment home for same store communities for each of amli s markets and for the amli portfolio in total weighted average total revenue earned per occupied apartment home same store communities quarter ended year ended dec sept jun mar dec dec dec dallas atlanta austin houston        indianapolis kansas city chicago        denver        total port folio a a calculated by taking the simple average of each of the three months in the quarter 
each month s calculation is made by dividing that month s accrual basis rental and other income total community revenue by the weighted average number of apartments occupied during the month 
amli s markets the following provides commentary about each of amli s markets 
statistical information relates to same store communities  including wholly owned and co investment communities at  for the year  compared to actual monthly rental revenue for the year dallas forth worth  which represented of total revenue in the fourth quarter  continued to exhibit deteriorating fundamentals as supply and demand remained out of balance 
as expected  seasonal leasing patterns resulted in less traffic on a quarter over quarter basis  while year over year traffic increased by just 
rental revenue declined by for the year ended december  compared to a year ago  as average effective rents have decreased by 
at the end of  market wide vacancy was  more than percentage points higher than a year earlier as absorption remained negative for the quarter 
the sluggish economy continues to hamper any real job growth as the area lost approximately  jobs in with  new units to be delivered in  dallas will struggle in as many of these scheduled completions are heavily concentrated in the first half of the year 
atlanta  which represented of total revenue in the fourth quarter  experienced a decline in revenue for the sixth consecutive quarter  falling during the fourth quarter 
revenue  after dropping steadily in the second quarter  appeared to stabilize in the third quarter  before trending downward again in the fourth quarter  although not out of line with year end seasonality 
market wide  over the past quarter  occupancies and the level of concessions have remained stable 
with  new units still in the pipeline  the atlanta market will continue to be under pressure  especially those stabilized communities that compete with new lease ups 
although atlanta experienced negative year over year job growth in  the region experienced job gains throughout the year  providing reason to believe that even if the market has not hit bottom  its deterioration has slowed 
chicago  which represented of total revenue for the quarter  experienced a drop in revenue versus the third quarter after showing increased revenue in the first two quarters and only a slight drop in the third quarter 
a weak economy and low interest rates continue to negatively impact chicago 
this market continues to have the highest level of move outs due to home purchases during the fourth quarter 
demand remains depressed due to continued shrinkage in employment levels 
in  chicago lost  jobs 
traffic has decreased every month since march  with the fourth quarter dropping from the third quarter 
fourth quarter average occupancy dropped to from the prior quarter but is up from a year ago 
with continuing job layoffs creating fear of a long delayed recovery or double dip recession in chicago  needed occupancy gains will likely be made only at the expense of effective rent 
austin  which represented of total revenue for the quarter  reversed its trend of slowing revenue deterioration as the region experienced a decrease from the third quarter after a decrease from the second quarter 
the decline in revenue was mainly created by a decrease in occupancy as concessions actually decreased by from the prior quarter 
market wide occupancy for class a units fell below in the fourth quarter 
traffic and net rentals fell significantly in the last two months of the year as each measure decreased by and  respectively  over the same period a year ago 
through december austin remained one of the few regions to register positive job growth as  jobs were added on a trailing twelve month basis 
throughout the austin area experienced positive demand for apartments  as nearly  units were absorbed 
however  with nearly  new units delivered at the same time  the region had negative net absorption of nearly  units 
with  additional units scheduled for completion in  the region will be challenged for significant revenue increases during the upcoming year 
kansas city  which represented of total revenue during the fourth quarter  experienced a decrease in rental revenue from the third quarter  following a decrease from the second to the third quarter 
the economy in kansas city has slowed with job growth turning negative during the second half of the year 
december s bureau of labor statistics data show a year over year loss of  jobs  with the unemployment rate up basis points over a similar time period 
the market has also been affected by significant new supply delivered over the past months 
although market conditions have not tightened  occupancy in the amli portfolio improved to during the fourth quarter versus during the same period a year ago 
looking forward  multifamily permits have slowed from year ago levels and are at their lowest level since however  without a return to positive job growth  absorption of new units will remain a challenge 
indianapolis  which represented of total revenue during the fourth quarter  showed a sequential decrease of in rental revenue  but a increase over the same period a year ago 
occupancy of during the quarter was down slightly from the previous period  but up from during the fourth quarter of concessions were reduced by in the quarter  following an decrease during the third quarter  a positive trend 
with multifamily permits trending up over the past year  this market will need some job growth to remain in balance 
job growth has turned negative over the past two quarters 
houston revenue  which represented of total revenue during the fourth quarter  decreased by from the previous quarter  after posting revenue growth on a sequential basis during the previous two quarters 
demand for apartments in houston fell during the fourth quarter as approximately  more apartments were vacated than were leased 
the move outs resulted in a drop in occupancy to in december from as of september in the downtown sub market  where our two same store communities are located  approximately  units currently under development account for nearly one fifth of houston s scheduled new supply in the next months 
job growth remained positive through december as the region added approximately  jobs during the trailing twelve month period 
despite the relatively resilient job market  the concentration of new supply in the downtown sub market could lead to imbalances in supply and demand in the near term 
denver  which represented of total revenue during the fourth quarter one community  continues to be challenged due to the combination of weak job growth and significant new supply 
total revenue decreased during the quarter as concessions increased for the fourth consecutive quarter 
average occupancies in a product in the company s three submarkets averaged for the quarter 
with significant new supply still to be delivered  units  continued weak job growth  and on going competition from the home sale market  denver will struggle to reach equilibrium during other community revenue includes non rental income items such as revenue from parking garages and carports  laundry facilities  washer dryer rentals  phone and cable  vending  application fees  late fees  termination fees  month to month fees  pet charges and other such items

inflation inflation has been low for the past several years 
virtually all apartment leases at the wholly owned communities and co investment communities are for six or twelve months duration 
absent other market influences  this enables the company to pass along inflationary increases in its operating expenses on a timely basis 
because the company s community operating expenses exclusive of depreciation and amortization are approximately of rental and other revenue  increased inflation typically results in comparable increases in income before interest and general and administrative expenses 
however  in the increases in costs and expenses combined with decreases in income resulted in decreased income before interest and general and administrative expenses 
it appears likely that this trend will continue in an increase in general price levels may immediately precede  or accompany  an increase in interest rates 
at december   the company s exposure to rising interest rates including the company s proportionate share of its co investment partnerships interest expense was mitigated by the existing debt level of approximately of the company s total market capitalization including the company s share of co investment partnerships debt  the high percentage of intermediate term fixed rate debt of total debt  and the use of interest rate swaps to effectively fix the interest rate on  through february   through september and  through october of total debt

other contingencies the company has discovered that some of its communities primarily some of those located in texas have problems with mold caused by excessive moisture which accumulates in buildings or on building materials 
some molds are known to produce potent toxins or irritants 
concern about indoor exposure to mold has been increasing as exposure to mold can cause a variety of health effects and symptoms in certain individuals  including severe allergic or other reactions 
as a result  the presence of mold at the company s communities could require undertaking a costly remediation program to contain or remove the mold from the affected communities 
such a remediation program could necessitate the temporary relocation of some or all of the communities residents or the complete rehabilitation of the communities 
the company carries insurance to protect against this specific risk 
based on existing known facts  the company is unaware of any specific circumstance that could result in the company incurring any significant costs as a result of problems with mold

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk the company is exposed to interest rate changes primarily as a result of its line of credit used to maintain liquidity and fund capital expenditures and expansion of the company s real estate investment portfolio and operations 
the company s interest rate risk management objective is to limit the impact of interest rate changes on earnings and cash flows and to lower its overall borrowing costs 
to achieve its objectives  the company borrows primarily at fixed rates and may enter into derivative financial instruments such as interest rate swaps  caps and treasury locks in order to mitigate its interest rate risk on a related financial instrument 
the company does not enter into derivative or interest rate transactions for speculative purposes 
since december   the company has reduced its exposure to risks associated with interest rate changes and has significantly extended the average maturities of its fixed rate debt portfolio by refinancing  in borrowings under its floating rate line of credit with a ten year secured fixed interest rate loan 
there have been no other significant changes in the company s exposure to market risks

moreover  because there were no firm commitments to actually sell these instruments at fair value at december   the information presented herein is merely an estimate and has limited predictive value 
as a result  the company s ultimate realized gain or loss with respect to interest rate fluctuations will depend on the exposures that arise during the period  the company s hedging strategies at that time  and future changes in the level of interest rates
