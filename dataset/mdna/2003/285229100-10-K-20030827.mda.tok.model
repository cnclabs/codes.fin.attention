business overview electro scientific industries  inc and its subsidiaries esi provide high technology manufacturing equipment to the global electronics market 
our customers are primarily manufacturers of semiconductors  passive electronic components and electronic interconnect devices 
our equipment enables these manufacturers to reduce production costs  increase yields and improve the quality of their products 
the components and devices manufactured by our customers are used in a wide variety of end use products in the computer  communications and automotive industries 
we believe we are the leading supplier of advanced laser systems used to improve the production yield of semiconductor devices  high speed test and termination equipment used in the high volume production of multi layer ceramic passives mlcps and other passive electronic components  and advanced laser systems used to fine tune electronic components and circuitry 
additionally  we produce a series of laser drilling systems for production of high density interconnect hdi circuit boards and advanced semiconductor packaging  as well as passive component inspection systems and original equipment manufacturer oem machine vision products 
electronics industry overview the electronic content of common items such as computers  communication products  consumer products and automobiles continues to increase 
for example  markets for consumer oriented electronic products such as wireless telephones  computers  personal digital assistants  pagers  digital cameras and home entertainment devices have developed rapidly as increasingly affordable products have been introduced that are smaller  lighter and more portable 
in addition  automobile manufacturers now routinely include electronic ignition and fuel injection  anti lock brakes  navigation systems and other electronic safety and sensor systems in place of components that in the past were predominantly mechanical or hydraulic 
the increasing demand for electronic products has been accompanied by the need for faster  smaller  more complex  less expensive and higher quality electronic devices and circuits 
to achieve these higher performance attributes and smaller device sizes  electronic device manufacturers are increasing the circuit densities in these devices and tuning them to precise electrical values 
manufacturers of cellular telephones  for example  must use miniaturized circuits to accommodate the size limitations of their finished products 
these circuits must also be tuned to operate within precise frequency specifications  enabling the existing wireless frequency bands to accommodate more users without interchannel interference 
smaller and lighter requirements also decrease the physical dimensions used in electronic interconnections within the electronic device  its surrounding package and the hdi circuit board on which it is mounted 
higher operating speeds of computers and communications products also require more input and output channels within these packages and between the packages and the hdi circuit board 
the highly competitive consumer markets for electronic products drive the need for lower cost devices and components 
electronic devices and components are produced in large unit volumes and their production and testing is highly automated  utilizing a variety of manufacturing equipment 
manufacturers continuously seek to achieve reduced costs by improving the throughput  yield and quality of device and component production 
these manufacturers are also developing new materials to improve performance and reduce costs of their devices 
this puts additional challenges on the equipment suppliers to innovate new manufacturing process solutions and equipment 
for example  semiconductor device manufacturers are continuing a transition from the use of mm and smaller silicon wafers to mm wafers 
this enables manufacturers to fit significantly more electronic devices on a single silicon wafer 
in addition  decreasing circuit densities enables more devices to be produced on a silicon wafer by reducing the size of each device on the wafer 
the use of larger wafers and the design of smaller devices increase the effective throughput and capacity of semiconductor manufacturing facilities  or fabs 
increasing circuit densities  as the result of shrinking line widths and faster operating speeds  requires the use of newer materials  such as copper  to create these miniaturized electronic circuits 
to improve production yield  or the number of acceptable devices produced per silicon wafer  device manufacturers are utilizing advanced yield improvement systems  such as laser memory repair  in the manufacture of memory devices such as dynamic random access memory  or dram  and non memory devices such as logic with embedded memory  digital signal processors dsps and high end electronic game chips 
as semiconductor manufacturers move toward higher densities and more complex architectures  machine vision has also emerged as a critical technology 
by allowing manufacturers to achieve greater precision  increased equipment speed and fewer errors  machine vision is enabling technology in the semiconductor manufacturing process  from wafer production through final assembly and packaging 
variations of these advanced technologies and manufacturing processes that are routinely used in the semiconductor fabs are increasingly being employed in the production of passive components  hdi circuit boards and advanced semiconductor packages 
an example is the use of machine vision in passive component inspection 
as the device sizes are becoming ever smaller and the critical dimensions of the electrical contacts become more precise  machine vision  incorporated with high speed handling and real time software  allow for over  parts per hour inspection of mlcps 
the previous technique utilized human inspection at a much slower rate with poorer inspection results 
in the case of hdi circuit boards  consumers desire for faster  lighter  longer battery lived and ultimately less expensive products drives consumer product manufacturers  such as cell phone producers  to design products in which the discrete circuits are closer together 
the same increased density concept used in semiconductor manufacturing is also pursued in printed circuit board production

item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview electro scientific industries  inc and its subsidiaries esi provide high technology manufacturing equipment to the global electronics market 
our customers are primarily manufacturers of semiconductors  passive electronic components and electronic interconnect devices 
our equipment enables these manufacturers to reduce production costs  increase yields and improve the quality of their products 
the components and devices manufactured by our customers are used in a wide variety of end use products in the computer  communications and automotive industries 
we supply advanced laser systems used to improve the production yield of semiconductor devices  high speed test and termination equipment used in the high volume production of multi layer ceramic passives mlcps and other passive electronic components  and advanced laser systems used to fine tune electronic components and circuitry 
additionally  we produce a family of laser drilling systems for production of high density interconnect hdi circuit boards and advanced electronic packaging  as well as inspection systems and original equipment manufacturer oem machine vision products 
in fiscal  the electronics industry  and in particular the semiconductor subset of this industry  were at the peak of an extended period of expansion 
our revenues in fiscal were a record million 
however  during fiscal  the slowing worldwide demand for electronics and semiconductors resulted in a rapid decline in demand for manufacturing equipment 
this sudden and steep decline in demand for manufacturing equipment continued to deepen into fiscal and demand remains at a reduced level today 
by many accounts  this is the most severe and protracted downturn in the history of the electronics industry 
inventory buildups in telecommunication products  slower than expected personal computer sales and slow global economic growth have caused electronic and semiconductor companies to reevaluate their capital spending and reschedule or cancel existing orders 
as a result of this business environment  sales in fiscal and were million and million  respectively 
in response to this prolonged and continuing downturn  we initiated  and continue to implement  plans to better align our infrastructure and operating costs with expected business conditions 
these plans have included discontinuing certain products  consolidating facilities  relocating employees  reducing headcount  freezing salaries and wages and reducing discretionary spending 
although we continue to address cost management in response to the downturn  we will continue to invest in those areas which we believe are important to our long term growth  including customer support and new products 
restructuring and cost management plans in response to the economic climate described above  we initiated restructuring and other cost management plans in fiscal and the fiscal actions primarily related to relocating the manufacturing of our electronic component product line from escondido  california to our headquarters in portland  oregon 
this action resulted in a reduction of employees and the relocation of employees to our headquarters 
severance  relocation and other employee related charges for these activities totaled approximately million 
facilities consolidation costs related to these activities totaled approximately million 
the fiscal actions reduced our work force by a total of employees in june and august  with an additional employee reduction in october these reductions impacted all employee groups 
the actions also included vacating buildings located in california  massachusetts  michigan  minnesota  and texas  as well as exiting the mechanical drill business and discontinuing the manufacturing of certain other products 
severance  relocation and other employee related charges for these activities totaled approximately million 
facilities consolidation and other charges related to the discontinuance of certain products totaled approximately million 
investigation and restatements of financial statements in march  our audit committee commenced an internal investigation of the circumstances surrounding the reversal of an employee benefits accrual that occurred in the first quarter of the investigation also identified and addressed unsupported accounting adjustments and clerical errors primarily relating to inventory and cost of goods sold  and certain other areas where potential accounting errors could have occurred  including revenue recognition and restructuring reserves 
restatement of financial statements we have restated our financial statements for the fiscal year ended june  and the quarters contained therein principally related to the deferral of revenue for certain transactions where customer specified acceptance criteria existed but were not properly considered in determining whether our criteria for revenue recognition had been met as of year end 
we also corrected our financial statements for other matters we identified  including the failure to write off fixed assets that were sold prior to year end  but had not been removed from our books  the write off of inventory due to a change in our accounting for defective parts being returned by customers  an unauthorized change in depreciation methods and the correction of a bank error related to amortization of bond premiums discounts 
following is a summary of the effects of the restatements on our results of operations for the year ended june  in thousands  except per share amounts net sales net loss net loss per share as originally reported   effect of restatements   as restated   for a more complete analysis of the effects of the restatements on our results of operations for the year ended june  and on our balance sheet as of june   please refer to our amended annual report on form k a as filed with the securities and exchange commission on august  fiscal year ended may  compared to fiscal year ended june  net sales net sales for fiscal decreased million to million compared to million in fiscal certain information regarding our net sales by product group is as follows net sales in thousands net sales percent of total net sales net sales percent of total net sales semiconductor group sg   passive components group pcg   electronic interconnect group eig   the decreases in sg and pcg are primarily due to a decrease in unit volume 
the decrease in volume is primarily due to continuing softness in the global economy and competitive pressures 
in particular  pcg experienced increased competition for consumable products  primarily from asian sources 
the increase in eig is primarily due to acceptance of products in fiscal that were shipped to one customer in fiscal at the end of fiscal  these products were included in deferred revenue 
net sales by geographic region were as follows net sales in thousands net sales percent of total net sales net sales percent of total net sales united states   asia   europe   other   gross margin gross margin was million of net sales for fiscal compared to million of net sales for fiscal primarily as a result of the economic climate as described above  cost of sales in fiscal included million of charges primarily for inventory write downs related to the discontinuance of certain products and excess and obsolete inventory  as well as for open purchase order accruals 
cost of sales in fiscal included million of such charges 
the gross margin and gross margin percentage were also negatively affected in fiscal compared to fiscal by under absorption of factory overhead  higher overhead burden costs included in the inventory that was sold  pricing pressures  higher warranty costs and product mix 
we anticipate that future margins will be impacted by the same factors until business conditions improve 
operating expenses selling  service and administrative expenses were million of net sales in fiscal compared to million of net sales in fiscal included in selling  service and administrative expenses in fiscal are charges related to our restructuring and other cost management activities of million  primarily related to employee severance  relocation and related costs  facilities consolidation costs and fixed asset write downs 
fiscal included million of such charges 
fiscal also benefited from decreases resulting from the restructuring and other cost management efforts that were implemented at various times during fiscal and we expect to incur significant legal and other professional fees in fiscal related to the audit committee investigation  which concluded in july  lawsuits and compliance with the sarbanes oxley act 
premiums for our directors and officers liability insurance will increase in fiscal future operating results are highly dependent on our ability to maintain a competitive advantage in the products and services we provide 
to protect this advantage we continue to make investments in research and development 
research  development and engineering expenses were million in fiscal of net sales compared to million of net sales in fiscal included in research  development and engineering expenses in fiscal are charges related to our restructuring and other cost management activities of million  primarily related to employee severance and related costs and facilities consolidation costs 
fiscal included million of such charges 
the decrease in research  development and engineering expenses is primarily due to lower headcount 
we continue to invest in a number of development projects that we believe are important to our future 
long lived asset impairment of million in fiscal includes million related to the write down of our klamath falls  oregon components manufacturing site and related equipment and million related to the write down of land in taiwan 
the market for the consumable products manufactured by our klamath falls operation experienced a significant reduction in demand in fiscal as well as significantly increased competition from foreign manufacturers 
accordingly  during the fourth quarter of fiscal  we determined that the book value of these assets exceeded the estimated undiscounted future cash flows 
pursuant to statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  we wrote down the assets to their estimated fair values 
other income expense interest income was million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal the increase is due to a full year of interest earned on the increase in our investment balances as a result of our sale of million aggregate principal amount of convertible subordinated notes due the convertible notes in december and january this increase was partially offset by lower interest rates in fiscal compared to fiscal interest expense was million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal the increase is primarily due to a full year of interest expense related to the sale in december and january of million aggregate principal amount of convertible notes

fiscal year ended june  compared to fiscal year ended june  net sales net sales for fiscal were million  which was  or million  lower than the million reported for fiscal certain information regarding our net sales by product group is as follows net sales in thousands net sales percent of total net sales net sales percent of total net sales semiconductor group sg   passive components group pcg   electronic interconnect group eig   the decreases in all product groups were due to lower unit sales across all of our product lines 
net sales by geographic region were as follows net sales in thousands net sales percent of total net sales net sales percent of total net sales united states   asia   europe   other   gross margin gross margin for fiscal was  down from in the prior fiscal year 
this decrease in gross margin as a percentage of net sales was due primarily to charges for inventory write downs totaling million in fiscal  primarily as a result of the economic climate as described above  in addition to decreased capacity utilization resulting from lower unit volume and product mix 
operating expenses selling  service and administrative expenses were million of net sales in fiscal compared to million of net sales in fiscal as discussed above  selling  service and administrative expenses in fiscal include charges related to our restructuring and other cost management activities of million 
the decrease in fiscal was primarily due to decreases in our selling  service and administrative headcount and lower costs of incentive and benefits programs 
the increase as a percentage of sales is primarily due to lower net sales in fiscal future operating results are highly dependent on our ability to maintain a competitive advantage in the products and services we provide 
to protect this advantage we continue to make investments in research and development 
research  development and engineering expenses for fiscal decreased to million of net sales from million of net sales in fiscal as discussed above  research  development and engineering expenses in fiscal included charges related to our restructuring and other cost management activities of million 
the decrease in fiscal was primarily due to decreases in research  development and engineering headcount 
the increase as a percentage of net sales was due to lower net sales in fiscal gain on settlement of litigation in fiscal includes a million award from gsi lumonics  offset by million of legal fees and other expenses directly related to the litigation award 
other income expense interest income was million for fiscal  a decrease of million from million in fiscal the fiscal amount includes million of interest related to the gsi lumonics litigation award

as discussed above  the net loss in fiscal includes million  on a pretax basis  of restructuring and special charges 
financial condition and liquidity at may   our principal sources of liquidity consisted of existing cash  cash equivalents and marketable and restricted securities of million and accounts receivable of million 
at may   we had a current ratio of and long term debt of million 
working capital decreased to million at may  from million at june  we believe that our existing cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities are adequate to fund our operations for at least the next twelve months 
trade receivables decreased million to million at may  from million at june  due to lower sales and fewer sales with extended payment terms in fiscal compared to fiscal inventory decreased million to million at may  from million at june   primarily due to decreased sales and  as discussed above  write downs for excess and obsolete inventories and discontinued product lines 
assets held for sale of million at may  relates to a  square foot plant on acres of land near escondido  california  which we are no longer utilizing 
we have contracted with a real estate agent to find a buyer and anticipate that we will sell the assets within one year 
subsequent to year end  we listed a parcel of land in taiwan for sale for million 
purchases of property  plant and equipment of million in fiscal were primarily for the completion of our new corporate headquarters in portland  oregon 
at may  we had million recorded on our balance sheet related to our convertible subordinated notes 
during the third quarter of fiscal  we repurchased million of the subordinated notes 
the difference between the remaining million face value and the million balance at may  relates to underwriting discounts  which originally totaled million and are being amortized as additional interest expense over the life of the subordinated notes at a rate of million per year 
a summary of our contractual commitments and obligations as of may  is as follows in thousands payments due by period contractual obligation total less than year years years more than years convertible subordinated debt   purchase commitments    operating leases   critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of our financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses 
our estimates are based on historical experience and on various assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
these estimates form the basis for judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
refer to note  summary of significant accounting policies  of notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information 
our critical accounting policies and estimates include the following revenue recognition  inventory write downs  product warranty reserves  allowance for doubtful accounts  deferred taxes  loss contingencies  and long lived asset valuations 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue in accordance with sec staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition in financial statements  and sab revenue recognition in financial statements frequently asked questions and answers  or sab faq 
we recognize revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred or the services have been rendered  the sales price is fixed or determinable and collection of the related receivable is reasonably assured 
title and risk of loss generally passes to the customer at the time of delivery of the product to a common carrier 
revenue is recognized upon delivery  provided that acceptance criteria can be demonstrated prior to shipment 
installation services are not essential to the functionality of the delivered equipment 
where the acceptance criteria cannot be demonstrated prior to shipment  or in the case of substantially new products  revenue is deferred until acceptance has been received 
for multiple element arrangements  we defer the fair value of any undelivered elements until they are delivered 
revenues associated with sales to customers under local contracts in japan are recognized upon title transfer  which generally occurs upon customer acceptance  with the exception of sales to our distributor in japan  where revenues are recognized upon title transfer to the distributor 
revenues related to spare parts and consumable sales are recognized upon shipment 
revenues related to maintenance and service contracts are recognized ratably over the duration of the contracts 
revenues are difficult to predict  due in part to our reliance on customer acceptance related to a portion of our revenues 
any shortfall in revenue or delay in recognizing revenue could cause our operating results to vary significantly from quarter to quarter and could result in future operating losses 
inventory write downs we regularly evaluate the value of our inventory based on a combination of factors including  but not limited to  the following forecasted sales or usage  historical usage rates  estimated service period  product end of life dates  estimated current and future market values  service inventory requirements and new product introductions 
purchasing requirements and alternative uses for the inventory are explored within these processes to mitigate inventory exposure 
raw materials with quantities in excess of forecasted usage are reviewed quarterly for obsolescence by our engineering and operating personnel 
raw material obsolescence write downs are typically caused by engineering change orders or product end of life adjustments in the market 
finished goods are reviewed quarterly by product marketing and operating personnel to determine if inventory carrying costs exceed market selling prices 
we record write downs for inventory based on the above factors and take into account worldwide quantities and demand into our analysis 
if circumstances related to our inventories change  our estimates of the value of inventory could materially change 
we record estimated inventory reserves quarterly as an increase to cost of sales 
product warranty reserves we evaluate our obligations related to product warranties quarterly 
we offer a standard one year warranty to our customers 
costs include labor to repair the system and replacement parts for defective items  as well as other costs incidental to warranty repairs 
any cost recoveries from warranties offered to us by our suppliers covering defective components are also considered 
this data is then used to calculate the warranty reserve based on remaining warranty periods 
if circumstances change  or if a dramatic change in warranty related incidents occurs  our estimate of the warranty reserve could change significantly 
we record estimated warranties quarterly as an adjustment to cost of sales 
our warranty expense in fiscal totaled million 
allowance for doubtful accounts credit limits are established by reviewing the financial history and stability of each customer 
where appropriate  we obtain credit rating reports and financial statements of the customer to initiate and modify their credit limits 
on certain foreign sales  we require letters of credit 
we regularly evaluate the collectibility of our trade receivable balances based on a combination of factors 
when a customer s account becomes past due  we talk with the customer to determine the cause 
if we determine that the customer will be unable to fully meet its financial obligation to us  such as in the case of a bankruptcy filing or other material events impacting its business  we record a specific reserve for bad debt to reduce the related receivable to the amount we expect to recover given all information then available 
if circumstances related to specific customers change  our estimates of the recoverability of receivables could materially change 
we record estimated bad debts quarterly as an increase to selling  service and administrative expense 
at may   our allowance for doubtful accounts totaled million and our bad debt expense in fiscal was million 
deferred taxes deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
under sfas no 
accounting for income taxes  the effect on deferred taxes of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date 
when management determines that is more likely than not that a deferred tax asset will not be fully realized  a valuation allowance is established to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount expected to be realized 
should management s assumptions and expectations be inaccurate  our results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected in future periods 
at may   our net deferred tax assets totaled million  which included a valuation allowance of million 
loss contingencies in addition to intellectual property litigation  we have been  from time to time  subject to legal proceedings and claims  including a putative securities class action lawsuit and other securities related litigation 
see part i  item  legal proceedings 
where we can make a reasonable estimate of the liability relating to pending litigation  we record a liability 
as additional information becomes available  we assess the potential liability and revise estimates as appropriate 
because of uncertainties relating to litigation  however  the amount of our estimates could be wrong 
moreover  plaintiffs may not specify an amount of damages sought 
in addition to the direct costs of litigation and the use of cash  pending or future litigation could divert management s attention and resources from the operation of our business 
accordingly  our operating results and financial condition could suffer 
at may   we had million accrued for anticipated costs related to defending and or settling current litigation 
long lived asset valuations long lived assets  principally property and equipment and identifiable intangibles held and used by us are reviewed for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of assets may not be recoverable in accordance with sfas no 
we evaluate recoverability of assets to be held and used by comparing the carrying amount of an asset to estimated future net undiscounted cash flows to be generated by the asset 
if such assets are considered to be impaired  the impairment to be recognized is measured as the amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceeds the fair value of the assets 
in addition  when appropriate  we utilize independent  third party valuations 
factors that may affect future results the statements contained in this report that are not statements of historical fact  including without limitation  statements containing the words believes  expects  and similar words  constitute forward looking statements that are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties 
from time to time we may make other forward looking statements 
investors are cautioned that such forward looking statements are subject to an inherent risk that actual results may materially differ 
the following information highlights some of the factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from the results expressed or implied by our forward looking statements 
forward looking statements should be considered in light of these factors 
factors that may result in such variances include  but are not limited to the following the industries that comprise our primary markets are volatile and unpredictable 
our business depends upon the capital expenditures of manufacturers of components and circuitry used in wireless communications  computers  automotive electronics and other electronic products 
in the past  the markets for electronic devices have experienced sharp downturns 
during these downturns  electronics manufacturers  including our customers  have delayed or canceled capital expenditures  which has had a negative impact on our financial results 
the current economic downturn has resulted in a reduction in demand for our products and significant reductions in our profitability and net sales 
we had a net loss of million during fiscal on net sales of million and a net loss of million for the year ended june  on net sales of million 
we cannot assure you that demand for our products will increase 
even if demand for our products does increase  there may be significant fluctuations in our profitability and net sales 
during any downturn  including the current downturn  it will be difficult for us to maintain our sales levels 
as a consequence  to maintain profitability we will need to reduce our operating expenses 
however  because certain of our operating expenses are fixed  our ability to quickly reduce these fixed operating expenses is limited 
moreover  we may be unable to defer capital expenditures  and we will need to continue to invest in certain areas such as research and development 
an economic downturn may also cause us to incur charges related to impairment of assets and inventory write offs and we may also experience delays in payments from our customers 
for example  in the fourth quarter of fiscal  we wrote down our klamath falls  oregon facility by million 
the combined effect of asset impairments  inventory write offs and payment delays will have a negative effect on our financial results 
pending or future litigation could have a material adverse impact on our operating results and financial condition 
in addition to intellectual property litigation  we have been  from time to time  subject to legal proceedings and claims  including a putative securities class action lawsuit and other securities related litigation 
see part i  item  legal proceedings 
where we can make a reasonable estimate of the liability relating to pending litigation  we record a liability 
as additional information becomes available  we assess the potential liability and revise estimates as appropriate 
because of uncertainties relating to litigation  however  the amount of our estimates could be wrong 
moreover  plaintiffs may not specify an amount of damages sought 
in addition to the direct costs of litigation and the use of cash  pending or future litigation could divert management s attention and resources from the operation of our business 
accordingly  our operating results and financial condition could suffer 
we face risks relating to governmental inquiries and the results of our internal investigation of accounting matters 
on march   we contacted the sec in connection with our issuance of a press release announcing the need to restate our financial results for the quarters ended august  and november  in march  the audit committee of our board of directors  with the assistance of outside legal counsel and independent forensic accountants  commenced an internal investigation of certain accounting matters 
the investigation involved the review of the circumstances surrounding the reversal of an accrual for employee benefits  unsupported accounting adjustments and clerical errors primarily relating to inventory and cost of goods sold  and certain other areas where potential accounting errors could have occurred  including revenue recognition and restructuring reserves 
as a result of the investigation  we determined that our unaudited consolidated condensed financial statements for the three months ended august  and november   and our audited consolidated financial statements for the year ended june  and the quarters contained therein required restatement 
we will continue to cooperate with any government investigation into the matters addressed by the internal investigation 
depending on the scope  timing and result of any governmental investigation  management s attention and our resources could be diverted from operations  which could adversely affect our operating results and contribute to future stock price volatility 
governmental investigations also could lead to further restatement of our prior period financial statements or require that we take other actions not currently contemplated 
our management is implementing what it believes to be improvements in our internal and disclosure controls and procedures 
see part iii  item  controls and procedures 
nonetheless  future accounting restatements could occur because these controls and procedures prove to be ineffective or for other reasons 
in addition to a potential sec investigation  the restatement of our previously issued financial statements may lead to new litigation  may expand the claims and the class periods in pending litigation  and may increase the cost of defending or resolving current litigation 
our operating results could suffer as we have recently experienced significant changes in our senior management and plan to add new members to our management team 
several members of our senior management have joined esi as employees since january and we intend to continue to add new members to our senior management team 
changes in management may be disruptive to our business and negatively impact our operating results and may result in the departure of existing employees or customers 
further  it could take an extended period of time to locate  retain and integrate qualified management personnel 
our inability to attract and retain sufficient numbers of managerial  financial  engineering and other technical personnel could have a material adverse effect upon our results of operations 
our continued success depends  in part  upon key managerial  financial  engineering and technical personnel as well as our ability to continue to attract and retain additional personnel 
the loss of key personnel could have a material adverse effect on our business or results of operations 
in april  barry l 
harmon became president and chief executive officer of esi with the understanding that he will serve in that capacity until a successor is hired 
recently  the board of directors decided to commence a search in the second quarter of fiscal for a new chief executive officer to succeed mr 
harmon 
it may take longer than anticipated to hire a new chief executive officer 
in addition  there are several key positions open in our finance department 
we are in the process of recruiting highly skilled accounting and financial reporting personnel to fill these finance positions 
it could take longer than anticipated  however  to hire and train the appropriately qualified professionals 
moreover  we cannot be certain that the employees hired to fulfill these duties will perform at the level necessary to ensure that our internal controls are not compromised 
in addition  we may not be able to retain our key managerial  financial  engineering and technical employees 
our growth may be affected by our ability to hire new managerial personnel  highly skilled and qualified technical personnel  and personnel that can implement and monitor our financial controls and reporting systems 
attracting and retaining qualified personnel is difficult  and our recruiting efforts to attract and retain these personnel may not be successful 
our ability to reduce costs is limited by our need to invest in research and development 
our industry is characterized by the need for continued investment in research and development 
because of intense competition in the industries in which we compete  if we were to fail to invest sufficiently in research and development  our products could become less attractive to potential customers  and our business and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected 
as a result of our need to maintain our spending levels in this area  our operating results could be materially harmed if our net sales fall below expectations 
in addition  as a result of our emphasis on research and development and technological innovation  our operating costs may increase further in the future  and research and development expenses may increase as a percentage of total operating expenses and as a percentage of net sales 
we depend on a few significant customers and we do not have long term contracts with any of our customers 
our top ten customers for fiscal accounted for approximately of total net sales in fiscal  with one customer  samsung  accounting for approximately of total net sales 
no other customer in fiscal accounted for more than of total net sales 
in fiscal and  no customer exceeded of total net sales 
in addition  none of our customers has any long term obligation to continue to buy our products or services  and any customer could delay  reduce or cease ordering our products or services at any time 
delays in manufacturing  shipment or customer acceptance of our products could substantially decrease our sales for a period 
we derive a substantial portion of our revenues from the sale of a relatively small number of products with high average selling prices  some with prices in excess of million per unit 
we depend on manufacturing flexibility to meet the changing demands of our customers 
any significant delay or interruption in receiving raw materials or of our manufacturing operations as a result of software deficiencies  natural disasters  or other causes could result in ineffective manufacturing capabilities or delayed product deliveries  any or all of which could materially and adversely affect our results of operations 
shipment and or customer acceptance delays could significantly impact our recognition of revenue and could be further magnified by announcements from us or our competitors of new products and technologies  which announcements could cause our customers to defer purchases of our existing systems or purchase products from our competitors 
any of these delays could result in a material adverse change in our results of operations for any particular period 
failure of critical suppliers of parts  components and manufacturing equipment to deliver sufficient quantities to us in a timely and cost effective manner could negatively affect our business 
we use a wide range of materials in the production of our products  including custom electronic and mechanical components  and we use numerous suppliers for those materials 
we generally do not have guaranteed supply arrangements with our suppliers 
we seek to reduce the risk of production and service interruptions and shortages of key parts by selecting and qualifying alternative suppliers for key parts  monitoring the financial stability of key suppliers and maintaining appropriate inventories of key parts 
although we make reasonable efforts to ensure that parts are available from multiple suppliers  key parts may be available only from a single supplier or a limited group of suppliers 
operations at our suppliers facilities are subject to disruption for a variety of reasons  including work stoppages  fire  earthquake  flooding or other natural disasters 
such disruption could interrupt our manufacturing 
our business may be harmed if we do not receive sufficient parts to meet our production requirements in a timely and cost effective manner 
we may make additional acquisitions in the future  and these acquisitions may subject us to risks associated with integrating these businesses into our current business 
although we have no commitments or agreements for any acquisitions  we have made  and plan in the future to make  acquisitions of  or significant investments in  businesses with complementary products  services or technologies 
acquisitions involve numerous risks  many of which are unpredictable and beyond our control  including difficulties and increased costs in connection with integration of the personnel  operations  technologies and products of acquired companies  diversion of management s attention from other operational matters  the potential loss of key employees of acquired companies  lack of synergy  or inability to realize expected synergies  resulting from the acquisition  the risk that the issuance of our common stock in a transaction could be dilutive to our shareholders if anticipated synergies are not realized  and acquired assets becoming impaired as a result of technological advancements or worse than expected performance by the acquired company 
our inability to effectively manage these acquisition risks could materially and adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
in addition  if we issue equity securities to pay for an acquisition the ownership percentage of our existing shareholders would be reduced and the value of the shares held by our existing shareholders could be diluted 
if we use cash to pay for an acquisition the payment could significantly reduce the cash that would be available to fund our operations or to use for other purposes 
in addition  the accounting for future acquisitions could result in significant charges resulting from amortization of intangible assets related to such acquisitions 
our markets are subject to rapid technological change  and to compete effectively we must continually introduce new products that achieve market acceptance 
the markets for our products are characterized by rapid technological change and innovation  frequent new product introductions  changes in customer requirements and evolving industry standards 
our future performance will depend on the successful development  introduction and market acceptance of new and enhanced products that address technological changes as well as current and potential customer requirements 
the introduction by us or by our competitors of new and enhanced products may cause our customers to defer or cancel orders for our existing products  which may harm our operating results 
we have in the past experienced a slowdown in demand for our existing products and delays in new product development  and similar delays may occur in the future 
we also may not be able to develop the underlying core technologies necessary to create new products and enhancements or  where necessary  to license these technologies from others 
product development delays may result from numerous factors  including changing product specifications and customer requirements  difficulties in hiring and retaining necessary technical personnel  difficulties in reallocating engineering resources and overcoming resource limitations  difficulties with contract manufacturers  changing market or competitive product requirements  and unanticipated engineering complexities 
the development of new  technologically advanced products is a complex and uncertain process  requiring high levels of innovation and highly skilled engineering and development personnel  as well as the accurate anticipation of technological and market trends 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to identify  develop  manufacture  market or support new or enhanced products successfully  if at all  or on a timely basis 
further  we cannot assure you that our new products will gain market acceptance or that we will be able to respond effectively to product announcements by competitors  technological changes or emerging industry standards 
any failure to respond to technological change would significantly harm our business 
we are exposed to the risks that others may violate our proprietary rights  and our intellectual property rights may not be well protected in foreign countries 
our success is dependent upon the protection of our proprietary rights 
in the high technology industry  intellectual property is an important asset that is always at risk of infringement 
we incur substantial costs to obtain and maintain patents and defend our intellectual property 
for example  we have initiated litigation alleging that certain parties have violated various patents of ours 
we rely upon the laws of the united states and of foreign countries in which we develop  manufacture or sell our products to protect our proprietary rights 
these proprietary rights may not provide the competitive advantages that we expect  however  or other parties may challenge  invalidate or circumvent these rights 
further  our efforts to protect our intellectual property may be less effective in some foreign countries where intellectual property rights are not as well protected as in the united states 
many us companies have encountered substantial problems in protecting their proprietary rights against infringement in foreign countries 
if we fail to adequately protect our intellectual property in these countries  it could be easier for our competitors to sell competing products in foreign countries 
we may be subject to claims of intellectual property infringement 
several of our competitors hold patents covering a variety of technologies  applications and methods of use similar to some of those used in our products 
from time to time  we and our customers have received correspondence from our competitors claiming that some of our products  as used by our customers  may be infringing one or more of these patents 
for example  in february and august  cognex corporation and gsi lumonics  respectively  filed lawsuits against us claiming we infringed patents owned by each of them 
competitors or others may assert infringement claims against our customers or us in the future with respect to current or future products or uses  and these assertions may result in costly litigation or require us to obtain a license to use intellectual property rights of others 
if claims of infringement are asserted against our customers  those customers may seek indemnification from us for damages or expenses they incur 
if we become subject to infringement claims  we will evaluate our position and consider the available alternatives  which may include seeking licenses to use the technology in question or defending our position 
these licenses  however  may not be available on satisfactory terms or at all 
if we are not able to negotiate the necessary licenses on commercially reasonable terms or successfully defend our position  our financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected 
we are exposed to the risks of operating a global business  including risks associated with exchange rate fluctuations and legal and regulatory changes 
international shipments accounted for of net sales for fiscal  with of our net sales to customers in asia 
we expect that international shipments will continue to represent a significant percentage of net sales in the future 
our non us sales and operations are subject to risks inherent in conducting business abroad  many of which are outside our control  including the following periodic local or geographic economic downturns and unstable political conditions  price and currency exchange controls  fluctuation in the relative values of currencies  difficulties protecting intellectual property  unexpected changes in trading policies  regulatory requirements  tariffs and other barriers  and difficulties in managing a global enterprise  including staffing  collecting accounts receivable  managing distributors and representatives and repatriation of earnings 
in addition  our ability to address normal business transaction issues internationally is at risk due to outbreaks of serious contagious diseases 
for example  in response to the recent severe acute respiratory syndrome outbreak in asia  management limited travel to asia in accordance with the world health organization s recommendations 
our direct sales force in asia exposes us to the risks related to employing persons in foreign countries 
we have established direct sales and service organizations in china  taiwan  korea and singapore 
previously  we sold our products through a network of commission based sales representatives in these countries 
our shift to a direct sales model in these regions involves risks 
for example  we may encounter labor shortages or disputes that could inhibit our ability to effectively sell and market our products 
we also are subject to compliance with the labor laws and other laws governing employers in these countries and we will incur additional costs to comply with these regulatory schemes 
additionally we will incur new fixed operating expenses associated with the direct sales organizations  particularly payroll related costs and lease expenses 
if amounts saved on commission payments formerly paid to our sales representatives do not offset these expenses  our operating results may be adversely affected 
our business is highly competitive  and if we fail to compete effectively  our business will be harmed 
the industries in which we operate are highly competitive 
we face substantial competition from established competitors  some of which have greater financial  engineering  manufacturing and marketing resources than we do 
if we are unable to compete effectively with these companies  our market share may decline and our business could be harmed 
our competitors can be expected to continue to improve the design and performance of their products and to introduce new products 
furthermore  our technological advantages may be reduced or lost as a result of technological advances by our competitors 
their greater resources in these areas may enable them to better withstand periodic downturns  compete more effectively on the basis of price and technology  and more quickly develop enhancements to and new generations of products 
in addition  new companies may in the future enter the markets in which we compete  further increasing competition in those markets 
we believe that our ability to compete successfully depends on a number of factors  including performance of our products  quality of our products  reliability of our products  cost of using our products  our ability to ship products on the schedule required  quality of the technical service we provide  timeliness of the services we provide  our success in developing new products and enhancements  existing market and economic conditions  and price of our products as compared to our competitors products 
we may not be able to compete successfully in the future  and increased competition may result in price reductions  reduced profit margins  and loss of market share 
possibilities of terrorist attacks have increased uncertainties for our business 
like other us companies  our business and operating results are subject to uncertainties arising out of the possibility of terrorist attacks  including the potential worsening or extension of the current global economic slowdown  the economic consequences of military action or additional terrorist activities and associated political instability  and the impact of heightened security concerns on domestic and international travel and commerce 
in particular  due to these uncertainties we are subject to the risk that future tightening of immigration controls may adversely affect the residence status of non us engineers and other key technical employees in our us facilities or our ability to hire new non us employees in such facilities  the risk of more frequent instances of shipping delays  and the risk that demand for our products may not increase or may decrease 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk as of may   our investment portfolio includes marketable debt securities of million 
these securities are subject to interest rate risk and will decline in value if interest rates increase 
these securities are classified as securities available for sale  therefore  the impact of interest rate changes is reflected as a separate component of shareholder s equity 
due to the short duration of our investment portfolio  an immediate increase in interest rates would not have a material effect on our financial condition or the results of our operations 
our million aggregate principal amount of convertible subordinated notes due are at a fixed interest rate 
therefore  there is no associated volatility 
the fair value of the convertible notes at may   based on recent open market trades  was million 
foreign currency exchange rate risk we have limited involvement with derivative financial instruments and do not use them for trading purposes 
we do  however  use derivatives to manage well defined foreign currency risks 
we enter into forward exchange contracts to hedge forecasted japanese sales commitments and the value of accounts receivable primarily denominated in japanese yen and other material non functional monetary asset and liability balances 
the impact of exchange rates on the forward contracts will be substantially offset by the impact of such changes on the underlying transactions 
the effect of an immediate change in exchange rates on the forward exchange contracts and the underlying hedged positions would not be material to our financial position or the results of our operations 
the table below summarizes  by major currency  the notional amounts of our forward exchange contracts in us dollars as of may  and june  the bought amounts represent the net us dollar equivalents of commitments to purchase foreign currencies  and the sold amounts represent the net us dollar equivalent of commitments to sell foreign currencies 
the foreign currency amounts have been translated into a us dollar equivalent value using the exchange rate at the reporting date
