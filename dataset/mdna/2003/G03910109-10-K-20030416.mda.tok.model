liquidity and capital resources our liquidity and capital resources are a measure of our overall financial strength and our ability to generate cash flows from our operations to meet operating and growth needs 
our principal sources of funds are premiums received  net investment income  proceeds from investments called  redeemed or sold  and cash and short term investments 
the principal obligations and uses of the funds are to post collateral for the statutory reserves ceded to us by us based insurers and reinsurers  the payment of policy benefits  acquisition and operating expenses and the purchase of investments 
under the terms of our reinsurance agreements  we are required to provide letters of credit or fund trust accounts with liquid assets to satisfy the collateral requirements of our cedents 
at december  and  letters of credit totaling  and  respectively  issued in the ordinary course of our business had been issued by our bankers in favor of certain ceding insurance companies including our us operating subsidiary to provide security and meet regulatory requirements 
at december  and  cash and investments of approximately  and  respectively  were pledged as collateral for letters of credit 
at december  and  cash investments of  and  respectively  were held in trust for the benefit of certain of our ceding insurance companies to provide security and to meet regulatory requirements 

table of contents we have two reinsurance operating subsidiaries  the largest of which is based in and operates out of bermuda 
our other reinsurance operating subsidiary is based in and operates out of the united states 
our bermuda operating subsidiary reinsures a large portion of the reinsurance business written by our us operating subsidiary 
the primary purpose of this reinsurance is to provide reinsurance capacity to our us operating subsidiary so that it can compete in its market place 
our bermuda operating subsidiary also has made capital infusions into our us operating subsidiary to allow the us company to maintain targeted statutory surplus levels and to provide cash and securities as collateral for the reinsurance cessions our us operating subsidiary makes to our bermuda operating subsidiary 
at december   approximately  of our cash and cash equivalents and fixed income securities were held by our us operating subsidiary and was not available to us or our bermuda operating subsidiary to maintain its statutory capital and surplus to fund liquidity or collateral needs 
as discussed below  in we entered into a reinsurance agreement with a reinsurer to cede excess us statutory reserves to the reinsurer 
under that reinsurance agreement  we were required to make cash deposits of  with that reinsurer 
in  we classified those deposits as a component of operating cash flows in our consolidated statements of cash flows 
for the year  we are classifying the return of those deposits in connection with the termination of the reinsurance agreement as a component of financing cash flows  and have reclassified the  of deposits in as a component of financing cash flows in our consolidated statements of cash flows to maintain comparability between the two years 
after giving effect to this reclassification  net cash used by operations was  for the year ended december   as compared with net cash provided by operating activities of  for the year ended december  our negative operating cash flow for the year was primarily the result of the xl life transaction at december  in which we novated five blocks of reinsurance agreements to xl life 
in connection with these novations  we paid cash to xl life to fund the gaap liabilities they assumed and closing costs associated with the transaction  offset in part by a net ceding commission paid to us 
the quota share retrocession business back to us on four of the five blocks of novated agreements was done on a modified coinsurance basis  and  as a result  no cash was paid to us for the gaap reserves we reassumed 
our positive cash flows from investing activities are the result of significant sales of securities we made 
the proceeds of those sales were used to return cash deposits to a reinsurer  which caused our negative cash flows from financing activities 
for  virtually all cash flow was used to fund trust accounts or secure letters of credit 
as of december   after giving effect to the novation of certain of our life reinsurance contracts to xl life  we did not have sufficient available cash or investments to post collateral to satisfy all of our obligations under certain of our reinsurance treaties 
this shortfall was primarily attributable to collateral requirements asserted by the cedent under our largest guaranteed minimum death benefit contract 
since that date  our cedents have asserted that we must satisfy additional substantial collateral requirements  bringing the total asserted collateral requirements to approximately  in excess of amounts we currently have posted 
we are currently analyzing these asserted collateral requirements and have not concluded that such amounts are in fact required to be posted as collateral under the relevant reinsurance contracts 
in an effort to meet or reduce our collateral requirements and improve our liquidity  we have novated  terminated or negotiated the recapture of several of our annuity and life reinsurance contracts  including our second largest annuity reinsurance contract and certain of our more profitable life contracts 
pro forma financial information giving effect to certain of these transactions is presented below under the heading pro forma effects of recent transactions 
we currently have approximately  of outstanding letters of credit issued on our behalf by citibank 
in october  citibank agreed to extend our unsecured letter of credit facility into in exchange for our agreement to secure or eliminate the letter of credit facility by june  if we are unable to secure or eliminate the letter of credit facility by that date  citibank will not renew the outstanding letters of credit at december   at which time our customers may draw on such letters of credit  and we will be obligated to repay citibank for any amounts paid to our customers up to  at december   we had a  letter of credit outstanding under a letter of credit facility with manufacturer s life insurance company that had been posted as security to allow our us operating subsidiary to take credit on its statutory financial statements for reinsurance ceded to our bermuda operating 
table of contents company 
on february   we were served with a statutory demand under bermuda law from manulife related to our alleged failure to return or collateralize the letter of credit manulife issued on our behalf 
on february   we filed an application with the bermuda supreme court seeking an injunction to prevent manulife from filing proceedings to wind up our business on the basis that manulife is not a creditor of ours and therefore did not have standing to make the statutory demand 
on march   the court held in our favor and issued an injunction preventing manulife from commencing winding up proceedings based upon that demand 
since that date  as the result of recaptures of certain reinsurance agreements by cedents of our us operating subsidiary  the need for manulife s letter of credit facility has been eliminated  and the letter of credit has been terminated 
during  we had entered into a reinsurance agreement with a reinsurer to cede excess us statutory reserves the amount by which our cedents us statutory reserves exceed our us gaap reserves for certain life insurance contracts subject to certain state statutory regulations known as triple x to the reinsurer 
under the agreement  the reinsurer was obligated to make cash deposits with us that were used to fund the collateral requirements associated with these excess us statutory reserves 
prior to december   we had received deposits of  from the reinsurer 
this reinsurance agreement did not qualify for reinsurance accounting under us gaap 
as a result  funds received under this contract were recorded as a deposit liability 
we were also required to deposit funds with the reinsurer in connection with the reinsurance agreement  which funds had accumulated to approximately  at december  these funds were included in deposits and other reinsurance receivables on our balance sheet 
we received the benefit of investment income from the investment of the funds received and our deposit with the reinsurer  and we paid the reinsurer certain fees associated with the contract 
for the year  these fees were  and were included in collateral expenses on our income statement 
in connection with the novation of certain of our reinsurance contracts to xl life  we terminated this reinsurance agreement and repaid to the reinsurer the entire  balance owed by us under the agreement at december  in addition  the reinsurer returned to us the  we had deposited with it in connection with the termination of the reinsurance agreement 
at december   our total capitalization  which consisted entirely of equity  was approximately  on march   we filed a shelf registration statement on form s to register under the securities act of  of senior debt to be sold in one or more transactions on a delayed basis 
we subsequently determined that we would not utilize the shelf registration and requested that the securities and exchange commission withdraw the registration statement in march on november   the state of connecticut insurance department and annuity and life reassurance america entered into a letter agreement that acknowledges that the connecticut insurance department is monitoring the financial condition of our united states operating subsidiary and such letter agreement requires that certain financial transactions entered into by the subsidiary  including disposal of assets  payment of dividends and settlement of inter company balances with our bermuda operating subsidiary  be pre approved by the connecticut insurance department 
in addition  the connecticut insurance department has requested weekly reports from senior management of annuity and life reassurance america on our status and any changes in the status of annuity and life reassurance america 
the letter agreement continues to be effective until march  we have no material commitments for capital expenditures as of december   but as noted above  we have significant obligations that we will not be able to satisfy unless we are able to negotiate the termination  recapture or novation of certain reinsurance agreements on favorable terms  or raise additional capital 
since beginning our efforts in september  we also have been unable to raise capital  and there can be no assurances that our efforts to raise capital or pursue other strategic alternatives will be successful 
while we plan to continue to receive premiums and pay claims under our remaining reinsurance treaties  we have ceased to write new reinsurance agreements and have notified our existing clients that we will not be accepting any new business under existing treaties on their current terms 
we do not anticipate resuming to write new reinsurance agreements in the foreseeable future 
our plans for the future involve attempting to meet or reduce the additional collateral requirements of our ceding companies by continuing to negotiate the 
table of contents recapture  retrocession  novation or sale of certain of our reinsurance agreements  although there can be no assurance that we will be able to negotiate favorable terms for such transactions 
we have also instituted substantial premium rate increases on all of our non guaranteed premium yearly renewable term contracts that remain in force 
there can be no assurance that our plans will be sufficient to improve our operations or liquidity 
if we are not successful in implementing our plans  or if those plans are insufficient  we will not be able to satisfy our obligations in and will likely be required to liquidate our business if we cannot successfully pursue any other strategic alternative 
the report of our independent auditors included in this report contains a paragraph expressing substantial doubt regarding our ability to continue as a going concern 
in our efforts to meet our future collateral and liquidity needs  we will be required to rationalize our infrastructure costs while retaining employees with the skills and knowledge that we need to implement our plan 
in this regard  we may elect to settle our claims for repayment of amounts owed to us by certain of our officers who have indicated they may oppose collection of or be unable to repay these amounts 
such settlements may be for less than the amounts owed us  if it appears more efficient to do so 
quarterly dividends of per common share were declared and paid in each quarter of and both we and our bermuda operating subsidiary  annuity and life reassurance  are required to comply with the provisions of the bermuda companies act that regulate the payment of dividends and the making of distributions from contributed surplus 
neither we nor annuity and life reassurance may declare or pay a dividend  or make a distribution out of contributed surplus  if there are reasonable grounds for believing that i the relevant company is  or would be after the payment  unable to pay its liabilities as they become due  or ii the realizable value of the relevant company s assets would thereby be less than the aggregate of its liabilities and its issued share capital and share premium accounts 
as of december   we could not reasonably determine that we met these grounds 
accordingly  on february   we announced that we would not declare or pay a dividend on our common shares during the first quarter of the declaration and payment of future dividends to holders of our common shares will be at the discretion of our board of directors and will depend upon our earnings and financial condition  capital requirements of our subsidiaries  the ability of our operating subsidiaries to pay dividends to us  regulatory considerations and other factors the board of directors deems relevant 
for a discussion of other factors affecting our ability to pay dividends  see item business regulation and results of operations liquidity and capital resources and note to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report 
we do not expect to declare or pay dividends in the near future 
currently  there is no bermuda withholding tax on dividends paid by us to shareholders 
during  our board of directors approved a share repurchase program of up to  of our common shares 
while our board has given us the flexibility to repurchase our common shares in the future if market conditions so dictate  at the present time we do not anticipate repurchasing any common shares 
pro forma effects of recent transactions in an effort to meet the collateral needs of as many of our cedents as possible  we have entered into two significant transactions and several smaller transactions  which in the aggregate have had  and will have  a substantial impact on our business 
to highlight the effects of these transactions on our business  we have prepared a pro forma consolidated balance sheet as of december  and a pro forma consolidated statement of operations for the year ended december  the pro forma consolidated balance sheet as of december  is intended to demonstrate how our consolidated balance sheet as of december   as reported in our consolidated financial statements contained in this report  would look in light of novations  recaptures and terminations of certain of our reinsurance agreements that have occurred between january  and march  the pro forma consolidated statement of operations for the year ended december  is intended to illustrate how our consolidated statements of operations  which is included in our consolidated financial statements contained in this report  would look if the novations  recaptures  and terminations that occurred during and through march  had occurred prior to january  
table of contents the transactions that are the subject of the following pro forma financial statements are as follows on december   we entered into a transaction with xl life ltd  a subsidiary of xl capital ltd pursuant to which we transferred certain blocks of life reinsurance business to xl life 
the transaction enabled us to reduce a substantial portion of our year end collateral requirements under our reinsurance agreements and to repay deposits received under a reinsurance agreement to which we were a party 
we novated five blocks of life reinsurance business to xl life  which in turn entered into a quota share reinsurance contract with us with respect to four of those blocks of business 
the effects of this transaction  including  of charges  are not presented as having a pro forma impact in the pro forma balance sheet because they are already reflected in our consolidated balance sheet as of december   which is included in our consolidated financial statements contained in this report 
the xl life transaction is presented as having a pro forma impact in the pro forma statement of operations 
specifically  the pro forma statement of operations assumes that the block of business transferred to xl life that is not covered by the quota share were never written by us 
further  the pro forma statements of operations assumes that the four blocks of business that are covered by the quota share reinsurance policy were originally written by us on that basis and that xl life will not exercise its right to recapture those four blocks of business given that our current financial strength ratings are below the levels required by that reinsurance agreement 
additionally  the pro forma statement of operations excludes charges and expenses of approximately  associated with the xl life transaction 
these charges and expenses are primarily the result of a write down of deferred acquisition costs of approximately  which was partially offset by a net ceding commission paid to us by xl life of approximately  a write off of prepaid expenses related to the reinsurance agreement of approximately  and transaction costs of approximately  in addition  the pro forma statement of operations assumes we never entered into the reinsurance agreement that provided us with cash deposits we used to fund the collateral requirements of our cedents  which was terminated on december  in connection with the xl life transaction 
in february   we entered into a termination agreement with the ohio national life insurance company terminating our annuity reinsurance agreement 
pursuant to the terms of the termination agreement  the parties agreed to release and discharge one another from any and all claims  demands  causes of action and or damages relating to the reinsurance agreement effective january  in consideration  ohio national agreed to pay us  as adjusted for certain amounts payable to ohio national under the reinsurance agreement as of january   resulting in a net payment to us of approximately  the pro forma balance sheet shows the pro forma effects of the termination of this agreement as if it had occurred on the same terms and conditions as of december  and the pro forma statement of operations assumes that we had terminated the reinsurance agreement with ohio national prior to january  in addition to the transactions described above  we also negotiated the termination or recapture of other reinsurance contracts during and through march   resulting in the write down of deferred acquisition costs and cash payments made to cedents  net of reserve releases associated with those terminations or recaptures 
the pro forma balance sheet shows the pro forma effects of those terminations and recaptures as if each had occurred on the same terms and conditions as of december   and the pro forma statement of operations assumes that we had terminated or negotiated the recapture of each of those agreements prior to january  the following pro forma figures should not be considered indicative of our expected results of operations and financial condition in for a discussion of certain factors that could materially and adversely affect our operations and or cause our actual results of operations to differ from those expressed  please see forward looking statements

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk is the risk of loss arising from adverse changes in market rates and prices  such as interest rates  foreign currency exchange rates  and other relevant market rate or price changes 
the following is a discussion of our primary market risk exposures and how those exposures are currently managed as of december  our major market risk exposure is changing interest rates  primarily in the united states 
we have a portfolio of fixed income investments and a change in interest rates will affect the fair value of our investments and may affect our operating results and financial condition 
interest rate risk is managed with effective maturity structures and with the application of duration management practices 
we have no equity securities in our general account 
we have significant market risk  including equity risk  from our largest annuity reinsurance contract  our guaranteed minimum death benefit contracts and our guaranteed minimum income benefit contracts 
during  we utilized two interest rate swap agreements to manage our interest rate risk related to deposits received under one of our reinsurance agreements 
these swap agreements  which did not qualify for hedge accounting  were terminated in january  and we do not currently use derivative financial instruments such as futures and options to manage risk in our general account or assumed through our reinsurance agreements  although we may do so in the future 
we manage other risks  including credit and liquidity  in the normal course of business 
in managing credit risk  we establish overall quality and rating guidelines and place limits on credit exposure by issuer and industry to achieve appropriate diversification in the portfolio 
we do not have a trading portfolio and are not exposed to market risk from trading activities 
our primary market risk exposures for the year ended december  have not changed since the year ended december  however  due to continued financial market deterioration  we now utilize certain revised investment return assumptions in determining our write downs of deferred acquisition costs related to our annuity reinsurance agreement with transamerica 
we have now also started making claim payments and increased our reserves related to minimum guarantees associated with certain variable annuity contracts 
the table below presents as of december  the amortized cost amounts and related weighted average interest rates by years of maturity for our investment portfolio 
mortgage backed securities are included in the table by anticipated year of maturity 
weighted weighted cash and cash average fixed maturity average weighted average interest rates by maturity equivalents interest rate investments interest rate dollars in thousands thereafter total fair value sensitivity analysis and duration modeling are used to estimate changes in fair values of fixed income investments and the potential effects on operating earnings and cash flows resulting from possible near term changes in interest rates 
the term near term means a period of time going forward up to one year from the date of our consolidated financial statements 
durations of fixed income investments are adjusted for call  put and reset features 
portfolio durations are calculated on a market value weighted basis  including accrued investment income 
our duration model uses a basis point change in interest rates to measure the hypothetical change in fair value of financial instruments included in the model 
the duration model produces 
table of contents a loss in fair value of the fixed income investments of approximately  based on a basis point increase in interest rates as of december  conversely  gains of similar amounts are produced by the model with a basis point decrease in interest rates 
actual results may differ from the hypothetical change in fair values assumed in this disclosure  especially since the analysis does not and cannot reflect the results of any actions that would be taken by us to mitigate losses or to optimize gains in fair values 
we believe that our life insurance liabilities are not highly interest rate sensitive as they arise from traditional reinsurance arrangements and  therefore  the effects of fluctuating interest rates on these liability cash flows are not significant 
our annuity reinsurance contracts are generally regarded as market and interest rate sensitive 
the future earnings and cash flows of the annuity product line are primarily dependent on earning a spread the difference between the interest earned on the supporting asset base and the rate credited to policyholders and persistency of the underlying business 
our cedents  or their designated asset managers  manage all assets supporting interest sensitive contracts liabilities 
if these assets do not achieve investment returns at rates sufficient to meet our obligations on the underlying policies  we could experience unexpected losses 
for example  under our annuity reinsurance agreement with transamerica  the minimum interest guarantees on the underlying policies have exceeded the underlying policyholder account values due to poor investment performance  and we have been forced to fund our proportionate share of the shortfall out of our general assets  which has resulted in significant losses 
during and  we determined the extent to which the minimum interest guarantees on the policies underlying the transamerica contract had been exposed and  as a result  wrote down our deferred acquisition cost asset by  in and an additional  was written down in in determining the  write down of our deferred acquisition costs  we assumed absolute investment returns on convertible bonds of for the first half of and for the second half of  and annualized for each year thereafter 
additionally  we assumed annual investment returns of on investment grade bonds in and in each year thereafter  and for each year on each other asset class in which policyholder premiums have been invested 
we also assumed a lapse rate for the underlying policies of in  in  and in these assumed lapse rates include assumptions regarding full surrenders  partial withdrawals  annuitizations and policyholder deaths 
consistent with our accounting policies  we review the key assumptions used in determining the carrying value of our deferred acquisition cost each quarter 
a change in these assumptions could result in additional charges that would adversely impact future earnings 
if our assumptions for investment return prove to be inaccurate  or if lapse rates exceed our assumptions  we may be required to make additional minimum interest guarantee payments and record additional charges  which would adversely impact future earnings 
assuming no change in lapse assumptions  the net impact of a basis point decrease in our investment return assumptions in all future years would have required an additional write down of deferred acquisition costs of approximately  as of december  assuming no change in our investment return assumptions  an initial increase in our lapse assumptions on our transamerica annuity contract in all future years would have required an additional write down of deferred acquisition costs of approximately  as of december  subsequent increases of our lapse assumptions might result in larger incremental increases in the required write downs of deferred acquisition costs 
certain of our modified coinsurance and coinsurance funds withheld annuity reinsurance agreements have features that constitute embedded derivatives that require bifurcation and separate accounting under fas accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
we have identified an embedded derivative  similar to a total return swap arrangement  within our funds withheld at interest receivable asset that we record in connection with these agreements 
the valuation of these embedded derivatives requires complex cash flow modeling and assumptions  most notably with respect to expected future cash flows 
the net fair value of these derivatives is classified on our balance sheet as a component of our funds withheld asset 
changes in the fair value of these derivatives are reported in net income as net change in fair value of embedded derivatives 
while we believe these estimates of future cash flows and other assumptions in our models are reasonable when made  the assumptions used are subjective and may require adjustment in the 
table of contents future 
in addition  as industry standards for estimating the fair value of embedded derivatives develop  we may modify our methodology 
the methodology we use to determine the fair value of the embedded derivatives in our annuity reinsurance agreements that require bifurcation and separate accounting under fas is to determine the fair value of the host contract notional asset based upon expected future cash flows under the annuity contracts 
the fair value of the embedded derivative is calculated as being the market value of the actual assets less the fair value of the notional asset 
the change in fair value of the embedded derivative is influenced by changes in credit risk  changes in expected future cash flows under the annuity contracts and interest rate changes 
this methodology  which applies to all of our fixed annuity reinsurance contracts other than transamerica  results in a valuation of the embedded derivative reflecting the market risk inherent in the underlying contracts 
sensitivity analysis on the assets and liabilities associated with the underlying reinsurance agreements 
as of december   the net impact on our embedded derivatives of a basis point increase or decrease in credit spreads is a loss or gain on the embedded derivative of approximately  respectively 
as of december   the net impact on our embedded derivatives of a basis point increase or decrease in interest rates as a result of duration mismatching is a gain or loss on the embedded derivative of approximately  respectively 
the duration of the actual assets is approximately years and the duration of the notional asset is approximately years 
as a result  we believe the impact of interest rate movements on the embedded derivative will be small 
the table below shows the change in our embedded derivatives by quarter for change in embedded embedded derivative derivative value at fair value first quarter second quarter third quarter fourth quarter for comparative purposes  the table below shows the change in our embedded derivatives by quarter for change in embedded embedded derivative derivative value at fair value cumulative effect first quarter second quarter third quarter fourth quarter we implemented fas effective as of the first quarter of and  consequently  include the cumulative effect of the change in accounting principle prior to in the table above 
our accounting policy for guaranteed minimum death benefit  minimum guaranteed income benefit and enhanced earnings benefit contracts is discussed in note to our consolidated financial statements for the fiscal year ended december  as of december   we had established reserves of approximately  related to these types of minimum guarantees associated with variable annuity products 
these reserves are calculated on the basis of actuarial assumptions related to projected benefits and related contract charges over the lives of the contracts 
our reserve methodology for these variable annuity minimum guarantee products is not directly market sensitive  although we do make assumptions about the state of the financial markets when we establish our reserves for these exposures 

table of contents under the methodology contained in a proposed statement of position issued by the american institute of certified public accountants entitled accounting and reporting by insurance enterprises for certain nontraditional long duration contracts and for separate accounts  at december   march  and june   we estimate that no reserves for these types of minimum guarantees would have been required had we been utilizing the methodology in the proposed statement of position  while at september  and december   reserves of approximately  and  respectively  would have been required
