item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations general whole foods market opened its first store in texas in and has expanded its operations to stores as of september  both by opening new stores and acquiring existing stores from third parties 
we operate in one reportable segment  natural and organic foods supermarkets 
we currently have one store in toronto  ontario  canada 
all of our remaining operations are domestic 
our results of operations have been and may continue to be materially affected by the timing and number of new store openings 
new stores generally become profitable during their first year of operation  although some new stores may incur operating losses for the first one to three years of operations 
our results of operations are reported on a or week fiscal year ending on the last sunday in september 
fiscal years and are week years and fiscal year is a week year 
in november  the company adopted a plan to dispose of the naturesmart business of manufacturing and direct marketing of nutritional supplements 
the naturesmart business and related net assets were recorded as discontinued operations in the consolidated financial statements  and as of september   substantially all activities associated with discontinued operations have been completed 
the following discussion and analysis refer only to continuing operations 
results of operations the following table sets forth the statements of operations data of whole foods market expressed as a percentage of total sales for the fiscal years indicated sales cost of goods sold and occupancy costs gross profit direct store expenses general and administrative expenses goodwill amortization pre opening and relocation costs store closure and asset disposal costs operating income other income expense interest expense investment and other income income from continuing operations before income taxes and equity in losses of unconsolidated affiliates provision for income taxes equity in losses of unconsolidated affiliates income from continuing operations gain on disposal of discontinued operations  net of income taxes net income figures may not add due to rounding 
sales sales from continuing operations increased  and in fiscal years  and  respectively 
sales for all years shown reflect increases due to new stores opened and acquired and comparable store sales increases of approximately  and in fiscal years  and  respectively 
sales of a store are deemed to be comparable commencing in the fifty third full week after the store was opened or acquired 
identical store sales  which excludes remodels with expansions of square footage greater than and relocations  increased approximately   and in fiscal years  and  respectively 
sales from relocations and remodels with expansions of square footage greater than are excluded from identical store sales data to reduce the impact of square footage growth on the comparison 
our comparable and identical store sales increases generally resulted from an increase in the number of customer transactions and slightly higher average transaction amounts  reflecting an increase in market share as the stores mature in a particular market 
these increases are due to such factors as customers increasing their amount of purchases with us over time  improvements in overall store execution  stronger brand awareness and increased sales of perishables and private label products

index to financial statements gross profit gross profit consists of sales less cost of goods sold and occupancy costs plus contribution from non retail distribution and food preparation operations 
our gross profit from continuing operations as a percentage of sales was   and in fiscal years  and  respectively 
gross profit margin in fiscal year reflects higher occupancy costs  including utilities  repairs  and rent  higher lifo charges compared to the prior year  and market driven pricing strategies 
gross profit margins in fiscal years and were negatively impacted by lower margins at the harry s farmers market stores that were acquired in october in all years  gross profit margins were positively affected by increased national buying  category management and private label initiatives  which lower the cost of product purchased on a national basis 
additionally  continued improvement by new stores with respect to product procurement  merchandising and controlling shrink has positively affected gross profit 
in all years  gross profit margins were also positively affected by margin improvements as stores mature 
relative to other stores in a region  gross profit margins tend to be lower for new stores and increase as stores mature  reflecting lower shrink as volumes increase  as well as increasing experience levels and operational efficiencies of the store teams 
direct store expenses direct store expenses from continuing operations as a percentage of sales was approximately  and in fiscal years  and  respectively 
for all years  higher direct operating expenses of new stores continue to have a partially offsetting impact on store contribution 
direct store expense as a percentage of sales tends to be higher for new stores and decrease as stores mature  reflecting increasing operational productivity of the store teams 
we continue to focus on improvements in leveraging of labor  managing health care benefits plan costs and other direct expenses to produce incremental improvements in direct store expense as a percentage of sales 
general and administrative expenses general and administrative expenses from continuing operations as a percentage of sales were  and in fiscal years  and  respectively 
fiscal year general and administrative expenses decreased as a percentage of sales due to a strong focus on leveraging general and administrative expenses at both regional and national levels 
fiscal year general and administrative expenses reflect increased costs of infrastructure for the new south region and increases in other regions and the national office 
for fiscal year  general and administrative expenses reflect increases in wage costs and depreciation from investments in information systems 
we continue to focus on leveraging general and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales  but do not expect significant additional leverage in fiscal year over leverage generated in fiscal year pre opening and relocation costs pre opening costs include costs associated with hiring and training personnel  supplies and certain occupancy and miscellaneous costs related to new store and facility openings 
pre opening costs are incurred primarily in the days prior to a new store or facility opening

index to financial statements the following table shows expirations per period on commercial commitments as of september  in thousands total less than year years after years credit facility we periodically make other commitments and become subject to other contractual obligations that we believe to be routine in nature and incidental to the operation of the business

the company announced its first quarterly dividend on november  a cash dividend of cents per share is payable january  to shareholders of record as of january  the company will pay future dividends at the discretion of the board of directors 
the continuation of these payments  the amount of such dividends  and the form in which the dividends are paid cash or stock depend on many factors  including the results of operations and the financial condition of the company 
the company s bank credit agreement was amended on november  to allow for the payment of dividends on common stock 
our principal historical capital requirements have been the funding of the development or acquisition of new stores and acquisition of property and equipment for existing stores 
the required cash investment for new stores varies depending on the size of the new store  geographic location  degree of work performed by the landlord and complexity of site development issues 
over the past three fiscal years  our new store investment has averaged approximately million per location 
this excludes new store inventory of approximately  a portion of which is financed by our vendors

absent any significant cash acquisition or change in status of the company s outstanding zero coupon convertible bond issue  we expect planned expansion and other anticipated working capital and capital expenditure requirements will be funded by cash generated from operations 
we continually evaluate the need to establish other sources of working capital and will seek those considered appropriate based upon the company s needs and market conditions 
critical accounting policies the preparation of our financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues  expenses and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities 
actual results may differ from these estimates 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions and factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate the continued appropriateness of our accounting policies and resulting estimates to make adjustments we consider appropriate under the facts and circumstances 
we have chosen accounting policies that we believe are appropriate to report accurately and fairly our operating results and financial position  and we apply those accounting policies in a consistent manner 
our significant accounting policies are summarized in note to the consolidated financial statements 
we believe that the following accounting policies are the most critical in the preparation of our financial statements because they involve the most difficult  subjective or complex judgments about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
insurance and self insurance reserves the company uses a combination of insurance and self insurance plans to provide for the potential liabilities for workers compensation  general liability  property insurance  director and officers liability insurance  vehicle liability and employee health care benefits 
liabilities associated with the risks that are retained by the company are estimated  in part  by considering historical claims experience  demographic factors  severity factors and other actuarial assumptions 
while we believe that our assumptions are appropriate  the estimated accruals for these liabilities could be significantly affected if future occurrences and claims differ from these assumptions and historical trends

index to financial statements inventory valuation we value our inventories  both retail and wholesale  at the lower of cost or market 
cost is principally determined by the last in  first out lifo method 
lifo cost was determined using the retail method for approximately of inventories and was determined using the item cost method for approximately of inventories in both fiscal years and the excess of estimated current costs over lifo carrying value was approximately million and million at september  and september   respectively 
under the retail inventory method  the valuation of inventories at cost and the resulting gross margins are determined by applying a cost to retail ratio for various groupings of similar items to the retail value of inventories 
inherent in the retail inventory method calculations are certain management judgments and estimates  including shrinkage  which could impact the ending inventory valuation at cost as well as the resulting gross margins 
costs for the balance of inventories  consisting of the manufactured inventories of allegro coffee company  are determined by the first in  first out fifo method 
we believe we have the appropriate inventory valuation controls in place to minimize the risk that inventory values would be materially misstated 
goodwill and intangible assets in july  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
under sfas no 
 goodwill is no longer amortized but is reviewed for impairment on a reporting unit level annually  or more frequently if impairment indicators arise 
we allocate goodwill to one reporting unit for goodwill impairment testing 
we determine fair value utilizing both a market value method and discounted projected future cash flows compared to our carrying value for the purpose of identifying impairment 
our evaluation of goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite useful lives for impairment requires extensive use of accounting judgment and financial estimates 
application of alternative assumptions and definitions  such as reviewing goodwill for impairment at a different organizational level  could produce significantly different results
