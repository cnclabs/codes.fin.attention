overview we are the nation s leader in recreational vehicle sales  including motor homes  travel trailers  folding trailers and slide in truck campers  and one of the nation s largest producers and retailers of manufactured housing 
in fiscal and for fiscal  we sold  and  recreational vehicles  respectively 
in calendar  we had an percent share of the overall recreational vehicle retail market  consisting of a percent share of the motor home market  a percent share of the travel trailer market and a percent share of the folding trailer market 
in fiscal and for fiscal  we shipped  and  manufactured homes  respectively  and were the second largest producer of hud code homes in the united states in terms of units sold 
in calendar  we had a percent share of the manufactured housing retail market 
our manufacturing activities are conducted in states within the us  and to a much lesser extent in canada 
in addition  we operate five supply companies that provide components for our manufactured housing and recreational vehicle operations  while also generating outside sales 
our business began in producing manufactured homes 
we entered the recreational vehicle business in we distribute our manufactured products primarily through a network of independent dealers throughout the united states and canada 
however  in fiscal  we entered the manufactured housing retail business through a combination of key acquisitions and internal development of new retail sales centers 
at april   we operated retail sales locations in states  and were one of the four largest retailers of manufactured homes in the united states 
critical accounting policies our financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
this requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and notes 
we evaluate these estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis and use historical experience factors and various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances 
the results of these estimates form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities 
actual results could differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
the following is a list of the accounting policies that we believe reflect our more significant judgments and estimates  and that could potentially result in materially different results under different assumptions and conditions 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue in accordance with sec staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition in financial statements sab  as amended by sab a and b 
revenue for manufacturing operations is generally recorded when all of the following conditions have been met an order for a product has been received from a dealer  written or verbal approval for payment has been received from the dealer s flooring institution  a common carrier signs the delivery ticket accepting responsibility for the product as agent for the dealer  and product is removed from fleetwood s property for delivery to the dealer who placed the order 
most manufacturing sales are made on cash terms  with most dealers financing their purchases under flooring arrangements with banks or finance companies 
products are not ordinarily sold on consignment  dealers do not ordinarily have the right to return products  and dealers are typically responsible for interest costs to floorplan lenders 
on average  we receive payments from floorplan lenders on products sold to independent dealers within days of the invoice date  ie the date product is shipped 
to adopt the provisions of sab  in fiscal we changed our retail housing revenue recognition policy 
for retail sales from company owned retail stores  sales revenue is recognized when the home has been delivered  set up and accepted by the consumer  title has been transferred and funds have been received either from the finance company or the homebuyer 
prior to fiscal  we followed the industry practice of recording credit retail sales when a written contract and down payment were secured 
we recorded the cumulative effect of this accounting change on the amount of retained earnings at the beginning of fiscal year as a charge against net income in the second quarter of fiscal the after tax amount of the cumulative effect was million  or cents per diluted share 
warranty fleetwood provides customers of our products with a warranty covering defects in material or workmanship for periods ranging from one to two years  with longer warranties on certain structural components 
we record a liability based on our best estimate of the amounts necessary to settle future and existing claims on products sold as of the balance sheet date 
factors we use in estimating the warranty liability include a history of units sold to customers  the average cost incurred to repair a unit and a profile of the distribution of warranty expenditures over the warranty period 
a significant increase in dealer shop rates  the cost of parts or the frequency of claims could have a material adverse impact on our operating results for the period or periods in which such claims or additional costs materialize 
insurance reserves generally  we are self insured for health benefit  workers compensation  products liability and personal injury insurance 
under these plans  liabilities are recognized for claims incurred including those incurred but not reported  changes in the reserves related to prior claims and an administration fee 
at the time a claim is filed  a liability is estimated to settle the claim 
the liability for workers compensation claims is guided by state statute 
factors considered in establishing the estimated liability for products liability and personal injury claims are the nature of the claim  the geographical region in which the claim originated  loss history  severity of the claim  the professional judgment of our legal counsel  and inflation 
any material change in the aforementioned factors could have an adverse impact on our operating results 
we maintain excess liability insurance with outside insurance carriers to minimize our risks related to catastrophic claims 
deferred taxes deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on temporary differences between income and expenses reported for financial reporting and tax reporting 
we are required to record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that we believe is more likely than not to be realized 
in assessing the need for a valuation allowance  we previously have considered all positive and negative evidence  including scheduled reversals of deferred tax liabilities  projected future taxable income  tax planning strategies and recent financial performance 
the accounting guidance states that forming a conclusion that a valuation allowance is not needed is difficult when there is negative evidence such as cumulative losses in recent years 
as a result of this guidance  our recent cumulative losses and the full utilization of our loss carryback potential  we recently concluded that a partial valuation allowance against our net deferred tax assets was appropriate 
accordingly  as of fiscal year  after considering only the effects of prudent and feasible tax strategies  we recognized a valuation allowance of million 
we continue to believe that the combination of all positive and negative factors will enable us to realize the full value of the deferred tax assets 
if  after future assessments of the realizability of our deferred tax assets  we determine a lesser allowance is required  we would record a reduction to income tax expense and the valuation allowance in the period of such determination 
legal proceedings we are regularly involved in legal proceedings in the ordinary course of our business 
because of the uncertainties related to the outcome of the litigation and range of loss on cases other than breach of warranty  we are generally unable to make a reasonable estimate of the liability that could result from an unfavorable outcome 
in other cases  including products liability discussed above and personal injury cases  we prepare estimates based on historical experience  the professional judgment of our legal counsel  and other assumptions that we believe are reasonable 
as additional information becomes available  we reassess the potential liability related to pending litigation and revise our estimates 
such revisions and any actual liability that greatly exceeds our estimates could materially impact our results of operations and financial position 
repurchase commitments producers of recreational vehicles and manufactured housing customarily enter into repurchase agreements with lending institutions that provide wholesale floorplan financing to independent dealers 
these agreements generally provide that  in the event of a default by a dealer in its obligation to these credit sources  we will repurchase product 
with most repurchase agreements our obligation ceases when the amount for which we are contingently liable to the lending institution has been outstanding for more than  or months  depending on the terms of the agreement 
the contingent liability under these agreements approximates the outstanding principal balance owed by the dealer for units subject to the repurchase agreement less any scheduled principal payments waived by the lender 
although the maximum potential contingent repurchase liability approximated million for inventory at manufactured housing dealers and million for inventory at rv dealers as of april   the risk of loss is reduced by the potential resale value of any products that are subject to repurchase  and is spread over numerous dealers and financial institutions 
the gross repurchase obligation will vary depending on the season and the level of dealer inventories 
typically  the fiscal third quarter repurchase obligation will be greater than other periods due to high dealer inventories 
the rv repurchase obligation is significantly more than the manufactured housing obligation due to a higher average cost per motor home and more units in dealer inventories 
past losses under these agreements have not been significant and lender repurchase demands have been funded out of working capital 
in the past three fiscal years we have had the following repurchase activity fiscal years amounts in millions units repurchase amount loss recognized business outlook late in calendar year  the wholesale motor home market  particularly for gasoline powered class a products  began to improve after about months of decline 
the combination of the improved market and positive acceptance of our new motor home products has been reflected in increased market share and higher production rates  resulting in significantly improved motor home earnings compared with the past two years 
the travel trailer division introduced new products covering percent of its model line up at the national trade show in december even though the dealers were reluctant to increase their inventories with new products during the seasonally slow winter quarter  indications are the new products are being well received by retail customers 
the impact of the new products on production efficiencies negatively affected the operating results in the second half of fiscal year however  we have now begun to experience improved operating efficiencies and expect the travel trailer business to return to profitability in the first quarter of fiscal year with the current low interest rates and the introduction of new products  we expect our rv group will continue to achieve improved operating results in fiscal over fiscal however  the anticipated improvement could be at risk if consumer confidence  which is a key factor affecting the recreational vehicle industry  deteriorates due to concerns regarding the economy  gasoline prices or global tensions 
conditions in the manufactured housing market have been in decline since  and further deteriorated in the last half of fiscal year competition from repossessed homes  more stringent lending standards  relatively high retail interest rates for manufactured housing and the shortage of retail financing have adversely affected the industry 
these conditions were aggravated by several developments during calendar as a result of the exit of several consumer lenders  there has been a reduction in the volume of loans being written  particularly in the chattel  or home only  portion of the business related mostly to single section homes 
further  legislation in texas  the largest manufactured home state in the country  which was effective at the beginning of calendar year  required more restrictive procedures and legal processes to be applied to sales of manufactured homes 
the texas legislature has passed a new law as of june that substantially moderates the effect of the earlier  more restrictive statute 
in march  conseco finance servicing corp 
conseco  the largest floorplan lender in the country  announced its withdrawal from that business 
in october  deutsche financial services deutsche  another large housing wholesale floorplan lender  announced it would be exiting the business 
since the announcements by conseco and deutsche  dealer transition to other floorplan sources has been orderly and most dealers have found alternative sources of inventory financing  including our company owned stores 
in october  conseco  also formerly the largest provider of retail financing to the manufactured housing industry  announced it would no longer provide retail financing in any form and that it would more aggressively liquidate its existing inventory of repossessed homes 
further  oakwood homes  the fourth largest manufacturer  as well as a major retailer and lender of manufactured homes  announced in november that it was filing for chapter bankruptcy protection 
subsequently  conseco and oakwood have been aggressively liquidating their inventories of repossessed homes  which has depressed demand and pricing for new homes 
while we expect the industry will benefit in the longer term from these accelerated efforts to liquidate inventories of repossessed homes  thereby eventually reducing the competition for new homes  we expect we will continue to be challenged by the overhang of repossessions for at least the next year 
in the meantime  industry shipments in the first calendar quarter of were lower than in any other first quarter in the past years 
as a result of these conditions  over the past three years there have been significant industry manufacturing and retail capacity reductions and more are expected until retail finance and inventory conditions improve 
we expect that the operating environment for manufactured housing will continue to be challenging  at least through fiscal year however  a national lender has recently announced its intention to provide manufactured housing retail financing 
depending on the extent of the financing actually provided by this lender  in combination with retail financing that may be provided by other new entrants or that fleetwood may make available through our own homeone credit corp 
finance subsidiary  it is possible that new sources of financing could begin to moderate the effect of restrictive retail financing that has challenged the manufactured housing industry in recent years 
for fiscal  we expect to achieve profitability in the rv group and be above breakeven at the operating line in the manufacturing segment of housing  although we expect we will incur an operating loss at our retail housing business 
overall  the anticipated improved results from our rv group are expected to more than offset the losses from our retail housing segment 
consolidated results fiscal year compared with fiscal year consolidated results in fiscal year  we incurred a net loss of million or per diluted share compared to a net loss of million or per diluted share for the similar period last year 
a substantial portion of last year s loss  million  net of tax  was attributable to a non cash charge for impairment of goodwill related to the adoption of statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  and million to other restructuring and impairment charges 
the net loss for fiscal year was negatively impacted by a million or cent per diluted share partial valuation allowance of our deferred tax assets 
the significantly lower net loss in fiscal year was the result of a million swing in the rv group operating results from a loss of million in fiscal to an operating profit of million in fiscal partially offsetting the turnaround in the rv business segments was a decline in manufactured housing from an operating profit of million  including million in intercompany profit elimination  to an operating loss of million including million of intercompany profit elimination 
over the past three years we have been downsizing our operations  resulting in significant restructuring and other unusual charges that have negatively impacted our results 
a summary is provided below to illustrate the type of adjustments  the business segments affected and the magnitude of the adjustments 
generally  warranty reserve adjustments and inventory write downs related to closed facilities are not considered restructuring 
housing mfg 
retail rv other total amounts in thousands fiscal year restructuring and impairment asset impairments   severance   future lease obligations of closed stores subtotal    other legal reserves   severance total     fiscal year goodwill impairment   restructuring and impairment asset impairments      severance   future lease obligations of closed stores  plant store shutdown costs   subtotal      other legal reserves   inventory write downs    warranty closed plants recalls    severance   total      consolidated revenues for the fiscal year rose percent to billion compared to billion for the similar period last year 
a strong recreational vehicle market and improved products drove a percent sales increase in rvs  which more than offset a percent decline in manufactured housing revenues  and a percent drop in housing retail sales 
gross profit margin fell to percent of sales compared to percent last year  mainly due to a decline in housing margin from percent to percent 
overall rv gross margins in fiscal year improved from percent to percent 
in addition  housing retail s gross margin improved from percent to percent due to lower levels of aged inventory resulting in reduced inventory write down 
operating expenses  which include selling  general and administrative expenses  declined million or percent primarily due to reduced product warranty expenses and prior period downsizing actions 
included in the prior year operating expense was million for the legal settlement of two class action suits compared to million this year related to potential legal settlements 
selling expenses declined percent to million and decreased as a percentage of sales from percent to percent 
lower payroll related costs and a percent drop in product warranty costs led to the expense reduction 
general and administrative expenses fell million or percent to million and decreased as a percentage of sales from percent to percent 
the reduction in cost was mainly due to staff reductions resulting from manufacturing plant and retail store closures in prior periods 
partially offsetting the reductions were the above mentioned legal settlements and million to reverse incorrect balance sheet adjusting entries at the retail operation  which were related primarily to the integration and conversion of accounting systems from previously acquired entities 
in the prior year  there were million of restructuring and other expenses related to asset impairment and plant and store closures compared to million this year 
other expense was million compared with million in the prior year 
fiscal included a million net gain from the sale of fixed assets  which included three parcels of land and three facilities 
the prior year included interest expense of million for yield maintenance charges related to the early retirement of the senior unsecured notes on july  excluding the million yield maintenance charges from the prior year  interest expense was lower this year mainly due to a smaller retail housing inventory floorplan liability resulting from a reduction in inventories  combined with lower interest expense on other borrowings 
investment income was down percent from the prior year as a result of lower interest rates on lower invested balances 
recreational vehicles recreational vehicle revenues increased percent to billion  primarily as a result of a stronger recreational vehicle market and customer acceptance of our new diesel products 
motor home sales were up percent to million compared to million in the prior year 
the motor home performance was the result of improved market conditions and favorable acceptance of three new diesel products 
for fiscal year  class a diesel product shipments rose percent 
travel trailer revenues increased percent to million on a percent increase in unit volume 
folding trailer sales rose percent to million on a percent decline in unit volume 
the disproportionate increase in folding trailer revenues to shipments reflects the sales growth of the larger  higher priced caravan product offered since july the rv group earned million in the month period ending april   compared to a loss of million in the same period of the prior year 
the million swing in profitability was mainly due to the increase in diesel sales  which have higher selling prices and gross margins  and a million reduction in the travel trailer operating loss resulting from higher revenues and gross margins 
operating expenses declined million and decreased from percent of sales to percent in the current year mainly due to lower product warranty costs 
manufactured housing manufactured housing segment sales to the retail housing segment and related manufacturing profits are included in the manufactured housing segment 
retail housing segment results include retail profits from the sale of homes to consumers but do not include any manufactured housing segment profits associated with the homes sold 
intercompany transactions between the operating segments are eliminated in consolidation  including intercompany profit in inventory  which represents the amount of manufactured housing segment gross margin in fleetwood produced inventory at company owned retailers 
manufactured housing operations gross manufacturing revenues in fiscal year were million  down percent from the prior year  and included million of intercompany sales to company owned retail sales centers 
manufacturing unit volume declined percent to  homes  but the number of housing sections was off a lesser percent to  due to the continuing shift in sales mix toward multi section homes 
multi section homes represented percent of factory sales versus percent last year 
sales volume was below the prior year because of a weaker manufactured housing market  which has been adversely affected by competition from repossessed units and restrictive retail financing conditions 
this condition has further deteriorated in the past year because of legislation in texas  the largest manufactured housing state  which had the effect of restricting the use of chattel financing 
during the same period  the industry s two largest retail lenders and the two largest inventory floorplan lenders exited the business 
operating income  before the adjustment for intercompany profit elimination of million this year and million in the prior year  dropped from million to an operating loss of million  due to the decline in volume and erosion to gross margin resulting from the depressed market and competitive environment 
gross profit margin for the housing group declined from percent to percent of sales  mainly as a result of improving the competitiveness of the product by adding features without commensurate price increases 
housing group operating costs declined million or percent as a result of reduced product warranty expenses and lower employee compensation due to staffing reductions in prior quarters 
retail housing operations retail housing s revenues declined percent from million to million for fiscal year unit sales for the retail operation were off percent to  homes 
the smaller decrease in revenues resulted from a rise in the average unit price of percent to  for the current year due to the sale of more multi section homes and fewer homes at discounted prices 
as a result  gross margins improved from percent in the prior year to percent 
the retail division incurred an operating loss of million in fiscal year  before interest expense on inventory financing  compared to an operating loss of million last year 
the reduced loss mainly resulted from the higher gross margin and a percent reduction in operating expenses 
the operating expense reduction was negatively affected by a million charge for incorrect balance sheet adjusting entries related to integrating and then converting unique accounting systems from previously acquired dealers into a single system 
interest expense on inventory financing decreased percent from million to million as a result of lower interest rates  an percent reduction in inventories and a related pay down of the flooring liability

s frc fiscal year end  which is the last day in march 
all other statistics in this report regarding frc are as of fleetwood enterprises  inc s fiscal year end  which is the last sunday in april of each year 
supply operations our supply group contributed revenues of million for the month period through april   compared to million in the prior year 
operating income decreased from million to million mainly due to a shift in product mix to less profitable business 
consolidated results fiscal year compared with fiscal year we incurred a net loss in fiscal of million or per diluted share 
a substantial portion of the loss  million  was attributable to a non cash charge for impairment of goodwill and million to other restructuring and impairment charges 
this compares with a loss of million or per diluted share for fiscal  which included other non operating charges of million for the impairment of goodwill and million for restructuring and asset impairment 
in addition to the goodwill and other impairments  the current year loss also stems from significantly reduced sales volume in both the manufacturing and retail operations of the housing group 
these declines are primarily the result of competitive market conditions caused by a restrictive financing environment and competition for sales of new homes with repossessed units  which have negatively impacted the manufactured housing industry for the past three years 
in terms of earnings per share  the impairment to goodwill and the other downsizing related charges amounted to approximately and cents in fiscal year and and cents in fiscal year in addition to the impairment and restructuring charges  a change in accounting for credit retail housing sales  which was adopted in the first quarter of fiscal year  also contributed million or cents per share to the prior year loss 
consolidated revenues for the fiscal year were billion  down percent from the prior year s billion 
the decline was primarily due to continued weakness in the demand for manufactured housing 
housing revenues for the fiscal year were billion  down percent from the prior year 
gross revenues for the manufacturing segment of housing fell by percent to million  including intercompany sales of million 
retail revenues were down by percent to million  which approximates the percentage decrease in the number of retail stores 
stronger recreational vehicle demand in the second half of the year pushed recreational vehicle revenues to billion  the same as the prior year 
gross profit margin in the current year increased to percent of sales from percent a year ago  reflecting improved manufacturing margins 
manufacturing gross margin rose from percent of sales in fiscal to percent for the current year mainly due to improved housing and motor home margins 
reduced retail housing margins reflect very competitive market conditions and declining industry sales  as well as a million write down of aged and distressed inventory to net realizable value this year 
operating expenses  which include selling  general and administrative expenses  excluding other charges  declined million or percent to million 
as a percentage of sales  these costs declined from percent in fiscal to percent in fiscal due to continued downsizing activities 
selling expenses declined percent to million  but rose as a percentage of sales from percent to percent on the lower sales volume 
most of the dollar reduction in selling costs resulted from reduced expenditures for advertising  point of purchase materials  shows  sales commissions and sales compensation 
the bulk of these cost reductions occurred within the recreational vehicle segment  and can be attributed not only to volume  but enhanced cost controls 
selling expenses were lower this year  but as a percentage of sales they were higher in the current year due to increased warranty and service costs 
general and administrative expenses declined percent to million  and declined as a percentage of sales from percent to percent 
most of the reduction in general and administrative costs stems from downsizing in the second half of fiscal  lower profit based incentive compensation and lower staffing levels 
non operating expenses of million were percent higher than last year s million  mainly due to lower investment income  partially offset by lower interest expense 
investment income was down percent from the prior year as a result of lower interest rates and reduced invested balances  and interest expense was lower due to reduced borrowings 
our effective income tax rate increased from percent in fiscal to percent in the current year 
the sharp increase primarily reflects the impact of the higher charge for the impairment of goodwill in fiscal year  which  for the most part  is not deductible for tax purposes 
recreational vehicles in fiscal year  recreational vehicle sales were flat with the prior year at billion 
motor home revenues increased by percent to million on a percent increase in shipments from  units to  units 
this mainly reflects improved retail demand and motor home dealer confidence beginning late in calendar year in the towable recreational vehicle category  travel trailer sales declined percent from million to million as we continued to suffer from a lukewarm response to new product offerings in this segment 
folding trailer sales rose one percent to million 
fiscal year unit shipments for travel trailers and folding trailers were  including slide in truck campers and  respectively  representing a decrease of percent for travel trailers and percent for folding trailers 
the rv group incurred a million operating loss for the year compared with a million loss in fiscal year the operating loss was due to travel trailers losing million on the decline in sales and low gross margins 
motor homes earned  compared to a loss of million in the prior year 
the significant improvement in earnings was the result of a percent increase in sales  improved gross margins and reduced operating expenses 
folding trailers earned  compared to million in the prior year 
last year s rv group results were negatively impacted by high sales incentives  labor inefficiencies due to erratic production schedules  and plant shutdown costs 
gross profit margin for the rv group increased from percent to percent due to improvement in motor home margins 
motor home gross margin improvement was primarily due to a shift in product mix from class c product to higher priced class a motor homes 
rv group operating costs were percent lower than the prior year on flat sales mainly due to the prior year s downsizing activities 
manufactured housing gross manufacturing revenues of million were off percent from the prior year  and included million of intercompany sales to company owned retail home centers 
manufacturing unit volume declined percent to  homes  but the number of sections was off a lesser percent to  due to the continuing shift in sales mix toward multi section homes 
multi section homes represented percent of our factory sales versus percent in the prior year 
the lower housing volume reflects a weak manufactured housing market that has further deteriorated over the past year 
during the past three years  the industry has been adversely affected by excessive retail inventories and restrictive retail financing conditions 
lenders have imposed more stringent credit standards and higher down payment requirements for retail buyers  and have taken higher spreads between their cost of funds and retail financing rates 
additionally  several consumer lenders have withdrawn from the business  which has limited the amount of funding available to the industry 
these actions  combined with relatively higher interest rates charged to manufactured housing customers  have eliminated many potential buyers from the market 
we anticipate that industry wholesale shipments will continue to be weak until the current inventory imbalance is resolved  the timing of which depends largely on improved availability and terms of retail financing 
housing operating income  before the adjustment for intercompany manufacturing profit of million in fiscal year and million in fiscal year  declined percent from million to million  and operating margin fell from percent to percent of sales 
the operating income decline is greater if the million of restructuring and impairment charges related to plant closings and downsizing initiatives are added back to fiscal operating income and the million of asset impairment charges are added back to the current year income 
excluding the other charges  fiscal year income was million or a percent reduction from the adjusted fiscal operating income of million 
gross profit margin for the housing group improved slightly from percent to percent of sales as a result of lower raw material costs 
more efficient material usage and improved product pricing contributed to the higher gross margin percentage 
housing group operating costs  excluding the other charges  would have been the same as the prior year  despite the sales decline  mainly as a result of higher product warranty and service costs 
the increase in warranty and service costs was due to increased reserves for closed facilities and costs related to new regional service centers 
these higher costs effectively offset the positive impact of lower general and administrative costs due to staffing reductions resulting from downsizing efforts 
retail housing operations revenues for retail housing declined by million or percent to million in fiscal the decline is due to the significant decrease in the number of retail stores during the year 
it also is due to lower sales volume as a result of the restrictive retail financing environment 
unit sales from fleetwood retail stores fell percent to  homes 
as a result of a change in accounting for retail credit sales  we incurred a one time cumulative charge against earnings of million after taxes in fiscal year we had retail stores in operation at fiscal year end compared to one year earlier 
the retail division incurred an operating loss of million compared to a loss of million a year ago 
the current year loss includes restructuring charges totaling million related to downsizing initiatives 
earnings were also adversely affected by a million inventory write down 
excluding these unusual charges  the operating loss in the current year was due to the weak market environment and lower gross margins stemming from extremely competitive market conditions 
operating expenses  excluding restructuring and impairment charges  decreased million or percent due to reducing the number of retail stores by percent and consolidating operations 
interest expense on inventory financing decreased from million to million due to lower interest rates and a million reduction in our retail flooring liability 
supply operations our supply group contributed revenues of million compared to million in the prior year 
operating income increased percent to million mainly due to improved labor efficiencies from increased capacity utilization gained mainly through increased internal sales to motor home plants 
liquidity and capital resources we have historically relied upon internally generated cash flows to satisfy working capital needs and to fund capital expenditures 
in recent periods  however  primarily due to operating losses  we have used external funding sources to supplement internal cash flows 
cash totaling million was used in operating activities during fiscal year compared to cash generated of million for the similar period one year ago 
in addition to the million net loss  the use of cash from operations resulted primarily from a million increase in inventories and a million increase in other assets  consisting primarily of chattel loans internally funded through our homeone finance subsidiary 
the increase in inventories was mainly due to a planned buildup of motor home and travel trailer finished goods in anticipation of improved market conditions 
partially offsetting the increased use of cash was a million reduction to income tax receivable related to a refund from a carryback of prior year losses and a million increase in other liabilities mainly due to the deferral of the distribution on the convertible trust preferred securities 
last year  the million of cash generated from operations was mainly attributable to a reduction of retail inventories and a million refund of federal taxes from a carryback of losses to prior periods 
as a result of the above mentioned changes  cash and marketable investments decreased million from million as of april   to million as of april  additional cash outlays in fiscal year included million in capital expenditures 
in the same period of the prior year  the company paid common stock dividends of million and had capital expenditures of million 
distributions on the convertible trust preferred securities were deferred  whereas the distributions on the issues were paid in common stock in the first quarter of fiscal year and paid in cash for the remainder of the year  in the amount of million 
at fiscal year end  short term borrowings under our secured syndicated credit facility  led by bank of america  na  as administrative agent  were million 
currently  lender commitments to the facility total million 
our borrowing capacity  however  is governed by the amount of a borrowing base  consisting of inventories and accounts receivable  that fluctuates significantly from week to week 
the borrowing base is revised weekly for changes in receivables and monthly for changes in inventory balances 
under the borrowing agreement  million must be maintained as minimum unused availability  with the remainder available to support standby letters of credit and fund borrowings 
at the end of the fiscal year  the borrowing base totaled million 
after consideration of the unused minimum requirement  collateral reserves of million  million in standby letters of credit and the outstanding borrowings  unused borrowing capacity was approximately million 
credit agreement amendments on january   we announced that we had successfully restructured our revolving line of credit to provide greater flexibility and borrowing capacity 
the maximum amount of credit available to us under the line was reduced from million to million 
this more closely matches the size of the line to the loan value of the borrowing base  or pool of inventory and receivables  that supports our borrowings 
at the same time  the lenders agreed to reduce the borrowing availability reserve that we are required to maintain from million to million  and to release certain excess real estate and equipment collateral 
additional provisions of the amendment allowed for greater flexibility in making capital contributions  advances and distributions among fleetwood and our subsidiaries 
the amendment specifically authorized fleetwood to make additional capital contributions to our homeone credit finance subsidiary  and to enter into a warehouse line of credit to further support the operations of homeone 
in return  fleetwood paid a fee of three eighths of a percent of the new commitment amount to the syndicate 
on march   we announced that the lenders in the syndicated revolving line of credit had agreed to restate the financial covenant relating to adjusted earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization ebitda 
we also announced at the same time that we had amended our inventory financing agreement with textron financial  which had incorporated the same covenant 
we further announced that as part of the same amendment  the maximum amount of the revolving line of credit had been increased by million to million  reflecting the return of a former syndicate member to the loan arrangement and that we had paid the syndicate an amendment fee of three eighths of a percent of the new  higher commitment level 
subsequent to year end  on july   the adjusted ebitda covenant was amended to accommodate the reversal of the incorrect accounting entries at frc 
in addition  frc s wholesale financing agreement with textron financial corporation textron  which provides for wholesale financing to frc up to an uncommitted limit of million  is subject to a cross default provision and a covenant in which fleetwood agreed that it would not modify the adjusted ebitda covenant in the senior credit facility without textron s prior consent 
accordingly  we also requested and obtained textron s consent to the amendment 
convertible trust preferred securities on december   we commenced an offer of up to an aggregate of million in liquidation amount of new convertible trust ii preferred securities due february   in exchange for up to an aggregate of million of the million in liquidation amount of outstanding convertible trust preferred securities due february  the exchange offer expired on january   and was completed on january  each new trust preferred security issued in the exchange offer is convertible  at the option of the holder  at any time into shares of fleetwood common stock ie  a conversion price of per common share 
with million shares of new trust preferred issued in the exchange offer  the potential dilution to common shareholders upon conversion of the new exchange offer trust preferred is million common shares 
as a result of the exchange  debentures supporting the exchanged convertible trust preferred securities were cancelled  resulting in a taxable gain of million 
after deducting taxes of million  the remainder of million was reported as an increase to additional paid in capital and treated as income attributable to common shareholders in the calculation of earnings per share 
in conjunction with the exchange offer  we offered to sell for cash million of convertible trust iii preferred securities due february  the registration statement was declared effective by the securities and exchange commission on december   and the cash offer closed on december  each trust iii preferred security issued in the cash offer is convertible  at the option of the holder  at any time into shares of fleetwood common stock ie  a conversion price of per common share

dividends and distributions on october   the board of directors discontinued the payment of dividends on our common stock in conjunction with an election to defer the distribution on our existing convertible trust preferred securities due to be made on november  the distributions on the remaining convertible trust preferred securities due to be paid on february   may   august   november   february   and may   were also deferred 
we have the right to elect to defer distributions for up to consecutive quarters under the trust indenture governing the existing convertible trust preferred securities 
when we defer a distribution on the securities  we are prevented from declaring or paying dividends on our common stock during the period of the deferral 
in light of our business environment and recent operating results  we currently anticipate that we will find it necessary to defer distributions on the existing convertible trust preferred securities for the foreseeable future  subject to the terms of the governing documents 
at the end of fiscal  we have deferred million  including accrued interest at percent on the deferred amounts 
distributions on the new convertible trust preferred securities can be paid in cash or  at our election  prior to february   in our common stock  at a rate of per year of the liquidation amount of per exchange preferred security and per cash offer preferred security 
after february   we can defer interest payments on the new securities for up to consecutive quarterly periods 
as previously announced  we elected to pay the distributions on the new convertible trust preferred securities due to be made on february   and may   in shares of our common stock 
due to the low price of the stock since august and the resulting large quantity of shares required to satisfy the distribution obligation  subsequent distributions on the securities have been paid in cash  which have totaled million 
other we are in the process of exploring other financing options including junior capital to replace some of the existing debt  although there is no assurance any such financing can be obtained  on favorable terms or at all 
in the opinion of management  the combination of existing cash resources  expected future cash flows from operations  and available lines of credit will be sufficient to satisfy our foreseeable cash requirements for the next months  including up to million for capital expenditures  to be utilized primarily for enhancements to motor home manufacturing facilities

also included in the above amounts are equipment leases 
management expects that in the normal course of business  leases will be renewed or replaced by other leases to support continuing operations 
we have an operating agreement with a large dealer who manages retail store locations for frc 
either party may terminate the agreement by giving written notice days in advance of the date of the termination 
if termination notice is provided  fleetwood is obligated to repurchase the outstanding inventory at that time for the amount of the dealer s obligations to its flooring institutions 
similarly  an equivalent amount is included in the aggregate repurchase obligation described in note to the company s financial statements contained elsewhere in this report 
that repurchase obligation would become due and payable to the flooring institution only in the event the dealer defaults prior to its agreement with fleetwood being terminated 
the mandatorily redeemable convertible trust preferred securities were issued in three separate transactions  and are currently reflected on the balance sheet as a quasi equity interest

off balance sheet arrangements in march  fleetwood entered into a sale and leaseback agreement involving manufactured housing retail stores 
the minimum rental payments required under this agreement are included in the contractual obligation schedule above  under operating leases 
the agreement includes a contingent rental reset provision which provides that  in the event that the company s credit rating falls below a certain level anytime prior to march  the company could be required  at the option of the lessor  to make an accelerated rent payment equal to the unamortized principal of the lessor s underlying debt 
since entering into the agreement  the company s credit rating has fallen below the specified level  raising the possibility that the provision could be exercised in march the accelerated payment would be approximately million 
a number of alternatives to the accelerated rent payment are currently available to the company and are being considered 
it is likely that sometime prior to march  the company will move to restructure the arrangement to mitigate the potential negative cash impact

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to market risks related to fluctuations in interest rates on marketable investments  investments underlying a company owned life insurance program coli  variable rate debt under the secured credit facility and the liability for flooring of manufactured housing retail inventories 
with respect to the coli program  the underlying investments are subject to both interest rate risk and equity market risk 
we do not currently use interest rate swaps  futures contracts or options on futures  or other types of derivative financial instruments 
the vast majority of our marketable investments are in fixed rate securities with average original maturity dates of approximately two weeks  minimizing the effect of interest rate fluctuations on their fair value 
for fixed rate debt  changes in interest rates generally affect the fair market value  but not earnings or cash flows 
conversely  for variable rate debt  changes in interest rates generally do not influence fair market value  but do affect future earnings and cash flows 
based upon the amount of variable rate debt outstanding at the end of the third quarter  and holding the variable rate debt balance constant  each one percentage point increase in interest rates occurring on the first day of an annual period would result in an increase in interest expense of approximately  we do not believe that future market equity or interest rate risks related to our marketable investments or debt obligations will have a material impact on our results 
new accounting pronouncements in december  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure  which amends sfas  accounting for stock based compensation to provide alternative methods of transition for a voluntary change to the fair value method of accounting for stock based compensation 
in addition  this statement amends the disclosure requirements of sfas to require prominent disclosures in both annual and interim financial statements about the method of accounting for stock based employee compensation and the effect of the method used on reported results 
we will continue to account for stock based compensation using the intrinsic method as permitted by sfas and prominently disclose the additional information required by sfas in our annual and interim reports 
in may  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity 
this statement establishes standards for how an issuer classifies and measures certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity 
this statement requires an issuer to classify a financial instrument issued in the form of shares that are mandatorily redeemable that embodies an unconditional obligation requiring the issuer to redeem them by transferring its assets at a specified or determinable date as a liability 
we have three series of convertible trust preferred securities totaling million that are now treated as a quasi equity securities that are mandatorily redeemable at specified dates 
effective with the second quarter of fiscal year  these financial instruments will be classified as long term liabilities on the statement of financial position  valued at fair market value using the present value of the redemption amount  at the rate implicit in the contract at inception 
distributions to the minority interest  now classified below the tax provision benefit as an after tax amount  will be reclassified on the consolidated statement of operations to a separate line item included in other income expense as an interest expense 
in november  the fasb issued interpretation no 
fin  guarantor s accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees  including indirect guarantees of indebtedness of others 
this interpretation specifies the disclosures to be made by a guarantor in its interim and annual financial statements concerning its obligations under certain guarantees that it has issued 
fin also requires a guarantor to recognize a liability  at the inception of the guarantee  for the fair value of obligations it has undertaken in issuing the guarantee 
the disclosure requirements of fin are effective for interim and annual periods ending after december  the initial recognition and initial measurement requirements of fin are effective prospectively for guarantees issued or modified after december  accordingly  we adopted the disclosure provisions of fin  which have been reflected in the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
the adoption of these provisions did not have a material impact on the company s financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
in january  the fasb issued interpretation no 
fin  consolidation of variable interest entities  which expands upon and strengthens existing accounting guidance concerning when a company should include in its financial statements the assets  liabilities and activities of another entity 
prior to the issuance of fin  a company generally included another entity in its consolidated financial statements only if it controlled the entity through voting interests 
fin now requires a variable interest entity  as defined in fin  to be consolidated by a company if that company is subject to a majority of the risk of loss from the variable interest entity s activities or entitled to receive a majority of the entity s residual returns or both 
fin also requires disclosures about variable interest entities that the company is not required to consolidate but in which it has a significant variable interest 
the consolidation requirements of fin apply immediately to variable interest entities created after january   and to older entities in the first fiscal year or interim period beginning after june  certain of the disclosure requirements apply to all financial statements issued after january   regardless of when the variable interest entity was established 
the company does not believe the adoption of fin will have a material impact on the company s financial position  results of operations or cash flows
