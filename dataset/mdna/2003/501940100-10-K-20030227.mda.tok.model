overview lnr property corporation is a real estate investment  finance and management company 
we engage primarily in i acquiring  developing  repositioning  managing and selling commercial and multi family residential real estate properties  ii investing in high yielding real estate loans and acquiring at a discount portfolios of loans backed by commercial or multi family residential real estate and iii investing in unrated and non investment grade rated commercial mortgage backed securities cmbs as to which we have the right to be special servicer ie  to oversee workouts of underperforming and non performing loans 
for the following discussion  these businesses are grouped as follows a real estate properties  b real estate loans and c real estate securities

diluted earnings per share for the year ended november  were  a increase over prior year diluted earnings per share of 
the increase in earnings was primarily due to i a higher level of gains on asset sales primarily due to a million pre tax gain recognized on the sale of non investment grade cmbs through a resecuritization transaction  ii a decrease in interest expense primarily due to lower interest rates  and iii an increase in net rents rental income less cost of rental operations  reflecting the contribution to net rents from our development and repositioned properties which are now stabilized or completed and have tenants that are starting to pay rent 
these increases were partially offset by i a decrease in equity in earnings of unconsolidated partnerships  primarily due to lower earnings from madison square company llc madison see real estate securities segment below and ii a decrease in management and servicing fees 
overall  total revenues remained relatively flat  decreasing in  compared to this was primarily due to a decrease in equity in earnings of unconsolidated partnerships as discussed above  offset in part by higher gains on sales of assets 
operating earnings were generated from our three main business segments in the following proportions from real estate properties  from real estate loans and from real estate securities 
this compares with  and  respectively  for the prior year 
the shift in the percentage related to real estate properties from to was primarily the result of lower gains on sales of real estate property assets  offset in part by higher net rents and an increase in equity in earnings of unconsolidated partnerships 
the increase in the percentage related to real estate securities from to was primarily due to higher gains on sales of cmbs and interest income  offset in part by lower equity in earnings of unconsolidated partnership investments and higher operating expenses 
year ended november  compared to year ended november  net earnings for the year ended november  were million  a increase over prior year net earnings of million 
diluted earnings per share for the year ended november  were  a increase over prior year diluted earnings per share of 
the increase in earnings was primarily due to i an increase in interest income and servicing fees derived from our growing cmbs portfolio  ii an increase in interest income from our mortgage loan portfolio  iii a decrease in depreciation expense primarily due to the timing of stabilized property sales relative to new stabilized properties coming on line in and iv a decrease in interest expense due primarily to lower interest rates 
these increases were partially offset by i a decrease in equity in earnings of unconsolidated partnerships from both our domestic and japanese discount loan portfolio businesses  ii a decrease in net rents  primarily due to the timing of stabilized property sales relative to new properties coming on line in and iii an increase in general and administrative expenses from our growing business segments 
overall  total revenues remained relatively flat  increasing in  compared to this was primarily due to the timing of asset sales  reduced interest income on variable rate assets and a shift in the mix of our investments 
lower interest income is related to transactions that are match funded with variable rate debt  and therefore had minimal impact on net earnings 
the shift in the mix of investments relates primarily to moving investment dollars to asset classes that are currently yielding higher margins such as loans and securities 
operating earnings were generated from our three main business segments in the following proportions from real estate properties  from real estate loans and from real estate securities 
this compares with  and  respectively  for the prior year 
the shift in these percentages from to was primarily the result of higher gains from the sales of real estate in  the gain on sale of our interests in japanese real estate loan portfolios in and higher earnings in from our growing cmbs portfolio

real estate properties include office buildings  rental apartment communities market rate and affordable housing communities  substantially all of which qualify for low income housing tax credits under section of the internal revenue code  industrial warehouse facilities  hotels  retail centers and land that we acquire and develop  redevelop or reposition 
these properties may be wholly owned or owned through partnerships that are either consolidated or accounted for by the equity method  and therefore reflected on our balance sheet only as an investment in unconsolidated partnerships 
real estate properties also include our interest in lennar land partners llp  a non consolidated partnership accounted for under the equity method which is engaged in the acquisition  development and sale of land  and our interest in an unconsolidated partnership that has investments in properties in europe 
total revenues from real estate properties include rental income from operating properties  equity in earnings of unconsolidated partnerships that own and operate real estate properties  gains on sales of properties or those unconsolidated partnership interests  and fees earned from managing those partnerships 
operating expenses include the direct costs of operating the real estate properties  the related depreciation and the overhead associated with managing the properties and managing some of the partnerships 
we continued to take advantage of the strong investor demand for high quality properties  selling a number of matured assets during despite those sales  net rents have continued to grow as properties that were previously under development or repositioning are now stabilized or completed and tenants have started paying rent 
for the past two years  we have initiated very few new development or repositioning projects  focusing instead on completing and leasing up our existing portfolio 
as of november   approximately of our remaining property portfolio is still undergoing development or repositioning  the majority of which has already been pre leased 
we also entered the european commercial real estate market by investing in a portfolio of real estate properties in the second quarter of through an unconsolidated partnership with cdc ixis capital markets 
year ended november  compared to year ended november  overall  operating earnings from real estate properties were million for the year ended november   compared to million in this decrease was primarily due to lower gains on sales of real estate property assets  offset in part by higher net rents and an increase in equity in earnings of unconsolidated partnerships 
total rental income increased to million in from million in the increase in rental income was primarily due to the contribution from development and repositioning properties that are now stabilized or completed and have some tenants that are starting to pay rent 
in and  respectively  rental income consisted of million and million from commercial properties office  industrial warehouse and retail  million and million from market rate rental apartment communities  million and million from affordable housing communities  and million and million from hotels and other properties 
cost of rental operations were million for the year ended november   relatively flat compared to equity in earnings of unconsolidated partnerships increased to million in from million in  primarily due to higher earnings from llp and earnings from our european investment 
llp primarily sells land to homebuilders  including lennar  our former parent company and our partner in llp 
equity in earnings from llp may vary from period to period depending on the timing of housing starts 
these increases in earnings  relating to llp and our european investment  were partially offset by lower gains from sales of assets held by our domestic partnerships and a decrease in equity in earnings associated with our investments in affordable housing partnerships 
gains on sales of real estate and unconsolidated partnership interests decreased to million in from million in gains on sales of real estate in include million from sales of stabilized market rate operating properties  million from sales of land  million from the sale of interests in unconsolidated partnerships and million from syndications of affordable housing communities  as compared to million  million  million and million  respectively  in gains on sales of real estate fluctuate from period to period based on the timing of asset sales 
the net book value of operating properties and equipment with regard to various types of properties we own at november   together with the yield and the occupancy for the stabilized operating properties follows net book value occupancy rate yield on net book value in thousands  except percentages market rate operating properties stabilized operating properties office retail industrial warehouse ground leases commercial hotel under development or repositioning office retail commercial hotel total market rate operating properties affordable housing communities furniture  fixtures and equipment total occupancy rate at november  yield for purposes of this schedule is rental income less cost of rental operations before commissions and non operating expenses for the year ended november  as of november   approximately of our market rate operating properties  based on net book value  had reached stabilized occupancy levels and were yielding in total on net book value 
occupancy levels for our stabilized commercial real estate properties remained at at the end of and at the end of approximately of our market rate properties are in various stages of development or redevelopment 
our investment in these properties decreased to million at november   from million at november   primarily reflecting the stabilization of several development repositioning properties in these properties were yielding on net book value at november   compared to at november  the increased yield reflects a larger number of properties in this portfolio which have been completed and where some tenants are paying rent 
these properties were over pre leased at november  we entered the business of owning  developing and syndicating affordable housing communities in in this business  we create or enter into partnerships that hold interests in multi family real estate properties that are eligible for affordable housing tax credits granted under section of the internal revenue code 
initially our strategy was to retain the tax credits generated through owning the majority of the partnership interests in the affordable housing communities and then using those credits to reduce our overall effective tax rate 
however  the demand for credits has since increased significantly and we found we could generate higher returns on our investment by selling the credits instead of using them 
we therefore have shifted our strategy away from owning the majority of the partnership interests in the affordable housing communities toward syndicating those interests 
after such syndications  we continue to hold a small interest typically ranging from less than to in these partnerships and provide certain limited guarantees to the investors 
we may also continue to manage the communities and or provide tax compliance and other services on behalf of the investors  for which we receive fees 
as a result of the shift in strategy  our total investment in affordable housing communities  as well as the amount of tax credits we hold and utilize to reduce our tax rate  declined further in pre tax operating margins for the affordable housing communities are generally lower than for market rate rentals 
however  we receive our desired yield from these investments after adding in i the impact of lower income taxes as a result of the tax credits and other related tax deductions and ii profits from sales of tax credits to others 
we follow the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for sales of real estate  when accounting for syndications of partnership interests related to affordable housing communities 
interests in these partnerships are sold either while the property is in development  or after it is fully developed and leased 
the total proceeds from the sale of partnership interests related to fully developed properties are received at the time of sale  and therefore profit is recognized at that time to the extent that proceeds exceed our basis in the partnership interests sold plus any required reserves for guarantees 
proceeds from the sale of partnership interests related to properties in development may be subject to minor modification after the date of sale  because proceeds to be received generally depend on the amount of tax credits granted  which is only determined once the property is fully developed 
since the total proceeds to be received by us for these partnership interests are not definite at the date of sale  we apply the cost recovery method in accounting for these sales 
gains are recognized to the extent that cash receipts exceed our basis in the partnership interests sold plus any required reserves for guarantees 
we provide certain limited guarantees to the purchasers of these partnership interests 
in accordance with paragraph of sfas no 
 we recognize profit as outlined above because our loss of profit from guarantees is limited by the terms of the sales contracts 
in those instances where we provide operating guarantees that are of limited duration  the profit we recognize on sale is reduced by our expected exposure to loss  calculated in accordance with sfas no 
in those instances where we provide non operating guarantees  or provide operating guarantees for an extended duration  the profit we recognize on sale is reduced by our maximum exposure to loss as specified in the agreements  regardless of the likelihood that we will have to perform under these guarantees 
the net investment in our affordable housing communities at november  follows in thousands operating properties investments in unconsolidated partnerships debt and other net investment in affordable housing communities as of november   we had been awarded and held rights to approximately million in gross tax credits  compared with million at november  the decrease in tax credits primarily reflects the syndication of partnership interests  as well as the utilization of tax credits in our net investment in affordable housing communities decreased by million in  which is not fully reflective of the value of the partnership interests sold 
for syndications of affordable housing communities under development  we receive a substantial portion of the proceeds after the syndication occurs as the properties are completed and leased up 
our net investment is expected to decrease further as the properties in the syndicated partnerships are completed and leased up 
year ended november  compared to year ended november  overall  operating earnings from real estate properties were million for the year ended november   compared to million in this increase was primarily due to higher gains on sales of real estate  higher management fees and lower depreciation expense 
these increases were partially offset by a decline in net rents  lower equity in earnings of unconsolidated partnerships  and higher other operating expenses 
total rental income decreased to million in from million in in and  respectively  rental income consisted of million and million from commercial properties office  industrial warehouse and retail  million and million from market rate rental apartment communities  million and million from affordable housing communities  and million and million from hotels and other properties 
cost of rental operations decreased to million for the year ended november  from million in the decreases in rental income and cost of rental operations were primarily due to the timing of stabilized property sales relative to new stabilized properties coming on line in equity in earnings of unconsolidated partnerships decreased to million in from million in  primarily due to lower earnings from llp and a decrease in partnership earnings from our stabilized affordable housing partnerships  partially offset by partnership earnings from the sale of the properties held by two unconsolidated single asset partnerships 
gains on sales of real estate and unconsolidated partnership interests increased to million in from million in gains on sales of real estate in included million from sales of stabilized market rate operating properties  million from syndications of affordable housing communities  million from sales of land and million from the sale of investments in unconsolidated partnerships 
gains on sales of real estate fluctuate from period to period based on the timing of asset sales 
management fees increased to million in from million in this increase was primarily due to developer and other fees we received for managing the properties for our partners 
other operating expenses increased to million in from million in this increase was due to additional personnel and administrative costs necessary to support the growth in the overall real estate portfolio we manage  including wholly owned real estate and real estate owned by unconsolidated partnerships 
depreciation expense decreased to million in from million in since we have not been replacing stabilized properties as quickly as they have been sold  this has resulted in a lower investment in stabilized operating properties and a corresponding lower depreciation expense 
the net book value of operating properties and equipment with regard to various types of properties we own at november   together with the yield and the occupancy for the stabilized operating properties follows net book value occupancy rate yield on net book value in thousands  except percentages market rate operating properties stabilized operating properties office retail industrial warehouse ground leases commercial hotel under development or repositioning office retail commercial multi family hotel total market rate operating properties affordable housing communities furniture  fixtures and equipment total occupancy rate at november  yield for purposes of this schedule is rental income less cost of rental operations before commissions and non operating expenses for the year ended november  as of november   approximately of our market rate operating properties  based on net book value  had reached stabilized occupancy levels and were yielding in total on net book value 
hotel occupancy decreased from at november  to at november  on our two wholly owned operating hotels primarily due to the tragic events of september  and general economic conditions 
both of these factors resulted in lower levels of occupancy in by a major customer at one of the wholly owned operating hotels 
our investment in market rate properties under development or repositioning was million at november   compared with million at november  the increase primarily reflects continued expenditures on projects already under development at the beginning of these properties were yielding on net book value at november   slightly higher than at november  these properties were over pre leased at november  the net investment in our affordable housing communities at november  follows in thousands operating properties investments in unconsolidated partnerships debt and other net investment in affordable housing communities as of november   we had been awarded and held rights to approximately million in gross tax credits  with approximately relating to apartment communities that have not yet reached stabilized occupancy levels

total revenues include interest income  equity in earnings of unconsolidated partnerships and management fees earned from those partnerships 
operating expenses include the overhead associated with servicing the loans and managing the partnerships 
over the past three years  the majority of investing activity within the real estate loan segment has been in structured junior participations in short to medium term variable rate real estate loans b notes  most of which represent participations in first mortgage loans 
most of our b note investments are match funded with variable rate debt of similar term 
to date  we have not experienced any delinquencies in our b note portfolio 
year ended november  compared to year ended november  operating earnings from real estate loans were million for the year ended november   compared to million in this decrease was primarily due to lower interest income and management fees 
interest income decreased to million for the year ended november  from million in this decrease was partially due to million of interest income realized in from the early payoff of a discounted mortgage loan and the impact during of lower interest rates on our variable rate loans 
these decreases were offset in part by a higher level of loan investments during compared with during the year ended november   we funded ten new b note investments for million 
our b note investments at november  totaled million  net and had a face amount of million 
these investments contributed million to interest income in  compared to million in management fees decreased to million for the year ended november  from million in this decrease was primarily due to fees earned in the first quarter of from the disposition of certain assets in one of our domestic discount loan portfolios 
year ended november  compared to year ended november  operating earnings from real estate loans were million for the year ended november   compared to million in this decrease was primarily due to the sale of our investment interests in our japanese discount loan portfolios in and lower earnings from our domestic discount loan portfolio business 
these decreases were partly offset by an increase in interest income 
interest income increased to million for the year ended november  from million in interest income primarily includes interest earned on b notes 
during the year ended november   we funded seven new b note investments for million 
our b note investments at november  had a face amount of million 
these investments contributed million to interest income in  compared to million in interest income in also included million from the early payoff of a discounted mortgage loan 
these increases in interest income were partially offset by lower variable interest rates 
for the year ended november   equity in earnings of unconsolidated partnerships decreased to million from million in this decrease was due to a decline in earnings from our japanese discount loan portfolios  which were sold in april  and a decline in earnings from our domestic discount loan portfolios  as expected  due to the liquidation of most of the assets in these portfolios in prior periods 
gains on sales of unconsolidated partnership interests in reflect the sale of our investment interests in our japanese discount loan portfolios 
operating expenses decreased to million for the year ended november  from million in  primarily due to the sale of our japanese discount loan portfolios in april  partially offset by increased general and administrative expenses to support the growth in our mortgage loan portfolio

total revenues from real estate securities include primarily interest income  equity in the earnings of madison  gains on sales of securities  servicing fees from acting as special servicer for cmbs transactions and fees earned from managing madison 
operating expenses include the overhead associated with managing the investments and madison and costs of the special servicing responsibilities 
year ended november  compared to year ended november  overall operating earnings from real estate securities increased to million for the year ended november  from million in earnings were higher primarily due to a million gain recognized on the sale of non investment grade cmbs through a resecuritization transaction and an increase in interest income 
these increases were partially offset by lower earnings from madison and an increase in operating expenses 
for the year ended november   interest income increased million  or to million  compared to the same period in  primarily due to greater recognition of earnings as actual cmbs performance continued to exceed expectations as well as a higher average level of cmbs investments during the year  offset in part by lower interest rates 
in recording cmbs interest income  we recognize the amount by which cash flows over the life of a security are expected to exceed our initial investment as interest income to achieve a level yield 
to date  this has resulted in less recognition of interest income than the amount of interest actually received 
the excess interest received is applied to reduce our cmbs investment 
our initial and ongoing estimates of cash flows from cmbs investments are based on a number of assumptions that are subject to various business and economic factors 
changes in cash flow estimates could materially affect the interest income that is recognized in future periods  the most significant of which is the timing and magnitude of credit losses on the underlying mortgages 
since we invest in subordinated classes of cmbs  we generally do not receive principal payments until the principal of the senior classes of that issue are paid in full 
however  we have already begun to receive principal payments from classes of our cmbs securities  and classes excluding securities sold in the resecuritization transaction described below have reached economic maturity either through the collection of principal  liquidation of the trust  or sale 
through the resecuritization transaction described below  an additional classes of securities and portions of other classes were also sold 
actual loss experience to date  particularly for older transactions to years in age  is significantly lower than we originally underwrote 
therefore  changes to original estimated yields have resulted in improved earnings from these transactions 
we believe these improvements resulted primarily from our conservative due diligence and success in managing and working out the underlying loans and stable real estate fundamentals 
however  the positive experience on these older transactions will not necessarily translate into yield improvements on newer investments 
during the year ended november   we acquired million face amount of fixed rate cmbs for million and million face amount of short term floating rate cmbs for million

equity in earnings of unconsolidated partnerships decreased to million for the year ended november  from earnings of million for the same period in the decline in earnings was primarily due to reduced income from madison due to lower interest income resulting from the timing and amount of expected principal collections related to short term floating rate securities owned by the venture 
madison  which was formed in march  owned approximately billion face amount of cmbs at november  our investment in the venture as of that date was million  representing a ownership interest 
in addition to our investment  we maintain a significant ongoing role in the venture  for which we earn fees  both as the special servicer for the purchased cmbs transactions and as a provider of management services 
since its inception  we have received million in cash distributions and fees from madison  on an original investment of million 
gains on sales of securities were million for the year ended november   compared to million for the same period in this increase was primarily due to the gain recognized in the third quarter of on the sale of non investment grade cmbs through a resecuritization transaction 
in this transaction  we transferred million in face value of non investment grade cmbs to a qualifying special purpose entity 
those cmbs were securitized into various classes of non recourse fixed and floating rate bonds comprised of million face value of investment grade rated bonds and approximately million face value of non investment rated bonds  as well as million face value of preferred shares in the issuing entity 
the qualifying special purpose entity sold the investment grade rated bonds to unrelated third parties for net proceeds of million  which was used to pay us for the cmbs collateral securities 
we used the proceeds to repay short term debt  the majority of which can be reborrowed 
in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for transfers and servicing of financial assets and extinguishments of liabilities  we recognized a pre tax gain on the sale of the cmbs collateral securities of million 
we retained the non investment grade rated notes and preferred equity the retained interests 
the aggregate face amount of the retained interests at the date of transfer and at november  was million  respectively 
at november   the amortized cost of the retained interest was million  with an estimated fair value of million 
this transaction provided us with significant liquidity for the purchase of new investments  for other general corporate purposes or for the repurchase of stock under our ongoing share repurchase program 
operating expenses increased to million in compared to million in  primarily due to increases in personnel and out of pocket expenses directly related to the growth of our cmbs business activity 
year ended november  compared to year ended november  overall operating earnings from real estate securities increased to million for the year ended november  from million in earnings were higher primarily due to i increased interest income and fees resulting from the growth of our cmbs portfolio  ii greater recognition of earnings due to actual cmbs performance continuing to exceed original expectations and iii increased equity in earnings from our investment in madison 
these increases were partially offset by i a decrease in gains on sales of investment securities and ii an increase in operating expenses 
during the year ended november   we acquired million face amount of fixed rate cmbs for million and million face amount of short term floating rate cmbs for million

equity in earnings of unconsolidated partnerships primarily represents our participation in madison 
our investment in the venture as of the end of the year was million  representing a ownership interest 
madison contributed million of equity in earnings of unconsolidated partnerships to the real estate securities line of business for the year ended november  in  we sold six cmbs investments  which had been upgraded from non investment grade to investment grade status for a gain of million 
these bonds were originally purchased as non investment grade securities at substantial discounts and were sold at or above par 
additionally  we sold all classes of bonds we owned in one seasoned cmbs pool at close to par for a gain of million 
over of the original pool had paid off prior to this sale  which allowed the securitization to be terminated through a clean up call 
the underlying loans were then sold to three financial institutions 
there are a number of cmbs pools in which we own unrated bonds that have had significant principal paydowns  leaving only a small percentage of the bonds remaining 
as a result  we are able to sell some of these bonds or the underlying loans after executing a clean up call for significant profits prior to stated maturity  maximizing our return on investment 
the gains on sales of investment securities in resulted from the sale of our remaining investment in the common stock of bank united corporation 
during  we reclassified our held to maturity cmbs securities to available for sale in accordance with sfas no 
although we have the financial ability to hold these bonds to their stated maturities  it sometimes is advantageous for us to sell the bonds as the cmbs pools to which they relate pay down significantly and the bonds get close to economic maturity 
because we may choose to do this  sfas no 
requires all of our cmbs to be classified as available for sale and also requires the bond values to be adjusted to fair market value  net of tax  through stockholders equity 
as a result  at november   all of our directly owned securities were classified as available for sale and their book value was written up to include unrealized appreciation 
management and servicing fees increased to million for the year ended november  from million in this increase was primarily due to the increase in the number of cmbs mortgage pools at november  versus at november  for which we act as a special servicer 
operating expenses increased to million in compared to million in  primarily due to increases in personnel and out of pocket expenses directly related to the growth of our cmbs portfolio 
corporate  other  interest and income tax expenses year ended november  compared to year ended november  interest expense decreased to million in from million in this decrease was primarily due to a decrease in interest rates 
weighted average borrowing rates were at november   compared to at november  average borrowing levels were  million in compared to  million in see further detail below under financial condition  liquidity and capital resources 
income tax expense decreased to million in from million in the effective tax rate in  including state income taxes  was compared to in this decrease reflects lower state income taxes related to our cmbs investments in year ended november  compared to year ended november  interest expense decreased to million in from million in this decrease was primarily due to a decrease in interest rates and  to a lesser extent  lower borrowing levels 
weighted average borrowing rates were at november   compared to at november  average borrowing levels were  million in compared to  million in income tax expense increased to million in from million in this increase was primarily due to an increase in pre tax earnings  and to a lesser extent  a lower level of low income housing tax credits utilized 
because the level of tax credits was lower in and pre tax earnings increased  the effective tax rate in  including state income taxes  was compared to in financial condition  liquidity and capital resources our operating activities provided million and million of cash in and  respectively 
the decrease in cash provided by operating activities is primarily due to a greater reduction in accounts payable and accrued liabilities  partially offset by a decrease in other assets and higher net earnings after adjusting for the effects of non cash items  whose contributions to cash flow are reflected in cash from investing activities below 
our investing activities provided million in and used million in this increase in cash provided by investing activities is primarily due to i net proceeds received on the sale of non investment grade cmbs through the resecuritization transaction completed during the third quarter of  as previously discussed  ii a decrease in restricted cash resulting from the release of a cash collateralized letter of credit and iii higher proceeds from the sale of operating properties and unconsolidated partnership interests 
these increases in cash provided by investing activities were partially offset by i a higher level of purchases of investment securities  operating properties  land and mortgage loans  ii a higher level of investments in unconsolidated partnerships  primarily related to our investment in european properties  iii lower proceeds from the syndication of affordable housing partnership interests  and iv lower proceeds from collections on mortgage loans 
our financing activities used million and million in and  respectively 
the increase in cash used in financing activities was primarily due to i lower borrowings under our mortgage notes and other debts payable  ii more purchases of treasury stock under our stock buy back program and iii higher net distributions to minority partners in consolidated entities 
these increases in cash used in financing activities were partially offset by lower net payments under repurchase agreements and revolving credit lines 
our investment activities consist primarily of purchasing real estate related financial instruments and commercial and multi family residential properties  in part with borrowed funds 
the value of all financial instruments  or the earnings from them  is affected by changes in interest rates 
however  real estate related financial instruments are particularly sensitive to interest rate changes  because the value of the real estate which collateralizes the instruments  as well as the purely financial aspects of the instruments themselves  are affected by changes in interest rates 
similarly  the cost of borrowing is affected by changes in interest rates  and the willingness of lenders to finance purchases of real estate related financial instruments is affected by factors  including changes in interest rates  which affect the value of the real estate 
to a substantial extent  conditions which reduce the value of our assets increase the cost of owning them 
because we borrow significant sums in connection with our investing activities  we could be adversely affected by reluctance of lenders to make loans to companies in real estate related businesses 
difficulty obtaining financing can reduce our ability to take advantage of investment opportunities 
we use interest rate swaps to reduce the extent to which we will be affected by changes in interest rates  which affect the value of the assets we hold or the cost of debt we have incurred see below 
however  we cannot protect ourselves against the effect changes in interest rates  or other occurrences which affect real estate values  may have on our ability to borrow funds with which to finance new investments 
we also cannot fully protect ourselves against losses we would suffer if  because of declines in real estate values  we were unable to realize expected returns from our real estate related assets or to dispose of those assets for prices at least equal to our investment in them 
we continue to diversify our capital structure and to manage our debt position with a combination of short  medium and long term financings with a goal of matching the maturities of our debt with the expected lives of our assets 
at november   we had approximately billion of available liquidity  which included approximately billion of cash and availability under credit facilities  and approximately million under committed project level term financing 
additionally  subsequent to the end of the year  we entered into multi year reverse repurchase repo lines with two financial institutions for a total of million  and received a financing commitment for a repo line from another financial institution for million 
these facilities will finance future loan and cmbs investments and expire through february during the fourth quarter of  we amended our million unsecured revolving credit facility  increasing the total facility to million and extending its term  including a one year extension option  to july at november   million was outstanding under this facility  and we had million of outstanding standby letters of credit utilizing the facility 
the facility contains certain financial tests and restrictive covenants  none of which are currently expected to restrict our activities 
we have various secured revolving lines of credit with an aggregate commitment of million  of which million was outstanding at november  these lines are collateralized by cmbs and mortgage loans and mature through july we have financed some of our purchases of cmbs under repo facilities  which are in effect borrowings secured by the cmbs 
these repo agreements contain provisions which may require us to repay amounts or post additional collateral prior to the scheduled maturity dates if the market value of the bonds which collateralize them significantly decline 
therefore  if the market value of our cmbs falls significantly  we could be required to either use cash flow we need to operate and grow our business or to sell assets at a time when it may not be most advantageous for us to do so  to generate cash needed to repay amounts under repo obligations 
at november   we had five repo facilities through which we financed selected cmbs 
the first facility had a commitment and outstanding balance of million and is required to be paid in full by june the second facility had a commitment of million with no outstanding balance at november   and matures in june we guaranteed the obligations of our subsidiaries for these two facilities 
the third facility is a million non recourse facility  which matures in april  and had an outstanding balance of million at november  the fourth facility is a million non recourse facility  which matures in april  and had an outstanding balance of million at november  we do not guarantee the third or fourth facility 
the fifth facility is a million financing structured as a repo line with a leading financial institution to finance the acquisition of securities and loans 
at november   there was million outstanding under this facility 
this facility has limited recourse to us and matures in january additionally  we received seller financing in the form of term repos for three specific cmbs transactions 
these agreements had an aggregate commitment and outstanding balance of million and expire through august we have guaranteed million of the obligations of our subsidiaries for these facilities 
we received seller financing in the form of term loans for three specific cmbs transactions 
we do not guarantee these loans 
we also received seller financing in the form of a term loan for one mortgage loan investment  which we have guaranteed 
these term loans had an outstanding balance of million at november  and expire through september we have million of long term unsecured senior subordinated notes outstanding 
million of these notes bear interest at and are due in march million of these notes bear interest at and are due in january subsequent to year end  standard poor s  which rates our senior unsecured credit rating at bb and our senior subordinated debt rating at b  revised our outlook to positive from stable 
additionally  subsequent to year end  fitch ratings assigned us a senior unsecured credit rating of bb and affirmed our senior subordinated debt rating of bb 
approximately of our existing indebtedness bears interest at variable rates 
however  most of our investments generate interest or rental income at essentially fixed rates 
we have entered into derivative financial instruments  primarily interest rate swaps  to manage our interest costs and hedge against risks associated with changing interest rates on our debt portfolio 
we believe our interest rate risk management policy is generally effective 
nonetheless  our profitability may be adversely affected during particular periods as a result of changing interest rates 
additionally  hedging transactions using derivative instruments involve risks such as counterparty credit risk 
the counterparties to our arrangements are major financial institutions  rated a or better  with which we and our affiliates may also have other financial relationships 
these counterparties potentially expose us to loss in the event of their non performance 
at november   of our variable rate debt had been swapped to fixed rates and was match funded against variable rate assets 
after considering the variable rate debt that had been swapped or was match funded  of our debt remained variable rate and of our debt was fixed rate or match funded 
as of november   we estimate that a basis point change in libor would impact our net earnings by million  or per share diluted 
the weighted average interest rate on our outstanding debt  after giving consideration to the interest rate swap agreements mentioned above  was at november  our board of directors approved a stock repurchase plan authorizing us to buy back up to million shares of our common stock  including million shares of common stock authorized in the fourth quarter of during the years ended november   and  we purchased million shares  million shares and million shares  respectively  under this program  bringing the inception to date total through november  under our buy back program to million shares 
contractual obligations our significant contractual obligations as of november  follows payments due by period total less than year years years after years in millions contractual obligations long term debt operating leases total contractual cash obligations at november   we had scheduled maturities on existing debt of million through november   assuming we take advantage of extensions which are exercisable at our option 
our ability to make scheduled payments of principal or interest on or to refinance this indebtedness depends on our future performance  which to a certain extent  is subject to general economic  financial  competitive and other factors beyond our control 
we believe our borrowing availability under existing credit facilities  our operating cash flow and unencumbered asset values  and our ability to obtain new borrowings and or raise new capital  should provide the funds necessary to meet our working capital requirements  debt service and maturities and short and long term needs based upon currently anticipated levels of growth 
however  limitations on access to financing constrain our ability to take advantage of opportunities that might lead to more significant growth 
off balance sheet arrangements from time to time in the normal course of our business  we enter into various types of transactions and arrangements which are not recorded on our balance sheet 
these off balance sheet arrangements include certain commitments and contingent obligations  retained interests in assets transferred to unconsolidated entities  and investments in certain unconsolidated entities 
commitments and contingent obligations we are committed  under various types of agreements  to provide certain guarantees which are not otherwise reflected in the financial statements 
standby letters of credit locs  guarantees  performance surety bonds and other commitments under these arrangements at november  follows amount of commitment expiration per period outstanding commitments less than year years years after years in millions standby letters of credit guarantees of debt limited maintenance guarantees committed capital contributions performance surety bonds affordable housing communities other total commitments standby letters of credit we provide locs for the benefit of third parties generally to enhance credit or guarantee our performance under certain contractual obligations 
locs are issued by financial institutions for a fee 
we guarantee the reimbursement of any amounts the financial institutions pay to the third party beneficiaries 
to date  financial institutions that have issued locs on our behalf have not made any payments to beneficiaries  nor do we anticipate any payments will be made in the future 
the following are the primary types of locs we provide specific performance issued to guarantee our performance under various development and construction agreements  typically when the beneficiaries will not accept a third party surety bond 
credit enhancement issued to provide the beneficiaries a higher rated credit to look to for the repayment of debt 
in most situations  we would not be able to obtain the debt without providing the locs  or the terms of the debt arrangement would be significantly different 
deposits issued in lieu of cash to satisfy deposit requirements under certain lease and loan agreements 
collateral issued to provide collateral or excess collateral under certain derivative transactions and debt agreements 
the amount of issued and outstanding locs as of november  was million 
guarantees of debt in order for certain of our partnerships to obtain financing for the acquisition and development of their properties  we may need to provide a repayment guarantee to their lenders 
without our guarantee  the partnership may not be able to obtain financing  which would result in additional capital contributions from our partners and us 
to date  we have not made any payments under guarantees of debt  nor do we expect to make any payments in the future 
the amount of outstanding debt guaranteed by us at november  was million 
limited maintenance guarantees for certain partnerships  we provide limited maintenance guarantees to their lenders 
these guarantees require us to fund partnership debt obligations to maintain an established loan to value ratio 
to the extent the value of the collateral for the financing declines to an amount that would cause the partnership to no longer meet such a ratio  we and our partners would be required to reduce the outstanding loan balance by the amount needed to maintain the ratio 
in addition  to certain lenders we have provided a debt service payment guarantee upon an event of default by the borrower 
these guarantees are provided by our partners and us to enable the partnership to obtain third party financing for its projects 
these guarantees also limit the amount of capital we must contribute to the partnership 
to date  we have not made any payments under these limited guarantees  nor do we expect to make any payments in the future 
at november  the amount of outstanding debt related to these limited guarantees was million 
committed capital contributions in the ordinary course of business  we enter into various partnership arrangements 
these arrangements are governed by partnership agreements that describe the partners obligations 
these obligations include making capital contributions from time to time 
the majority of our non affordable housing partnerships contain provisions for an initial capital contribution and future capital contributions as required 
these future contributions are typically not quantifiable  and are therefore not included in the total committed capital contributions provided in the preceding table 
a few of our non affordable housing partnerships contain provisions for capital contributions to be made as defined in the partnership agreements or pursuant to approved annual business plans 
these capital contributions totaled million at november  due to the nature of the affordable housing business  the majority of our affordable housing partnerships are subject to agreements which require specified capital contributions 
these contributions are typically included on schedules which specify the amount and the date or the event that triggers each contribution 
these capital contributions amounted to million at november  in order to receive affordable housing tax credits  we must prepare applications to the respective jurisdictions where we intend to build affordable housing communities prior to their development 
as part of this tax credit application process  we are required to provide both loan commitments and capital contribution commitments related to the underlying affordable housing community 
these types of commitments are usual and customary for the affordable housing business 
these commitments amounted to million at november  we have in the past and plan to continue to fund capital contribution commitments as necessary to conduct our business 
performance surety bonds we obtain surety bonds to support our development obligations under certain development agreements with various municipalities 
surety bonds are customary in the real estate development business 
similar to the locs  we guarantee to the surety provider reimbursement of any amounts they may pay under the surety 
in addition to surety bonds we provide related to our development operations  we also provide surety bonds related to the syndication of affordable housing tax credits 
when tax credits are syndicated  we are required to provide to the internal revenue service bonds with a face amount equal to the amount of income tax recapture we would become subject to if the properties to which the tax credits apply no longer complied with the tax credit requirements 
to date  our bond providers have not made any payments on our behalf under performance or surety bonds  nor do we expect any payments to be made in the future 
at november  we had provided million of surety bonds to third parties 
affordable housing communities other in connection with our syndication of affordable housing tax credits  we provide various guarantees to the investor which are customary in the affordable housing business 
these include agreements to provide additional funding to cover operating cash flow deficiencies  maintain specified debt service coverage ratios and cover financing shortfalls to projects upon completion when the project s permanent financing is insufficient to pay off the project s construction loan 
these commitments amounted to million at november  construction completion guarantees as is customary in the real estate development business  we have provided guarantees to construction lenders that construction of properties we develop will be completed 
we cannot estimate the maximum exposure on these guarantees because the amount of any obligations we might incur would depend on the extent to which costs of completing construction exceeded amounts provided by committed borrowings and capital contributions 
we are not currently aware of any reason to expect we will be required to make payments under any of our outstanding construction completion guarantees 
retained interests in assets transferred to unconsolidated entities in july we completed our second resecuritization transaction 
we transferred million in face value of non investment grade cmbs to a qualifying special purpose entity 
those cmbs were securitized into various classes of non recourse fixed and floating rate bonds comprised of million face value investment grade rated bonds 
the qualifying special purpose entity sold the investment grade rated bonds to unrelated third parties for net proceeds of million  which was used to pay us for the cmbs collateral securities 
we used these proceeds to repay short term debt  the majority of which can be re borrowed 
we recognized a million gain on the sale  realizing the value we added to the resecuritized bonds 
we recovered most of our entire original purchase price on the million portfolio from the sale of the investment grade bonds 
we retained the non investment grade rated bonds and the preferred equity in the qualifying special purpose entity 
we have resecuritized and may continue to resecuritize our non investment grade cmbs investments in order to realize the value we add to these bonds and to better match our assets and liabilities  reduce our interest rate and refinancing risk  improve our liquidity position and strengthen our financial condition 
over the past several years  we have been acquiring non investment grade cmbs  and have been able to remove what we consider to be the riskiest assets before the underlying securitizations take place 
utilizing our due diligence expertise to remove risky assets  by re underwriting each and every property that backs each loan in a transaction  we have been able to improve the quality of the assets underlying the portfolio  which adds substantial value to the non investment grade bonds that we buy 
in addition  our workout and hands on real estate expertise as special servicer for each transaction has enabled these investments to perform exceptionally well 
taking into account the diversification  the quality of the collateral and our involvement in the transaction  rating agencies have rated a significant portion of the face amount of the non investment grade bonds we resecuritized as investment grade 
we can then sell the investment grade bonds to unrelated third parties to realize the added value and to further strengthen our balance sheet 
investments in unconsolidated entities we frequently make investments jointly with others  through partnerships and joint ventures 
this i allows us to further diversify our investment portfolio  spreading risk over a wider range of investments  ii provides access to transactions which are brought to us by other participants  iii provides access to capital and iv enables us to participate in investments which are larger than we are willing to make on our own 
in many instances  we have a less than controlling interest in the partnership or venture  or control is shared  and therefore we account for our interest by the equity method  rather than consolidating the assets and liabilities of the partnership or venture on our balance sheet 
typically  we either invest on a non recourse basis  such as by acquiring a limited partnership interest or an interest in a limited liability company  or we acquire a general partner interest  but hold that interest in a subsidiary which has few  if any  other assets 
in those instances  our exposure to partnership liabilities is essentially limited to the amounts we invest in the partnerships 
however  in some instances we are required to give limited guarantees of debt incurred or other obligations undertaken by the partnerships or ventures 
for certain partnerships  typically those involving real estate property development  we may commit to invest certain amounts in the future based on the partnerships business plan 
on january   the financial accounting standards board issued fasb interpretation fin no 
 consolidation of variable interest entities 
fin no 
will require us to consolidate variable interest entities vies in which we have a controlling financial interest 
under the provisions of fin no 
 we must consolidate vies in which we are the primary beneficiary  which is the entity that will absorb a majority of the entity s expected losses  receive a majority of the entity s expected residual returns  or both  as a result of holding variable interests  which are the ownership  contractual  or other pecuniary interests in an entity 
an entity is considered to be a vie subject to consolidation if either i the total equity investment at risk is not greater than the expected losses of the entity or ii as a group  the other equity holders lack a the ability to make decisions about the entity s activities through voting or similar rights  b the obligation to absorb the expected losses of the entity  or c the right to receive the residual returns of the entity 
fin no 
is effective immediately for variable interests in vies created after january   and is effective on september  for variable interests in vies created before february  we are in the process of evaluating all of our investments and other interests in entities that may be deemed vies under the provisions of fin no 
these include i interests in cmbs pools in which we have invested or act as special servicer  the face amount of which amounted to approximately billion  ii real estate related joint ventures with assets totaling approximately billion  and iii investments in mezzanine loans with underlying assets totaling approximately million  at november  our maximum exposure to loss as a result of our involvement with vies only represents our recorded investment in these assets of approximately billion and the guarantees we provided to these entities of approximately million included in the commitments and contingent obligations discussion above at november  although  we believe that many of these entities will not be consolidated and may not ultimately fall under the provisions of fin no 
 we cannot make any definitive conclusion until we complete our evaluation 
at november   we had investments in unconsolidated partnerships of million 
summarized financial information on a combined basis related to our investments in unconsolidated partnerships accounted for by the equity method at november  follows lnr investment lnr financial interest total partnership assets total partnership liabilities in thousands  except percentages properties single asset partnerships partnerships with lennar llp other affordable housing communities other international loans domestic non performing loan pools securities madison other total although we may own a majority financial interest in certain partnerships  we do not consolidate those partnerships in which control is shared or in which less than a controlling interest is held 
see further discussion under the heading of basis of presentation and consolidation within note to our consolidated financial statements 
debt is non recourse to us except for the million noted in the commitments table discussed above 
single asset partnerships we have investments in single asset partnerships established to acquire  develop  reposition  manage and sell real estate assets 
our investment in these partnerships at november  was million

partnerships with lennar in connection with our spin off from lennar in  lennar transferred parcels of land to us and we transferred these parcels to a general partnership in exchange for a partnership interest in this partnership 
in  certain assets and liabilities of this land partnership were contributed at net book value to a second general partnership and both we and lennar each received general partnership interests in the second partnership 
the two partnerships are collectively referred to as lennar land partners llp 
llp is engaged in the acquisition  development and sale of land and the development and sale of homes

llp also sells land to unrelated developers 
during  llp had land sale revenues of million of which million was from sales to lennar and million was from sales to us 
all major decisions with respect to llp are made on an equal basis between us and lennar 
our by laws require that all significant decisions with respect to llp be approved by a transaction review committee  which is entirely comprised of members of our board who are not directors  officers or employees of lennar

we recorded million of pre tax earnings  made contributions of million and received million in cash distributions from llp in the debt of llp is non recourse to us  with the exception of one million guarantee 
however  a subsidiary of ours  which holds our general partner interests in llp  could be liable as a general partner for llp s debt 
that subsidiary has essentially no assets other than the general partner interests in llp 
along with lennar  we provide limited maintenance guarantees on million of llp debt 
these limited maintenance guarantees only apply if the fair value of the collateral generally land and improvements thereto is less than a specified multiple of the loan balance and llp does not have the ability to reduce the loan balance to the appropriate level 
we have also provided debt service guarantees which only apply if the partnership defaults on its loan arrangements 
if we are required to make a payment under these guarantees  the payment would be accounted for as a capital contribution to the partnership and increase our share of capital distributed upon the dissolution of the partnership 
we have joint ventured with lennar in a number of other projects which require both residential and commercial expertise 
these projects include the redevelopment of two closed military facilities in california  as the federal government moves to put these into the hands of public private partnerships 
these facilities are being converted to master planned communities including housing  office  industrial warehouse  retail  entertainment  etc 
the development and disposition of approximately acres of commercial and residential land in carlsbad  california  of which acres remained at november  the development of residential condominiums within a mixed use project in san francisco  california

the underlying partnership has properties with a net book value of billion and non recourse debt of billion as of november  although we are entitled to of the economic benefits from the partnership in which we have a direct investment  acquiring less than of the partnership s voting rights was a condition of the transaction 
because our partner effectively participates through substantive participative rights as defined in emerging issues task force eitf no 
 investor s accounting for an investee when the investor has a majority of the voting interest but the minority shareholders have certain approval or veto rights  we do not consolidate this partnership

accounting policies in the preparation of our financial statements  we select and apply accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the application of some of these generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in our financial statements and accompanying results 
the accounting policies that include significant estimates and assumptions are in the areas of valuing our investment securities and determining if any are impaired  recognizing interest income on those securities and determining if any of our operating properties are impaired 
as discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements  our investment securities are carried at fair value 
we determine fair value through quoted market prices if available 
where quoted market prices are not available  we estimate fair value based on the present value of estimated future cash flows using our best estimate of certain key assumptions including credit losses  prepayment rates and discount rates 
interest income on these securities is recognized on the level yield method  using the yield that equates the future cash flows  estimated by us as described above  to the amortized cost 
to the extent estimated future cash flows change  the yield on the security is increased or decreased prospectively to the new yield 
a loss is recognized to the extent by which the fair value of the investment security has declined below its amortized cost and the decline in fair value is other than a temporary impairment 
impairment is considered to be other than temporary if the present value of the currently estimated total cash flows related to the security is less than the present value of the previous quarter s estimated total cash flows of that security 
we also review our operating properties for impairment of value 
this includes considering certain indications of impairment such as significant declines in occupancy  other significant changes in property operations  significant deterioration in the surrounding economy or environmental problems 
if such indications are present  we estimate the total future cash flows from the property and compare the total future cash flows to the carrying value of the property 
if the total future cash flows are less than the carrying value  we adjust the carrying value down to its estimated fair value 
fair value may be based on third party appraisals or our estimate of the property s fair value

we are required and plan to adopt the new disclosure requirements of fin no 
for the quarter ending february  the initial recognition and measurement provisions are applicable on a prospective basis to guarantees issued or modified after december  we are currently evaluating whether the adoption of the initial recognition and measurement provisions of fin no 
will have a material effect on our results of operations or financial position

 consolidation of variable interest entities  which is intended to clarify the application of arb no 
 consolidated financial statements to certain entities in which equity investors do not have the characteristics of a controlling financial interest or do not have sufficient equity at risk for the entity to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support 
fin no 
requires us to consolidate variable interest entities vies in which we have a variable interest or a combination of variable interests that will absorb a majority of the entity s expected losses if they occur  receive a majority of the entity s expected residual returns if they occur  or both 
we are required to assess whether or not we are required to consolidate the vie at the time we become involved with the entity 
reconsideration of this assessment is required only if we sell or otherwise dispose of all or part of our variable interest to unrelated third parties  acquire additional interests in the entity  or if the entity s governing documents or the contractual arrangements among the parties involved change 
we are required and plan to adopt the provisions of fin no 
immediately for variable interests in vies created after january   and in the quarter ending november  for variable interests in vies created before february  we have determined that it is reasonably possible that we will be required to consolidate or disclose information about certain vies when fin no 
becomes effective  and accordingly have made certain transitional disclosures required by fin no 
in note to our consolidated financial statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our business activities contain elements of market risk 
the primary market risks we are subject to include i exposure to changes in demand for commercial real estate space in areas in which we own properties  or in areas in which properties securing mortgages directly or indirectly owned by us are located  ii declines in the value of real estate assets due to changes in real estate markets or the economy in general  iii the ability of mortgagors to meet debt obligations and iv interest rate risk 
the first three risk factors noted above are affected primarily by general economic conditions and to some extent by the interest rate environment 
because these factors are not under our control  our attempts to minimize these risks may not always be effective 
we attempt to manage these market risks i through our exhaustive underwriting program  ii through hands on management of the underlying assets and iii by maintaining a portfolio of assets that is diverse by segment  geographic area and property type 
we do not make any investment before extensive hands on property level due diligence is performed 
for each asset  we evaluate the local market  rental rates  vacancy rates and  if applicable  loan and borrower characteristics 
cash flows are evaluated at the property level and loan levels  if applicable  and downside scenario assumptions are stressed 
before any investment is made  it must be approved by corporate senior management through a formal process 
we do not make passive investments  only investing when we have control over the development and implementation of the strategy for enhancing the value of the underlying assets 
we do not invest in disproportionately large assets 
no single asset we own at november  accounted for more than of our total assets 
interest rates are highly sensitive to many factors  including governmental monetary and tax policies  domestic and international economic and political conditions  and other factors beyond our control 
we have an interest rate risk management policy with the objective of i managing our interest costs and ii reducing the effect of unpredictable changes in asset values related to movements in interest rates on our available for sale securities 
as more fully discussed in note to our consolidated financial statements  we employ hedging strategies to limit the effects of changes in interest rates on our operating income and cash flows and on the value of our available for sale securities 
our approach to managing interest rate risk is based primarily on match funding  with the objective that variable rate assets be primarily financed by variable rate liabilities and fixed rate assets be primarily financed by fixed rate liabilities 
most of our variable rate assets are financed with variable rate debt 
to the extent that we have fixed rate assets financed with variable rate debt  we periodically enter into derivative financial instruments  primarily interest rate swap agreements  to manage our interest costs and hedge against risks associated with changing interest rates 
at november   of our existing consolidated indebtedness had interest at variable rates 
approximately of this debt was match funded against variable rate assets and was swapped to fixed rate 
as a result  at year end  we estimate that a basis point change in libor would have impacted our net earnings by million or by per share diluted 
to manage the risk associated with unpredictable changes in asset values related to movements in interest rates on our fixed rate available for sale securities  we periodically use derivative financial instruments  primarily interest rate swap agreements 
we believe our interest rate risk management policy is generally effective 
nonetheless  our profitability may be adversely affected during particular periods as a result of changing interest rates 
in addition  hedging transactions using derivative instruments involve risks such as counterparty credit risk 
the counterparties to our arrangements are lenders of the hedged debt instruments or are major financial institutions  rated a or better  with which we and our affiliates may also have other financial relationships 
these counterparties potentially expose us to credit loss in the event of non performance
