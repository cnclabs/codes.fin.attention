actual results could differ significantly from those estimates under different assumptions and conditions 
the company believes that the following discussion addresses the company s most critical accounting policies  which are those that are most important to the portrayal of the company s consolidated financial condition and results and require management s most difficult  subjective and complex judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
revenue recognition performing  non performing and real estate pools 
in its portfolio asset acquisition and resolution business  commercial corp 
acquires portfolio assets that are designated as non performing  performing or real estate 
each portfolio is accounted for as a pool and not on an individual asset basis  except for real estate portfolios 
to date  a substantial majority of the portfolio assets acquired by commercial corp 
have been designated as non performing 
once a portfolio has been designated as either non performing or performing  such designation is not changed regardless of the performance of the assets comprising the portfolio 
the company recognizes revenue from portfolio assets and acquisition partnerships based on proceeds realized from the resolution of portfolio assets  which proceeds have historically varied significantly and likely will continue to vary significantly from period to period 
non performing portfolio assets non performing portfolio assets consist primarily of distressed loans and loan related assets  such as foreclosed upon collateral 
portfolio assets are designated as non performing unless substantially all of the loans in the portfolio are being repaid in accordance with the contractual terms of the underlying loan agreements 
such portfolios are acquired on the basis of an evaluation by the company of the timing and amount of cash flow expected to be derived from borrower payments or other resolution of the underlying collateral securing the loan 
all non performing portfolio assets are purchased at substantial discounts from their outstanding legal principal amount  the total of the aggregate of expected future sales prices and the total payments to be received from obligors 
subsequent to acquisition  the amortized cost of non performing portfolio assets is evaluated for impairment on a quarterly basis 
the evaluation of impairment is determined based on the review of the estimated future cash receipts  which represents the net realizable value of the non performing pool 
once it is determined that there is impairment  a valuation allowance is established for any impairment identified through provisions charged to operations in the period the impairment is identified 
the company recorded an allowance for impairment of 
million in and million in no allowance was required in net gain on resolution of non performing portfolio assets is recognized as income to the extent that proceeds collected exceed a pro rata portion of allocated cost from the portfolio 
cost allocation is based on a proration of actual proceeds divided by total estimated proceeds of the pool 
no interest income is recognized separately on non performing portfolio assets 
all proceeds  of whatever type  are included in proceeds from resolution of portfolio assets in determining the gain on resolution of such assets 
accounting for portfolios is on a pool basis as opposed to an individual asset by asset basis 
the actual future proceeds of the pool could vary materially from the estimated proceeds of the pool due to changes in economic conditions  deterioration of collateral values  deterioration in the borrowers financial condition and other conditions described in the risk factors discussed later in this document 
in the event that the actual future proceeds of the pool exceed the current estimates the reported future results of the company could be higher than anticipated and would result in a higher net gain on resolution of non performing portfolio assets 
in the event that actual future proceeds of the pool are less than current estimates the reported future results of the company could be lower than anticipated and would result in lower net gain on resolution of non performing portfolio assets or possibly require the company to recognize impairment in the value of the pool 
performing portfolio assets performing portfolio assets consist primarily of portfolios of consumer and commercial loans acquired at a discount from the aggregate amount of the borrowers obligation 
portfolios are classified as performing if substantially all of the loans in the portfolio are being repaid in accordance with the contractual terms of the underlying loan agreements 
performing portfolio assets are carried at the unpaid principal balance of the underlying loans  net of acquisition discounts 
interest is accrued when earned in accordance with the contractual terms of the loans 
the accrual of interest is discontinued once a loan becomes past due days or more 
acquisition discounts for the portfolio as a whole are accreted as an adjustment to yield over the estimated life of the portfolio 
accounting for these portfolios is on a pool basis as opposed to an individual asset by asset basis 
gains are recognized on the performing portfolio assets when sufficient funds are received to fully satisfy the obligation on loans included in the pool  either from funds from the borrower or sale of the loan 
the gain recognized represents the difference between the proceeds received and the allocated carrying value of the individual loan in the pool 
impairment on each performing portfolio is measured based on the present value of the expected future cash flows in the aggregate discounted at the loans risk adjusted rate  which approximates the effective interest rates  or the fair value of the collateral  less estimated selling costs  if any loans are collateral dependent and foreclosure is probable 
the company recorded an allowance for impairment of 
million in no allowance was required in either or the actual future cash flows of the pool could vary materially from the expected future cash flows of the pool due to changes in economic conditions  changes in collateral values  deterioration in the borrowers financial condition  restructure or renewal of individual loans in the pool  sale of loans within the pool and other conditions described in the risk factors discussed later in this document 
in the event that the actual future cash flows of the pool exceed the current estimates  the reported future results of the company could be higher than anticipated and would result in a higher level of interest income due to greater amounts of discount accretion being included in revenue derived from the performing portfolio assets as well as higher gains recognized on the sale of individual loans from a pool 
in the event that actual future cash flows of the pool are less than current estimates  the reported future results of the company could be lower than anticipated and would result in a lower level of interest income and reduced gains from the sale of assets from a pool  lower levels of interest income as a result of lower amounts of discount accretion being included in revenue derived from performing portfolio assets or possibly require the company to recognize impairment in the value of the pool due to a decline in the present value of the expected future cash flows 
real estate portfolios real estate portfolios consist of real estate acquired from a variety of sellers 
such portfolios are carried at the lower of cost or fair value less estimated costs to sell 
costs relating to the development and improvement of real estate for its intended use are capitalized  whereas those relating to holding assets are charged to expense 
income or loss is recognized upon the disposal of the real estate 
rental income  net of expenses  on real estate portfolios is recognized when received 
accounting for the portfolios is on an individual asset by asset basis as opposed to a pool basis 
subsequent to acquisition  the amortized cost of real estate portfolios is evaluated for impairment on a quarterly basis 
the evaluation of impairment is determined based on the review of the estimated future cash receipts  which represents the net realizable value of the real estate portfolio 
a valuation allowance is established for any impairment identified through provisions charged to operations in the period the impairment is identified 
the company recorded an allowance for impairment of 
million in  million in and million in deferred tax asset as a part of the process of preparing its consolidated financial statements  the company is required to estimate its income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which it operates 
this process involves estimating the company s actual current tax exposure together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items for tax and accounting purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax asset and liabilities 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and the tax basis of existing assets and liabilities and operating loss and tax credit carry forwards 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
the effects of future changes in tax laws or changes in tax rates are not anticipated 
the measurement of deferred tax assets  if any  is reduced by the amount of any tax benefits that  based on available evidence  are not expected to be realized 
as a result of the merger  the company has substantial federal nols that can be used to offset the tax liability associated with the company s pre tax earnings until the earlier of the expiration or utilization of such nols 
the company accounts for the benefit of the nols by recording the benefit as an asset and then establishing an allowance to value the net deferred tax asset at a value commensurate with the company s expectation of being able to utilize the recognized benefit in the foreseeable future 
such estimates are reevaluated on a quarterly basis with the adjustment to the allowance recorded as an adjustment to the income tax expense generated by the quarterly operating results 
significant events that change the company s view of its currently estimated ability to utilize the tax benefits  such as the acquisition of harbor in the third quarter of  result in substantial changes to the estimated allowance required to value the deferred tax benefits recognized in the company s periodic consolidated financial statements 
the company s analysis resulted in no change in and and an increase to the valuation allowance of million in due to the evaluation of the recoverability of the deferred tax asset recognized related to the mortgage banking operations  the company increased its valuation allowance by million in similar events could occur in the future  and would impact the recognition of the company s estimate of the required valuation allowance associated with its nols 
if there are changes in the estimated level of the required reserve  operating results will be affected accordingly 
the company has recorded a net deferred tax asset of million in the consolidated balance sheet as of december   which is composed of a gross deferred tax asset of million net of a valuation allowance of million 
realization is dependent on generating sufficient taxable income in a look forward period over the next four years 
although realization is not assured  management believes it is more likely than not that all of the net deferred tax asset will be realized 
the amount of the deferred tax asset considered realizable  however  could be reduced in the near term if estimates of future taxable income during the look forward period are reduced 
in the event that actual results differ from these estimates or the company adjusts these estimates in future periods  the company may need to establish an additional valuation allowance which could materially impact its consolidated financial position and results of operations 
equity investment in drive the company has an equity investment in drive from which it records of the results of drive using the equity method of accounting 
the following discussion addresses the critical accounting policies associated with drive 
retail installment contracts  net retail installment contracts  net consist of sub prime automobile finance receivables  which are acquired from third party dealers at a nonrefundable discount from the contractual principal amount 
at december   all retail installment contracts at drive were held for sale and stated at the lower of cost or fair value in the aggregate 
on july   drive made a decision to change the structure of its securitization transactions to treat the transactions as secured financings for accounting purposes 
therefore  retail installment contracts at drive are classified as held to maturity and carried at amortized cost  net of credit loss reserves at december   and include retail installment contracts pledged under secured financings 
drive does not hedge its retail installment contracts at this time 
management of drive does not believe that drive is exposed to material interest rate risk during the period contracts are not securitized 
interest is accrued when earned in accordance with the contractual terms of the retail installment contract 
the accrual of interest is discontinued once a retail installment contract becomes past due days or more 
discounts on retail installment contracts are recognized as adjustments to the yield of the related contract 
gain on sale of retail installment contracts prior to july drive accounts for sales of retail installment contracts from securitizations in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for transfers and servicing of financial assets and extinguishments of liabilities a replacement of fasb statement no 
sfas 
in applying sfas to drive s securitized retail installment contract sales  drive recognizes revenue gain on sales of retail installment contracts and allocates the total cost of the loans sold to financial components based on their relative fair values 
during the year ended december   drive sold million of auto retail installment contracts in securitization transactions and recognized pre tax gains of million 
drive retained servicing responsibilities and interests in the receivables in the form of residual certificates 
as of december   drive was servicing million of auto receivables that have been sold to certain special purpose financing trusts the trusts 
in connection with the sales of retail installment contracts from securitizations  drive receives certain residual certificates associated with the securitizations as described below 
drive and certain of its subsidiaries have entered into an agreement whereby drive receives all the economic benefits associated with the residual certificates and conversely assumes all the risks 
under the above agreement  drive has retained unrated interests in retail installment contracts sold which are subordinate to senior investors and certificated interest only strips for the benefit of drive which represents the present value of the right to the excess cash flows generated by the securitized contracts which represents the difference between a interest at the stated rate paid by borrowers and b the sum of i pass through interest paid to third party investors  ii trustee fees  iii third party credit enhancement fees if applicable  iv stipulated servicing fees  and v estimated contract portfolio credit losses 
drive s right to receive the cash flows begins after certain over collateralization requirements have been met  which are specific to each securitization and used as a means of credit enhancement 
valuation of residual interests at drive fair value of the residual interests at drive is determined by calculating the present value of the anticipated cash flows at the time each securitization transaction closes  utilizing valuation assumptions appropriate for each particular transaction 
the significant valuation assumptions are related to the anticipated average lives of the retail installment contracts sold  including the effect of anticipated prepayment speeds and anticipated credit losses 
the residual interests are accounted for under statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities 
because such assets can be contractually prepaid or otherwise settled in such a way that the holder would not receive all of the recorded investment  the assets are classified as available for sale investments and are carried at estimated fair value with any accompanying increases or decreases in estimated fair value being recorded as unrealized gains or losses in other comprehensive income loss 
the determination of fair value is based on the present value of the anticipated excess cash flows utilizing various discount rates  prepayment speeds and cumulative loss rates 
drive assesses the carrying value of its securitization related securities for impairment in accordance with the provisions of eitf as discussed below under effect of new accounting standards 
there can be no assurance that the estimates used to determine the fair value of the residual certificates will remain appropriate for the life of each asset and it is reasonably possible that circumstances could change in future periods which could result in a material change in the estimates used to prepare the accompanying financial statements 
if actual retail installment contract prepayments or credit losses exceed the drive s current estimates  other than temporary impairment may be required to be recognized 
the implementation of eitf required drive to record a cumulative effect of accounting change for other than temporary impairments on retained beneficial interests in certain securitized assets  which had previously been recorded as unrealized losses 
as a result  in the second quarter of  the company recognized a charge for the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle of 
million relating to the company s share of drive s cumulative effect because the company believed it to be material to the consolidated results of operations 
equity investments in acquisition partnerships commercial corp 
accounts for its investments in acquisition partnerships using the equity method of accounting 
this accounting method generally results in the pass through of its pro rata share of earnings from the acquisition partnerships activities as if it had a direct investment in the underlying portfolio assets held by the acquisition partnership 
the revenues and earnings of the acquisition partnerships are determined on a basis consistent with the accounting methodology applied to non performing  performing and real estate portfolios described in the preceding paragraphs 
commercial corp 
has ownership interests in the various partnerships that range from to 
the company also holds investments in servicing entities that are accounted for on the equity method 
distributions of cash flow from the acquisition partnerships are a function of the terms and covenants of the loan agreements related to the secured borrowings of the acquisition partnerships 
generally  the terms of the underlying loan agreements permit some distribution of cash flow to the equity partners so long as loan to cost and loan to value relationships are in compliance with the terms and covenants of the applicable loan agreement 
once the secured borrowings of the acquisition partnerships are fully paid  all cash flow in excess of operating expenses is available for distribution to the equity partners 
discontinued operations the company recorded provisions of million in  million in and million in for additional losses from discontinued operations 
the additional provisions primarily relate to a decrease in the estimated future gross cash receipts on residual interests in securitizations 
these securities are in run off  and the company is contractually obligated to service these assets 
the assumptions used in the valuation model consider both industry as well as the company s historical experience 
the decrease in the estimated future gross cash receipts is a result of the actual losses exceeding the losses projected by the valuation model 
as the securities run off  assumptions are reviewed in light of historical evidence in revising the prospective results of the model 
these revised assumptions could potentially result in either an increase or decrease in the estimated cash receipts 
an additional provision is booked based on the output of the valuation model if deemed necessary 
effective during the third quarter of  management of the company adopted formal plans to discontinue the operations of harbor financial group  inc formerly known as firstcity financial mortgage corp 
and its subsidiaries collectively referred to as mortgage corp  and fc capital corp 
capital corp 
these entities comprise the operations that were previously reported as the company s residential and commercial mortgage banking business 
as formal termination plans were adopted and historical business operations at each entity have ceased  the results of operations for have been reflected as discontinued operations in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations 
additionally  the net assets related to the resolution of activity from the discontinued operations have been reflected in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets 
revenues from discontinued operations were zero in  and the only assets remaining from discontinued operations are the investment securities resulting from the retention of residual interests in securitization transactions 
these residual interests are classified as discontinued operations even though the liquidation or run off of the securitized assets extends longer than one year because the company is contractually obligated to service the securitized assets as master servicer 
the company has considered the estimated future gross cash receipts for such investment securities in the computation of the loss from discontinued operations 
the cash flows are collected over a period of time and are valued using prepayment assumptions of to for fixed rate loans and to for variable rate loans 
overall loss rates are estimated from to of collateral 
the company uses modeling techniques to estimate future results from discontinued operations that consider the contractual terms of the securitization structures and using the assumptions stated above 
the actual cash flows received from the residual interests in the future could differ materially positively or negatively due to factors such as economic conditions  changes in collateral values  fluctuating interest rates  differences between actual prepayments and actual losses  which differ from the assumptions used in the estimating process 
estimates of future cash receipts the company uses estimates to determine future cash receipts from portfolio assets 
these estimates of future cash receipts from acquired portfolio asset pools are utilized in four primary ways i to calculate the allocation of cost of sales of non performing portfolios  ii to determine the effective yield of performing portfolios  iii to determine the reasonableness of settlement offers received in the liquidation of the portfolio assets  and iv to determine whether or not there is impairment in a pool of portfolio assets calculation of the estimates of future cash receipts the company uses a proprietary asset management software program to manage the portfolio assets it owns and services 
each asset within a pool is analyzed by an account manager who is responsible for analyzing the characteristics of each asset within a pool 
the account manager projects future cash receipts and expenses related to each asset and the sum of which provides the total estimated future cash receipts related to a particular purchased asset pool 
these estimates are routinely monitored by the company to determine reasonableness of the estimates provided 
risks associated with these estimates the company has in the past been able to establish with reasonable accuracy the estimated future cash receipts over the life of a purchased asset pool 
changes in economic conditions  fluctuations in interest rates  deterioration of collateral values  and other factors described in the risk factors section could cause the estimates of future cash flows to be materially different than actual cash receipts 
the effects of an increase in the estimated future cash receipts would generally increase revenues from portfolio assets by increasing gross profit on a non performing or real estate pool and increasing the effective yield on a performing portfolio while a decrease in future cash receipts would generally have the effect of reducing revenues by reducing gross profit on a non performing or real estate pool and decreasing the effective yield on a performing portfolio 
in some cases a reduction in the total future cash receipts by collecting those cash receipts sooner than expected could have a positive impact on the company s revenues from portfolio assets due to reduced interest expense and other carrying costs associated with the portfolio assets 
likewise an increase in future cash receipts  although generally a positive trend  could have a negative impact on future revenues of the company due to higher levels of interest expense and other carrying costs of the portfolios negating any potentially positive effects 
consolidation policy the accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts of all of the majority owned subsidiaries of the company 
all significant intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated in consolidation 
investments in to owned affiliates are accounted for on the equity method since the company has the ability to exercise significant influence over operating and financial policies of those affiliates 
for domestic acquisition partnerships  the company owns a limited partner interest and generally shares in a general partner interest 
regarding the foreign investments  the company participates as a limited partner 
in all cases the company s direct and indirect equity interest never exceeds 
investments in less than owned affiliates are also accounted for on the equity method 
these investments are partnerships formed to share in the risks and rewards in developing new markets as well as to pool resources 
also  the company has the ability to exercise significant influence over operating and financial policies  despite its comparatively smaller equity percentage  due to its leading role in the formation of these partnerships as well as its involvement in the day to day management activities 
relationship with cargill cargill is a wholly owned subsidiary of cargill  incorporated  which is generally regarded as one of the world s largest privately held corporations and has offices worldwide 
cargill and its affiliates provide significant debt and equity financing to the acquisition partnerships 
in addition  commercial corp 
believes its relationship with cargill significantly enhances commercial corp 
s credibility as a purchaser of portfolio assets and facilitates its ability to expand into related businesses and foreign markets 
under the right of first refusal agreement  if the company receives an invitation to bid on or otherwise obtains an opportunity to acquire interests in loans  receivables  real estate or other assets located in the united states  canada  latin america  or the caribbean in which the aggregate amount to be bid exceeds million  or thousand for consumer assets  the company is required to follow a prescribed notice procedure pursuant to which cfsc has the option to participate in the proposed purchase by requiring that such purchase or acquisition be effected through an acquisition partnership formed by the company and cargill or an affiliate 
the right of first refusal agreement does not prohibit the company from holding discussions with entities other than cfsc regarding potential joint purchases of interests in loans  receivables  real estate or other assets  provided that any such purchase is subject to cfsc s right to participate in the company s share of the investment 
the right of first refusal agreement further provides that  subject to certain conditions  cfsc will bear of the due diligence expenses incurred by the company in connection with proposed asset purchases 
the right of first refusal agreement is a restatement and extension of a similar agreement entered into among the company  certain members of the company s management and cargill in the right of first refusal agreement has a termination date of february  and will renew automatically for an additional year on an annual basis thereafter unless either party gives notice to the other of its desire to discontinue the arrangement six months prior to the termination date 
future increases in the company s investments in portfolio assets acquired from institutions and government agencies may be obtained through investment entities formed with cargill  whereby cargill shares a general partner interest  thereby capitalizing on the expertise of cargill whose skills complement those of the company

million of unaccrued dividends through september changes in internal controls there have been no changes in internal controls or in other factors that significantly changed internal controls during the fiscal year ended december effect of new accounting standards in march  the company adopted the provisions of eitf  recognition of interest income and impairment on purchased and retained beneficial interests in securitized financial assets eitf  which requires that other than temporary impairments in beneficial interests be written down to fair value with the resulting charge being included in operations 
the implementation of eitf required drive to record a cumulative effect of accounting change for other than temporary impairments on retained beneficial interests in certain securitized assets  which had previously been recorded as unrealized losses 
as a result  in the second quarter of  the company recognized a charge for the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle of 
million relating to the company s share of drive s cumulative effect because the company believed it to be material to the consolidated results of operations 
on january   the company adopted statement of financial accounting standards sfas  goodwill and other intangible assets sfas and sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets sfas 
sfas requires that goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite useful lives no longer be amortized but instead be tested for impairment at least annually in accordance with the provisions of sfas sfas requires that intangible assets with definite useful lives be amortized over their respective estimated useful lives to their estimated residual values  and reviewed for impairment in accordance with the sfas  accounting for the impairment of long lived assets to be disposed of sfas and sfas after it superceded sfas the adoption of sfas did not have a material impact on the company s consolidated financial statements  as unamortized goodwill at december  was 
million 
sfas addresses the accounting model for long lived assets to be disposed of by sale and resulting implementation issues 
this statement requires that those long lived assets be measured at the lower of carrying amount or fair value less cost to sell  whether reported in continuing operations or in discontinued operations 
it also broadens the reporting of discontinued operations to include all components of an entity with operations that can be distinguished from the rest of the entity and that will be eliminated from the ongoing operations of the entity in a disposal transaction 
additionally  discontinued operations that are not disposed of within one year must be reclassified as assets held and used unless the discontinued segment will be abandoned through the liquidation or run off of operations because the entity is obligated by regulation or contract to provide services after it ceases accepting all new business and is being reported as a discontinued operation when sfas is initially applied 
the only assets remaining from discontinued operations are the investment securities resulting from the retention of residual interests in securitization transactions 
since the company is contractually obligated to service the securitized assets  the adoption of sfas had no impact on the company s consolidated financial statements 
on april   the company elected early adoption of sfas no 
 rescission of fasb statements no 
 and  amendment of fasb statement no 
 and technical corrections sfas 
sfas updates  clarifies and simplifies existing accounting pronouncements 
as it relates to firstcity  sfas eliminates the extraordinary gain classification on early debt extinguishments 
instead  the gains associated with the early extinguishment of debt have been recorded in other income in the consolidated statements of operations 
the result of this adoption did not modify or adjust net loss for any period and does not impact the company s compliance with various debt covenants 
the effect of sfas resulted in the extinguishment of debt of 
million in being included in other income in the consolidated statements of operations 
in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure  an amendment of fasb statement no 
sfas 
sfas amends fasb statement no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  to provide alternative methods of transition to sfas s fair value method of accounting for stock based employee compensation 
sfas also amends the disclosure provisions of sfas no 
and apb opinion no 
 interim financial reporting  to require disclosure in the summary of significant accounting policies of the effects of an entity s accounting policy with respect to stock based employee compensation on reported net income or loss and earnings loss per share in annual and interim consolidated financial statements 
sfas does not amend sfas to require companies to account for stock based employee compensation using the fair value method  regardless of whether they account for that compensation using the fair value method of sfas or the intrinsic value method of apb opinion no 
as allowed by sfas  the company has elected to continue to utilize the accounting method prescribed by apb opinion no 
and has adopted the disclosure requirements of sfas as of december  in november  the fasb issued fasb interpretation no 
 guarantor s accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees  including indirect guarantees of indebtedness of others  an interpretation of fasb statements no 
 and and rescission of fasb interpretation no 
fin 
fin requires that a liability be recorded in the guarantor s balance sheet upon issuance of a guarantee 
in addition  fin requires disclosures about the guarantees that an entity has issued  including a reconciliation of changes in the entity s product warranty liabilities 
the initial recognition and initial measurement provisions of fin are applicable on a prospective basis to guarantees issued or modified after december   irrespective of the guarantor s fiscal year end 
the disclosure requirements of fin are effective for financial statements of interim or annual periods ending after december  the company believes that the adoption of fin will have no material impact on its consolidated financial statements and applicable disclosure requirements are included in the notes to its consolidated financial statements 
in january  the fasb issued fasb interpretation no 
 consolidation of variable interest entities  an interpretation of arb no 
fin 
fin requires certain variable interest entities to be consolidated by the primary beneficiary of the entity if the equity investors in the entity do not have the characteristics of a controlling financial interest or do not have sufficient equity at risk for the entity to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support from other parties 
fin is effective immediately for all new variable interest entities created or acquired after january  for variable interest entities created or acquired prior to february   the provisions of fin must be applied for the first interim or annual period beginning after june  fin also requires certain disclosures in financial statements issued after january  if it is reasonably possible that the entity will consolidate or disclose information about variable interest entities when fin becomes effective 
although management is still evaluating the impact of fin  the adoption is not expected to have a material effect 
presently the company has identified one acquisition partnership  which may qualify for consolidation in accordance with fin this acquisition partnership holds real estate that is being developed for its intended use 
as of december   the total assets that would be consolidated into the company s consolidated financial statements were million 
the maximum loss exposure to the company related to this acquisition partnership is estimated to be 
million as of december  risk factors availability of portfolio assets the portfolio asset acquisition and resolution business is affected by long term cycles in the general economy 
the company cannot predict its future annual acquisition volume of portfolio assets 
moreover  future portfolio asset purchases will depend on the availability of portfolios offered for sale  the availability of capital and the company s ability to submit successful bids to purchase portfolio assets 
the acquisition of portfolio assets is highly competitive in the united states 
this may require the company to acquire portfolio assets at higher prices thereby lowering profit margins on the resolution of such portfolios 
to offset these changes in the domestic arena  the company continues to develop its presence in other markets 
under certain circumstances  the company may choose not to bid for portfolio assets that it believes cannot be acquired at attractive prices 
as a result of all the above factors  portfolio asset purchases  and the revenue derived from the resolution of portfolio assets  may vary significantly from quarter to quarter 
assumptions underlying portfolio asset performance the purchase price and carrying value of portfolio assets acquired by commercial corp 
are determined largely by estimating expected future cash flows from such assets 
commercial corp 
develops and revises such estimates based on its historical experience and current market conditions  and based on the discount rates that the company believes are appropriate for the assets comprising the portfolios 
in addition  many obligors on portfolio assets have impaired credit  with risks associated with such obligors similar to the risks described in respect of borrowers under credit impaired borrowers at drive 
if the amount and timing of actual cash flows is materially different from estimates  the company s consolidated financial position  results of operations and business prospects could be materially adversely affected 
risk associated with foreign operations commercial corp 
has acquired  and manages and resolves  portfolio assets located in france and mexico and is actively pursuing opportunities to purchase additional pools of distressed assets in these locations as well as other areas of western europe  southeast asia and central and south america 
foreign operations are subject to various special risks  including currency translation risks  currency exchange rate fluctuations  exchange controls and different political  social and legal environments within such foreign markets 
to the extent future financing in foreign currencies is unavailable at reasonable rates  the company would be further exposed to currency translation risks  currency exchange rate fluctuations and exchange controls 
in addition  earnings of foreign operations may be subject to foreign income taxes that reduce cash flow available to meet debt service requirements and other obligations of the company  which may be payable even if the company has no earnings on a consolidated basis 
any or all of the foregoing could have a material adverse effect on the company s consolidated position  results of operations and business prospects 
impact of changing interest rates because most of the company s borrowings are at variable rates of interest  the company will be impacted by fluctuations in interest rates 
however  certain effects of changes in interest rates  such as increased prepayments of outstanding loans  cannot be mitigated 
fluctuations in interest rates could have a material adverse effect on the company s consolidated financial position  results of operations and business prospects 
a substantial and sustained decline in interest rates may adversely impact the amount of distressed assets available for purchase by commercial corp 
the value of the company s interest earning assets and liabilities may be directly affected by the level of and fluctuations in interest rates  including the valuation of any residual interests in securitizations that would be severely impacted by increased loan prepayments resulting from declining interest rates 
conversely  a substantial and sustained increase in interest rates could adversely affect the ability of the company to originate loans and could reduce the gains recognized by the company upon their securitization and sale 
fluctuating interest rates also may affect the net interest income earned by the company resulting from the difference between the yield to the company on loans held pending sale and the interest paid by the company for funds borrowed under the company s warehouse credit facilities or otherwise 
see item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 
continuing need for financing general 
the successful execution of the company s business strategy depends on its continued access to financing 
in addition to the need for such financing  the company must have access to liquidity to invest as equity or subordinated debt to meet its capital needs 
liquidity is generated by the cash flow to the company from subsidiaries  access to the public debt and equity markets and borrowings incurred by the company 
the company s access to the capital markets is affected by such factors as changes in interest rates  general economic conditions  and the perception in the capital markets of the company s business  results of operations  leverage  financial position and business prospects 
in addition  the company s ability to issue and sell common equity including securities convertible into  or exercisable or exchangeable for  common equity is limited as a result of the tax laws relating to the preservation of the nols available to the company as a result of the merger 
there can be no assurance that the company s funding relationships with commercial banks  investment banks and financial services companies including cargill and the senior lenders that have previously provided financing for the company and its subsidiaries will continue past their respective current maturity dates 
some credit facilities to which the company and its subsidiaries are parties have short term maturities 
if these credit facilities are not extended and the company or its subsidiaries cannot find alternative funding sources on satisfactory terms  or at all  the company s consolidated financial position  results of operations and business prospects would be materially adversely affected 
see liquidity and capital resources 
each of the company and its major operating subsidiaries has its own source of debt financing 
in certain circumstances  a default by the company or any of its major operating subsidiaries in respect of indebtedness owed to a third party constitutes a default under the company s credit facility 
although the company intends to segregate the debt obligations of each such subsidiary  there can be no assurance that its existing financing sources will continue to agree to such arrangements or that alternative financing sources that would accept such arrangements would be available 
in the event the company s major operating subsidiaries are compelled to accept cross guarantees  or cross default or cross acceleration provisions in connection with their respective credit facilities  financial difficulties experienced by one of the company s subsidiaries could adversely impact the company s other subsidiaries 
dependence on warehouse financing at drive 
as is customary in the consumer lending businesses  drive depends upon warehouse credit facilities with financial institutions or institutional lenders to finance the origination and purchase of loans on a short term basis pending sale or securitization 
implementation of the drive s business strategy requires the continued availability of warehouse credit facilities  and may require increases in the permitted borrowing levels under such facilities 
there can be no assurance that such financing will be available on terms satisfactory to drive 
the inability of drive or its subsidiaries to arrange additional warehouse credit facilities  to extend or replace existing facilities when they expire or to increase the capacity of such facilities may have a material adverse effect on the company s consolidated position  results of operations and business prospects 
risk of declining value of collateral the value of the collateral securing automobile and other consumer loans and loans acquired for resolution  as well as real estate or other acquired distressed assets  is subject to various risks  including uninsured damage  change in location or decline in value caused by use  age or market conditions 
any material decline in the value of such collateral could adversely affect the consolidated financial position  results of operations and business prospects of the company 
risks of securitization by drive significance of securitization 
the company continues to believe that drive s ability to securitize sub prime automobile loans is necessary to efficiently finance the volume of assets expected to be generated 
accordingly  adverse changes in the secondary market for such loans could impair drive s ability to purchase and securitize on a favorable or timely basis 
any such impairment could have a material adverse effect upon drive s consolidated position  results of operations and business prospects 
proceeds from the securitization of acquired loans are required to be used to repay borrowings under warehouse credit facilities  which makes such facilities available to finance the purchase of additional loan assets 
there can be no assurance that  as drive s volume of loans purchased increases  drive will be able to securitize its loan production efficiently 
an inability of drive to efficiently securitize its loan production could have a material adverse effect on the company s consolidated position  results of operations and business prospects 
securitization transactions may be affected by a number of factors  some of which are beyond drive s control  including  among other things  the adverse financial condition of  or developments related to  some of drive s competitors  conditions in the securities markets in general  and conditions in the asset backed securitization market 
drive s securitizations typically utilize credit enhancements in the form of financial guaranty insurance policies in order to achieve enhanced credit ratings 
failure to obtain insurance company credit enhancement could adversely affect the timing of or ability of drive to effect securitizations 
in addition  the failure to satisfy rating agency requirements with respect to loan pools would adversely impact drive s ability to effect securitizations 
contingent risks 
during  drive began structuring securitization transactions as secured financings and retaining the assets on the balance sheet and thus retains the credit risk on substantially all loans securitized in this manner 
drive is subject to various business risks associated with the lending business  including the risk of borrower default  the risk of foreclosure and the risk that a rapid increase in interest rates would result in a decline in the future net interest margins on future securitizations 
drive expects that the terms of its securitizations will require it to establish deposit accounts or build over collateralization levels through retention of distributions otherwise payable to drive who holds the subordinated interests in the securitization 
drive also expects to be required to commit to repurchase or replace loans that do not conform to the representations and warranties made by drive at the time of securitization 
retained risks of securitized loans 
drive makes various representations with respect to the loans that it securitizes 
with respect to acquired loans  drive s representations rely in part on similar representations made by the originators of such loans when drive purchased them 
in the event of a breach of its representations  drive may be required to repurchase or replace the related loan using its own funds 
while drive may have a claim against the originator in the event of a breach of any of these representations made by the originators  the company s ability to recover on any such claim will be dependent on the financial condition of the originator 
there can be no assurance that drive will not experience a material loss associated with any of these contingencies 
performance assumptions 
securitizations completed by drive for the foreseeable future will be structured as debt financings and will result in a growth of the net interest margin and grow drive s balance sheet 
prior to july drive structured the securitizations as sales and retains subordinated interests in those securitizations 
management of drive makes a number of assumptions in determining the estimated fair value for the subordinated interests 
these assumptions include  but are not limited to  prepayment speeds  default rates and subsequent losses on the underlying loans  and the discount rates used to present value the future cash flows 
all of the assumptions are subjective 
varying the assumptions can have a material effect on the present value determination in one securitization as compared to any other 
subsequent events will cause the actual occurrences of prepayments  losses and interest rates to be different from the assumptions used for such factors at the time of the recognition of the sale of the loans 
the effect of the subsequently occurring events could cause a re evaluation of the carrying values of the previously estimated values of the subordinated interests and excess spreads and such adjustment could be material 
defaults and losses on defaults increased in and due to recession related factors 
of major importance was the reduction in used car values caused by the events of september   when  facing significant slowdowns in travel  the car rental agencies reduced their fleets dramatically 
this  compounded by the zero percent financing offered on new cars  flooded the used car market creating downward pressure on used car values 
because the subordinated interests to be retained by drive represent claims to future cash flow that are subordinated to holders of senior interests  drive retains a significant portion of the risk of whether the full value of the underlying loans may be realized 
in addition  holders of the senior interests may have the right to receive certain additional payments on account of principal in order to reduce the balance of the senior interests in proportion to the credit enhancement requirements of any particular transaction 
such payments for the benefit of the senior interest holders will delay the payment  if any  of excess cash flow to drive as the holder of the subordinated interests 
risk of minority investment in drive although the company continues to have some influence on drive and its operations  due to the sale of of its interest  the company now maintains a minority interest in drive 
there can be no guarantee that drive s future operations will be consistent with the company s goals credit impaired borrowers at drive drive s sub prime borrowers generally are unable to obtain credit from traditional financial institutions due to factors such as an impaired or poor credit history  low income or other adverse credit events 
drive is subject to various risks associated with these borrowers  including  but not limited to  the risk that the borrowers will not satisfy their debt service obligations and that the realizable value of the assets securing their loans will not be sufficient to repay the borrowers debt 
while the company believes that the underwriting criteria and collection methods drive employs enable it to identify and control the higher risks inherent in loans made to such borrowers  and that the interest rates charged compensate drive for the risks inherent in such loans  no assurance can be given that such criteria or methods  or such interest rates  will afford adequate protection against  or compensation for  higher than anticipated delinquencies  foreclosures or losses 
the actual rate of delinquencies  foreclosures or losses could be significantly accelerated by an economic downturn or recession 
consequently  the company s consolidated financial position  results of operations primarily consumer corp 
s equity earnings in drive and business prospects could be materially adversely affected 
retail installment contracts at drive are held for sale and stated at the lower of cost or fair value in the aggregate 
drive does not hedge its retail installment contracts while held for sale 
while management of drive does not believe drive is exposed to material interest rate risk during the period contracts are held for sale  there can be no assurance that future material valuation impairments will not be required 
availability of net operating loss carryforwards the company believes that  as a result of the merger  approximately million of nols were available to the company to offset future taxable income as of december  since december   the company has generated an additional million in tax operating losses 
accordingly  as of december   the company believes that it has approximately million of nols available to offset future taxable income 
out of the total million of nols  the company estimates it will be able to utilize million  which equates to a million deferred tax asset on the company s books and records 
however  because the company s position in respect of its million nols resulting from the merger is based upon factual determinations and upon legal issues with respect to which there is uncertainty and because no ruling has been obtained from the internal revenue service the irs regarding the availability of the nols to the company  there can be no assurance that the irs will not challenge the availability of such nols and  if challenged  that the irs will not be successful in disallowing this portion of the company s nols  with the result that the company s million deferred tax asset would be reduced or eliminated 
some of the nols may be carried forward to offset future federal taxable income of the company through the year  however  the availability of some of the nols begins to expire beginning in the ability of the company to utilize such nols will be severely limited if there is a more than ownership change of the company during a three year testing period within the meaning of section of the internal revenue code of  as amended the tax code 
if the company were unable to utilize its nols to offset future taxable income  it would lose significant competitive advantages that it now enjoys 
such advantages include  but are not limited to  the company s ability to offset non cash income recognized by the company in connection with certain securitizations  to generate capital to support its expansion plans on a tax advantaged basis  to offset its and its consolidated subsidiaries pretax income  and to have access to the cash flow that would otherwise be represented by payments of federal tax liabilities 
assumptions regarding recognition of deferred tax asset as noted above  the company has nols available for federal income tax purposes to offset future federal taxable income  if any  through the year a valuation allowance is provided to reduce the deferred tax assets to a level  which  more likely than not  will be realized 
realization is determined based on management s expectation of generating sufficient taxable income in a look forward period over the next four years 
the ultimate realization of the resulting net deferred tax asset is dependent upon generating sufficient taxable income prior to expiration of the net operating loss carryforwards 
although realization is not assured  management believes it is more likely than not that all of the recorded deferred tax asset  net of the allowance  will be realized 
the amount of the deferred tax asset considered realizable  however  could be adjusted in the future if estimates of future taxable income during the carryforward period change 
the change in valuation allowance represents a change in the estimate of the future taxable income during the carryforward period since the prior year end and utilization of net operating loss carryforwards since the merger 
the ability of the company to realize the deferred tax asset is periodically reviewed and the valuation allowance is adjusted accordingly 
see discussion of critical accounting policies deferred tax asset 
environmental liabilities the company  through its subsidiaries and affiliates  acquires real property in its portfolio asset acquisition and resolution business 
there is a risk that properties acquired by the company could contain hazardous substances or waste  contaminants or pollutants 
the company may be required to remove such substances from the affected properties at its expense  and the cost of such removal may substantially exceed the value of the affected properties or the loans secured by such properties 
furthermore  the company may not have adequate remedies against the prior owners or other responsible parties to recover its costs  either as a matter of law or regulation  or as a result of such prior owners financial inability to pay such costs 
the company may find it difficult or impossible to sell the affected properties either prior to or following any such removal 
competition all of the businesses in which the company operates are highly competitive 
some of the company s principal competitors are substantially larger and better capitalized than the company 
because of their resources  these companies may be better able than the company to obtain new customers for loan production  to acquire portfolio assets  to pursue new business opportunities or to survive periods of industry consolidation 
access to and the cost of capital are critical to the company s ability to compete 
many of the company s competitors have superior access to capital sources and can arrange or obtain lower cost of capital  resulting in a competitive disadvantage to the company with respect to such competitors 
in addition  certain of the company s competitors may have higher risk tolerances or different risk assessments  which could allow these competitors to establish lower margin requirements and pricing levels than those established by the company 
in the event a significant number of competitors establish pricing levels below those established by the company  the company s ability to compete would be adversely affected 
general economic conditions periods of economic slowdown or recession  or declining demand for commercial real estate  automobile loans or other commercial or consumer loans may adversely affect the company s business 
economic downturns may reduce the number of loan originations by the company s consumer business and negatively impact its securitization activity and generally reduce the value of the company s assets 
in addition  periods of economic slowdown or recession  whether general  regional or industry related  may increase the risk of default on loans and could have a material adverse effect on the company s consolidated financial condition  results of operations and business prospects 
such periods also may be accompanied by declining values of automobiles and other property securing outstanding loans  thereby weakening collateral coverage and increasing the possibility of losses in the event of default 
due to significant increases in automobiles for sale during the recent recessionary economic period have depressed the prices at which such collateral may be sold or delayed the timing of such sales 
there can be no assurance that there will be adequate markets for the sale of repossessed automobiles 
any additional deterioration of such markets could reduce recoveries from the sale of collateral 
such economic conditions could also adversely affect the resolution of portfolio assets  lead to a decline in prices or demand for collateral underlying portfolio assets  or increase the cost of capital invested by the company and the length of time that capital is invested in a particular portfolio 
all or any one of these events could decrease the rate of return and profits to be realized from such portfolio and materially adversely affect the company s consolidated financial position  results of operations and business prospects 
government regulation some aspects of the company s business are subject to regulation  examination and licensing under various federal  state and local statutes and regulations that impose requirements and restrictions affecting  among other things  credit activities  maximum interest rates  finance and other charges  disclosures to obligors  the terms of secured transactions  collection  repossession and claims handling procedures  multiple qualification and licensing requirements for doing business in various jurisdictions  and other trade practices 
the company believes it is currently in compliance in all material respects with applicable regulations  but there can be no assurance that the company will be able to maintain such compliance 
failure to comply with  or changes in  these laws or regulations  or the expansion of the company s business into jurisdictions that have adopted more stringent regulatory requirements than those in which the company currently conducts business  could have an adverse effect on the company by  among other things  limiting the income the company may generate on existing and additional loans  limiting the states in which the company may operate or restricting the company s ability to realize on the collateral securing its loans

relationship with and dependence upon cargill the company s relationship with cargill is material in a number of respects 
cargill  a subsidiary of cargill  incorporated  a privately held  multi national agricultural and financial services company  provides equity and debt financings for many of the acquisition partnerships 
cargill owns approximately of the company s outstanding common stock  and a cargill designee  jeffery leu  serves as a director of the company 
the company believes its relationship with cargill significantly enhances the company s credibility as a purchaser of portfolio assets and facilitates its ability to expand into other businesses and foreign markets 
although management believes that the company s relationship with cargill is excellent  there can be no assurance that such relationship will continue in the future 
absent such relationship  the company and the acquisition partnerships would be required to find alternative sources for the financing that cargill has historically provided 
there can be no assurance that such alternative financing would be available 
any termination of such relationship could have a material adverse effect on the company s consolidated financial position  results of operations and business prospects 
dependence on key personnel the company is dependent on the efforts of its senior executive officers  particularly james r 
hawkins chairman of the board and james t 
sartain president and chief executive officer 
the company is also dependent on several of the key members of management of each of its operating subsidiaries  many of whom were instrumental in developing and implementing the business strategy for such subsidiaries 
the inability or unwillingness of one or more of these individuals to continue in his present role could have a material adverse effect on the company s consolidated condition  results of operations and business prospects 
there can be no assurance that any of the foregoing individuals will continue to serve in his current capacity or for what time period such service might continue 
the company does not maintain key person life insurance for any of its senior executive officers

shares eligible for future sale the utilization of the company s million in nols resulting from the merger may be limited or prohibited under the tax code in the event of certain ownership changes 
the company s amended and restated certificate of incorporation the certificate of incorporation contains provisions restricting the transfer of its securities that are designed to avoid the possibility of such changes 
such restrictions may prevent certain holders of common stock of the company from transferring such stock even if such holders are permitted to sell such stock without restriction under the securities act of  as amended  and may limit the company s ability to sell common stock to certain existing holders of common stock at an advantageous time or at a time when capital may be required but unavailable from any other source 
period to period variances the revenue of commercial corp 
and acquisition partnerships is based on proceeds realized from the resolution of the portfolio assets  which proceeds have historically varied significantly and likely will continue to vary significantly from period to period 
likewise  earnings from drive are dependent on the timing of securitization transactions of drive 
consequently  the company s period to period revenue and results of operations have historically varied  and are likely to continue to vary  correspondingly 
such variances  alone or with other factors  such as conditions in the economy or the financial services industries or other developments affecting the company  may result in significant fluctuations in the reported operations of the company and in the trading prices of the company s securities  particularly the common stock 
tax  monetary and fiscal policy changes the company originates and acquires financial assets  the value and income potential of which are subject to influence by various state and federal tax  monetary and fiscal policies in effect from time to time 
the nature and direction of such policies are entirely outside the control of the company  and the company cannot predict the timing or effect of changes in such policies 
changes in such policies could have a material adverse effect on the company s consolidated financial position  results of operations and business prospects 
dependence on automobile dealership relationships the ability of the drive to expand into new geographic markets and to maintain or increase its volume of automobile loans is dependent upon maintaining and expanding the network of franchised automobile dealerships from which it purchases contracts 
increased competition  including competition from captive finance affiliates of automobile manufacturers  could have a material adverse effect on the drive s ability to maintain or expand its dealership network 
anti takeover considerations the company s certificate of incorporation and by laws contain a number of provisions relating to corporate governance and the rights of stockholders 
certain of these provisions may be deemed to have a potential anti takeover effect to the extent they are utilized to delay  defer or prevent a change of control of the company by deterring unsolicited tender offers or other unilateral takeover proposals and compelling negotiations with the company s board of directors rather than non negotiated takeover attempts even if such events may be in the best interests of the company s stockholders 
the certificate of incorporation also contains certain provisions restricting the transfer of its securities that are designed to prevent ownership changes that might limit or eliminate the ability of the company to use its nols resulting from the merger 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk is the risk of loss from adverse changes in market prices and interest rates 
the company s operations are materially impacted by net gains on sales of loans and net interest margins 
the level of gains from loan sales the company achieves is dependent on demand for the products originated 
net interest margins are dependent on the company ability to maintain the spread or interest differential between the interest it charges the customer for loans and the interest the company is charged for the financing of those loans 
the following describes each component of interest bearing assets held by the company and how each could be affected by changes in interest rates 
the company invests in portfolio assets both directly through consolidated subsidiaries and indirectly through equity investments in acquisition partnerships 
portfolio assets consist of investments in pools of non homogenous assets that predominantly consist of loan and real estate assets 
earnings from these assets are based on the estimated future cash flows from such assets and recorded when those cash flows occur 
the underlying loans within these pools bear both fixed and variable rates 
due to the non performing nature and history of these loans  changes in prevailing benchmark rates such as the prime rate or libor generally have a nominal effect on the ultimate future cash flow to be realized from the loan assets 
furthermore  these pools of assets are held for sale  not for investment  therefore  the disposition strategy is to liquidate these assets as quickly as possible 
loans receivable consist of investment loans made to acquisition partnerships located in mexico and bear interest at predominately fixed rates 
the collectibility of these loans is directly related to the underlying portfolio assets of those acquisition partnerships  which are non performing in nature 
therefore  changes in benchmark rates would have minimal effect on the collectibility of these loans 
the company s equity investment in drive is materially impacted by net interest margins and the ability to securitize the loans drive originates 
during  drive elected not to use gain on sale treatment when assets were securitized 
instead  drive pursued a strategy to grow the balance sheet and record interest income from loans and interest expense on the related debt as incurred to build an earnings stream over time 
demand from potential investors in drive s securitizations is affected by the perception of credit quality and prepayment risk associated with the loans drive originates and securitizes 
the timing and size and interest rates of the bonds issued as a part of the securitizations could also have a material effect on the net income of drive 
interest rates offered to customers also affect prices paid for loans 
these rates are determined by review of competitors rate offerings to the public and current prices being paid to drive for the products 
drive does not hedge these price risks 
drive s residual interests in securitizations represent the present value of the excess cash flows drive expects to receive over the life of the underlying sub prime automobile loans 
the sub prime automobile residual interests are affected less by prepayment speeds due to the shorter term of the underlying assets and the fact that the loans are fixed rate  generally at the highest rate allowable by law 
additionally the company has various sources of financing which have been previously described in item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations liquidity and capital resources 
in summary  the company would be negatively impacted by rising interest rates and declining prices of its sub prime loans 
rising interest rates would negatively impact the value of residual interests in securitizations currently held and costs of borrowings under the warehouse lines and new secured financings 
declining prices of the company s sub prime loans would adversely affect the levels of gains achieved in the event drive elects to sell those loans 
the company has not entered into any instruments to minimize this market risk of adverse changes in interest rates or declining prices 
the following table is a summary of the interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities  as of december   segregated by asset type as described in the previous paragraphs  with expected maturity or sales dates as indicated dollars in thousands weighted greater average than rate months months months months months total interest bearing assets portfolio assets n a      loans receivable      equity investments acquisition partnerships n a       drive n a   interest bearing liabilities notes payable secured by portfolio assets  loans receivable and equity in acquisition partnerships       unsecured notes consumer lending   company credit facility       portfolio assets are shown based on estimated proceeds from disposition  which could occur much faster or slower than anticipated or as directed 
loans receivable are shown in the table based upon the expected date of sale or repayment 
equity investments are shown based on anticipated equity disbursements  which could occur much faster or slower than anticipated 
notes payable mature in the periods indicated 
this does not necessarily indicate when the outstanding balances would be paid 
notes payable secured by portfolio assets fund up to of the corresponding asset class 
if the asset balance declines whether through a sale or a payment from the borrower  the corresponding liability must be paid 
the company currently has investments in mexico and france 
in france  the company s investments are in the form of equity and represent a significant portion of the company s total equity investments 
as of december   one us dollar equaled 
euros 
a sharp change of the euro relative to the us dollar could materially adversely affect the financial position and results of operations of the company 
the company has not entered into any instruments to minimize this market risk of adverse changes in currency rates 
a and incremental depreciation of the euro would result in an estimated decline in the valuation of the company s equity investments in france of approximately 
million and million  respectively 
these amounts are estimates of the financial impact of a depreciation of the euro relative to the us dollar 
consequently  these amounts are not necessarily indicative of the actual effect of such changes with respect to the company s consolidated financial position or results of operations 
in mexico  approximately of the company s investments in mexico are made through us dollar denominated loans to the partnerships located in mexico 
the remaining investment is in the form of equity in these same partnerships 
the loans receivable are required to be repaid in us dollars 
although the us dollar balance of these loans will not change due to a change in the mexican peso  the future estimated cash flows of the underlying assets in mexico could become less valuable as a result of a change in the exchange rate for the mexican peso  and thus could affect the overall total returns to the company on these investments 
as of december   one us dollar equaled mexican pesos 
a and incremental depreciation of the peso would result in an estimated decline in the valuation of the company s total investments in mexico of approximately 
million and million  respectively 
these amounts are estimates of the financial impact of a depreciation of the mexican peso relative to the us dollar 
consequently  these amounts are not necessarily indicative of the actual effect of such changes with respect to the company s consolidated financial position or results of operations
