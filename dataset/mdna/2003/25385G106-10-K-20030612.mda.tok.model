the transaction was accounted for using the purchase method of accounting 
the purchase price was approximately million 
in connection with the acquisition  we recorded goodwill and intangible assets of approximately million  which we are amortizing over a period of three years 
during the quarter 
table of contents ended march   we performed an impairment assessment of the identified intangibles and goodwill recorded in connection with the acquisition of mineshare 
as a result of our review  we recorded an impairment charge of million relating to goodwill 
in accordance with sfas no 
 goodwill will be and has been reviewed annually for impairment

revenue generated by our professional service group is typically recognized as the service is provided 
as of march  the company had full time employees 
critical accounting policies and estimates digital impact s consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period 
on an on going basis  management evaluates its estimates  including those related to the allowance for doubtful accounts  intangible assets  restructuring costs and contingencies and litigation 
management bases its estimates on historical experience and various factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
management believes that the following critical accounting policies  among others  affect its more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements revenue recognition  restructuring charges  accounting for internal use software  estimating valuation allowances  specifically the allowance for doubtful accounts  valuation of long lived assets and goodwill  and accounting for stock based compensation 
revenue recognition 
we generate revenue from the sale of solutions that enable businesses to proactively communicate with their customers online 
digital impact applies the provisions of staff accounting bulletin revenue recognition and recognizes revenue when persuasive evidence of an agreement exists  the service has been delivered  the fee is fixed or determinable and collection of the resulting receivables is reasonably assured 
customer marketing revenues are recognized on delivery of the campaigns 
revenues attributable to one time set up fees for service initiation are deferred and recognized ratably over the term of the client s service agreement  typically twelve months 
customer acquisition revenues are derived primarily from programs that assist clients in growing their email lists through the use of third party list rentals 
customer acquisition programs fall into two general categories list rental programs and prospectnet programs 
list rental programs involve the execution and delivery of email campaigns to a defined number of individuals provided by a third party list rental or email address matching service 
prospectnet programs involve the strategic placement of a digital 
table of contents impact client offer on a third party site for the purpose of generating new opt in email addresses for the client 
digital impact contracts with third party providers to deliver secure names of individuals who opt in to join the client s email list 
digital impact is obligated to make payments to third parties for the cost of services associated with the execution of list rental and prospectnet programs 
digital impact accounts for revenues and costs associated with customer acquisition programs in accordance with emerging issues task force issue no 
eitf  reporting revenue gross as a principal versus net as an agent 
the cost of customer acquisition campaigns are estimated using company records of outstanding purchase commitments when final vendor invoices have not been received 
the cost of customer acquisition campaigns are recognized in the period that the programs are executed and are netted against program revenue 
digital impact recognizes revenue net of third party costs because the majority of client and supplier contracts have the following characteristics the supplier  not the company  is the primary obligor in the arrangement  the company has limited latitude in establishing the price charged to the client  the company s credit risk is sometimes mitigated by receiving prepayment or reduced credit terms from its clients before ordering from the supplier  the company does not maintain any inventory related to customer acquisition programs  the company does not make changes to any data acquired from the supplier  and the client approves the supplier selection and the service specifications 
digital impact provides other complementary services to clients  such as strategy  solutions engineering  web page development  creative design and data analytics 
these services are typically billed on an hourly rate 
the revenue for engagements that support the delivery of future products and services  such as custom solutions  is deferred at the time of delivery and recognized pro rata over the future periods of usage 
the period over which the revenue is recognized varies  generally between one and twelve months  depending on the term of the contract or the estimated period of usage 
management uses its best estimates to determine the appropriate period for revenue deferral 
we assess probability of collection based on a number of factors  including our past transaction history with the customer and the credit worthiness of the customer 
new customers and certain existing customers are subject to a credit review process that evaluates the customers financial position and ultimately their ability to pay according to the original terms of the arrangement 
based on our review process  if it is determined from the outset or during the term of an arrangement that collection of the resulting receivable is not reasonably assured  then revenue is recognized on a cash collected basis 
restructuring charges 
digital impact s restructuring reserve is related to our facilities in cupertino 
in calculating the restructuring charge we consulted with a third party real estate firm to determine reasonable estimates of future sublease income for our idle space  and to determine the time necessary to identify sublessees 
the analysis was performed based on the current real estate market in the silicon valley area 
digital impact s restructuring charge related to future lease commitments is based on a review of this information 
should market conditions change this information may be updated 
accounting for internal use software 
we account for internal use software in accordance with aicpa statement of position  accounting for the costs of computer software developed or obtained for internal use 
internal use software costs  including any fees paid to third parties to implement the software  are capitalized beginning when we have determined various factors are present  including among others  that the technology exists to achieve the performance requirements  we have made a decision as to whether we will purchase the software or develop it internally and we have authorized funding for the project 
capitalization of software costs ceases when the software implementation is substantially complete and is ready for its intended use  and the capitalized costs are amortized over the software s estimated useful life generally one to two years using the straight line method 
the estimated useful life is based on technical and marketing management judgment as to the product or feature life cycle 
as of march   we had  of capitalized internal use software costs  all of which has been subject to amortization based upon deployment dates of the related projects 
when events or circumstances indicate the carrying value of internal use software might not be recoverable  we assess the recoverability of these assets by determining whether the amortization of the asset balance over its remaining life can be recovered through undiscounted future operating cash flows 
the 
table of contents amount of impairment  if any  is recognized to the extent that the carrying value exceeds the projected discounted future operating cash flows and is recognized as a write down of the asset 
in addition  if it is no longer probable that computer software being developed will be placed in service  the asset will be adjusted to the lower of its carrying value or fair value  if any  less direct selling costs 
any such adjustment would result in an expense in the period recorded  which could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated statement of operations 
based on our assessment as of march   we determined that no such impairment of internal use software existed 
allowance for doubtful accounts 
the preparation of financial statements requires our management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amount of assets and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reported period 
specifically  management must make estimates of the uncollectable portion of our accounts receivable 
management specifically analyzes accounts receivable and analyzes historical bad debt experience  customer account disputes  customer credit worthiness  current economic trends and changes in our customer payment terms when evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts 
our accounts receivable balance was million  net of allowance for doubtful accounts of  as of march  valuation of long lived assets and goodwill 
we assess the impairment of identified intangibles  long lived assets and goodwill annually and whenever events or a change in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable 
factors we consider important which could trigger an impairment review include the following significant underperformance relative to expected historical or projected future operating results  significant changes in the manner of our use of the acquired assets or the strategy for our overall business  significant negative industry or economic trends  significant decline in our stock price for a sustained period of time  and our market capitalization relative to net book value 
when we determine that the carrying value of intangible assets  long lived assets or goodwill may not be recoverable based upon the existence of one or more of the above indicators of impairment  we measure any potential impairment based on a projected discounted cash flow method using a discount rate determined by our management to be commensurate with the risk inherent in our current business model 
net intangible assets  long lived assets  and goodwill amounted to million as of march  accounting for stock based compensation the company accounts for stock based awards to employees and directors using the intrinsic value method of accounting in accordance with accounting principles board opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees apb no 

under the intrinsic value method  because the exercise price of the company s employee stock options equals the market price of the underlying stock on the date of grant  no compensation expense is recognized in the company s consolidated statement of operations 
we believe this method is appropriate for the company because it avoids the volatility of other expense methods which determine stock compensation expense typically by using the black scholes option pricing model which was developed for use in estimating the value of traded options that have no vesting restrictions and are fully transferable 
in addition  option pricing models require input of highly subjective assumptions including the expected stock price volatility 
we have currently elected to apply the disclosure only provisions of sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation 
in accordance with the provisions of sfas no 
 the company applies accounting principles board opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees apb no 
 and related interpretations in accounting for its stock option plans

total revenues increased by to million for the fiscal year ended march  from million for the fiscal year ended march  the increase was primarily the result of growth in the client base and email volume 
the increase in the average number of clients from fiscal to fiscal is primarily the result of retaining most existing clients and the addition of new mid cap and fortune clients

the rise in gross margin was driven by personnel efficiencies and lower data center rent  offset by higher depreciation expense resulting from investments in our data center infrastructure 
gross margins for professional services were and for the twelve months ended march  and  respectively 
the increase in gross margins is the result of higher utilization rates for our professional service personnel  as revenue grew and costs increased 
operating expenses our operating expenses are classified into three general categories research and development  sales and marketing  and general and administrative 
we classify all charges to these operating expense categories based on the nature of the expenditures 
although each category includes expenses that are unique to each operating category  some expenditures  such as compensation  employee benefits  recruiting costs  equipment costs  travel and entertainment costs  facilities costs and third party professional service fees  occur in each of these categories 
we allocate the total cost for information services and facilities to each functional area that uses the information services and facilities based on each area s relative headcount 
these allocated charges include rent and other facility related costs  communication charges and depreciation expense for furniture and equipment 
total operating expenses also include non cash expenses related to stock based compensation  amortization of purchased intangibles  goodwill impairment charges  write off of acquired in process research and development and restructuring charges and write off of fixed assets 
research and development 
research and development expenses consist primarily of personnel and related costs  consultants and outside contractor costs  and software and hardware maintenance costs for our development efforts 
research and development expense decreased by to million for the year ended march  from million for year ended march  the decrease was mainly attributable to reductions in personnel costs of million  resulting from a person reduction in headcount related to restructuring activities and completion of our impact product  and a  reduction in outside consulting expense related to efforts to control costs and meet development needs with internal personnel  offset by a  increase in depreciation and the amortization of software maintenance contracts 
we 
table of contents capitalized  and  for internally developed software for the fiscal years ended march  and march   respectively 
we expect research and development expense to decrease in absolute dollars and as a percentage of revenue for the next fiscal year 
research and development expense is substantially dependent on the level of development activity and related staffing 
sales and marketing 
sales and marketing expenses consist of personnel and related costs for our direct sales force and marketing staff  and marketing programs  which include trade shows  advertisements  promotional activities and media events 
sales and marketing expense decreased by to million for the fiscal year ended march  from million for the year ended march  the decrease was mainly attributable to a million reduction in personnel costs associated with restructuring activities  a  reduction in marketing expenses  and a  reduction in recruiting expenses 
we expect sales and marketing expense to decrease in absolute dollars and as a percentage of revenue for the next fiscal year largely as a result of cost reductions in fiscal sales and marketing expense can vary as a result of our expectations of future sales growth 
if sales growth were to exceed expectations  sales and marketing expense may increase in line with revenue growth 
general and administrative 
general and administrative expenses consist primarily of personnel and related costs for general corporate purposes  including information services  finance  accounting  human resources  facilities and legal 
general and administrative expenses decreased by to million for the year ended march  from million for the year ended march  the decrease was primarily due to decreased personnel costs of  related to an decline in headcount  a  decrease in bad debt expense  a  reduction in outside consulting expense and a  decline in travel and entertainment expense

stock based compensation 
in connection with the granting of stock options and restricted stock to our employees and the assumption of options related to the acquisition of mineshare  we recorded unearned stock based compensation totaling approximately million  net of forfeitures  from fiscal through march  this amount represents the total difference between the exercise prices of the stock options or the purchase price of the restricted stock and the deemed fair market value of the underlying common stock for accounting purposes on the date granted 
this amount is included as a component of stockholders equity and is being amortized on an accelerated basis by charges to operations over the vesting period of the options or restricted stock  consistent with the methods described in fasb interpretation no 
stock based compensation  a non cash expense  decreased to  for the year ended march  from million for the year ended march  the decline was primarily due to our use of the accelerated method of amortization for our employee stock based compensation arrangements plus the reversal of balances of unamortized stock based compensation as a result of employee terminations 
as of march   approximately  of total unearned deferred stock based compensation remains to be amortized in fiscal amortization of goodwill

income taxes 
no provision for federal and state income taxes was recorded as we incurred net operating losses from inception through march  due to the uncertainty regarding the ultimate utilization of the net operating loss carryforwards  we have not recorded any benefit for losses and a valuation allowance has been recorded for the entire amount of the net deferred tax asset 
the tax reform act of limits the use of net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards in certain situations where changes occur in the stock ownership of a company 
if we should have an ownership change  as defined for tax purposes  utilization of the carryforwards could be restricted 
in addition  sales of our stock  including shares sold in the initial public offering  may further restrict our ability to utilize our net operating loss carryforwards 
comparison of the years ended march  and revenues total revenues decreased by to million for the fiscal year ended march  from million for the fiscal year ended march   primarily as a result of the factors listed below 
the number of clients declined slightly from march  to march  this decline in clients was primarily the result of a loss of dot com customers as their businesses failed and they ceased operations

recent accounting pronouncements in july  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities  which nullifies emerging issues task force eitf issue no 
liability recognition for certain employee termination benefits and other costs to exit an activity including certain costs incurred in a restructuring 
sfas no 
requires that a liability for a cost associated with an exit or disposal activity be recognized when the liability is incurred and states that an entity s commitment to exit plan  by itself  does not create a present obligation that meets the definition of a liability 
sfas no 
also establishes that fair value is the objective for initial measurement of the liability 
the adoption of sfas no

risk factors as indicated in this annual report on form k under the caption forward looking information  certain of the information contained in this annual report consists of forward looking statements 
important 
table of contents factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from the forward looking statements include the following because of our limited operating history and the emerging nature of the online direct marketing industry  any predictions about our future revenues and expenses may not be as accurate as they would be if we had a longer business history  and we cannot determine trends that may affect our business 
we were incorporated in october in california and reincorporated in delaware in october our limited operating history makes financial forecasting and evaluation of our business difficult 
since we have limited financial data  any predictions about our future revenues and expenses may not be as accurate as they would be if we had a longer business history 
because of the emerging nature of the online direct marketing industry  we cannot determine trends that may emerge in our market or affect our business 
the revenue and income potential of the online direct marketing industry  and our business  are unproven 
our operating results have varied significantly in the past and are likely to vary significantly from period to period  and our stock price may decline if we fail to meet the expectations of analysts and investors 
our operating results have varied significantly in the past and are likely to vary significantly from period to period 
as a result  our operating results are difficult to predict and may not meet the expectations of securities analysts or investors 
if this occurs  the price of our common stock would likely decline 
we derive our revenue from marketing services  which revenues tend to be cyclical and dependent on the economic prospects of our clients and the economy in general 
a sustained reduction in expenditures by our clients or a sustained downturn in the economy could cause our revenues to decline significantly in any given period 
our clients marketing and advertising expenditures tend to be cyclical  reflecting overall economic conditions as well as budgeting and buying patterns 
the overall market for marketing and advertising services  including internet marketing and advertising services  has been characterized in recent quarters by softness of demand and lower prices 
we cannot assure you that if economic conditions improve  marketing budgets and advertising spending will increase from current levels 
a continued decline in the economic prospects of our clients or the economy in general could alter spending priorities or increase the time it takes to close a sale with a prospective client 
as a result  our revenues from marketing services may decline significantly in any given period 
we may not be able to forecast our revenues accurately because our customers marketing budgets are difficult to predict and may fluctuate from period to period 
our revenue and operating results depend upon the marketing budgets of our existing and new clients 
these marketing budgets are difficult to predict and may vary from period to period as a result of factors that are beyond our control  including our clients marketing objectives for a particular period  the general state of the economy and our clients success in the marketplace 
consequently  we face difficulty in predicting the amount of revenues each client will generate in any particular quarter 
as a result  our operating results are difficult to predict and may not meet the expectations of securities analysts or investors 
if this occurs  the price of our common stock would likely decline 
seasonal trends may cause our quarterly operating results to fluctuate  which may adversely affect the market price of our common stock 
the traditional direct marketing industry has typically generated lower revenues during the summer months and higher revenues during the calendar year end months 
we believe our business is affected by similar revenue fluctuations  but our limited operating history is insufficient to isolate and predict the magnitude of these effects 
because we do experience these effects  analysts and investors may not be able to predict our quarterly or annual operating results 
if we fail to meet expectations of analysts and investors  our stock price could decline 

table of contents if businesses and consumers fail to accept online direct marketing as a means to attract new customers  demand for our services may not develop and the price of our stock could decline 
the market for online direct marketing services is relatively new and rapidly evolving  and our business may be harmed if sufficient demand for our services does not develop 
our current and planned services are very different from the traditional methods that many of our clients have historically used to attract new customers and maintain customer relationships 
the loss of a major client could result in lower than expected revenues 
the loss of a major client could harm our business 
while only one client accounted for more than of our revenues for the twelve months ended march   the loss of this client or another major client could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations 
the online direct marketing industry is highly competitive  and if we are unable to compete effectively  the demand for  or the prices of  our services may decline 
the market for online direct marketing is highly competitive  rapidly evolving and experiencing rapid technological change 
intense competition may result in price reductions  reduced sales  gross margins and operating margins  and loss of market share 
our principal competitors include providers of online direct marketing solutions such as doubleclick  responsys  cheetahmail  bigfoot interactive  edialog and infousa  as well as the in house information technology departments of our existing and prospective clients 
the loss of a client due to service quality or technology problems could result in reputational harm to us and  as a result  increase the effect of competition and negatively impact our ability to attract new clients 
in addition  we expect competition to persist and intensify in the future  which could harm our ability to increase sales and maintain our prices 
in the future  we may experience competition from internet service providers  advertising and direct marketing agencies and other large established businesses possessing large  existing customer bases  substantial financial resources and established distribution channels and could develop  market or resell a number of online direct marketing solutions 
these potential competitors may also choose to enter  or have already entered  the market for online direct marketing by acquiring one of our existing competitors or by forming strategic alliances with a competitor 
many of these potential competitors have broad distribution channels and they may bundle competing products or services 
as a result of future competition  the demand for our services could substantially decline 
any of these occurrences could harm our ability to compete effectively 
if we fail to respond to changing customer preferences in our market  demand for our technology and services may decline  causing our revenues to suffer 
if we do not continue to develop new technology and services that keep pace with competitive developments  satisfy diverse and rapidly evolving customer requirements and achieve market acceptance  we might be unable to attract new customers and retain existing customers 
the development of proprietary technology and service enhancements entails significant technical and business risks and requires substantial expenditures and lead time 
we might not be successful in marketing and supporting recently released versions of our technology and services on a timely or cost effective basis 
in addition  even if new technology and services are developed and released  they might not achieve market acceptance 
we have experienced delays in releasing new or enhanced technology and services in the past and could experience similar delays in the future  which could cause us to lose customers 
if we do not attract and retain additional highly skilled personnel  we may be unable to execute our business strategy 
our business depends on the continued technological innovation of our core products and services and our ability to provide comprehensive online direct marketing expertise 
our main offices are located in the san francisco bay area and new york city  where competition for personnel with internet related technology and marketing skills has traditionally been intense 
in addition  we restructure our organization from time to time  including reductions in our workforce  to streamline operations and reduce costs 
these measures may 
table of contents have unanticipated consequences  such as low morale  unexpected litigation and difficulty in future employee hiring and retention 
if we fail to identify  attract  retain and motivate these highly skilled personnel  we may be unable to successfully introduce new services or otherwise implement our business strategy 
as a public company we face greater difficulty attracting and retaining personnel than we did as a private company 
if the delivery of our email messages is limited or blocked  then the amount we may be able to charge our clients for producing and sending their campaigns may be reduced and our clients may discontinue their use of our services 
our business model relies on our ability to deliver emails over the internet through internet service providers and to recipients in major corporations 
in particular  a significant percentage of our emails are sent to recipients who use aol 
we do not have  nor are we required to have  an agreement with aol to deliver emails to their customers 
aol uses a proprietary set of technologies to handle and deliver email and the value of our services will be reduced if we are unable to provide emails compatible with these technologies 
in addition  aol and other internet service providers are able to block messages from reaching their users 
recent releases of internet service provider software and the implementation of stringent new policies by internet service providers have caused periodic temporary blockages of our ability to successfully deliver emails to their customers 
we continually improve our own technology and work with internet service providers to improve our ability to successfully deliver our emails 
however  if internet service providers materially limit or halt the delivery of our emails  or if we fail to deliver emails in such a way as to be compatible with these companies email handling technologies  then the amount we may be able to charge our clients for producing and sending their online direct marketing campaigns may be reduced and our clients may discontinue their use of our services 
our facilities and systems are vulnerable to natural disasters and other unexpected events  and any of these events could result in an interruption of our ability to execute our clients online direct marketing campaigns 
we depend on the efficient and uninterrupted operations of our data center and hardware systems 
our data center and hardware systems are located in northern california  an area susceptible to earthquakes 
our data center and hardware systems are also vulnerable to damage from fire  floods  power loss  telecommunications failures  and similar events 
if any of these events results in damage to our data center or systems  we may be unable to execute our clients online direct marketing campaigns until the damage is repaired  and may accordingly lose clients and revenues 
in addition  subject to applicable insurance coverage  we may incur substantial costs in repairing any damage 
our data center is located at facilities provided by a third party  and if this party is unable to adequately protect our data center  our reputation may be harmed and we may lose clients 
our data center  which is critical to our ongoing operations  is located at facilities provided by a third party 
our operations depend on this party s ability to protect our data center from damage or interruption from human error  break ins  sabotage  computer viruses  intentional acts of vandalism and similar events 
if this party is unable to adequately protect our data center and information is lost or our ability to deliver our services is interrupted  our reputation may be harmed and we may lose clients 
if we are unable to protect our intellectual property or if third parties develop superior intellectual property  third parties could use our intellectual property without our consent and prevent us from using their technology 
our ability to successfully compete is substantially dependent upon our internally developed technology and intellectual property  which we protect through a combination of patent  copyright  trade secret and trademark law  as well as contractual obligations 
we have one issued us patent and have two us patent applications pending 
we have several registered us trademarks and have several more applications pending in the us  europe and japan 
we may not be able to protect our proprietary rights 
unauthorized parties may attempt to obtain and use our proprietary information 
policing unauthorized use of our proprietary 
table of contents information is difficult  and we cannot be certain that the steps we have taken will prevent misappropriation  particularly in foreign countries where the laws may not protect our proprietary rights as fully as in the united states 
we are one of several companies rapidly building new technologies in our industry 
it is possible that a third party could be awarded a patent that applies to some portion of our technology 
if this occurs  we may be required to incur substantial legal fees  cease using the technology or pay significant licensing fees for such use 
if we are unable to safeguard the confidential information in our data warehouse  our reputation may be harmed and we may be exposed to liability 
we currently store confidential customer information in a secure data warehouse 
we cannot be certain  however  that we will be able to prevent unauthorized individuals from gaining access to this data warehouse 
if any compromise or breach of security were to occur  it could harm our reputation and expose us to possible liability 
any unauthorized access to our servers could result in the misappropriation of confidential customer information or cause interruptions in our services 
it is also possible that one of our employees could attempt to misuse confidential customer information  exposing us to liability 
in addition  our reputation may be harmed if we lose customer information maintained in our data warehouse due to systems interruptions or other reasons 
activities of our clients could damage our reputation or give rise to legal claims against us 
our clients promotion of their products and services may not comply with federal  state and local laws 
we cannot predict whether our role in facilitating these marketing activities would expose us to liability under these laws 
any claims made against us could be costly and time consuming to defend 
if we are exposed to this kind of liability  we could be required to pay fines or penalties  redesign our business methods  discontinue some of our services or otherwise expend resources to avoid liability 
our services involve the transmission of information through the internet 
our services could be used to transmit harmful applications  negative messages  unauthorized reproduction of copyrighted material  inaccurate data or computer viruses to end users in the course of delivery 
any transmission of this kind could damage our reputation or could give rise to legal claims against us 
we could spend a significant amount of time and money defending against these legal claims 
new regulation of  and uncertainties regarding the application of existing laws and regulations to  online direct marketing and the internet could prohibit  limit or increase the cost of our business 
legislation has been enacted in several states regulating the sending of unsolicited commercial email 
we cannot assure you that existing or future legislation regarding commercial email will not harm our business 
the federal government  foreign governments and several state governments are considering  or have considered  similar legislation 
these provisions generally limit or prohibit both the transmission of unsolicited commercial emails and the use of forged or fraudulent routing and header information 
some states  including california  require that unsolicited commercial emails include opt out instructions and that senders of these emails honor any opt out requests 
our business could be negatively impacted by new laws or regulations applicable to online direct marketing or the internet  the application of existing laws and regulations to online direct marketing or the internet or the application of new laws and regulations to our business as we expand into new jurisdictions 
there is a growing body of laws and regulations applicable to access to  or commerce on  the internet 
moreover  the applicability to the internet of existing laws is uncertain and may take years to resolve 
due to the increasing popularity and use of the internet  it is likely that additional laws and regulations will be adopted covering issues such as privacy  pricing  content  copyrights  distribution  taxation  antitrust  characteristics and quality of services and consumer protection 
the adoption of any additional laws or regulations may impair the growth of the internet or online direct marketing  which could  in turn  decrease the demand for our services and prohibit  limit or increase the cost of our doing business 

table of contents internet related stock prices are especially volatile and this volatility may depress our stock price 
the stock market and specifically the stock prices of internet related companies have been very volatile 
because we are an internet related company  we expect our stock price to be similarly volatile 
as a result of this volatility  the market price of our common stock could significantly decrease 
this volatility is often not related to our operating performance and may accordingly reduce the price of our common stock without regard to our operating performance 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk for the period from our inception through march   we provided our services to clients primarily in the united states 
as a result  our financial results have not been materially affected by factors such as changes in foreign currency exchange rates or weak economic conditions in foreign markets 
the majority of our sales are currently denominated in us dollars 
during the fiscal year ended march   we established a subsidiary in the united kingdom  which has had minimal operations to date 
as the operations of this subsidiary expand  our future operating results could be directly impacted by changes in foreign currency exchange rates or economic conditions in this region 
our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to the increase or decrease in the amount of interest income we can earn on our investment portfolio and on the increase or decrease in the amount of interest expense we must pay on our outstanding debt instruments 
the risk associated with fluctuating interest expense is limited to the exposure related to those debt instruments and credit facilities  which are tied to market rates 
we do not plan to use derivative financial instruments in our investment portfolio 
we plan to ensure the safety and preservation of our invested principal funds by limiting default risk  market risk and reinvestment risk 
we plan to mitigate default risk by investing in high credit quality securities
