critical accounting estimates and judgments the consolidated financial statements include amounts based on informed estimates and judgments of management for those transactions that are not yet complete or for which the ultimate effects are uncertain 
such estimates and judgments affect the reported amounts in the financial statements 
those estimates and judgments that were most critical to the preparation of the financial statements involved the adequacy of loss reserves and the recoverability of related reinsurance recoverables  the fair value of credit derivative obligations  the recoverability of the carrying value of real estate properties and the realization of deferred income tax benefits 
these estimates and judgments are discussed within the following analysis of our results of operations 
if different estimates and judgments had been applied  materially different amounts might have been reported in the financial statements 
earnings summary net income determined in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles gaap was million in compared with million in and million in operating income  which excludes after tax realized investment gains and losses  was million in compared with million in and million in management uses operating income  a non gaap financial measure  to evaluate its performance because the realization of investment gains and losses in any given period is largely discretionary as to timing and could distort the analysis of trends 
operating income should only be analyzed in conjunction with  and not in lieu of  net income 
results in were adversely affected by two large loss events 
in the third quarter  we incurred net costs of million  or million after tax  related to the september attack in the united states 
then  in the fourth quarter  we recognized net surety bond losses of million  or million after tax  arising from the bankruptcy of enron corp 
results in were adversely affected by aggregate net losses of million  or million after tax  recognized in the third and fourth quarters related to asbestos and toxic waste claims 
results in were also adversely affected by a tax valuation allowance of million from not being able to recognize for accounting purposes certain us tax benefits related to european losses 
conversely  results in benefited from a reduction of net surety bond losses of million  or million after tax  resulting from the settlement of litigation related to enron 
a summary of our results is as follows years ended december in millions property and casualty insurance underwriting net premiums written increase in unearned premiums premiums earned claims and claim expenses operating costs and expenses increase in deferred policy acquisition costs dividends to policyholders underwriting loss investments investment income before expenses investment expenses investment income other charges property and casualty income loss chubb financial solutions non insurance business corporate and other consolidated operating income loss before income tax federal and foreign income tax credit consolidated operating income realized investment gains after income tax consolidated net income property and casualty investment income after income tax property and casualty insurance overview our property and casualty business produced income before taxes of million in compared with a loss of million in and income of million in results in and were impacted by a number of significant items 
results in were adversely affected by the net costs of million related to the september attack and the net surety losses of million related to enron 
results in were adversely affected by the recognition of aggregate net losses of million in the third and fourth quarters related to asbestos and toxic waste claims the million asbestos charge 
results in benefited from the million reduction in net surety losses resulting from the settlement of litigation related to enron 
the pre tax costs of million related to the september attack had three components 
first  in our insurance business  we incurred estimated net claims and claim expenses of million plus reinsurance reinstatement costs of million  for an aggregate cost of million 
each of our underwriting segments was affected by the september attack 
however  the impact was by far the greatest on our financial institutions business 
second  in our reinsurance business written through chubb re  which is included in other specialty results  we incurred estimated net claims and claim expenses of million and recognized reinstatement premium revenue of million  for a net cost of million 
finally  we recorded a million charge  included in other charges  as our share of the losses publicly estimated by hiscox plc  a uk insurer in which we have a minority interest 
we estimate that our gross claims and claim expenses from the september attack were about billion 
most of the claims were from property exposure and business interruption losses 
we also had significant workers compensation losses 
our net claims and claim expenses of million were significantly lower than the gross amount due to various reinsurance agreements 
our property exposures were protected by facultative reinsurance  property per risk treaties that limited our net loss per risk  and our property catastrophe treaties 
our workers compensation losses were protected by a casualty catastrophe treaty and a casualty clash treaty that operates like a catastrophe treaty 
our property per risk reinsurance coverage is in several layers  with separate treaties covering each layer 
about reinsurers and individual lloyds syndicates participate in these treaties 
many of these reinsurers participate in each of the layers 
in  these treaties provided limits of up to million for each individual risk in excess of the initial million that we retained 
we have approximately individual property claims in excess of million from the september attack 
the property per risk reinsurance agreements apply to each of these claims 
business interruption claims from the september attack will take some time to resolve  while potential liability claims could take years to resolve 
also  certain of our reinsurers are questioning our interpretation and or application of some provisions of our property per risk reinsurance agreements 
the questions that have been raised generally involve the applicable limit of reinsurance coverage available to us  the definition of what constitutes one risk  our accumulation of exposure in the various buildings destroyed or damaged and our adherence to our underwriting guidelines 
we have responded to these questions and are continuing discussions with the reinsurers 
most of the reinsurers are paying  although some are reserving their rights as they continue to discuss their open issues with us 
one reinsurer is withholding payments pending the resolution of the questions raised 
based on current information  we estimate that the aggregate amount of reinsurance recoverable under the property per risk reinsurance agreements related to claims arising from the september attack is approximately billion 
as of december   approximately million had been billed under these agreements 
we had collected million of this amount at that date 
of the remaining million billed  million was outstanding for more than days and  as of february   million of that amount has been collected 
the amounts billed relate to those individual losses on which we have already made payments to an insured in excess of our million retention 
the balance of the billion reinsurance recoverable under the property per risk reinsurance treaties relates to similar claims on which we have not yet made such payments 
we are optimistic that many of the outstanding concerns can be resolved through the ongoing discussions with our reinsurers 
nonetheless  we continue to monitor this situation closely and to consider all alternatives available to us under the property per risk reinsurance agreements  including the commencement of arbitration proceedings to enforce our rights 
we believe that our position is strong and that either our responses to the reinsurers questions will ultimately satisfy them or we will prevail in arbitration should that become necessary 
our loss reserve estimates related to the september attack are subject to considerable uncertainty 
however  we continue to believe that  whether we resolve the open issues with our reinsurers through discussions or through arbitration proceedings  our estimate of our net costs related to the september attack is reasonable 
it is possible that our estimate of ultimate gross losses related to the september attack  as well as the collectibility of related reinsurance recoverables  may change in the future  and that the change in estimate could have a material effect on the corporation s results of operations 
however  we do not expect that any such change would have a material effect on the corporation s financial condition or liquidity 
the surety losses arising from the enron bankruptcy relate to bonds issued to various obligees in connection with enron commitments 
although certain of these surety bonds were the subject of litigation  we recognized our maximum exposure of million  net of reinsurance  in the fourth quarter of as of the end of  the litigation was settled  resulting in an million reduction in our surety loss reserves 
in october  our actuaries and outside actuarial consultants completed their periodic ground up exposure based analysis of our asbestos related liabilities 
upon completion of the analysis and assessment of the results  we increased our net loss reserves by million in the third quarter 
in the fourth quarter  we reduced our previous estimate of reinsurance recoverable on potential asbestos claims  resulting in an additional increase in our net loss reserves of million 
our asbestos related exposure is further discussed under loss reserves 
the net costs related to the september attack  the enron surety losses and related settlement  and the asbestos charge are significant components in understanding and assessing our financial performance 
however  these items had a distorting effect on our results 
the following summary adjusts our reported property and casualty income or loss before taxes to exclude the impact of these items 
in millions property and casualty income loss before tax  as reported net costs related to the september attack net surety bonds losses related to enron increase in asbestos and toxic waste loss reserves reduction in surety bond losses resulting from settlement of litigation related to enron property and casualty income before tax  as adjusted as adjusted  property and casualty earnings in were higher than in the prior year due primarily to a substantial improvement in underwriting results 
earnings in were similar to those in underwriting results net premiums written amounted to billion in  an increase of over net premiums written increased in compared with premiums written in included net reinsurance reinstatement premium revenue of million related to the september attack 
us premiums grew in and in substantial premium growth was achieved outside the united states in and reported non us premiums grew in and in in local currencies  such premiums grew and in and  respectively 
net premiums written by class of business were as follows years ended december in millions personal insurance automobile homeowners other total personal commercial insurance multiple peril casualty workers compensation property and marine total commercial specialty insurance executive protection financial institutions other total specialty total in  premium growth in personal lines was strong 
in our commercial classes  which include multiple peril  casualty  workers compensation and property and marine  the marketplace improved with many of our competitors increasing rates 
as a result  our commercial lines premiums began to increase as we retained more of our accounts at renewal and wrote more new business 
premium growth in specialty lines was restricted in  primarily due to the lack of growth in our executive protection business caused by our writing fewer multi year policies as well as our initiative to increase pricing and to not renew underperforming accounts 
premium growth in was strong in all segments of our business due primarily to higher rates 
premium growth was exceptionally strong in the commercial classes 
in the wake of heavy insurance industry losses in recent years  exacerbated by the tragic event of september   many insurance companies have sought substantial price increases  raised deductibles  reduced coverage limits or declined outright to renew coverage 
in this environment  we are seeing more opportunities to write new business and we are retaining more of our accounts 
we are getting substantial rate increases on business we write  often with more favorable policy terms and conditions 
we expect that this trend will continue throughout premium growth in in our other specialty insurance business was primarily from chubb re  our reinsurance business that began operations in as a result of the substantial losses incurred by reinsurers in recent years  the cost of reinsurance in the marketplace has increased significantly and reinsurance capacity for certain coverages  such as terrorism  is limited and expensive 
our casualty per risk and casualty clash treaties in the aggregate cost approximately million more in than in the previous year 
we did not renew a workers compensation catastrophe treaty in that had substantially reduced our net losses from the september attack because the terms and price that were offered were unreasonable 
our property reinsurance program was renewed in april the property per risk treaty and property catastrophe treaties in the aggregate cost approximately million more on an annualized basis  with more restrictive terms  including terrorism exclusions 
our property per risk retention increased from million to million 
our catastrophe treaty for events in the united states was modified to increase our initial retention  to increase the reinsurance coverage at the top and to reduce our participation in certain layers of the program 
the program now provides coverage for individual catastrophic events of approximately of losses between million and million 
the potential increase in our net risk concentrations from a catastrophic event that would result from these changes to our reinsurance arrangements may be offset to some degree by changes to our gross risk profile 
in particular  we are making a concerted effort to reduce risk aggregations 
despite this effort  our future operating results could be more volatile due to the changes made to our reinsurance program 
it is expected that the cost of reinsurance will continue to increase in the changes in our reinsurance program in will be more subtle than in we expect to discontinue some lower limit treaties that we believe are no longer economical and to increase our participation in certain layers of the treaties that we renew 
the terrorism risk insurance act of the terrorism act was signed into law on november  the terrorism act established a program under which the federal government will share the risk of loss from certain acts of international terrorism with the insurance industry 
the program terminates on december  the terrorism act is applicable to almost all commercial lines of insurance 
insurance companies with direct commercial insurance exposure in the united states are required to participate in the program 
each insurer has a separate deductible in the event of an act of terrorism before federal assistance becomes available 
the deductible is based on a percentage of direct commercial earned premiums from the previous calendar year 
for  that deductible is of direct commercial earned premiums in for losses above the deductible  the federal government will pay for of insured losses  while the insurer contributes 
for certain classes of business  such as workers compensation  terrorism coverage is mandatory 
for those classes of business where it is not mandatory  insureds may choose not to accept the terrorism coverage  which would reduce our exposure 
while the provisions of the terrorism act will serve to mitigate our exposure in the event of a large scale terrorist attack  our deductible is substantial  approximating million in therefore  we continue to monitor concentrations of risk 
we also have exposure outside the united states to risk of loss from acts of terrorism 
in some jurisdictions  we have access to government mechanisms that would mitigate our exposure 
the combined loss and expense ratio  expressed as a percentage  is the key measure of underwriting profitability traditionally used in the property and casualty business 
we use the statutory definition of combined loss and expense ratio 
it is the sum of the ratio of losses to premiums earned loss ratio plus the ratio of underwriting expenses to premiums written expense ratio after reducing both premium amounts by dividends to policyholders 
when the combined ratio is under  underwriting results are generally considered profitable  when the combined ratio is over  underwriting results are generally considered unprofitable 
underwriting results in were adversely affected by the million asbestos charge  but such results benefited from the million reduction in surety losses resulting from the settlement of litigation related to enron 
underwriting results in were adversely affected by net costs of million related to the september attack and the enron related surety losses of million 
the combined loss and expense ratio  as reported and as adjusted to exclude the effects of the asbestos charge  the enron surety losses and related settlement  and the september attack  was as follows years ended december as reported loss ratio expense ratio combined ratio as adjusted loss ratio expense ratio combined ratio the loss ratio  as adjusted  was similar in the past three years 
losses from catastrophes other than the september attack were million in which represented percentage points of the loss ratio compared with million or percentage points in and million or percentage points in other than reinsurance recoveries related to the september attack  we did not have any recoveries from our catastrophe reinsurance program during the three year period since there were no other individual catastrophes for which our losses exceeded the initial retention 
our initial retention level for each catastrophic event in the united states was increased from million to million during our initial retention is generally million outside the united states 
our expense ratio decreased in due to premiums written growing at a substantially higher rate than overhead expenses 
personal insurance net premiums from personal insurance  which represent of the premiums written by our property and casualty subsidiaries  increased by in compared with a increase in in both years  premium growth occurred in all classes 
however  as planned  growth in our in force policy count slowed in premium growth in was particularly significant in our homeowners business due primarily to higher rates and increased insurance to value 
homeowners premiums were up in  while the in force policy count was up 
our personal insurance business produced modestly profitable underwriting results in compared with slightly unprofitable results in and substantial profits in results in included net costs of million related to the september attack 
the combined loss and expense ratios for the classes of business within the personal insurance segment  as reported and as adjusted to exclude the effects of the september attack  were as follows years ended december as reported automobile homeowners other total personal as adjusted automobile homeowners other total personal homeowners results improved in but remained unprofitable 
results continued to be adversely affected by an increase in the severity of water damage claims  including those related to mold  particularly in texas 
the improvement in was due to a decrease in the frequency of both catastrophe and non catastrophe losses  the latter resulting in large part from the mild winter weather in the eastern half of the united states 
results deteriorated significantly in compared with due primarily to the substantial increase in the frequency and severity of water damage and mold claims as well as rate deficiencies in several states 
losses from catastrophes other than the september attack represented percentage points of the loss ratio for this class in compared with percentage points in and percentage points in homeowners results were unprofitable in europe in each of the past three years 
we are in the process of disengaging from our personal lines operations in continental europe 
our remediation plan relating to our homeowners business  which began in the latter part of  is on track 
we have made substantial progress in implementing rate increases in states where rates have been deficient 
however  we continue to be concerned about the proliferation of water damage claims  including those related to mold 
we have made regulatory filings in most states to introduce contract changes that would enable us to treat mold as a separate peril available at an appropriate price 
these changes have been implemented in states  including texas  and approved in other states 
if necessary  we will reduce our presence in states where we cannot attain rate adequacy due to regulatory constraints or adverse loss trends 
our personal automobile business was profitable in each of the last three years 
profitability increased modestly in profitability decreased in compared with due to an increase in the frequency of losses in the liability component of this business 
results in each year benefited from stable loss severity 
other personal coverages  which include insurance for personal valuable articles and excess liability  produced highly profitable results in each of the past three years  as favorable loss experience has continued 
commercial insurance net premiums from commercial insurance  which represent of our total writings  increased by in compared with a increase in the substantial premium growth in  which occurred in all segments of this business  was due in large part to significantly higher rates and also to an increase in our in force count 
retention levels have improved significantly  beginning in the second half of on the business that was renewed  rates have increased steadily 
new business has accelerated  beginning toward the end of during  we wrote more than two dollars of new business for every dollar of business we lost  during  this ratio was about one to one 
the substantial growth in new business was produced with the same underwriting discipline that existed over the past three years when we were shrinking the book of business 
we expect that rates will continue to rise but that the level of rate increases will begin to decline 
our commercial insurance results were adversely affected in by the million asbestos charge and in by net costs of million related to the september attack 
the combined loss and expense ratios for the classes of business within commercial insurance  as reported and as adjusted to exclude the effects of the asbestos charge and the september attack  were as follows years ended december as reported multiple peril casualty workers compensation property and marine total commercial as adjusted multiple peril casualty workers compensation property and marine total commercial our commercial insurance results  as adjusted  have shown substantial improvement in each succeeding year 
on an as adjusted basis  our commercial insurance business produced an underwriting profit in compared with underwriting losses in and the improvement has been due in large part to the cumulative effect of price increases  better terms and conditions and more stringent risk selection in recent years 
while all segments of this business have improved  the improvement has been most significant in our casualty and property and marine classes 
commercial insurance results  particularly in the casualty classes  were adversely affected in each of the past three years by incurred losses relating to asbestos and toxic waste claims 
in addition to the million asbestos charge in  asbestos and toxic waste losses were million in  million in and million in the as adjusted combined ratios exclude the effect of the million asbestos charge but include the effect of all other asbestos and toxic waste losses 
multiple peril results  as adjusted  showed modest improvement in due to highly profitable overseas results 
the improved results in compared with were principally in the liability component of this business due to a lower frequency and severity of losses 
losses from catastrophes other than the september attack represented percentage points of the loss ratio for this class in and percentage points in there were virtually no catastrophe losses in results for our casualty business  as adjusted  were profitable in compared with highly unprofitable results in and this business has shown significant improvement in each of the past two years due to higher rates and the culling of business where we could not attain price adequacy 
in particular  the automobile component showed substantial improvement  producing highly profitable results in compared with modestly unprofitable results in and highly unprofitable results in results for the primary liability component also improved in each succeeding year 
the excess liability component produced breakeven results in compared with unprofitable results in and as noted above  casualty results in each of the past three years were adversely affected by incurred losses related to asbestos and toxic waste claims 
workers compensation results were highly profitable in and compared with near breakeven results in the strong results in and were due to higher rates as well as to a lower frequency of losses  resulting in large part from our disciplined risk selection during the past several years 
property and marine results were profitable in compared with highly unprofitable results in and results in benefited from improved pricing  higher deductibles and better terms and conditions 
results in and were adversely affected by a high frequency of large losses  both in the united states and overseas 
losses from catastrophes other than the september attack represented percentage points of the loss ratio for this class in compared with percentage points in and percentage points in specialty insurance net premiums from specialty insurance  which represent of our total writings  increased by in compared with a increase in premiums in included net reinsurance reinstatement premium revenue of million related to the september attack  primarily consisting of million of premium revenue in our reinsurance business offset in part by costs of million in our financial institutions business 
our strategy of working closely with our customers and our ability to differentiate our products continue to enable us to renew a considerable percentage of our executive protection and financial institutions business 
the growth in in executive protection and the professional liability component of our financial institutions business was primarily attributable to higher rates 
in response to claim severity trends  we initiated a program in to increase pricing and improve policy terms and to not renew business that no longer met our underwriting criteria 
we have implemented better terms and conditions  including lower policy limits and higher deductibles 
most of our new business is coming from the small to mid size market 
in the standard commercial component of our financial institutions business  rates were higher as well 
growth of this business was somewhat restrained by our management of terrorism exposure concentrations and higher reinsurance costs 
executive protection premium growth in was only due to our writing fewer multi year policies and the non renewal of unprofitable business 
excluding the reinsurance reinstatement costs of million in  financial institutions premium growth was in and in a reunderwriting of our european executive protection business is underway using many of the strategies already implemented in the united states  including substantial rate increases  reductions in policy limits and higher deductibles 
growth in our other specialty insurance business was primarily from chubb re  our reinsurance assumed business 
premiums produced by chubb re amounted to million in compared with million in  excluding the net reinstatement premium revenue of million  and million in we expect reinsurance assumed business to continue to grow significantly in our specialty insurance results in benefited from the million reduction in surety losses resulting from the settlement of litigation related to enron 
results were adversely affected in by net costs of million related to the september attack and the enron related surety losses of million 
the combined loss and expense ratios for the classes of business within specialty insurance  as reported and as adjusted to exclude the effects of the september attack and the enron surety losses and related settlement  were as follows years ended december as reported executive protection financial institutions other total specialty as adjusted executive protection financial institutions other total specialty our specialty insurance underwriting results  as adjusted  were unprofitable in compared with profitable results in and executive protection results were unprofitable in compared with profitable results in and results in were adversely affected by deteriorating claim trends in directors and officers liability and errors and omissions liability business due in large part to the corporate abuses and accounting irregularities in recent years 
results in europe were particularly unprofitable in loss experience in europe started to deteriorate in due to adverse trends in loss severity caused by an increase in litigation  often involving european companies being sued in us courts for securities fraud 
loss trends in europe deteriorated further in our employment practices liability business was profitable in compared with unprofitable results in and the improvement was due to our strategy to reduce our exposure to accounts with more than  employees  which are the accounts that had been generating most of our large losses in this class 
our financial institutions business  as adjusted  produced unprofitable results in compared with profitable results in and the fidelity component of this business was highly profitable in each of the last three years due to favorable loss experience 
results for the professional liability component were highly unprofitable in compared with modestly unprofitable results in and profitable results in the deterioration in was due to the same claim trends in the united states and europe experienced in our executive protection business 
the standard commercial business written on financial institutions produced profitable results in and compared with breakeven results in results have improved in each succeeding year due in large part to the rate increases and more stringent risk selection in recent years 
other specialty results  as adjusted  were highly profitable in compared with near breakeven results in and unprofitable results in excluding the impact of the enron bankruptcy  our surety results were highly profitable in each of the past three years 
our reinsurance assumed business generated by chubb re produced a modest underwriting gain in compared with a modest loss in and accident and aviation results also improved in the surety business tends to be characterized by infrequent but potentially high severity losses 
since the end of  we have been reducing our exposure on an absolute basis and by specific bond type 
the majority of our obligations are intended to be performance based guarantees 
when losses occur  they are mitigated by the customer s balance sheet  contract proceeds and bankruptcy recovery 
notwithstanding our efforts to manage and reduce our surety exposure  we continue to have substantial commercial surety exposure for outstanding bonds 
in that regard  we have exposures related to commercial surety bonds issued on behalf of companies that have experienced deterioration in creditworthiness 
given the current economic climate and its impact on these and other companies  there is an increased likelihood that we may experience an increase in filed claims and may incur high severity losses 
such losses would be recorded if and when claims are filed and determined to be valid 
as a result of disarray in the surety reinsurance market caused by several years of declining prices and high losses  the availability of surety reinsurance in the near term has been significantly reduced 
as a result  our future surety results could be more volatile 
we have in force several gas forward purchase surety bonds similar to those we issued on behalf of enron 
the total amount of bonds with one principal  aquila  inc  is million 
these bonds are uncollateralized 
the combined amount of all other gas forward surety bonds is approximately million 
approximately million of these bonds are uncollateralized 
our obligations under these bonds will decline over the terms of the bonds  the longest of which extends until there is currently no reinsurance in place covering our obligations under any of these bonds 
under the gas forward purchase surety bond structure  gas suppliers entered into long term gas purchase agreements pursuant to which they agreed to supply specified quantities of gas to the beneficiaries under our surety bonds 
in exchange for the gas purchase agreement  the beneficiaries under our surety bonds made an agreed upon advance payment for the gas 
our surety bonds secure the suppliers obligation to supply gas 
under the terms of these bonds  our entire obligation to pay could be triggered if the related supplier failed to provide gas under its forward purchase contracts or was the subject of a bankruptcy filing 
each of the suppliers continues to perform its obligations under the related gas forward purchase agreements 
however  certain of these suppliers  including aquila  inc  have suffered ratings downgrades 
if payment under the aquila surety bonds were triggered or if payment under all of the other gas forward surety bonds were triggered  such payments would have a material adverse effect on the corporation s results of operations and liquidity 
loss reserves loss reserves  which are our property and casualty subsidiaries largest liability  include significant amounts related to the september attack  to our enron surety exposure and to asbestos and toxic waste claims 
the components of our loss reserves were as follows december in millions gross loss reserves total  per balance sheet less related to the september attack related to enron surety exposure related to asbestos and toxic waste claims total  as adjusted reinsurance recoverable total  per balance sheet less related to the september attack related to enron surety exposure related to asbestos and toxic waste claims total  as adjusted net loss reserves total total  as adjusted the loss reserves related to the september attack  our enron surety exposure and asbestos and toxic waste claims are significant components of our total loss reserves  but they distort the growth trend in our loss reserves 
adjusted to exclude such loss reserves  our loss reserves  net of reinsurance recoverable  increased by  million or in compared with million or in net loss reserves  as adjusted  by segment were as follows december in millions personal insurance commercial insurance specialty insurance net loss reserves  as adjusted loss reserves for personal insurance and specialty insurance increased significantly in and in particular  in specialty insurance  our european directors and officers and errors and omissions loss reserves for the current and prior accident years increased by about million in the aggregate in loss reserves for commercial insurance have not increased  reflecting the significant exposure reductions of the past several years and the improved accident year results in these years due to more stringent risk selection 
a reconciliation of the beginning and ending liability for unpaid claims and claim adjustment expenses for the three years ended december  is included in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
during  we experienced overall unfavorable development of million on loss reserves established as of the previous year end 
this compares with favorable development of million in and million in such development was reflected in operating results in these respective years 
the unfavorable development in was due primarily to our strengthening asbestos and toxic waste loss reserves by million during the year 
in addition  we experienced unfavorable development of about million in the homeowners class due to the increase in the severity of water damage and related mold claims 
in the executive protection classes  the adverse loss trends in europe and the united states in the more recent accident years more than offset favorable loss experience in the united states in older accident years  resulting in unfavorable development of about million during offsetting the unfavorable development somewhat was the million reduction in surety loss reserves related to the enron settlement 
the favorable development in and was due primarily to favorable claim experience in our commercial excess liability and executive protection coverages  offset in part by losses incurred related to asbestos and toxic waste claims 
in item of the form k  we present an analysis of our consolidated loss reserve development on a calendar year basis for the ten years prior to our us property and casualty subsidiaries are required to file annual statements with insurance regulatory authorities prepared on an accounting basis prescribed or permitted by such authorities 
these annual statements include an analysis of loss reserves  referred to as schedule p  that presents accident year loss development information by line of business for the nine years prior to it is our intention to post the schedule p for our combined us property and casualty subsidiaries on our website as soon as it becomes available 
the process of establishing loss reserves is complex and imprecise as it is subject to variables that are influenced by significant judgmental factors 
this is true because claim settlements to be made in the future will be impacted by changing rates of inflation  particularly medical cost inflation  and other economic conditions  changing legislative  judicial and social environments  and changes in our claim handling procedures 
our loss reserves include amounts related to short tail and long tail classes of business 
short tail classes consist principally of homeowners  personal valuable articles and commercial property business 
for these classes  the estimation of loss reserves is less complex because claims are generally reported and settled quickly and the claims relate to tangible property 
long tail classes include directors and officers liability  errors and omissions liability and other executive protection coverages  commercial excess liability and other liability classes 
most of our loss reserves relate to long tail liability classes of business 
for many liability claims significant periods of time  ranging up to several years or more  may elapse between the occurrence of the loss  the reporting of the loss and the settlement of the claim 
the longer the time span between the incidence of a loss and the settlement of the claim  the more the ultimate settlement amount can vary 
for the long tail liability classes  a relatively small proportion of net losses in the more recent accident years are reported claims and an even smaller proportion are paid losses 
therefore  a relatively large proportion of our net losses for these classes are reserves for incurred but not reported ibnr losses claims that had not yet been reported to us  some of which were not yet known to the insured  and future development on reported claims 
in fact  approximately of our aggregate net loss reserves at december  were for ibnr 
we use a variety of actuarial methods that analyze experience trends and other relevant factors to estimate loss reserves 
these methods generally utilize analyses of historical patterns of the development of paid and reported losses by accident year by class of business 
this process relies on the basic assumption that past experience  adjusted for the effects of current developments and likely trends  is an appropriate basis for predicting future outcomes 
for certain long tail classes of business where anticipated loss experience is less predictable because of the small number of claims and or erratic claim severity patterns  estimates are based on both expected losses and actual reported losses 
these classes include directors and officers liability  errors and omissions liability and commercial excess liability  among others 
for these classes  we judgmentally set ultimate losses for each accident year based on our evaluation of loss trends and the current risk environment 
the expected ultimate losses are adjusted as the accident years mature 
reserves for asbestos and toxic waste claims cannot be estimated with traditional actuarial techniques that rely on historical accident year loss development factors 
we establish case reserves and expense reserves for costs of related litigation where sufficient information has been developed to indicate the involvement of a specific insurance policy 
in addition  ibnr reserves are established to cover additional exposures on both known and unasserted claims 
judicial decisions and legislative actions continue to broaden liability and policy definitions and to increase the severity of claim payments 
as a result of this and other societal and economic developments  the uncertainties inherent in estimating ultimate claim costs on the basis of past experience have been exacerbated  further complicating the already complex loss reserving process 
the uncertainties relating to asbestos and toxic waste claims on insurance policies written many years ago are further exacerbated by inconsistent court decisions as well as judicial interpretations and legislative actions that in some cases have tended to broaden coverage beyond the original intent of such policies and in others have expanded theories of liability 
the industry as a whole is engaged in extensive litigation over these coverage and liability issues and is thus confronted with a continuing uncertainty in its efforts to quantify these exposures 
asbestos remains the most significant and difficult mass tort for the insurance industry in terms of claims volume and dollar exposure 
early court cases established the continuous trigger theory with respect to insurance coverage 
under this theory  insurance coverage is deemed to be triggered from the time a claimant is first exposed to asbestos until the manifestation of any disease 
this interpretation of a policy trigger can involve insurance companies over many years and increases their exposure to liability 
to date  approximately manufacturers and distributors of asbestos products have filed for bankruptcy protection as a result of asbestos liabilities 
the rapid increase in both the frequency and severity of claims in recent years has accelerated the pace at which these bankruptcies have been filed 
about of these companies have been pushed into bankruptcy since in part as a result of these bankruptcies  the volume and value of claims against viable asbestos defendants continue to increase 
our most significant individual asbestos exposures involve product liability on the part of traditional defendants who manufactured  distributed or installed asbestos products 
we wrote excess liability and or general liability coverages for these insureds 
while these insureds are relatively few in number  such exposure has increased in recent years due to the increased volume of claims  the erosion of much of the underlying limits and the bankruptcies of target defendants 
our other asbestos exposures involve non product liability on the part of peripheral defendants  including a mix of manufacturers  distributors and installers of certain products that contain asbestos in small quantities and owners of properties on which asbestos exists 
generally  these insureds are named defendants on a regional rather than a nationwide basis 
as the financial resources of traditional asbestos defendants have been depleted  plaintiffs are targeting these peripheral parties with greater frequency and  in many cases  for larger awards 
in addition  the plaintiffs bar continues to solicit new claimants through extensive advertising and through asbestos medical screenings 
litigation is then initiated even though many of the claimants do not show any signs of asbestos related disease 
thus  new asbestos claims and new exposures on existing claims have continued unabated despite the fact that usage of asbestos has declined since the mid s 
based on published projections  we expect that we will continue receiving asbestos claims at the current rate for at least the next several years 
asbestos claims initially focused on the major manufacturers  distributors or installers of asbestos products under the products liability section of primary general liability policies as well as under excess liability policies  both of which typically had aggregate limits that capped an insurer s liability 
in recent years  a number of asbestos claims by insureds are being presented as non products claims  such as those by installers of asbestos products and by property owners who allegedly had asbestos on their property  under the premises or operations section of primary general liability policies 
unlike products exposures  these non products exposures typically had no aggregate limits  creating potentially greater exposure 
further  in an effort to seek additional insurance coverage  some insureds with installation activities who have substantially eroded their products coverage are presenting new asbestos claims as non products operations claims or attempting to reclassify old products claims 
the extent to which insureds will be liable under such theories and successful in obtaining coverage on this basis is uncertain 
the expanded focus of asbestos litigation beyond asbestos manufacturers and distributors to installers and premises owners has created  in some instances  conflicts among insureds  primary insurers and excess insurers  mainly involving questions regarding allocation of indemnity and expense costs and exhaustion of policy limits 
these issues are generating costly coverage litigation with the potential for inconsistent results 
federal legislation still appears to be the best vehicle for comprehensively addressing the asbestos problem 
however  unified support among various defendant and insurer groups considered essential to any possible reform is lacking 
we therefore have assumed a continuing unfavorable legal environment with no benefit from any asbestos reform legislation 
in establishing our asbestos reserves  we evaluate the exposure presented by each insured 
as part of this evaluation  we consider the available insurance coverage  limits and deductibles  the potential role of other insurance  particularly underlying coverage below our excess liability policies  and applicable coverage defenses  including asbestos exclusions 
in the third quarter of  our actuaries and outside actuarial consultants commenced their periodic ground up exposure based analysis of our asbestos related liabilities 
as part of this analysis  they considered the following recent adverse trends estimates of the ultimate liabilities for traditional asbestos defendants have increased as the number of plaintiff claims has surged over the past few years 
the notable increase in claimants as well as potential future claimants has resulted in large settlements of asbestos related litigation 
as a result  it now appears more likely that many of these traditional defendants will access higher excess layers of insurance coverage as well as more years of coverage than previously anticipated 
claims have been more aggressively pursued against peripheral asbestos defendants in recent years  partly in response to the bankruptcy or exhaustion of insurance coverage for many of the major traditional defendants 
the number of claims filed under the non aggregate premises or operations section of general liability policies has increased  creating potentially greater exposure 
the litigation environment has become increasingly adverse 
more than half of the lawsuits filed in recent years have been filed in five plaintiff oriented states  where significant verdicts historically have been rendered against commercial defendants 
the number of asbestos defendants in bankruptcy has increased  resulting in an increase in the number and cost of declaratory judgment lawsuits to resolve coverage disputes and to effect settlements in the bankruptcy courts 
upon completion of the analysis and assessment of the results  we increased our net asbestos loss reserves by million in the third quarter 
following a thorough review in the fourth quarter by our internal actuarial  claims and reinsurance personnel  we reduced our previous estimate of reinsurance recoverable on potential asbestos claims 
as a result  our net asbestos loss reserves increased by an additional million 
the following table presents a reconciliation of the beginning and ending loss reserves related to asbestos claims 
years ended december in millions gross loss reserves  beginning of year reinsurance recoverable  beginning of year net loss reserves  beginning of year net incurred losses net losses paid net loss reserves  end of year reinsurance recoverable  end of year gross loss reserves  end of year significant uncertainty remains as to our ultimate liability relating to asbestos related claims due to such factors as the long latency period between asbestos exposure and disease manifestation and the resulting potential for involvement of multiple policy periods for individual claims as well as the increase in the volume of claims by plaintiffs who claim exposure but who have no symptoms of asbestos related disease and an increase in claims filed under the non aggregate premises or operations section of general liability policies 
there is also the possibility of federal legislation that would address the asbestos problem 
hazardous waste sites are another potential exposure 
under the federal superfund law and similar state statutes  when potentially responsible parties prps fail to handle the clean up at a site  regulators have the work done and then attempt to establish legal liability against the prps 
most sites have multiple prps 
most prps named to date are parties who have been generators  transporters  past or present landowners or past or present site operators 
the prps disposed of toxic materials at a waste dump site or transported the materials to the site 
these prps had proper government authorization in many instances 
insurance policies issued to prps were not intended to cover the clean up costs of pollution and  in many cases  did not intend to cover the pollution itself 
pollution was not a recognized hazard at the time many of these policies were written 
in more recent years  however  policies specifically exclude such exposures 
as the costs of environmental clean up became substantial  prps and others increasingly filed claims with their insurance carriers 
litigation against insurers extends to issues of liability  coverage and other policy provisions 
there is great uncertainty involved in estimating our liabilities related to these claims 
first  the liabilities of the claimants are extremely difficult to estimate 
at any given site  the allocation of remediation costs among governmental authorities and the prps varies greatly depending on a variety of factors 
second  different courts have addressed liability and coverage issues regarding pollution claims and have reached inconsistent conclusions in their interpretation of several issues 
these significant uncertainties are not likely to be resolved definitively in the near future 
uncertainties also remain as to the superfund law itself 
superfund s taxing authority expired on december  and has not been re enacted 
federal legislation appears to be at a standstill 
at this time  it is not possible to predict the direction that any reforms may take  when they may occur or the effect that any changes may have on the insurance industry 
without federal movement on superfund reform  the enforcement of superfund liability is shifting to the states 
states are being forced to reconsider state level cleanup statutes and regulations 
as individual states move forward  the potential for conflicting state regulation becomes greater 
significant uncertainty remains as to the cost of remediating the state sites 
because of the large number of state sites  such sites could prove even more costly in the aggregate than superfund sites 
toxic waste losses appear to be developing as expected due to relatively stable claim trends 
in many cases  claims are being settled for less than initially anticipated due to various factors  including more efficient site remediation efforts and increasing success with policy buy backs 
despite the stable claim trends  we increased our toxic waste loss reserves by million in the third quarter of based on the most recent estimate of our actuaries and actuarial consultants as to our ultimate exposure 
the following table presents a reconciliation of the beginning and ending loss reserves  net of reinsurance recoverable  related to toxic waste claims 
there are virtually no reinsurance recoveries related to these claims 
years ended december in millions reserves  beginning of year incurred losses losses paid reserves  end of year we continually review and update our loss reserves 
based on all information currently available  we believe that the aggregate loss reserves of the property and casualty subsidiaries at december  were adequate to cover claims for losses that had occurred  including both those known to us and those yet to be reported 
in establishing such reserves  we consider facts currently known and the present state of the law and coverage litigation 
however  given the judicial decisions and legislative actions that have broadened the scope of coverage and expanded theories of liability in the past and the possibilities of similar interpretations in the future  particularly as they relate to asbestos claims and  to a lesser extent  toxic waste claims  additional increases in loss reserves may emerge in future periods 
such increases could have a material adverse effect on the corporation s future operating results 
however  management does not expect that any such increases would have a material effect on the corporation s consolidated financial condition or liquidity 
catastrophe exposure our property and casualty subsidiaries have exposure to insured losses caused by hurricanes  earthquakes  winter storms  windstorms and other natural catastrophic events 
the frequency and severity of natural catastrophes are unpredictable 
the tragic event of september changed the way the property and casualty insurance industry views catastrophic risk 
numerous classes of business have become exposed to terrorism related catastrophic risks in addition to the catastrophic risks related to natural occurrences 
this has required us to change how we identify and evaluate risk accumulations 
we have changed our underwriting protocols to address terrorism and the limited availability of terrorism reinsurance 
however  given the uncertainty of the potential threats  we cannot be sure that we have addressed all the possibilities 
the extent of losses from a catastrophe is a function of both the total amount of insured exposure in an area affected by the event and the severity of the event 
we continually assess our concentration of underwriting exposures in catastrophe prone areas globally and develop strategies to manage this exposure through individual risk selection  subject to regulatory constraints  and through the purchase of catastrophe reinsurance 
in recent years  we have invested in modeling technologies and concentration management tools that allow us to better monitor and control our accumulations of potential losses from catastrophe exposures 
we maintain records showing concentrations of risk in catastrophe prone areas such as california earthquake and brush fires and the gulf and east coasts of the united states hurricanes 
we also continue to explore and analyze credible scientific evidence  including the impact of global climate change  that may affect our potential exposure under insurance policies 
despite these efforts  the occurrence of one or more severe catastrophic events in heavily populated areas could have a material adverse effect on the corporation s results of operations  financial condition or liquidity 
investment income property and casualty investment income before taxes increased by both in compared with and in compared with growth in and was due to an increase in invested assets  which reflected substantial cash flow from operations over the period 
growth in also benefited from capital contributed to the property and casualty subsidiaries by the corporation in the fourth quarter of growth in both years was dampened by lower available reinvestment rates on fixed maturities that matured in each year 
the effective tax rate on our investment income was in compared with in and in the effective tax rate increased each year as a result of our holding a somewhat smaller proportion of our investment portfolio in tax exempt securities 
on an after tax basis  property and casualty investment income increased by in and in management uses property and casualty investment income after tax  a non gaap financial measure  to evaluate its investment performance because it reflects the impact of any change in the proportion of our investment portfolio invested in tax exempt securities and is therefore more meaningful for analysis purposes than investment income before taxes 
other charges other charges include miscellaneous income and expenses of the property and casualty subsidiaries 
other charges in both and included goodwill amortization of approximately million 
the accounting for goodwill was changed in  as discussed further under changes in accounting principles 
as a result  there was no goodwill amortization in other charges in included a million charge for our share of the losses of hiscox plc from the september attack 
chubb financial solutions chubb financial solutions cfs was organized by the corporation in to develop and provide customized products to address specific financial needs of corporate clients 
cfs operates through both the capital and insurance markets 
since its inception  cfs s non insurance business has been primarily structured credit derivatives  principally as a counterparty in portfolio credit default swap contracts 
the corporation guarantees all of these obligations 
in a typical portfolio credit default swap  cfs participates in the senior layer of a structure designed to replicate the performance of a portfolio of corporate securities  a portfolio of asset backed securities or a specified pool of loans 
the structure of these portfolio credit default swaps generally requires cfs to make payment to counterparties to the extent cumulative losses  related to numerous credit events  exceed a specified threshold 
the risk below that threshold  referred to as subordination  is assumed by other parties with the primary risk layer sometimes retained by the buyer 
the amount of subordination for each contract varies based on the credit quality of the underlying portfolio and the term to maturity of the contract 
credit events generally arise when one of the referenced entities within a portfolio becomes bankrupt  undergoes a debt restructuring or fails to make timely interest or principal payments on a senior unsecured debt obligation 
portfolio credit default swaps are derivatives and are carried in the financial statements at estimated fair value  which represents management s best estimate of the cost to exit our positions 
changes in fair value are included in income in the period of the change 
thus  cfs s results are subject to volatility  which could have a significant effect on the corporation s results of operations from period to period 
valuation models are used to estimate the fair value of our obligation in each credit default swap 
such valuations require considerable judgment and are subject to significant uncertainty 
the fair value of our credit default swaps is subject to fluctuations arising from  among other factors  changes in credit spreads  the financial ratings of referenced asset backed securities  actual credit events reducing subordination  credit correlation within a portfolio  anticipated recovery rates related to potential defaults and changes in interest rates 
short term fluctuations in the fair value of our future obligations may have little correlation to the ultimate profitability of this business 
the ultimate profitability of this business depends on actual credit events over the lives of the contracts 
while we have not had to make any payment under any of the contracts  we cannot be certain that there will never be any payment obligation under the credit default swap portfolio 
the market risks associated with our obligations under portfolio credit default swaps are discussed under market risk of financial instruments credit derivatives 
revenues from the non insurance business of cfs  principally consisting of the change in fair value of derivative contracts  were million in and million in revenues were negative million in due to the adverse impact of changes in fair value during the year 
this business produced a loss before taxes of million in compared with income of million in and million in the substantial loss in was due to an adverse movement in the mark to market adjustment  which resulted in an increase in the fair value of our obligations related to the portfolio credit default swaps 
the primary factors contributing to the increase in the fair value of our obligations were downgrades in the financial ratings of certain referenced asset backed securities  a widening of market credit spreads  and  for one credit default swap  erosion in the risk layers that are subordinate to the cfs risk layer due to actual losses in those subordinate layers 
at december   cfs s aggregate exposure  or retained risk  referred to as notional amounts  from its in force portfolio credit default swaps was approximately billion 
the notional amounts are used to express the extent of involvement in swap transactions 
these amounts are used to calculate the exchange of contractual cash flows and are not necessarily representative of the potential for gain or loss 
the notional amounts are not recorded on the balance sheet 
our realistic loss exposure is a very small portion of the billion notional amount due to several factors 
our position is senior to subordinated interests of billion in the aggregate 
of the billion of subordination  there were only million of defaults through december   none of which has pierced the subordination limits of any of our contracts 
in addition  the underlying credits are primarily investment grade corporate credits and highly rated asset backed securities 
in addition to portfolio credit default swaps  cfs has entered into a derivative contract linked to an equity market index and a few other insignificant non insurance transactions 
the notional amount and fair value of our future obligations by type of risk were as follows december notional amount fair value in billions in millions credit default swaps corporate securities asset backed securities loan portfolios other the insurance and reinsurance solutions that cfs develops to meet the risk management needs of its customers are written by our property and casualty subsidiaries 
results from this business are included within our insurance results 
a property and casualty subsidiary issued a reinsurance contract to an insurer who provides financial guarantees on asset backed transactions 
at december   the amount of aggregate principal commitments related to this contract was approximately million  net of reinsurance 
these commitments expire by in february  we announced that we are reviewing our strategic alternatives with respect to cfs 
although the risk financing business continues to have attractive growth characteristics and recent market movements have resulted in a favorable pricing environment for writing high quality credit default swaps  several recent developments have led us to examine our continuing commitment to this business 
most significantly  in order to take advantage of very attractive market conditions in the property and casualty insurance business  we will need to commit increasing amounts of capital to this business  which could limit the capital resources available to support cfs s risk financing business 
also  our corporate debt rating has been downgraded to a  which could limit our opportunities to participate competitively in the aaa credit default swap layer 
finally  as we saw in  cfs s business increases the volatility of our earnings due to mark to market accounting requirements 
corporate and other corporate and other includes investment income earned on corporate invested assets  interest expense and other expenses not allocated to the operating subsidiaries  and the results of our real estate and other non insurance subsidiaries 
corporate and other produced a loss before taxes of million in compared with losses of million and million in and  respectively 
the substantially higher loss in was due to higher interest expense and lower investment income 
the higher interest expense in was due to the issuance of million of debt in the fourth quarter of the lower investment income in was due to the decrease in corporate invested assets resulting from the capital contribution to the property and casualty subsidiaries in the fourth quarter of in  corporate and other included income of million from a noncompete payment related to the sale of the corporation s interest in associated aviation underwriters  inc aau 
real estate real estate operations resulted in a loss before taxes of million in compared with a loss of million in both and these amounts are included in the corporate and other results 
in each year  we sold selected commercial properties as well as residential properties 
real estate revenues were million in  million in and million in we own approximately million of land which we expect will be developed in the future 
in addition  we own approximately million of commercial properties and land parcels under lease 
we are continuing to explore the sale of certain of our remaining properties 
loans receivable  which amounted to million at december   are primarily purchase money mortgages 
such loans  which were issued in connection with our joint venture activities and other property sales  are generally collateralized by buildings and  in some cases  land 
we continually evaluate the ultimate collectibility of such loans and establish appropriate reserves 
the recoverability of the carrying value of our real estate assets is assessed based on our ability to fully recover costs through a future revenue stream 
the assumptions used reflect future improvement in demand for office space  an increase in rental rates and the ability and intent to obtain financing in order to hold and develop such remaining properties and protect our interests over the long term 
management believes that it has made adequate provisions for impairment of real estate assets 
however  if the assets are not sold or developed or if leased properties do not perform as presently contemplated  it is possible that additional impairment losses may be recognized that would have a material adverse effect on the corporation s results of operations 
realized investment gains and losses net realized investment gains were as follows years end december in millions equity securities fixed maturities sale of aau realized investment gains before tax realized investment gains after tax decisions to sell securities are governed principally by considerations of investment opportunities and tax consequences 
as a result  realized investment gains and losses on the sale of investments may vary significantly from year to year 
a primary reason for the sale of fixed maturities in each of the last three years has been to improve our after tax portfolio return without sacrificing quality where market opportunities have existed to do so 
we regularly review the value of our invested assets for other than temporary impairment 
in evaluating whether a decline in value is other than temporary  we consider various factors including the length of time and the extent to which the fair value has been less than the cost  the financial condition and near term prospects of the issuer  whether the debtor is current on contractually obligated interest and principal payments  and our intent and ability to hold the investment for a period of time sufficient to allow us to recover our cost 
if a decline in the fair value of an individual security is deemed to be other than temporary  the difference between cost and estimated fair value is charged to income as a realized investment loss 
in  net realized gains on the sale of equities of million were partially offset by writedowns of million due to the recognition of other than temporary impairment on certain securities 
net realized gains on the sale of fixed maturities of million were reduced by other than temporary impairment writedowns of million 
in  realized gains on sales of equity securities and fixed maturities of million and million  respectively  were substantially offset by other than temporary impairment writedowns on certain securities 
the increase in writedowns in and was due to credit deterioration and corporate failures  particularly in the telecommunications and  to a lesser extent  energy related industries 
income taxes we establish deferred income taxes on the undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries 
similarly  we establish deferred tax assets related to the expected future us tax benefit of losses and foreign taxes incurred by our foreign subsidiaries 
in the last three years  chubb insurance company of europe chubb europe has incurred substantial losses 
these losses were the result of underwriting losses due to inadequate prices and adverse claim trends  particularly for directors and officers liability and errors and omissions liability coverages 
at december  and  we recorded a deferred income tax asset of million and million  respectively  related to the expected future us tax benefit of the losses and foreign taxes incurred by chubb europe 
to evaluate the realization of these deferred tax assets  management must consider whether it is more likely than not that chubb europe will generate sufficient taxable income to realize the future tax benefit of the deferred tax assets 
management s judgment is based on its assessment of business plans and related projections of future taxable income that reflect assumptions about increased premium volume  higher rates and improved policy terms as well as available tax planning strategies 
results in chubb europe in were less favorable than we anticipated due to the deteriorating claim trends 
while the tax loss carryforwards and foreign tax credits have no expiration and we expect to generate sufficient taxable income to realize these benefits in the future  we are required under generally accepted accounting principles to consider a relatively near term horizon when we evaluate the likelihood of realizing future tax benefits 
during the fourth quarter of  we established a valuation allowance of million for the portion of these assets that we cannot recognize for accounting purposes due to this limitation 
if our estimates of future taxable income in chubb europe were revised upward or downward  we would need to adjust the valuation allowance accordingly 
the effect on the corporation s results of operations could be significant 
invested assets the main objectives in managing our investment portfolios are to maximize after tax investment income and total investment returns while minimizing credit risks in order to provide maximum support to the insurance underwriting operations 
investment strategies are developed based on many factors including underwriting results and our resulting tax position  regulatory requirements  fluctuations in interest rates and consideration of other market risks 
investment decisions are centrally managed by investment professionals based on guidelines established by management and approved by the boards of directors 
our investment portfolio is primarily comprised of high quality bonds  principally tax exempt  us treasury  government agency  mortgage backed securities and corporate issues 
in addition  the portfolio includes equity securities held primarily with the objective of capital appreciation 
in  we invested new cash in mortgage backed securities and  to a lesser extent  us treasury securities 
in  we invested new cash primarily in corporate bonds 
in  we invested new cash primarily in mortgage backed securities 
in each year  we tried to achieve the appropriate mix of taxable and tax exempt securities in our portfolio to balance both investment and tax strategies 
at december   of our fixed maturity portfolio was invested in tax exempt bonds compared with at december  and at december  fixed maturity securities which we have the ability and intent to hold to maturity are classified as held to maturity 
the remaining fixed maturities  which may be sold prior to maturity to support our investment strategies  such as in response to changes in interest rates and the yield curve or to maximize after tax returns  are classified as available for sale 
fixed maturities classified as held to maturity are carried at amortized cost while fixed maturities classified as available for sale are carried at market value 
at december   of the fixed maturity portfolio was classified as held to maturity compared with at december  and at december  changes in the general interest rate environment affect the returns available on new fixed maturity investments 
while a rising interest rate environment enhances the returns available  it reduces the market value of existing fixed maturity investments and thus the availability of gains on disposition 
a decline in interest rates reduces the returns available on new investments but increases the market value of existing investments  creating the opportunity for realized investment gains on disposition 
in  interest rates declined to their lowest levels in many years while equity returns were negative for the second consecutive year 
these trends may continue into  reducing the returns available on the investment of funds 
the unrealized appreciation of investments carried at market value  which includes fixed maturities classified as available for sale and equity securities  was million  million and million at december   and  respectively 
such unrealized appreciation is reflected in a separate component of other comprehensive income  net of applicable deferred income tax 
the unrealized market appreciation before tax of those fixed maturities carried at amortized cost was million  million and million at december   and  respectively 
such unrealized appreciation was not reflected in the consolidated financial statements 
changes in unrealized market appreciation or depreciation of fixed maturities were due primarily to fluctuations in interest rates 
market risk of financial instruments market risk represents the potential for loss due to adverse changes in the fair value of financial instruments 
our primary exposure to market risks relates to our investment portfolio  which exposes us to risks related to interest rates and  to a lesser extent  credit quality  prepayment  foreign currency exchange rates and equity prices 
we also have exposure to market risks through our credit derivatives business and our debt obligations 
analytical tools and monitoring systems are in place to assess each of these elements of market risk 
investments interest rate risk is the price sensitivity of a security that promises a fixed return to changes in interest rates 
changes in market interest rates directly affect the market value of our fixed income securities 
we view the potential changes in price of our fixed income investments within the overall context of asset and liability management 
our actuaries estimate the payout pattern of our liabilities  primarily our property and casualty loss reserves  to determine their duration  which is the present value of the weighted average payments expressed in years 
we set duration targets for our fixed income investment portfolios after consideration of the duration of these liabilities and other factors  which we believe mitigates the overall effect of interest rate risk for the corporation and its subsidiaries 
the following table provides information about our fixed maturity investments  which are sensitive to changes in interest rates 
the table presents cash flows of principal amounts and related weighted average interest rates by expected maturity dates at december  and the cash flows are based on the earlier of the call date or the maturity date or  for mortgage backed securities  expected payment patterns 
actual cash flows could differ from the expected amounts

as a result  we believe that we have minimal credit quality risk 
approximately of taxable bonds in our portfolio are issued by the us treasury or us government agencies or rated aa or better by moody s or standard poor s 
of the tax exempt bonds  more than are rated aa or better with more than rated aaa 
approximately of our bond portfolio is below investment grade 
our taxable bonds have an average maturity of five years  while our tax exempt bonds mature on average in eight years 
prepayment risk refers to the changes in prepayment patterns related to decreases and increases in interest rates that can either shorten or lengthen the expected timing of the principal repayments and thus the average life and the effective yield of a security 
such risk exists primarily within our portfolio of mortgage backed securities 
we monitor such risk regularly and invest primarily in those classes of mortgage backed securities that are less subject to prepayment risk 
mortgage backed securities comprised and of our taxable bond portfolio at year end and  respectively 
about of our mortgage backed securities holdings at december  related to residential mortgages consisting of government agency pass through securities  government agency collateralized mortgage obligations cmos and aaa rated non agency cmos backed by government agency collateral or single family home mortgages 
the majority of the cmos are actively traded in liquid markets and market value information is readily available from broker dealers 
an additional of our mortgage backed securities were call protected aaa rated commercial securities 
the remaining mortgage backed holdings were all in investment grade commercial mortgage backed securities 
foreign currency risk is the sensitivity to foreign exchange rate fluctuations of the market value and investment income related to foreign currency denominated financial instruments 
the functional currency of our foreign operations is generally the currency of the local operating environment since business is primarily transacted in such local currency 
we reduce the risks relating to currency fluctuations by maintaining investments in those foreign currencies in which our property and casualty subsidiaries have loss reserves and other liabilities 
such investments have characteristics similar to our liabilities in those currencies 
at december   the property and casualty subsidiaries held non us investments of billion supporting their international operations 
these investments have quality and maturity characteristics similar to our domestic portfolio 
the principal currencies creating foreign exchange rate risk for the property and casualty subsidiaries are the euro  the british pound sterling and the canadian dollar 
the following table provides information about those fixed maturity investments that are denominated in these currencies 
the table presents cash flows of principal amounts in us dollar equivalents by expected maturity dates at december  and actual cash flows could differ from the expected amounts 
at december  total estimated there amortized market after cost value in millions euro british pound sterling canadian dollar at december  total estimated there amortized market after cost value in millions euro british pound sterling canadian dollar equity price risk is the potential loss arising from decreases in the value of equity securities 
in general  equities have more year to year price variability than intermediate term high grade bonds 
however  returns over longer time frames have been consistently higher 
our publicly traded equity securities are high quality  diversified across industries and readily marketable 
our portfolio also includes alternative investments  primarily investment partnerships 
these investments by their nature are less liquid than other investments 
we actively manage our risk by allocating a comparatively small amount of funds to alternative investments  perform extensive research prior to investing in a new investment and monitor the performance of the entities in which we have invested 
a hypothetical decrease of in the market price of each of the equity securities held at december  and would have resulted in a decrease of million and million  respectively  in the fair value of the equity securities portfolio 
all of the above risks are monitored on an ongoing basis 
a combination of in house systems and proprietary models and externally licensed software are used to analyze individual securities as well as each portfolio 
these tools provide the portfolio managers with information to assist them in the evaluation of the market risks of the portfolio 
credit derivatives the corporation  through cfs s business  assumes exposure to credit risk through portfolio credit default swaps 
in a typical portfolio credit default swap  the occurrence of certain defined credit events related to referenced entities within a specified portfolio will result in a deterioration of the subordination 
when losses related to cumulative credit events exceed the subordination  the contract requires cfs to make payment to its counterparty 
these obligations are guaranteed by the corporation 
valuation models are used to estimate the fair value of our obligation in each credit default swap 
within these models  credit spreads are a critical input used to estimate the probability of the occurrence of credit events 
the fair value of a portfolio credit default swap is also a function of the financial ratings of referenced asset backed securities  actual credit events reducing subordination  credit correlation within a portfolio  anticipated recovery rates related to potential defaults and changes in interest rates 
our in force portfolio credit default swaps mature within a range of two to nine years 
however  certain credit default swaps on asset backed portfolios include extension options under which the counterparty may continue to participate in the swap through the maturity of all referenced securities within the portfolio 
in the event that an extension option is exercised by the counterparty  cfs would be entitled to additional periodic fee payments 
at december   the average expected remaining weighted average life of the business was approximately years

management continuously monitors the amount of capital resources that the corporation maintains both for itself and its operating subsidiaries 
in connection with our long term capital strategy  the corporation from time to time contributes capital to its property and casualty subsidiaries 
in addition  in order to satisfy its capital needs as a result of any rating agency capital adequacy or other future rating issues  or in the event the corporation were to need additional capital to make strategic investments in light of market opportunities  the corporation may take a variety of actions  which could include the issuance of debt and or equity securities 
in july  the board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to  shares of the corporation s common stock 
in june  the board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to an additional  shares 
the authorization has no expiration while the authorization will expire on june  as of december    shares remained under the share repurchase authorization and  shares remained under the authorization

we do not anticipate that we will repurchase any shares of our common stock in ratings the corporation and its insurance subsidiaries are rated by major rating agencies 
these ratings reflect the rating agency s opinion of our financial strength  operating performance  capital resources  strategic position and ability to meet our obligations to policyholders 
several of the rating agencies lowered certain of our ratings in the fourth quarter of the following table summarizes the corporation s credit ratings from the major independent rating organizations as of march  am best standard poor s moody s fitch senior unsecured debt rating aa a a a preferred stock rating a a p a commercial paper amb a p f counterparty credit rating a the following table summarizes our property and casualty subsidiaries financial strength ratings from the major independent rating organizations as of march  am best standard poor s moody s fitch financial strength a aa aa aa ratings are an important factor in establishing our competitive position in our operating businesses 
there can be no assurance that our ratings will continue for any given period of time or that they will not be changed 
further reductions in our ratings could adversely affect the competitive position of our operating businesses 
following the announcement of our fourth quarter earnings  including our reported actions taken to strengthen our asbestos reserves and our reserves for directors and officers liability and errors and omissions liability coverages in europe  standard poor s ratings services s p placed certain of our ratings on creditwatch with negative implications 
s p is currently conducting a review and has announced that it expects the ratings on our operating companies to remain in the aa category and the ratings on the corporation to remain in the a category 
it is possible that negative ratings actions may occur 
if our ratings are downgraded  the corporation may incur higher borrowing costs and may have more limited means to access capital 
in addition  the competitive position of cfs s non insurance operations  which is dependent on the strength of the corporation s parental guarantee  could be adversely affected and  as described below under liquidity  we may be required to provide collateral under certain of cfs s credit default swap arrangements 
liquidity liquidity is a measure of our ability to generate sufficient cash flows to meet the short and long term cash requirements of our business operations 
in our property and casualty subsidiaries  premiums are generally received months or even years before losses are paid under the policies purchased by such premiums 
these funds are used first to make current claim and expense payments 
the balance is invested to augment the investment income generated by the existing portfolio 
historically  cash receipts from operations  consisting of insurance premiums and investment income  have provided more than sufficient funds to pay losses  operating expenses and dividends to the corporation 
new cash from operations available for investment by the property and casualty subsidiaries was approximately  million in compared with million in and million in the increase in new cash in was due to the significant growth in premium receipts while paid losses were similar in and new cash available in and was similar as substantial growth in premiums in was offset by an increase in paid losses 
in addition to the cash from operations  the property and casualty subsidiaries received capital contributions from the corporation of billion in the fourth quarter of and million in the fourth quarter of in  million was used by a property and casualty subsidiary to fund the purchase of a interest in allied world assurance holdings  ltd  a newly formed bermuda based insurer 
in  the interest in allied world assurance holdings was transferred as a dividend from the property and casualty subsidiary to the corporation 
our property and casualty subsidiaries maintain investments in highly liquid  short term and other marketable securities to provide for immediate cash needs 
cfs s derivatives business subjects the corporation  through its parental guarantee  to liquidity risk related to the uncertain timing of any potential cash payments to counterparties as well as contractual collateral postings upon a ratings downgrade of the corporation and or an increase in the fair value of obligations to a particular counterparty 
if the corporation were downgraded two notches to a and the fair value of cfs s future obligations were to remain unchanged relative to the year end carried amount  we would be required to post collateral of approximately million 
the corporation s liquidity requirements in the past have been met by dividends from its property and casualty subsidiaries and the issuance of commercial paper and debt and equity securities 
liquidity requirements in the future will be met by these sources of funds as well as borrowings from our credit facilities 
the declaration and payment of future dividends to the corporation s shareholders will be at the discretion of the corporation s board of directors and will depend upon many factors  including our operating results  financial condition  capital requirements and any regulatory constraints 
as a holding company  the corporation s ability to continue to pay dividends to shareholders and to satisfy its obligations  including the payment of interest and principal on debt obligations  relies on the availability of liquid assets in the corporation  which is dependent in large part on the dividend paying ability of its property and casualty subsidiaries 
various state insurance laws restrict the corporation s property and casualty subsidiaries as to the amount of dividends they may pay to the corporation without the prior approval of regulatory authorities 
the restrictions are generally based on net income and on certain levels of policyholders surplus as determined in accordance with statutory accounting practices 
dividends in excess of such thresholds are considered extraordinary and require prior regulatory approval 
during  these subsidiaries paid cash dividends to the corporation totaling million 
the maximum dividend distribution that may be made by the property and casualty subsidiaries to the corporation during without prior approval is approximately million 
we believe that our strong financial position and conservative debt level provide us with the flexibility and capacity to obtain funds externally through debt or equity financings on both a short term and long term basis 
however  should our ratings be downgraded and should there be a prolonged disruption of the capital markets caused by war or terrorism  our ability to access the markets to satisfy our liquidity requirements could be adversely affected 
the corporation has lines of credit with a group of banks pursuant to two agreements entered into in june that provide for unsecured borrowings of up to million in the aggregate 
the million short term revolving credit facility terminates on june  and may be renewed or replaced 
the million medium term revolving credit facility terminates on june  on the respective termination dates for these agreements  any loans then outstanding become payable 
there have been no borrowings under these agreements 
various interest rate options are available to the corporation  all of which are based on market interest rates 
the facilities replaced  on substantially the same terms  million of revolving credit facilities that were to expire in july the facilities are available for general corporate purposes and to support our commercial paper borrowing arrangement
