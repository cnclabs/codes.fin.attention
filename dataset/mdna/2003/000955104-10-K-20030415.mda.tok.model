significant business activities during the following developments were of significance we experienced a significant downsizing of revenues from conferencing services for concert  a major customer  which negatively affected total revenues  profits and cashflows 
revenues from concert declined from approximately million during to just over million during we are replacing the lost concert contract revenue with revenues from at t and its customers see below 
in august we announced the signing of an outsourcing agreement whereby act will provide conferencing services to at t and its customers outside the usa  on a worldwide basis 
we believe this could add approximately million million in annual revenue by the end of the first year of contract implementation 
growth in the first five months of the contract has been rapid 
revenues will depend upon customer usage 
we achieved excellent growth in revenues in our videoconferencing services business as a result of good organic growth and acquisition 
videoconferencing revenues in tripled over the previous year due to two new acquisitions 
we observed a general stabilization in pricing trends across most product lines  especially in the audio conferencing sector  and we achieved slower but steady revenue growth in the audioconferencing sector 

table of contents in august we finalized the consolidation of three service delivery centers in continental europe paris  frankfurt  amsterdam into one  based in heerlen  netherlands 
we believe this consolidation will achieve important cost reductions  economies of scale and improvements in quality of service in the long term 
we estimate that we incurred approximately thousand in non recurring cost to finalize this consolidation which included running operations in parallel for a short period of time  as well as termination costs for the phase out of certain employees 
these costs are included in selling  general and administration expense in the consolidated statements of operations 
we commenced a project to rationalize and reduce our worldwide telecommunications costs 
we believe this project could yield annual savings in the million range during  if fully implemented 
we offered a performance incentive plan to our employees to voluntarily elect to reduce their salaries in a range of percent to percent per annum in exchange for a bonus program aimed at improving our profit and cash flow in this program will yield savings including payroll taxes of approximately million for five quarters  ended december  employees will earn their salary reduction back and could earn an additional bonus upon achievement of established targets related to income before taxes  interest  depreciation  and amortization 
employees were granted stock options to participate in the program 
the following table summarizes the most important revenue trends total conferencing minutes s revenues audioconferencing concert channel audioconferencing global services channel audioconferencing audioconferencing subtotal videoconferencing other revenues total revenues revenue growth percentage principally at t and other international customers 
excluding concert and global services concert downsizing as noted  concert revenues reached their peak in late at an annualized revenue run rate of approximately million and downsized during as concert was closed 
act however continued to maintain its worldwide capital infrastructure  telecommunications network and dedicated employee base which had been installed for concert through this period at an estimated cost  including depreciation  of approximately million  during the reason for continuing to incur this significant infrastructure cost was due to the anticipation of significant new revenue streams in and as a result of the signing of an outsourced agreement with at t in august the concert revenue downsizing which resulted in a reduction of approximately million in annual revenues caused a resultant reduction in net income of 
table of contents approximately million 
this is clearly evidenced in the decline in the company s net income and operating cashflow results 
it is also the main reason for the net loss incurred by the company in at t outsourcing contract among many other telecommunications services  at t provides high quality teleconferencing services to large corporate customers in the usa with over four million corporate customers  many of these use teleconferencing services domestically but also have international requirements as at t was previously a percent shareholder in concert and due to the existence of act s established and extensive global service platform built for concert  it was decided that act s worldwide teleconferencing network with established and dedicated local facilities would be an effective way to provide conferencing services to those subsidiaries of american multinationals who are already at t customers in the us but who require conferencing services overseas 
we started implementing this outsource contract in august  and have seen rapid revenue growth since then 
current monthly revenues are at an estimated annualized run rate of approximately million as of january with significant additional potential growth opportunities to come in and the outsource contract requires act to provide detailed levels of quality  sales and service positioning  customer provisioning and comprehensive pricing for a number of different conferencing products  services and applications 
the relationship between both contracting parties is excellent  and in the absence of any presently unknown adverse factors  we expect this revenue stream to grow to an annualized revenue run rate of approximately million by the end of the first year of implementation thereby substantially replacing the lost concert revenues 
revenues will depend on customer usage 
audioconferencing revenues automated voice conferencing volumes continued to grow at a rapid rate for and pricing remained competitive 
most of our us and canadian customers have already made the transition to automated services  and we now expect strong growth in automated services in the european and asian pacific markets over the next few years 
we expect that the growth of automated services at reduced prices will continue unabated  but the emergence of this product line nevertheless has highlighted some fundamental applications whereby operator attended services will continue to be required by our customers 
our strategy remains to provide a broad range of services to our customers which fit their different communications needs 
we expect our automated services to complement our fully attended offering  and vice versa 
attended voice conferencing services remains one of our core business and still accounts for approximately percent of total revenues 
the company is focused on developing new markets and applications for customers in the attended voice conferencing services especially in areas such as training  education and large participant calls 
while we do 
table of contents expect this overall market will grow at a much lower rate over the next few years we also believe that the act growth rate could be faster  as we are one of the specialized  niche players and have the capacity for faster growth internationally 
videoconferencing revenues our videoconferencing revenues tripled over mainly due to the acquisition of two companies  namely picturetel s c videoconferencing division acquired in october and proximity acquired in january although proximity sales were flat  sales by picturetel c renamed act videoconferencing reflected a significant increase in revenues of million due to strong customer acquisition 
as with audioconferencing  we expect to see continued growth in the videoconferencing areas especially as companies continue to reduce travel costs and executives prefer to avoid non essential travel 
in today s uncertain climate with the threat of terrorism and warfare  videoconferencing remains an attractive proposition for high level executives unwilling to travel 
as we are approaching our second year following these two videoconference unit acquisitions  we believe we have identified good opportunities for further cost reduction and network rationalization especially in the telecommunications costs area 
we have also identified opportunities to cross sell our services from audioconferencing to videoconferencing  and vice versa 
we expect that our videoconferencing business will see a strong stimulus for usage as large volume users transition their telecom usage over to the internet thus significantly lowering telecom costs 
internet transmission not only lowers telecom costs for videoconferencing users but also provides higher quality transmission and lower network failure rates 
as transmission costs are fixed  these users are able to utilize videoconferencing services for as long as they need to without incurring the significant additional long distance telephony costs which  up to now  have been a major impediment to the development of videoconferencing 
the much awaited high growth rates in videoconferencing  nevertheless  may be tempered by the emergence of web conferencing applications 
many applications which were previously more suited to a videoconference can now be handled by combining voice and web conferencing at a less expensive price 
we believe therefore that videoconferencing will continue to only be used in situations where it is specifically required by business executives for a specific reason 
web and audioconferencing will be used in most other conferencing situations 
results of operations fiscal year ended december   compared to fiscal year ended december net revenues 
net revenues increased percent to million for the year ended december   compared to million for the percent revenue growth resulted from an increase in video conferencing revenues due to two acquisitions  but was offset by the decline in concert audio conferencing revenues 
concert revenues declined by million or in this was somewhat offset by a million increase in global service channel audioconferencing 
audioconferencing accounted for percent  percent and percent of revenue in  and respectively 
videoconferencing and other revenue grew by million  or in it accounted for the balance of our revenue

gross profit 
gross profit declined percent to million for the year ended december   compared to million for the prior year 
gross profit percentage decreased to percent of net revenues for the year ended december   compared to percent of net revenues for this gross profit decrease reflects the increased volume of higher cost videoconferencing volumes due to the higher network costs associated with videoconferencing 
the decline in gross profit also highlights the loss of concert business which had high margins  and the residual high fixed costs as a result of keeping our telecom network  and our capital and operating infrastructure intact worldwide as discussed above pending implementation of the at t contract 
over time we expect  with the growth of at t services and other volumes plus the further stabilization of our operating costs which is being achieved as well as continual reduction in our video and audio network costs  that our gross margins will eventually improve back towards our target of percent of net revenues 
selling  general and administrative expense 
selling  general and administrative expense for the year ended december  was million or percent of revenue  compared to million or percent of revenue for the percent increase in such expense was incurred mainly as a result of the increase in selling  general and administrative staff arising as a result of our two videoconferencing acquisitions namely  the c division of picturetel and proximity  inc we expect  with continued strong control of our operating expenses  that our selling  general and administrative costs will stabilize during operating income loss 
operating income loss declined by million to a loss of million and reflected the following an overall million reduction in operating income due to the reduction of concert revenues of million  for net savings of million against our operating costs as a result of strict cost control and the cancellation of various discretionary development projects 
a million non cash charge recorded for goodwill impairment offset by the significant savings in operating costs 
interest expense 
net interest expense grew by percent from million to million 
this is due primarily to an increase in debt during the year as well as the addition of debt for acquisitions during provision for income taxes 
provision for income taxes decreased to approximately  from  for the year ended december   compared to  due to reduced taxable income earned by our united kingdom and canada subsidiaries 
we paid no other income taxes due to domestic and international tax loss carry forwards of approximately million

net income loss increased by million for the same reasons discussed under operating income loss  above 

table of contents fiscal year ended december   compared to fiscal year ended december net revenues 
net revenues increased percent to million for the year ended december   compared to million for the percent revenue growth resulted from an increase in conference call volume of percent offset by a shift in product mix from attended conference calls to automated conference calls  which resulted in a lower average revenue per minute 
audioconferencing revenues grew by percent while video  data  internet and other enhanced conferencing services grew by percent due to our acquisition of the picturetel assets

gross profit 
gross profit increased percent to million for the year ended december   compared to million for the prior year 
gross profit percentage decreased to percent of net revenues for the year ended december   compared to percent of net revenues for this gross profit decrease is almost entirely due to the higher volume of videoconferencing  which has lower margins than our traditional voice business due to the higher network costs associated with videoconferencing 
in the fourth quarter of  our videoconferencing network costs exceeded our ongoing acceptable benchmarks  and we are currently in the process of reconfiguring our videoconferencing network to reduce our costs 
this decrease in gross profit percent was offset by some significant economies of scale associated with volume increases in voice conferencing as a result of automation 
selling  general and administrative expense 
selling  general and administrative expense for the year ended december  was million or percent of revenue  compared to million or percent of revenue for the percent increase in such expense was incurred mainly as a result of the percent increase in selling  general and administrative staff from to employees to develop new locations and introduce new products and services associated with internet based and other high speed digital conferencing products 
interest expense 
net interest expense grew by percent from million to million as a result of overall debt and capital leases increasing by million from million in to million in this increase is mainly due to debt associated with the acquisitions completed 
we incurred debt of approximately million for general financing purposes  million on the acquisition of the remaining percent minority interest in act teleconferencing  limited and million for the picturetel acquisition 
during we paid off debt of million and liquidated preferred stock of million 
provision for income taxes 
provision for income taxes increased percent to  for the year ended december   compared to  for  due to increased taxable income earned by our united kingdom subsidiaries and deferred tax

net cash provided by financing activities was million 
we repaid debt of million and received proceeds from the issuance of debt of million 
the company also issued million of preferred stock and repaid million of preferred stock dividends and principal 
at december  we had approximately million in current assets  in relation to million in current liabilities excluding the deferred income of million which is not a cash liability 
we have assessed our cashflow needs for as follows we have significantly cut back our planned capital expenditures for we believe we can generate operating cash flow in a range of million to million during based upon our current revenue run rates and strict cost controls 
we have disclosed our financial model in various press releases and filings and are tracking reasonably closely to this model in early using this financial model and a revenue range of million to million yields the operating cash flow of million to million noted above 
we are in discussions to obtain additional subordinated debt and other preferred equity financings in the million to million range to accelerate the pay down of certain debt items  should we elect to accept the terms of these financings 
we also believe there is additional capacity for approximately million to million in senior debt to be negotiated during which would be secured against our accounts receivable and other fixed telecommunications assets 
we are in discussions with our senior lenders in this regard 
preferred stock dividend payments due the first quarter of were made with a combination of cash and act stock as follows  in cash  and  shares of act stock 
with the expected growth in our business we may also need to seek additional sources of financing which may include additional public or private debt  equity financing by us and or our subsidiaries  or other financing arrangements 
however  there is no assurance 
table of contents that the financing will be available to us and or on acceptable terms should we decide to seek it 
the facilities based teleconferencing service business is a capital intensive business 
our operations have required and will continue to require capital investment for i the purchase and installation of conferencing bridges and other equipment in existing bridging networks and in additional bridging networks to be constructed in new service areas  ii the acquisition and expansion of conferencing platforms currently owned and operated by other companies  and iii the evolution of the platform to support new products  services and technologies 
our expected capital expenditures for general corporate and working capital purposes include i expenditures with respect to our management information system and corporate service support infrastructure and ii operating and administrative expenses with respect to new bridging platforms  networks and debt service 
we plan to make substantial capital investments in connection with plans to construct and develop new bridging networks  as well as for technology upgrades 
expansion of our bridging networks will include the geographic expansion of our existing operations  and we will consider the development of new markets 
in addition  we may acquire existing conferencing companies and their bridging platforms and networks in the future 
occasionally we evaluate potential acquisitions of conferencing assets currently owned and operated by other companies  and expect to continue to do so 
in the event we enter into a definitive agreement with respect to any acquisition  it may require additional financing 
in the event that our plans or assumptions change or prove to be inaccurate  or the foregoing sources of funds prove to be insufficient to fund our growth and operations  or if we complete acquisitions or joint ventures  we will be required to seek additional capital sooner than currently anticipated 
our revenue and costs are dependent upon factors that are not within our control  such as regulatory changes  changes in technology  customer mergers and acquisitions and increased competition 
due to the uncertainty of these and other factors  actual revenue and costs may vary from expected amounts  possibly to a material degree  and such variations are likely to affect the level of our future capital expenditures and expansion plans
