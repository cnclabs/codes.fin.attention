item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the discussion and analysis of the results of operations and financial condition of the company below should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes 
results of operations compared to premium and fee income 
premium and fee income in was million as compared to million in  an increase of 
premiums from core group employee benefit products increased to million in from million in this increase reflects normal growth in employment and salary levels for the company s existing customer base  price increases  and strong production of new business 
core group employee benefit products include group life  disability  excess and large deductible workers compensation  travel accident and dental insurance and self insurance workers compensation bonds 
see business group employee benefit products 
excess workers compensation premiums increased to million in from million in primarily due to improvements in the pricing environment and demand for this product as a result of higher primary workers compensation rates 
sncc was able to obtain significant price increases in connection with its renewals of insurance coverage during  with increases exceeding on a substantial portion of such renewals 
sncc has also been obtaining significant improvements in contract terms  in particular higher sir levels  in these renewals 
sncc has continued to obtain price increases in the range of to on its renewals 
new business production for excess workers compensation products increased to million in from million in and the retention of existing customers was consistent with sncc s goals 
new business production for the company s other core group employee benefit products increased to million in from million in primarily due to the expansion of the company s sales force during and  and the opening of three new sales offices in retention of existing customers for these products also improved during and price increases were implemented for certain disability customers 
non core group employee benefit products include lpts  primary workers compensation  bail bond insurance  workers compensation and property reinsurance  and reinsurance facilities 
see business group employee benefit products and business reinsurance 
premiums from non core group employee benefit products increased to million in from million in primarily due to a higher level of premium from lpts  which are episodic in nature 
deposits from the company s asset accumulation products were million in as compared to million in deposits for these products  which are long term in nature  are recorded as liabilities rather than as premiums 
the company has maintained its disciplined approach to setting the crediting rates offered on its asset accumulation products since market interest rates and the resulting interest rate spreads available to the company on these products remained less favorable throughout and the increase in deposits from the company s asset accumulation products in was higher than expected due to the pullback of certain fixed annuity providers from the wholesale distribution chain and heightened demand for fixed annuity products as a result of adverse conditions in the equity markets 
accordingly  the level of deposits achieved in may not be representative of the level of deposits attainable in net investment income 
net investment income in was million as compared to million in  an increase of 
this increase primarily reflects an increase in average invested assets in  partially offset by a decrease in the tax equivalent weighted average annual yield 
the tax equivalent weighted average annual yield on invested assets was on average invested assets of  million in and on average invested assets of  million in net realized investment losses 
net realized investment losses were million in as compared to million in the company s investment strategy results in periodic sales of securities and  therefore  the recognition of realized investment gains and losses 
the company monitors its investments on an ongoing basis 
when the market value of a security declines below its cost  and such decline is determined in the judgment of management to be other than temporary  the security is written down to fair value  and the decline is reported as a realized investment loss 
in and  the company recognized million and million  respectively  of losses due to the other than temporary declines in the market values of certain fixed maturity and equity securities 
during the same periods  the company recognized million and million  respectively  of net gains on sales of securities 
realized investment losses  net of the related tax benefit  reduced net income by million  or per share  in and by million  or per share  in the losses due to the other than temporary declines in the market values of fixed maturity and equity securities recognized during  which totaled million on an after tax basis  resulted primarily from credit quality related deterioration in the corporate debt markets  and the company may recognize additional losses of this type in the future 
the company anticipates that if certain other existing declines in security values are determined to be other than temporary  it may recognize additional investment losses in the range of million to million  on an after tax basis  with respect to the relevant securities 
however  the extent of any such losses will depend on future market developments and changes in security values  and such losses may exceed or be lower than such range 
the company continuously monitors the affected securities pursuant to its procedures for evaluation for other than temporary impairment in valuation 
see management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations critical accounting policies for a description of these procedures  which take into account a number of factors 
it is not possible to predict the extent of any future changes in value  positive or negative  or the results of the future application of these procedures  with respect to these securities 
there can be no assurance that the company will realize investment gains in the future in an amount sufficient to offset any such losses 
benefits and expenses 
policyholder benefits and expenses were million as compared to million in  an increase of 
this increase primarily reflects the increase in premiums from the company s group employee benefit products discussed above 
benefits and expenses in include a pre tax charge of million for reserve strengthening primarily related to an unusually high number of large losses in the company s excess workers compensation business 
see compared to benefits and expenses 
the combined ratio loss ratio plus expense ratio for the company s group employee benefits segment was in and excluding the reserve strengthening in the combined ratio in reflects the higher levels of reserves which have been established for the company s excess workers compensation products due to the high number of large losses in this combined ratio also reflects the large amount of new business production from the company s other core group employee benefit products  for which initial reserves have been set at higher levels until actual loss experience emerges 
the higher level of premium from lpts  which carry a higher loss ratio  also contributed to the higher combined ratio in interest expense and extraordinary loss gain 
interest expense was million in as compared to million in  a decrease of million 
this decrease was primarily a result of the company s repurchase of million liquidation amount of the capital securities in the open market  which occurred on various dates during the first nine months of  and a lower weighted average borrowing rate under the company s revolving credit facilities 
in addition  the company had a lower amount of borrowings outstanding during the year ended under its senior notes and sig s senior notes the sig senior notes due may in june  the company also repurchased million aggregate principal amount of the senior notes 
the company recognized an extraordinary gain of million  net of income tax expense of million  in connection with the repurchases of the capital securities and senior notes 
in the second quarter of  the company repurchased million aggregate principal amount of the senior notes  resulting in an extraordinary loss of million  net of an income tax benefit of million 
income tax expense benefit 
income tax expense was million in as compared to an income tax benefit of million in the income tax benefits attributable to net realized investment losses were million and million in and  respectively 
the income tax benefit in was also attributable to the reserve strengthening charge 
the company s effective tax rate excluding net realized investment losses and the reserve strengthening was in and in income before extraordinary loss gain 
management believes the concept of operating earnings is informative when analyzing the company s operating trends and in comparing the company s performance with that of other companies in its industry 
operating earnings exclude discretionary or nonrecurring income or loss items such as realized investment gains and losses and extraordinary items 
investment gains and losses may be realized based on management s decision to dispose of an investment or management s judgment that a decline in the market value of an investment is other than temporary 
therefore  realized investment gains and losses do not represent elements of the company s ongoing earnings capacity 
however  operating earnings should not be considered a substitute for net income as an indication of the company s overall performance and may not be calculated in the same manner as similarly titled captions in other companies financial statements 
operating earnings for the company  consisting of income before extraordinary loss gain adjusted to exclude realized investment losses net of the related income tax benefit  were million  or per share  in as compared to million  or per share  in the increase in operating earnings in the current period is attributable to the decrease in interest expense million after taxes  and charges in the period for goodwill amortization million after taxes and reserve strengthening million after taxes see compared to benefits and expenses 
excluding the effects of the reserve strengthening and goodwill amortization in  income from group employee benefit products increased in as compared to equivalent shares attributable to in the money stock options  which totaled million for  were not considered in the calculation of the per share amount since the inclusion of these equivalent shares would have diluted the loss before extraordinary gain 
compared to premium and fee income 
premium and fee income in was million as compared to million in premiums from core group employee benefit products increased to million in from million in this increase reflects normal growth in employment and salary levels for the company s existing customer base  price increases  production of new business and improved persistency 
core group employee benefit products include group life  disability  excess and large deductible workers compensation  travel accident and dental insurance and self insurance workers compensation bonds 
excess workers compensation premiums increased to million in from million in primarily due to increases in the pricing environment and demand for this product due to higher primary workers compensation rates and disruption in the workers compensation marketplace as a result of difficulties experienced by some competitors  particularly during these trends accelerated during the second half of as sharply higher primary workers compensation rates and rising reinsurance costs due to the terrorist attacks on the world trade center increased the demand for self insurance 
as a result  the demand for excess workers compensation products and the rates for such products increased 
new business production for the company s other group employee benefit products was very strong during  particularly during the fourth quarter  primarily due to a increase in the company s sales force during retention of existing customers for these products also improved during and price increases were implemented for certain disability customers 
non core group employee benefit products include lpts  primary workers compensation  bail bond insurance  workers compensation and property reinsurance  and reinsurance facilities 
premiums from non core group employee benefit products decreased to million in from million in primarily due to the company s termination of its participations in the reinsurance facilities in which it had historically participated and a lower level of premium from lpts  which are episodic in nature 
deposits from the company s asset accumulation products were million in as compared to million in deposits for these products  which are long term in nature  are recorded as liabilities rather than as premiums 
in the first quarter of  the company reduced the crediting rates offered on its asset accumulation products due to the decline in market interest rates and the resulting interest rate spreads available to the company on these products 
accordingly  the company experienced a lower level of production from its asset accumulation business in as compared to net investment income 
net investment income in was million as compared to million in the tax equivalent weighted average annual yield on invested assets was on average invested assets of  million in and on average invested assets of  million in the decrease in investment income reflects the company s liquidation during the fourth quarter of of a substantial majority of the investments of its investment subsidiaries 
the proceeds from these sales were used to repay million of outstanding borrowings under the company s revolving credit facilities in the first half of  to repurchase million liquidation amount of the capital securities during the first nine months of and to repurchase million principal amount of the senior notes in june net realized investment losses 
net realized investment losses were million in as compared to million in the company s investment strategy results in periodic sales of securities and  therefore  the recognition of realized investment gains and losses 
the company monitors its investments on an ongoing basis 
when the market value of a security declines below its cost  and such decline is determined in the judgment of management to be other than temporary  the security is written down to fair value 
in  the company recognized million of losses due to the other than temporary declines in the market value of certain fixed maturity and equity securities 
in  the company realized losses of million related to the liquidation of the investments of its investment subsidiaries and million on closed us treasury futures and option contracts 
see note c to the consolidated financial statements 
realized investment losses  net of the related tax benefit  reduced net income by million  or per share  in and by million  or per share  in benefits and expenses 
policyholder benefits and expenses were million as compared to million in  an increase of 
benefits and expenses in include a pre tax charge of million for reserve strengthening primarily related to an unusually high number of large losses in the company s excess workers compensation business 
prior to  sncc s historical average for losses exceeding million in its excess workers compensation products was one to two per year 
in  however  the company experienced seven such losses  including two losses as a result of the terrorist attacks on the world trade center 
the case reserves for these seven losses totaled million  including million attributable to the world trade center attacks 
though the company believed that the high number of large losses in was unlikely to recur  the company added million to its reserve for ibnr losses since its method of estimating ibnr reserves is based on past experience 
the company experienced only one large loss from its excess workers compensation business in the company also added million to its long term disability ibnr reserves for potential mental and nervous disability claims related to the world trade center attacks 
this reserve strengthening charge reduced net income in by million  or per share 
the increase in premiums from the company s core group employee benefit products also contributed to the increase in benefits and expenses in the combined ratio loss ratio plus expense ratio for the company s group employee benefits segment was excluding the reserve strengthening in and in benefits and interest credited on asset accumulation products increased by million in principally due to an increase in average funds under management from million in to million in  partially offset by a decrease in the weighted average annual crediting rate on asset accumulation products from in to in interest expense and extraordinary gain 
interest expense was million in as compared to million in  a decrease of million 
this decrease was primarily a result of the company s repayment of million of outstanding borrowings under its revolving credit facilities during the first half of and the repurchase of million liquidation amount of the capital securities in the open market  which occurred on various dates during the first nine months of in addition  the company repurchased million principal amount of the senior notes in june the company recognized an extraordinary gain of million  net of income tax expense of million  in connection with these repurchases 
income tax benefit 
the income tax benefit was million in and million in and was primarily attributable to the recognition of investment losses and  in  the reserve strengthening 
the company s effective tax rate excluding net realized investment losses and the reserve strengthening was in and in loss before extraordinary gain 
management believes the concept of operating earnings is informative when analyzing the company s operating trends and in comparing the company s performance with that of other companies in its industry 
operating earnings exclude discretionary or nonrecurring income or loss items such as realized investment gains and losses and extraordinary items 
investment gains and losses may be realized based on management s decision to dispose of an investment or management s judgment that a decline in the market value of an investment is other than temporary 
therefore  realized investment gains and losses do not represent elements of the company s ongoing earnings capacity 
however  operating earnings should not be considered a substitute for net income as an indication of the company s overall performance and may not be calculated in the same manner as similarly titled captions in other companies financial statements 
operating earnings for the company  consisting of income before extraordinary gain adjusted to exclude realized investment losses net of the related income tax benefit  were million  or per share  in as compared to million  or per share  in the decrease in operating earnings is primarily attributable to the after tax charge for reserve strengthening totaling million  or per share see compared to benefits and expenses 
equivalent shares attributable to in the money stock options  which totaled million and million for and  respectively  were not considered in the calculation of these per share amounts since the inclusion of these equivalent shares would have diluted the loss from continuing operations 
the decrease in operating earnings is also attributable to the liquidation during the fourth quarter of of investments of the company s investment subsidiaries see compared to net investment income 
liquidity and capital resources general 
the company had approximately million of financial resources available at the holding company level at december   which was primarily comprised of investments in the common stock of its investment subsidiaries 
the assets of the investment subsidiaries are primarily invested in fixed maturity securities and balances with independent investment managers 
in december  the company obtained a new million revolving credit facility with a group of lenders comprised of major banking institutions  which replaced the existing million revolving credit facilities scheduled to expire in april this facility  which expires in december  is subject to certain restrictions and financial covenants considered ordinary for this type of credit agreement 
they include  among others  the maintenance of certain financial ratios  minimum statutory surplus and rbc requirements for rslic and sncc  and certain investment  indebtedness  dividend and stock repurchase limitations 
at december   the company had million of borrowings available to it under its new revolving credit facility 
other sources of liquidity at the holding company level include dividends paid from subsidiaries  primarily generated from operating cash flows and investments 
during  the company s life insurance subsidiaries and sncc will be permitted  without prior regulatory approval  to make dividend payments of million and million  respectively 
the life insurance subsidiaries and sncc may also pay additional dividends with the requisite regulatory approvals 
see business regulation 
in general  dividends from the company s non insurance subsidiaries are not subject to regulatory or other restrictions 
the company s current liquidity needs  in addition to funding its operating expenses  include principal and interest payments on outstanding borrowings under its revolving credit facility  the senior notes  the sig senior notes and the subordinated notes and distributions on the capital securities 
during the second quarter of  the company repurchased million aggregate principal amount of the senior notes 
the senior notes mature in their entirety in october and are not subject to any sinking fund requirements nor are they redeemable prior to maturity 
a million annual principal installment was paid on the sig senior notes in may  and the remaining million of such notes will mature in their entirety in may the subordinated notes mature in their entirety in june the junior subordinated debentures underlying the capital securities are not redeemable prior to march  see note e to the consolidated financial statements 
the company s shelf registration statement for the sale  from time to time  of securities was declared effective by the securities and exchange commission on may  this shelf registration increased the company s existing million shelf registration to an amount of up to million of proceeds 
subject to market conditions  the company may refinance its revolving credit facility and its senior notes prior to maturity through the issuance of debt securities covered by the shelf registration 
however  no assurance can be given that such an offering will be commenced or completed 
to mitigate the risk of interest rates rising before such refinancing could be completed  the company entered into a treasury rate lock agreement  with a notional amount of million  pursuant to which the company will receive or make a single payment at the conclusion of the agreement  depending on the extent to which the market yield on the specified us treasury security rises or falls over the term of the agreement 
the agreement was entered into in september with a term of one year 
any gains or losses on the treasury rate lock agreement would be deferred and amortized as a component of interest expense over the term of any debt securities issued in the refinancing  or recognized in income if  and at the time  the company concludes the refinancing is improbable 
sources of liquidity available to the company on a parent company only basis  including the undistributed earnings of its subsidiaries  additional borrowings available under the company s revolving credit facility and borrowings  if any  available pursuant to any debt obligations issued in the future  are expected to exceed the company s current and long term cash requirements 
the company from time to time engages in discussions with respect to acquiring blocks of business and insurance and financial services companies  any of which could  if consummated  be material to the company s operations 
the principal liquidity requirements of the company s insurance subsidiaries are their contractual obligations to policyholders and other financing sources 
the primary sources of funding for these obligations  in addition to operating earnings  are the marketable investments included in the investment portfolios of these subsidiaries 
the company believes that these sources of funding will be adequate for its insurance subsidiaries to satisfy on both a short term and long term basis these contractual obligations throughout their estimated or stated period 
cash flows 
operating activities increased cash by million in operating activities in  which include million of cash provided by the liquidation of trading account securities and million of funds received from oracle re for the commutation of various reinsurance agreements that the company had entered into with oracle re in  increased cash by million 
see note q to the consolidated financial statements 
operating activities increased cash by million in and are net of million of funds returned to a ceding insurer in connection with the rescission of a reinsurance transaction  million of cash used by trading account activities  and a net cash payment of million related to the cession by the company of group employee benefit product reserves 
investments 
the company s overall investment strategy emphasizes safety and liquidity  while seeking the best available return  by focusing on  among other things  managing the company s interest sensitive assets and liabilities and seeking to minimize the company s exposure to fluctuations in interest rates 
the company s investment portfolio  which totaled  million at december   primarily consists of investments in fixed maturity securities and short term investments 
the market value of the company s investment portfolio  in relation to its amortized cost  improved by million during  before related changes in the cost of business acquired of million and the income tax provision of million 
the net investment losses recognized during  which are discussed above  contributed to the improvement in the net unrealized appreciation in the investment portfolio 
the weighted average credit rating of the company s fixed maturity portfolio as rated by standard poor s corporation was aa at december  while the investment grade rating of the company s fixed maturity portfolio addresses credit risk  it does not address other risks  such as prepayment and extension risks  which are discussed below 
at december   approximately of the company s total invested assets were comprised of corporate fixed maturity securities 
eighty seven percent of the company s corporate fixed maturity portfolio  based on fair values  has been rated investment grade by nationally recognized statistical organizations 
investment grade corporate fixed maturity securities are distributed among the various rating categories as follows aaa  aa  a  and bbb 
corporate fixed maturity securities subject the company to credit risk and  to a lesser extent  interest rate risk 
to reduce its exposure to corporate credit risk  the company diversifies its investments across economic sectors  industry classes and issuers 
mortgage backed securities comprised of the company s total invested assets at december  ninety seven percent of the company s mortgage backed securities portfolio  based on fair values  has been rated as investment grade by nationally recognized statistical organizations 
mortgage backed securities subject the company to a degree of interest rate risk  including prepayment and extension risk  which is generally a function of the sensitivity of each security s underlying collateral to prepayments under varying interest rate environments and the repayment priority of the securities in the particular securitization structure 
the company seeks to limit the extent of this risk by emphasizing the more predictable payment classes and securities with stable collateral 
the company  through its insurance subsidiaries  maintains a program in which investments are financed using advances from various federal home loan banks 
the company has utilized this program to manage the duration of its liabilities and to earn spread income  which is the difference between the financing cost and the earnings from the investments purchased with those funds 
at december   the company had outstanding advances of million  of which million were obtained during the advances  of which million were obtained at a fixed rate and million were obtained at a variable rate  have a weighted average term to maturity of years 
a total of million of these advances will mature at various times during in addition  the company has utilized reverse repurchase agreements  futures and option contracts and interest rate swap contracts from time to time in connection with its investment strategy 
these transactions require the company to maintain securities or cash on deposit with the applicable counterparty as collateral 
as the market value of the collateral or contracts changes  the company may be required to deposit additional collateral or be entitled to have a portion of the collateral returned to it 
the types and amounts of investments made by the company s insurance subsidiaries are subject to the insurance laws and regulations of their respective states of domicile 
each of these states has comprehensive investment regulations 
in addition  the company s revolving credit facility and  as to sncc  the sig senior notes also contain limitations  with which the company is currently in compliance in all material respects  on the composition of the company s investment portfolio 
the company also continually monitors its investment portfolio and attempts to ensure that the risks associated with concentrations of investments in either a particular sector of the market or a single entity are limited 
asset liability management and market risk 
because the company s primary assets and liabilities are financial in nature  the company s consolidated financial position and earnings are subject to risks resulting from changes in interest rates 
the company manages this risk by active portfolio management focusing on minimizing its exposure to fluctuations in interest rates by matching its invested assets and related liabilities and by periodically adjusting the crediting rates on its annuity products 
in addition  the company  at times  has utilized exchange traded futures and option contracts to reduce the risk associated with changes in the value of its fixed maturity portfolio due to changes in the interest rate environment and to reduce the risk associated with changes in interest rates in connection with anticipated securities purchases and debt refinancing 
at december   the company had no outstanding futures and option contracts or interest rate swap agreements other than the treasury rate lock agreement discussed above see liquidity and capital resources general 
the company regularly analyzes the results of its asset liability matching through cash flow analysis and duration matching under multiple interest rate scenarios 
these analyses enable the company to measure the potential gain or loss in fair value of its interest rate sensitive financial instruments due to hypothetical changes in interest rates 
based on these analyses  if interest rates were to immediately increase by from their year end levels  the fair value of the company s interest sensitive assets  net of corresponding changes in the fair value of cost of business acquired and insurance and investment related liabilities  would decline by approximately million at december  as compared to a decline of approximately million at december  these analyses incorporate numerous assumptions and estimates and assume no changes in the composition of the company s investment portfolio in reaction to such interest rate changes 
consequently  the results of this analysis will likely be materially different from the actual changes experienced under given interest rate scenarios 
the company manages the composition of its borrowed capital by considering factors such as the ratio of borrowed capital to total capital  future debt requirements  the interest rate environment and other market conditions 
approximately of the company s corporate debt was issued at fixed interest rates 
a hypothetical decrease in market interest rates would cause a corresponding million increase in the fair value of the company s fixed rate corporate debt at december  as compared to an increase of million at december  in addition  a hypothetical decrease in market interest rates would cause a corresponding million increase in the fair value of the company s treasury rate lock agreement  which was entered into in in anticipation of refinancing the company s credit facility and its senior notes 
an increase in the fair value of such agreement would increase the company s unrealized loss thereon 
because interest expense on the company s floating rate corporate debt fluctuates as prevailing interest rates change  changes in market interest rates would not materially affect its fair value 
critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires the company s management  in some instances  to make judgments about the application of these principles 
the amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period could differ materially from the amounts reported if different conditions existed or different judgments were utilized 
management s judgment is most critical in the estimation of its liabilities for future policy benefits and unpaid claims and claim expenses and its assets for cost of business acquired and in the valuation of its investments 
a discussion of how management applies these critical accounting policies follows 
future policy benefits and unpaid claims and claim expenses 
the company establishes reserves for future policy benefits and unpaid claims and claim expenses relating to its insurance products 
these reserves  which totaled  million at december   are calculated using various generally recognized actuarial methodologies and are based upon assumptions that management believes are appropriate and which vary by type of product 
external actuarial experts also review the company s methodologies  assumptions and the resulting reserves 
the company s projected ultimate insurance liabilities and associated reserves are estimates  which are subject to variability 
this variability arises because the factors and events affecting the ultimate liability for claims have not all taken place  and thus cannot be evaluated with certainty 
the estimation process is complex and involves information obtained from company specific and industry wide data  as well as general economic information 
the most significant assumptions made in the estimation process for future policy benefits relate to mortality  morbidity  claim termination and discount rates 
the reserves for unpaid claims and claim expenses are determined on an individual basis for reported claims and estimates of ibnr losses are developed on the basis of past experience 
the most significant assumptions made in the estimation process for unpaid claims and claim expenses are the trend in loss costs  the expected frequency and severity of claims  changes in the timing of the reporting of losses from the loss date to the notification date  and expected costs to settle unpaid claims 
the assumptions vary based on the year the claim is incurred 
at december   disability and excess workers compensation reserves for unpaid claims and claim expenses with a carrying value of million have been discounted at a weighted average rate of  with the rates ranging from to 
disability reserves for unpaid claims and claim expenses are discounted using interest rate assumptions based upon projected portfolio yield rates for the assets supporting the liabilities 
the assets selected to support these liabilities produce cash flows that are intended to match the timing and amount of anticipated claim and claim expense payments 
excess workers compensation claim reserves are discounted using interest rate assumptions based on the risk free rate of return for us government securities with a duration comparable to the expected duration and payment pattern of the claims at the time the claims are settled 
the rates used to discount reserves are determined annually 
the methods and assumptions used to establish reserves for future policy benefits and unpaid claims and claim expenses are continually reviewed and updated based on current circumstances  and any resulting adjustments are reflected in earnings currently 
there have been no material changes in the actuarial assumptions and or methods from those used in the previous periods other than those resulting from the unusually high number of large losses in the company s excess workers compensation business in deferred acquisition costs 
costs related to the acquisition of new insurance business  such as commissions  certain costs of policy issuance and underwriting  and certain sales office expenses  are deferred when incurred 
the unamortized balance of these deferred acquisition costs is included in cost of business acquired on the consolidated balance sheet 
deferred acquisition costs related to group life  disability and accident products  which totaled million at december   are amortized over the anticipated premium paying period of the related policies in proportion to the ratio of the present value of annual expected premium income to the present value of the total expected premium income 
deferred acquisition costs related to casualty insurance products  which totaled million at december   are amortized over the period in which the related premium is earned 
deferred acquisition costs related to annuity products  which totaled million at december   are amortized over the anticipated lives of the policies in relation to the present value of estimated gross profits from such policies surrender charges and mortality  investment and expense margins 
the amortization is a constant percentage of estimated gross profits based on the ratio of the present value of amounts deferred as compared to the present value of estimated gross profits 
adjustments are made each year to reflect the actual gross profits to date as compared to assumed experience and any changes in the remaining expected future gross profits 
the unamortized balance of deferred policy acquisition costs related to certain asset accumulation products is adjusted for the impact on estimated future gross profits as if net unrealized appreciation and depreciation on available for sale securities had been realized at the balance sheet date 
the impact of this adjustment  net of the related income tax expense or benefit  is included in net unrealized appreciation and depreciation as a component of other comprehensive income in shareholders equity 
deferred acquisition costs are charged to current earnings to the extent that it is determined that future premiums or estimated gross profits will not be adequate to cover the amounts deferred 
the amortization of deferred acquisition costs totaled million  million and million in  and  respectively 
investments 
investments are primarily carried at fair value with unrealized appreciation and depreciation included as a component of other comprehensive income in shareholders equity  net of the related income tax benefit or expense and the related adjustment to cost of business acquired 
ninety seven percent of the company s fixed maturity and equity securities portfolio are actively traded in a liquid market or have other liquidity mechanisms 
securities acquired through private placements  which are not actively traded in a liquid market and do not have other mechanisms for their sale  totaled million at december  the company estimates the fair value for these securities primarily by comparison to similar securities with quoted market prices 
if quotes are not available on similar securities  the company estimates fair value based on recent purchases or sales of similar securities or other internally prepared valuations 
key assumptions used in this process include the level of risk free interest rates  risk premiums  and performance of underlying collateral  if applicable 
all such investments are classified as available for sale 
the company s ability to liquidate these investments in a timely manner  if necessary  may be adversely impacted by the lack of an actively traded market 
historically  the company has not realized amounts on dispositions of non marketable investments that varied materially from the amounts estimated by the company under this valuation methodology 
the company believes that its estimates reasonably reflect the fair value of these securities  however  had there been an active market for these securities during the applicable reporting period  the market prices may have been materially different than the amounts reported 
declines in the fair value of investments that are considered in the judgment of management to be other than temporary are reported as realized investment losses 
the company evaluates  among other things  the financial position and prospects of the issuer  conditions in the issuer s industry and geographic area  liquidity of the investment  changes in the amount or timing of expected future cash flows from the investment  and recent downgrades of the issuer by a rating agency to determine if and when a decline in the fair value of an investment below amortized cost is other than temporary 
the length of time and extent to which the fair value of the investment is lower than its amortized cost and the company s ability and intent to retain the investment to allow for any anticipated recovery in the investment s fair value are also considered 
in and  the company recognized losses totaling million and million  respectively  for the other than temporary decline in the value of certain securities 
these losses were recognized as a result of events that occurred in the respective periods  such as downgrades in an issuer s credit ratings  deteriorating financial results of issuers  adverse changes in the amount and timing of estimated future cash flows from securities and the impact of the recessionary economic environment on issuers financial positions 
investment grade and non investment grade fixed maturity securities comprised and  respectively  of the company s total investment portfolio at december  gross unrealized appreciation and gross unrealized depreciation  before the related income tax expense or benefit and the related adjustment to cost of business acquired  attributable to investment grade fixed maturity securities totaled million and million  respectively  at december  gross unrealized appreciation and gross unrealized depreciation  before the related income tax expense or benefit and the related adjustment to cost of business acquired  attributable to non investment grade fixed maturity securities totaled million and million  respectively  at december  unrealized appreciation and depreciation  net of the related income tax expense or benefit and the related adjustment to cost of business acquired  has been reflected on the company s balance sheet as a component of other comprehensive income loss 
the company anticipates that if certain existing declines in security values are determined to be other than temporary  it may recognize additional investment losses in the range of million to million pre tax million to million on an after tax basis with respect to the relevant securities 
however  the extent of any such losses will depend on future market developments and changes in security values  and such losses may exceed or be lower than such range 
it is not possible to predict the extent of any future changes in value  positive or negative  or the results of the future application of the company s procedures for the evaluation of other than temporary impairment in valuation 
there can be no assurance that the company will realize investment gains in the future in an amount sufficient to offset any such losses 
forward looking statements and cautionary statements regarding certain factors that may affect future results in connection with  and because it desires to take advantage of  the safe harbor provisions of the private securities litigation reform act of  the company cautions readers regarding certain forward looking statements in the above management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations and elsewhere in this form k and in any other statement made by  or on behalf of  the company  whether in future filings with the securities and exchange commission or otherwise 
forward looking statements are statements not based on historical information and which relate to future operations  strategies  financial results  prospects  outlooks or other developments 
some forward looking statements may be identified by the use of terms such as expects  believes  anticipates  intends  judgment or other similar expressions 
forward looking statements are necessarily based upon estimates and assumptions that are inherently subject to significant business  economic  competitive and other uncertainties and contingencies  many of which are beyond the company s control and many of which  with respect to future business decisions  are subject to change 
examples of such uncertainties and contingencies include  among other important factors  those affecting the insurance industry generally  such as the economic and interest rate environment  federal and state legislative and regulatory developments  including but not limited to changes in financial services and tax laws and regulations  market pricing and competitive trends relating to insurance products and services  acts of terrorism or war  and the availability and cost of reinsurance  and those relating specifically to the company s business  such as the level of its insurance premiums and fee income  the claims experience  persistency and other factors affecting the profitability of its insurance products  the performance of its investment portfolio and changes in the company s investment strategy  acquisitions of companies or blocks of business  and ratings by major rating organizations of its insurance subsidiaries 
these uncertainties and contingencies can affect actual results and could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed in any forward looking statements made by  or on behalf of  the company 
certain of these uncertainties and contingencies are described in more detail in the remainder of this section 
the company disclaims any obligation to update forward looking information 
reserves established for future policy benefits and claims may prove inadequate 
the company s reserves for future policy benefits and unpaid claims and claim expenses are estimates 
see critical accounting policies future policy benefits and unpaid claims and claim expenses for a description of the most significant assumptions used in the estimation process 
these estimates are subject to variability  since the factors and events affecting the ultimate liability for claims have not all taken place  and thus cannot be evaluated with certainty 
moreover  under the actuarial methodologies discussed previously  these estimates are subject to reevaluation based on developing trends with respect to the company s loss experience 
such trends may emerge over longer periods of time  and changes in such trends cannot necessarily be identified or predicted at any given time by reference to current claims experience  whether favorable or unfavorable 
if the company s actual loss experience is different from the company s assumptions or estimates  the company s reserves could be inadequate 
in such event  the company s results of operations  liquidity or financial condition could be materially adversely affected 
the market values of the company s investments fluctuate 
the market values of the company s investments vary depending on economic and market conditions  including interest rates  and such values can decline as a result of changes in such conditions 
increasing interest rates or a widening in the spread between interest rates available on us treasury securities and corporate debt  for example  will typically have an adverse impact on the market values of the fixed maturity securities in the company s investment portfolio 
if interest rates decline  the company generally achieves a lower overall rate of return on investments of cash generated from the company s operations 
in addition  in the event that investments are called or mature in a declining interest rate environment  the company may be unable to reinvest the proceeds in securities with comparable interest rates 
the company may also be required or determine in the future to sell certain investments at a price and a time when the market value of such investments is less than the book value of such investments 
declines in the fair value of investments that are considered in the judgment of management to be other than temporary are reported as realized investment losses 
see critical accounting policies investments for a description of management s evaluation process 
the company has experienced and may in the future experience losses from other than temporary declines in security values 
such losses are recorded as realized investment losses in the income statement 
see results of operations compared to the company s investment strategy exposes the company to default and other risks 
the management of the company s investment portfolio is an important component of the company s profitability since a substantial portion of the company s operating income is generated from the difference between the yield achieved on invested assets and  in the case of asset accumulation products  the interest credited on policyholder funds and  in the case of all of the company s other products  the discount rate used to calculate the related reserves 
see liquidity and capital resources investments for a description of the company s investment portfolio and strategy 
the company is subject to the risk that the issuers of the fixed maturity securities the company owns will default on principal and interest payments 
a major economic downturn or any of the various other factors that affect issuers abilities to pay could result in issuer defaults 
because the company s investments consist primarily of fixed maturity securities and short term investments  such defaults could materially adversely affect the company s results of operations  liquidity or financial condition 
the company continually monitors its investment portfolio and attempts to ensure that the risks associated with concentrations of investments in either a particular sector of the market or a single entity are limited 
the company s financial position exposes the company to interest rate risks 
because the company s primary assets and liabilities are financial in nature  the company s consolidated financial position and earnings are subject to risks resulting from changes in interest rates 
the company manages this risk by active portfolio management focusing on minimizing its exposure to fluctuations in interest rates by matching its invested assets and related liabilities and by periodically adjusting the crediting rates on its annuity products 
see liquidity and capital resources asset liability management and market risk 
the company s ability to reduce its exposure to risks depends on the availability and cost of reinsurance 
the company transfers its exposure to some risks through reinsurance arrangements with other insurance and reinsurance companies 
under the company s reinsurance arrangements  another insurer assumes a specified portion of the company s losses and loss adjustment expenses in exchange for a specified portion of policy premiums 
the availability  amount  cost and terms of reinsurance may vary significantly based on market conditions 
any decrease in the amount of the company s reinsurance will increase the company s risk of loss 
furthermore  the company is subject to credit risk with respect to reinsurance 
the company obtains reinsurance primarily through indemnity reinsurance transactions in which the company is still liable for the transferred risks if the reinsurers fail to meet their financial obligations 
such failures could materially affect the company s results of operations  liquidity or financial condition 
some reinsurers experienced significant losses related to the terrorist events of september  as a result  higher prices and less favorable terms and conditions are presently being offered in the reinsurance market 
also  there has been significantly reduced availability of reinsurance covering risks such as terrorist and catastrophic events 
accordingly  substantially all of the company s coverages of this nature were discontinued during there can be no assurance that the company will be able to obtain such coverages on acceptable terms  if at all  in the future 
however  under the terrorism act  the federal government will pay of the company s insured loss from property and casualty products above the company s annual deductible 
see business group employee benefit products 
the insurance business is a heavily regulated industry 
the company s insurance subsidiaries  like other insurance companies  are highly regulated by state insurance authorities in the states in which they are domiciled and the other states in which they conduct business 
such regulations  among other things  limit the amount of dividends and other payments that can be made by such subsidiaries without prior regulatory approval and impose restrictions on the amount and type of investments such subsidiaries may have 
these regulations also affect many other aspects of the company s insurance subsidiaries businesses  including  for example  rbc requirements  various reserve requirements  the terms  conditions and manner of sale and marketing of insurance products and the form and content of required financial statements 
these regulations are intended to protect policyholders rather than investors 
the ability of the company s insurance subsidiaries to continue to conduct their businesses is dependent upon the maintenance of their licenses in these various states 
from time to time  increased scrutiny has been placed upon the insurance regulatory framework  and a number of state legislatures have considered or enacted legislative measures that alter  and in many cases increase  state authority to regulate insurance companies 
in addition to legislative initiatives of this type  the national association of insurance commissioners and insurance regulators are continuously involved in a process of reexamining existing laws and regulations and their application to insurance companies 
furthermore  while the federal government currently does not directly regulate the insurance business  federal legislation and administrative policies in a number of areas  such as employee benefits regulation  age  sex and disability based discrimination  financial services regulation and federal taxation  can significantly affect the insurance business 
it is not possible to predict the future impact of changing regulation on the operations of the company and those of its insurance subsidiaries 
the company s insurance subsidiaries can also be required  under solvency or guaranty laws of most states in which they do business  to pay assessments to fund policyholder losses or liabilities of insurance companies that become insolvent 
the financial services industry is highly competitive 
the company competes with numerous other insurance and financial services companies 
many of these organizations have substantially greater assets  higher ratings from rating agencies  larger and more diversified portfolios of insurance products and larger agency sales operations 
competition in asset accumulation product markets is also encountered from the expanding number of banks  securities brokerage firms and other financial intermediaries marketing alternative savings products  such as mutual funds  traditional bank investments and retirement funding alternatives 
the company may be adversely impacted by a decline in the ratings of the company s insurance subsidiaries 
ratings with respect to claims paying ability and financial strength have become an increasingly important factor impacting the competitive position of insurance companies 
each of the rating agencies reviews its ratings of companies periodically and there can be no assurance that current ratings will be maintained in the future 
claims paying and financial strength ratings are based upon factors relevant to policyowners and are not directed toward protection of investors 
downgrades in the ratings of the company s insurance subsidiaries could adversely affect sales of their products and could have a material adverse effect on the results of the company s operations
