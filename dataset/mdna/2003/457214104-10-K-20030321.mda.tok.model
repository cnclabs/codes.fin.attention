actual results could differ materially from those currently anticipated as a result of a number of factors  including  but not limited to  the risks and uncertainties discussed under the caption other factors to be considered in part i of this report 
given these uncertainties  current or prospective investors are cautioned not to place undue reliance on any such forward looking statements

general we are a biopharmaceutical company focused on the diagnosis and treatment of gastrointestinal disorders  including colon cancer  irritable bowel syndrome  or ibs  and inflammatory bowel disease  or ibd 
our development strategy has been to acquire late stage drug candidates with short time lines to commercialization 
our current product portfolio includes visicol tm  ibstat tm  colirest tm and hematrol tm 
with the exception of our february agreement to market and sell ibstat tm  we acquired the rights to each of our products and product candidates in we have funded operations primarily from the proceeds of public and private placements of securities 
we have incurred net losses in each year since our inception in at december   our accumulated deficit was approximately million 
critical accounting policies and practices in cautionary advice regarding disclosures about critical accounting policies sec release no 
 december   the sec advised registrants to provide more information about a company s most critical accounting policies  ie  the specific accounting policies that have the most impact on a company s results and require the most difficult  subjective or complex judgments by management 
we have identified the following accounting policies that may constitute critical accounting policies  under the guidance provided by this release 
o stock based compensation 
it is our policy  which is consistent with most public company policies  to apply accounting principles board opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  to account for our stock option plans rather than statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for stock based compensation 
had we applied sfas no 
 our net loss for the years ended december and  the six months ended december  and the year ended june  would have been increased by approximately    and  respectively see note to the footnotes to our financial statements accompanying this report 
o product returns 
it is our policy to estimate and record an allowance for future product returns in connection with our sales of visicol tm 
we have applied a return rate to our unit sales to provide this allowance under our product return policy 
this return rate is calculated based on actual return experience and our monitoring of distribution channels taking into account the expiration dating of visicol tm 
the product return rate is periodically updated to reflect actual experience and changes to other factors affecting future product returns 
o deferred taxes 
in assessing the reliability of deferred tax assets  management considers whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
the ultimate realization of the deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the period in which those temporary differences become deductible 
management considers the scheduled reversal of deferred tax liabilities  projected future taxable income and projections for future taxable income over the periods in which the deferred tax asset items are deductible 
management believes that it is not likely that the company will realize the benefits of these deductible differences 
at december   management has concluded that a full valuation allowance is necessary for deferred tax assets

research and development expenses fluctuated from the fiscal year ended june  through fiscal year ended june  due to changes in manufacturing development expenses and clinical and preclinical testing costs associated with visicol tm  hematrol tm  colirest tm and our thrombospondin technology 
more specifically  the decrease in research and development expenses from fiscal year ended june  to fiscal year ended june  of  was principally due to the reduction in clinical development costs being partially offset by increases in costs associated with manufacturing development and nda submission costs for visicol tm 
general and administrative expenses amounted to  and  for the years ended june  and  respectively 
the decrease in general and administrative expenses was due to reduced amortization of deferred compensation from options previously granted to certain executive officers of  in fiscal year ended june   as compared to  for the fiscal year ended june  this decrease was offset by an increase in marketing costs and an increase in head count in fiscal year ended june  a one time charge resulted from a separation agreement with the former president and chief operating officer due to his resignation from the company in november the contract required the immediate vesting of all outstanding unvested options  which resulted in a non cash charge of  and the continuation of his salary and other benefits for a period of several months 
this resulted in an additional charge of approximately  the decrease in interest income of  from fiscal year ended june  to fiscal year ended june  was due to earnings on a lower investment balance as compared to the previous year  partially offset by an increase in the effective interest rate earned during liquidity and capital resources at december   we had cash and cash equivalents of  the cash and cash equivalents balance at december  includes net proceeds from a private placement of common stock of  and warrant and option exercises of  we believe that our financial resources are adequate for our operations for at least the next months 
our future short and long term capital requirements will depend on numerous factors  including marketplace acceptance of our products 
in addition to marketplace acceptance of our products  other factors which cannot be quantified and many of which we cannot control will also impact our short and long term capital requirements  including continued commercial costs of visicol tm  continued progress in our research and development activities  progress with pre clinical studies and clinical trials  prosecuting and enforcing patent claims  technological and market developments  the ability to establish product development arrangements  the cost of manufacturing development  effective marketing activities and arrangements  and licensing or acquisition activity 
we are currently conducting a clinical trial of colirest tm in crohn s disease  recently commenced studies for the use of visicol tm for constipation and in pre operative colonic surgical procedures  and continue to market and sell visicol tm to distributors and drug store chains 
during  we expect to spend approximately  on the visicol tm studies and visicol tm product development   on the colirest tm study  and  on visicol tm sales and marketing costs 
these activities will be funded by our current cash balance and future product sales 
if product sales fall short of current expectations or other factors negatively impact our cash balance  we may seek to obtain additional funds through equity or debt financing  collaborative or other arrangements with corporate partners  and from other sources 
no assurance can be given that necessary additional financing will be available on terms acceptable to us  if at all 
if adequate additional funds are not available when required  we may have to delay  scale back or eliminate certain of our research  drug discovery or development activities or certain other aspects of our operations and our business will be materially and adversely affected 
we anticipate reaching operating profitability during to achieve operating profitability  we  alone or with others  must successfully market and sell our products  revenues from product sales must be greater than the sum of cost of goods sold  research and development costs  sales and marketing costs and general and administrative costs 
the time required to reach operating profitability is highly uncertain  and there can be no assurance that we will be able to achieve profitability on a sustained basis  if at all

recently issued accounting pronouncements in july  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for asset retirement obligations 
sfas no 
required the recognition of a liability for an asset retirement in the period in which it is incurred 
a retirement obligation is defined as one in which a legal obligation exists in the future resulting from existing laws  statutes or contracts 
the standard is effective for fiscal years beginning after june  the adoption of sfas no 
is not expected to impact our financial statements 
in april  the fasb issued sfas no 
 rescission of fasb statements no 
 and  amendment of fasb statement no 
and technical corrections 
sfas no 
updates  clarifies and simplifies existing accounting pronouncements 
the rescission of sfas no  reporting gains and losses from extinguishment of debt  and sfas no 
 extinguishment of debt made to satisfy sinking fund requirements  which amended sfas no 
 will effect income statement classification of gains and losses from extinguishment of debt 
sfas no 
 required all gains and losses from extinguishment of debt to be aggregated and  if material  classified as an extraordinary item  net of related income tax effect 
as a result of the rescission  the criteria in apb no 
will now be used to classify those gains and losses 
this is a result of the changed marketplace that now utilizes the extinguishment of debt as part of day to day risk management strategies 
sfas no 
was issued to establish accounting requirements for the effects of transition to the provisions of the motor carrier act of because the transition is completed  sfas no 
is no longer necessary 
sfas no 
amends sfas no 
to require that certain lease modifications that have economic effects similar to sale leaseback transactions be accounted for in the same manner as sale leaseback transactions 
the standard was effective for fiscal years beginning after may  with early adoption of the provisions related to the rescission of sfas no 
encouraged 
the adoption of sfas did not have any impact on our financial statements 
in june  the fasb issued sfas no 
accounting for exit or disposal activities 
sfas no 
addresses significant issues regarding the recognition  measurement and reporting of costs associated with exit and disposal activities  including restructuring activities 
sfas no 
also addresses recognition of certain costs related to terminating a contract that is not capital lease  costs to consolidate facilities or relocate employees  and termination of benefits provided to employees that are involuntarily terminated under the terms of a one time benefit arrangement that is not an ongoing benefit arrangement or an individual deferred compensation contract 
the adoption of sfas no 
did not have any impact on our financial statements 
sfas no 
is effective for exit or disposal activities that are initiated after december  we do not expect the adoption of sfas no 
to have a material impact on our financial statements 
in november  the fasb issued fin no 
 guarantor s accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees  including indirect guarantees of indebtedness to others  an interpretation of sfas nos 
 and and a rescission of sfas no 
this interpretation elaborates on the disclosures to be made by a guarantor in its interim and annual financial statements about its obligations under guarantees issued 
the fin no 
also clarifies that a guarantor is required to recognize  at inception of the guarantee  a liability for the fair value of the obligation undertaken 
the initial recognition and measurement provisions of fin no 
are applicable to guarantees issued or modified after december  and are not expected to have a material effect on our financial statements 
the disclosure requirements are effective for financial statements of interim and annual periods ending after december  in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure  which amends sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation to provide alternative methods of transition for a voluntary change to the fair value method of accounting for stock based employee compensation 
in addition  the statement amends the disclosure requirement of sfas no 
to require more prominent disclosures in interim and annual financial statements 
certain of the disclosure modifications are required for the fiscal years ending after december  and are included in the notes to these financial statements 
in january  the fasb issued fin no 
 consolidation of variable interest entities with the objective of improving financial reporting by companies involved with variable interest entities 
a variable interest entity is a corporation  partnership  trust  or any other legal structure used for business purposes that either a does not have equity investors with voting rights  or b has equity investors that do not provide sufficient financial resources for the entity to support its activities 
historically  entities generally were not consolidated unless the entity was controlled through voting interests 
fin no 
changes that by requiring a variable interest entity to be consolidated by a company if that company is subject to a majority of the risk of loss from the variable interest entity s activities or entitled to receive a majority of the entity s residual returns or both 
a company that consolidates a variable interest entity is called the primary beneficiary of that entity 
fin no 
also requires disclosures about variable interest entities that a company is not required to consolidate but in which it has a significant variable interest 
the consolidation requirements of fin no 
apply immediately to variable interest entities created after january  the consolidation requirements of fin no 
apply to existing entities in the first fiscal year or interim period beginning after june  also  certain disclosure requirements apply to all financial statements issued after january   regardless of when the variable interest entity was established 
we do not expect the adoption of the fin no 
to have any financial impact on its financial statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to market risk associated with changes in interest rates on our line of credit and certain investments 
we do not manage the risk of fluctuations in interest rates associated with the line of credit  as it is a short term borrowing with a maturity date in the interest rate on our line of credit has fluctuated from to over the past year and the outstanding balance at december  was  typically  a substantial portion of our assets are investment grade debt instruments such as direct obligations of the us treasury  securities of federal agencies which carry the direct or implied guarantee of the us government and bank certificates of deposit 
the market value of such investments fluctuates with current market interest rates 
in general  as rates increase  the market value of a debt instrument would be expected to decrease 
the opposite is also true 
to minimize such market risk  we have in the past and  to the extent possible  will continue in the future to hold such debt instruments to maturity at which time the debt instrument will be redeemed at its stated or face value 
due to the short duration and nature of these instruments  we do not believe that we have a material exposure to interest rate risk related to our investment portfolio 
we do not anticipate any material changes in our primary market risk exposures in we do not hold or issue any derivatives
