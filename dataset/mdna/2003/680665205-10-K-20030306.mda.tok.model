item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
additional factors that may affect future results in addition to the other information in this form k  the following factors should be considered in evaluating olin and our business 
all of our forward looking statements should be considered in light of these factors 
additional risks and uncertainties that we are unaware of or that we currently deem immaterial also may become important factors that affect us 
sensitivity to global economic conditions and cyclicality our operating results could be negatively affected during economic downturns 
the business of most of our customers  particularly our automotive  coinage  electrical connectors  telecommunications and housing customers  are  to varying degrees  cyclical and have historically experienced periodic downturns 
these economic and industry downturns have been characterized by diminished product demand  excess manufacturing capacity and  in some cases  lower average selling prices 
therefore  any significant downturn in our customers businesses or in global economic conditions could result in a reduction in demand for our products and could adversely affect our results of operations or financial condition 
as a result of the depressed economic conditions beginning in the fourth quarter of and continuing through the first half of  our vinyls  urethanes and pulp and paper customers have had lower demand for our chlor alkali products 
our coinage  electronic and telecommunications customers had lower demand for our metals products beginning in the fourth quarter of and continuing through lower demand in our metals and chlor alkali products segments has adversely affected our business and results of operations in and  compared to specifically  the continued slowdown in the coinage and telecommunications industries has adversely affected our results of operations in our metals segment 
although we do not generally sell a large percentage of our products directly to customers abroad  a large part of our financial performance is dependent upon a healthy economy beyond the united states 
our customers sell their products abroad 
as a result  our business is affected by general economic conditions and other factors in western europe and most of east asia  particularly china and japan  including fluctuations in interest rates  customer demand  labor costs and other factors beyond our control 
the demand for our customers products  and therefore  our products  is directly affected by such fluctuations 
our joint venture  yamaha olin metal corporation  located in japan  is particularly susceptible to these fluctuations 
we cannot assure you that events having an adverse effect on the industries in which we operate will not occur or continue  such as a further downturn in the western european  asian or world economies  increases in interest rates  unfavorable currency fluctuations or a prolonged slowdown in the coinage  electronic or telecommunications industries 
the terrorist attacks of september th created many economic and political uncertainties and have had a negative impact on the global economy 
the long term effects of these attacks on our future operating results and financial condition are unknown 
the national and international responses to terrorist attacks and the potential for additional terrorist attacks or similar events could have further material adverse effects on the economy in general  on our industry and on our operations 
for example  war with one or more countries  including a united states attack on iraq  which is under public discussion by the country s leaders  could have numerous consequences for us and our customers  one of which may be sustained high energy prices 
cyclical pricing pressure our profitability could be reduced by declines in average selling prices of our products  particularly declines in the ecu netback gross price less freight and discounts 
our historical operating results reflect the cyclical and sometimes volatile nature of the chemical  metals and ammunition industries 
we experience cycles of fluctuating supply and demand in each of our business segments  particularly in the chlor alkali products division  which results in changes in selling prices 
periods of high demand  tight supply and increasing operating margins tend to result in increased capacity and production until supply exceeds demand  generally followed by periods of oversupply and declining prices 
the industry build cycle  and its impact on industry pricing  has been most pronounced in our chlor alkali products segment 
for example  in and  the chlor alkali industry was very profitable due to a tight supply demand balance  which resulted in both higher operating rates and higher ecu prices 
higher profits led to reinvestment to expand capacity 
this new capacity became operational in and  resulting in industry over capacity 
this imbalance was exacerbated by falling demand as a result of the asian financial crisis 
the supply demand imbalance resulted in both lower operating rates and lower ecu prices  and in  many chlor alkali producers had operating losses 
the supply demand balance improved due to improved economic conditions in compared to  and ecu prices increased in compared to as the us and world economies have deteriorated in and through the first half of  the chlor alkali industry again experienced a period of oversupply because of lower industry demand for both chlorine and caustic 
price in the chlor alkali industry is a major supplier selection criterion 
we have little or no ability to influence prices in this large commodity market 
decreases in the average selling prices of our products could have a material adverse effect on our profitability 
for example  assuming all other costs remain constant  a change in our ecu netback causes a corresponding million increase or decrease in our annual revenues and pre tax profits  when we are operating at full capacity 
while we strive to maintain or increase our profitability by reducing costs through improving production efficiency  emphasizing higher margin products  and by controlling selling and administration expenses  we cannot assure you that these efforts will be sufficient to offset fully the effect of changes in pricing on operating results 
because of the cyclical nature of our businesses  we cannot assure you that pricing or profitability in the future will be comparable to any particular historical period  including the most recent period shown in our operating results 
we cannot assure you that the chlor alkali industry will not experience adverse trends in the future  or that our operating results and or financial condition will not be adversely affected by them 
our metals and winchester segments are also subject to changes in operating results as a result of cyclical pricing pressures  but to a lesser extent than the chlor alkali products segment 
we generally pass changes in prices for copper and other metals along to our customers as part of the negotiated price of the finished product in most of our metals segment product lines 
however  our metals segment experiences manufacturing or pricing pressure with respect to its conversion charges  and we cannot assure you that adverse trends in pricing and margins will not affect operating results in the future 
similarly  selling prices of ammunition are affected by changes in raw material costs and customer demand  and declines in average selling prices of our winchester segment could adversely affect our profitability 
indebtedness our indebtedness could adversely affect our financial condition  limit our ability to grow and compete and prevent us from fulfilling our obligation under our indebtedness 
as of december   we had approximately million of indebtedness outstanding  excluding our guarantee of million of indebtedness of our sunbelt joint venture 
this does not include our million senior credit facility on which we had million available on that date 
as of december   our indebtedness represented of our total capitalization 
on january   we entered into a new million three year revolving senior credit facility  which we refer to as our senior credit facility 
our indebtedness could adversely affect our financial condition  limit our ability to grow and compete and prevent us from fulfilling our obligations under our indebtedness 
despite our level of indebtedness  our senior credit facility and our existing indentures permit us to borrow additional money 
if we borrow more money  the risks related to our indebtedness could be increased significantly 
debt service we may not be able to generate sufficient cash to service our debt  which may require us to refinance our indebtedness or default on our scheduled debt payments 
our ability to generate sufficient cash flow from operations to make scheduled payments on our debt depends on a range of economic  competitive and business factors  many of which are outside our control 
we cannot assure you that our business will generate sufficient cash flow from operations 
if we are unable to meet our expenses and debt obligations  we may need to refinance all or a portion of our indebtedness on or before maturity  sell assets or raise equity 
we cannot assure you that we would be able to refinance any of our indebtedness  sell assets or raise equity on commercially reasonable terms or at all  which could cause us to default on our obligations and impair our liquidity 
our inability to generate sufficient cash flow to satisfy our debt obligations  or to refinance our obligations on commercially reasonable terms  would have an adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations  as well as on our ability to satisfy our debt obligations 
see management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
after taking into consideration our interest rate swaps which convert our fixed rate debt to a variable rate  at december   approximately of our indebtedness bears interest at variable rates that are linked to short term interest rates 
if interest rates rise  our costs relative to those obligations would also rise 
imbalance in demand for our chlor alkali products a loss of a substantial customer for our chlorine or caustic soda could cause an imbalance in demand for these products  which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations 
chlorine and caustic soda are produced simultaneously and in a fixed ratio of ton of chlorine to tons of caustic soda 
the loss of a substantial chlorine or caustic soda customer could cause an imbalance in demand for our chlorine and caustic soda products 
an imbalance in demand may require us to reduce production of both chlorine and caustic soda or take other steps to correct the imbalance 
since we cannot store chlorine  we may not be able to respond to an imbalance in demand for these products as quickly or efficiently as some of our competitors 
if a substantial imbalance occurred  we would need to reduce prices or take other actions that could have a negative impact on our results of operations and financial condition 
competition we face competition from other chemical  metals and ammunition companies  which could adversely affect our revenues and financial condition 
we are in active competition with companies producing the same or similar products  as well as  in some instances  with companies producing different products designed for the same uses 
with respect to certain product groups  such as ammunition  copper alloys and brass rod  and with respect to certain chlor alkali products  we are among the largest manufacturers or distributors in the united states 
we encounter competition in price  delivery  service  securing and maintaining customers  performance  technology  product innovation  and product recognition and quality  depending on the product involved 
with respect to certain products  some of our competitors are larger  have greater financial resources and have less debt than we do 
as a result  these competitors may be better able to withstand a change in conditions within the industries in which we operate and throughout the economy as a whole 
if we do not compete successfully  our business  financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected 
environmental costs we have ongoing environmental costs  which could also have a material adverse effect on our financial condition 
the nature of our operations and products  including the raw materials we handle  exposes us to the risk of liabilities or claims with respect to environmental matters 
we have incurred  and will continue to incur  significant costs and capital expenditures in complying with these environmental laws and regulations 
the ultimate costs and timing of environmental liabilities are difficult to predict 
liability under environmental laws relating to contaminated sites can be imposed retroactively and on a joint and several basis 
one liable party could be held responsible for all costs at a site  regardless of fault  percentage of contribution to the site or the legality of the original disposal 
we could incur significant costs  including cleanup costs  natural resources damages  civil or criminal fines and sanctions and third party lawsuits claiming  for example  personal injury and or property damage  as a result of past or future violations of  or liabilities under  environmental or other laws 
in addition  future events  such as changes to or more rigorous enforcement of environmental laws  could require us to make additional expenditures  modify or curtail our operations and or install pollution control equipment 
see management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations environmental matters 
cost control our profitability could be reduced if we experience higher than expected raw material  utility  transportation or logistics costs  or if we fail to achieve our targeted cost reductions 
our operating results and profitability are dependent upon our continued ability to control  and in some cases further reduce  our costs 
if we are unable to do so  or if costs outside of our control  particularly our costs of raw materials  utilities  transportation and similar costs increase beyond anticipated levels  our profitability will decline 
production hazards our facilities are subject to operating hazards  which may disrupt our business 
we are dependent upon the continued safe operation of our production facilities 
our production facilities are subject to hazards associated with the manufacture  handling  storage and transportation of chemical materials and products and ammunition  including leaks and ruptures  explosions  fires  inclement weather and natural disasters  unexpected utility disruptions or outages  unscheduled downtime and environmental hazards 
from time to time in the past  we have had incidents that have temporarily shut down or otherwise disrupted our manufacturing  causing production delays and resulting in liability for workplace injuries and fatalities 
some of our products involve the manufacture and or handling of a variety of explosive and flammable materials 
use of these products by our customers could also result in liability if an explosion  fire  spill or other accident were to occur 
we cannot assure you that we will not experience these types of incidents in the future or that these incidents will not result in production delays or otherwise have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition or results of operations 
tax audits we are currently subject to ongoing tax audits  which may result in additional tax payments 
we are currently subject to ongoing audits by the internal revenue service in connection with our federal tax returns for the years from to  however  we have closed all tax years through depending on the outcome of these audits  we may be required to pay additional taxes  and any additional taxes and related interest could be substantial 
we have reserved amounts which we believe will be sufficient for any adverse outcome  but the actual amount of any such additional taxes and the timing of any such payments is uncertain 
pension plans the decline in equity markets and low interest rates have resulted in our pension plan liabilities exceeding the fair value of the plan s assets as of december  this could result in higher pension costs and the need to fund the pension plan in future years 
due to the significant decline in the equity markets during and declining long term interest rates  which had the effect of lowering our discount rate and increasing the accumulated benefit obligation  the market value of our pension plan portfolio as of december  was below the accumulated benefit obligation 
under statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
we recorded a million after tax charge to shareholders equity to reflect this difference 
this is a non cash charge and does not affect our ability to borrow under our revolving credit agreement 
based on our assumptions and estimates  we may be required to make contributions to the pension fund  but those contributions would not be required until and pension costs may be higher over the next few years 
we estimate that the higher pension costs could be in the million per year range 
security and chemicals transportation new regulations on the transportation of hazardous chemicals and or the security of chemical manufacturing facilities in response to the increased terrorist threat post september th could result in higher operating costs 
the chemical industry  including the chlor alkali industry  has proactively responded to the issues surrounding the events of september  by starting new initiatives relating to the security of chemicals industry facilities and the transportation of hazardous chemicals in the united states 
simultaneously  government at the local  state and federal levels has begun the regulatory process which could lead to new regulations that would impact the security of chemical plant locations and the transportation of hazardous chemicals 
our chlor alkali business could be adversely impacted because of either an incident or the cost of complying with new regulations 
the extent of the impact would depend on the consequences of an incident and the nature and direction of future regulations  which are unknown at this time 
litigation and claims we are subject to litigation and other claims  which could cause us to incur significant expenses 
we are a defendant in a number of pending legal proceedings relating to our present and former operations 
these include proceedings alleging injurious exposure of plaintiffs to various chemicals and other substances including proceedings based on alleged exposures to asbestos  perchlorate and vinyl chloride 
frequently  such proceedings involve claims made by numerous plaintiffs against many defendants 
we believe we have valid defenses to these proceedings and are defending them vigorously 
however  litigation is subject to uncertainties and we are unable to predict the outcome of these proceedings 
item properties we have manufacturing sites at separate locations in states and puerto rico and two manufacturing sites and a distribution facility in three foreign countries 
in addition  a metals service center in china is expected to be operational in the second half of most manufacturing sites are owned although a number of small sites are leased 
we listed the locations at or from which our products and services are manufactured  distributed or marketed in the tables set forth under the caption products and services 
we lease warehouses  terminals and distribution offices and space for executive and branch sales offices and service departments throughout the world 
item legal proceedings a we continue to work with the united states environmental protection agency  or usepa  with respect to remediation of mercury contamination at the site of our former mercury cell chlor alkali products plant in saltville  virginia 
additional work is required including the covering of certain former waste ponds and additional investigation and monitoring 
we began work to cover the ponds in and expect the work to be completed in we have met with the site s natural resources trustees at the trustees request regarding past releases from the saltville site and the nearby north fork of the holston river 
we do not know whether the trustees will claim any natural resource damages associated with releases from the site 
we believe that any liability incurred in this matter will not be materially adverse to our financial condition or liquidity 
see environmental matters contained in item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
b as part of the continuing environmental investigation by federal  state and local governments of waste disposal sites  we have entered into a number of settlement agreements requiring us to contribute to the cost of the investigation and cleanup of a number of sites 
we expect this process of investigation and cleanup to continue 
see environmental matters contained in item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
c as a result of an internal audit of our east alton  illinois facility  we questioned whether recent upgrades to certain operations were completed in full compliance with certain usepa air emissions regulations 
although our facility received a modification to its air emissions permit from the illinois environmental protection agency  or iepa  for the upgrades  the permit modification may not have addressed or completely addressed all applicable regulations 
on february   we disclosed to usepa and iepa that the upgrades may not have been in compliance with all aspects of usepa regulations 
upon further review  we submitted a report to iepa in june  discussing our analysis of the regulations applicable to the upgrades 
we have offered to work with usepa and iepa to determine the nature and extent of the issues and to correct them  if necessary 
as part of the resolution of this issue  we may need to enhance pollution control equipment at our east alton facility and pay some penalty 
while we do not expect that the ultimate resolution of this matter will have a material impact on our financial position  we cannot  at this time  determine the financial impact  if any  on our results of operations in a particular year 
d we and our subsidiaries are defendants in various other legal actions including proceedings based on alleged exposures to asbestos  perchlorate and vinyl chloride incidental to our past and current business activities  none of which management believes to be material

item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations business background our operations are concentrated in three segments chlor alkali products  metals and winchester 
all three are capital intensive manufacturing businesses with growth rates closely tied to the general economy 
while each segment has a commodity element to it  our ability to influence pricing is quite limited and the portion of the business that is strictly commodity varies by segment 
our chlor alkali products business is a commodity business where all supplier products are similar and price is the major supplier selection criterion 
we have little or no ability to influence prices in this large  global commodity market 
cyclical price swings  driven by changes in supply demand  can be abrupt and significant and  given capacity in our chlor alkali products business  can lead to very significant changes in our overall profitability 
while a majority of metals sales are of a commodity nature  this business has a significant volume of specialty engineered products targeted for specific end uses 
in these applications  technical capability and performance differentiate the product and play a significant role in product selection and thus price is not the only selection criterion 
winchester also has a commodity element to its business but a majority of winchester ammunition is sold as a branded consumer product where there are opportunities to differentiate certain offerings through innovative new product development and enhanced product performance 
while competitive pricing versus other branded ammunition products is important  it is not the only factor in product selection 
recent developments and highlights year on september   we completed our acquisition of chase with the issuance of approximately million shares of our common stock for of the outstanding stock of chase 
our metals segment s operating results include the sales and profits from chase for the fourth quarter of due to the significant decline in the equity markets during the market value of our pension plan portfolio as of december  was below the accumulated benefit obligation 
under sfas no 
we recorded a million after tax charge to shareholders equity to reflect this difference 
this is a non cash charge and does not affect our ability to borrow under our revolving credit agreement 
based on our assumptions and estimates we continue to believe that we may be required to make contributions to the pension fund  but those contributions would not be required until and pension costs may be higher over the next few years 
we estimate that the annual pretax increase in pension costs could be in the million per year range 
in march  we issued and sold  shares of common stock at a public offering price of 
the net proceeds from the sale were approximately million 
in june  we repaid the million notes from the proceeds from the sale of million notes in december in march  we refinanced our variable rate tax exempt debt issues  totaling million 
in november  we announced that our metals segment had entered into an agreement with luoyang copper to jointly construct and operate a metals service center in guangzhou  guangdong province  china 
the joint venture named olin luotong metals gz ltd  co  will process and distribute both our and luoyang s copper alloy products to the growing chinese marketplace 
the joint venture will allow us to supply hpas targeted at the electronics  automotive and telecommunications industries  at competitive prices 
this joint venture is expected to be operational in the second half of  subject to chinese government approval 
on december  we announced that we are in the process of finalizing negotiations with the internal revenue service irs relative to our company owned life insurance coli program 
the settlement contemplates a tax payment by us of approximately million to the irs  which has been recorded as a liability in prior years 
as a result  there is no financial accounting charge to earnings associated with this payment 
we expect approximately million of this payment to be made in and the balance in future years 
concurrent with the settlement  we intend to surrender the life insurance policies purchased by the company under the program  which will result in the return of approximately million in cash from the insurance companies 
the surrender of the policies resulted in a tax charge of million in year in june  we acquired the stock of monarch for approximately million 
monarch was a privately held  specialty copper alloy manufacturer headquartered in waterbury  ct 
it produces and distributes an array of high performance copper alloys and other materials used for applications in electronics  telecommunications  automotive products and building products 
in the third quarter of  we recorded a pretax charge for restructuring and unusual items of million primarily for costs associated with a salaried workforce reduction through an early retirement incentive program 
cost of goods sold and other income included million and million  respectively  of unusual items 
cost of goods sold included the write off of inventory associated with cancelled customer orders 
other income included the write off of an investment in an e commerce company because the company declared bankruptcy and was dissolved and therefore had no future value 
the third quarter restructuring charge of million related to the employees retiring in connection with the retirement program and represented primarily pension and postretirement benefit curtailment losses and severance 
in the fourth quarter of  we recorded a restructuring charge of million pretax primarily for costs associated with idling our indianapolis brass mill  consolidating distribution operations of the recently acquired monarch with the aj oster metals service center business  and reducing staffing levels in chlor alkali products 
a significant portion of the charge relating to the idling of the indianapolis facility represented pension and postretirement curtailment losses and severance for employees 
another portion of the charge related to chlor alkali employees who accepted our offer of a voluntary special separation program whereby employees accept a voluntary lay off and receive full separation benefits and also receive their accrued pension benefits at the same time 
the balance of the restructuring charge related to costs associated with the consolidation of certain monarch facilities in order to optimize distribution operations 
in  we were notified that we would receive shares of prudential insurance company as a result of its decision to demutualize from a mutual company to a stock company 
we recorded a gain of million in other income in we received the shares and immediately sold them in january year at midnight on december   a work stoppage began at the metals and winchester manufacturing facilities at east alton  il  after the union and we were unable to agree on a new labor contract 
after several weeks of negotiations  the parties entered into a new labor contract and the union workers returned to work on january  the work stoppage had an adverse impact in and on the profitability of the metals and winchester operations  including product fulfillment issues  additional expenses and contract settlement costs 
in june  we signed a letter of intent with occidental petroleum corporation to combine the companies chlor alkali and related businesses in a partnership 
in october  we announced that the letter of intent had expired 
the partnership negotiations were discontinued primarily due to regulatory issues and certain other matters on which the parties could not agree 
consolidated results of operations in millions  except per share data sales gross margin selling and administration restructuring charge interest expense  net other income income loss before taxes net income loss diluted net income loss per common share compared to sales increased primarily due to sales associated with our acquisition of both chase and monarch and increased volumes  offset in part by lower selling prices and metal sales 
chase was acquired in late september  while monarch was acquired in early june the increase in sales volumes was across all segments  in particular strip shipments to the ammunition  automotive and electronics segments 
the price decreases were primarily related to lower ecu netbacks in the chlor alkali products segment 
gross margin percentage decreased from in to in primarily due to lower ecu prices 
selling and administration as a percentage of sales were in and selling and administration expenses were comparable to reduced salaries resulting from the early retirement incentive program and the voluntary separation program implemented in late and lower consumer promotional expenses offset lower pension income and higher legal expenses 
the decrease in operating losses from the non consolidated affiliates was due primarily to improved operating results from the sunbelt joint venture million loss  million loss due to higher ecu pricing 
interest expense  net of interest income  increased from due to higher average outstanding debt million relating primarily to the million that we borrowed in december and higher interest rates on our debt million  partially offset by higher interest income million in other income decreased from primarily due to the gains on the demutualization of prudential insurance million and the sale of excess real estate million and a non recurring fee payment million  all of which were recorded in the effective tax rate decreased in to a negative from in the tax benefit recorded on the loss in was less than the statutory rate because we recorded a tax provision of million in connection with the surrender of life insurance policies purchased by us under the coli program and are accruing interest on taxes which may be payable in the future 
compared to sales decreased due to lower volumes and both lower metal values and selling prices 
sales volumes were lower across all segments with the biggest impact coming from the metals segment  which was heavily impacted by a soft economy  particularly in the automotive  electronics and telecommunications industries and to a lesser extent by the strike at the east alton  il facility in the first quarter of the price decrease was primarily related to lower prices in the metals and winchester segments 
gross margin percentage decreased from in to in primarily due to lower sales volumes 
selling and administration as a percentage of sales was in up from in due to the lower sales base in as a result of the factors noted above 
selling and administration was million lower than in primarily due to lower incentive compensation costs million and fees incurred in associated with the discontinued chlor alkali partnership negotiations million  partially offset by lower pension income million and selling and administration expense million of monarch  acquired in the decrease in operating results from the non consolidated affiliates was due primarily to the lower operating results from the sunbelt joint venture million loss in  breakeven in  which was adversely impacted by lower chlorine pricing 
in  other income included the gains on the demutualization of prudential insurance of million and on the sale of excess real estate of million and a non recurring fee payment of million 
the effective tax rate decreased to from due to operating losses  carryover of foreign tax rate differential and an increase in the valuation allowance 
segment operating results we define segment operating income as earnings before interest expense  interest income  other income  restructuring charge and unusual items and income taxes  and include the operating results of non consolidated affiliates 
segment operating income includes an allocation of corporate operating expenses 
segment operating results in exclude the restructuring charge and unusual items million  pretax 
chlor alkali products in millions sales operating income loss compared to sales decreased from primarily due to lower selling prices  but offset in part by higher volumes 
average ecu netbacks in were approximately  compared to in the chlor alkali industry suffered through a difficult first half of and some high cost manufacturers decided to shut down capacity 
during the third quarter of  demand started to pick up and the industry was able to pass through several price increases 
improved demand and less overall capacity continued to support price increases through the rest of the year 
our operating rates improved until late in the year when seasonal slow downs and a sluggish economy forced us and other manufacturers to reduce production 
our operating rates for the full year were approximately compared with in chlorine and caustic volumes were both higher in compared to operating results were significantly lower in primarily due to lower prices million  offset in part by higher volumes million and improved results from our sunbelt joint venture million and lower costs million 
lower losses from the sunbelt joint venture million loss  million loss were favorably impacted by higher ecu pricing 
the losses from the sunbelt joint venture include interest expense of million in and on the sunbelt notes 
profit improvement activities  lower steam cost  overall cost management and the voluntary separation program implemented at the end of contributed to these cost reductions 
also in the second quarter of we recorded a non recurring pretax gain of million on an insurance settlement 
compared to sales decreased from primarily due to lower volumes offset in part by higher ecu netbacks 
our average ecu netbacks in were approximately  compared to in the chlor alkali industry participates in markets  such as vinyls  urethanes and pulp and paper  which have been negatively impacted by poor economic conditions 
these markets have faced declining demand for their products  which in turn  negatively impacts our products 
soft demand for chlorine in these markets  caused primarily by the slowdown in the general economy  has led to reduced chlor alkali operating rates across the industry 
this weak demand forced operating rates to decline to approximately mid to low from in and caused an erosion of chlorine s pricing structure 
this contributed to the decline in sales and operating income in also  operating income was lower in primarily due to lower sales volumes million  higher manufacturing costs million and losses from the sunbelt joint venture million loss in  breakeven in due to lower chlorine prices but offset in part by higher ecu netbacks million 
the increased manufacturing costs included higher salt costs and higher fixed cost absorption due to lower production volumes 
metals in millions sales operating income compared to sales increased mainly as a result of the two acquisitions over the past two years 
sales from monarch increased sales by while chase increased sales by in overall strip shipment volume increased by from due to increased demand in the automotive  ammunition and electronic segments  offset in part by reduced demand from coinage 
however  overall sales increased only 
the difference was the result of a shift in the mix of sales to lower metal value alloys  lower average metal selling prices and reduced conversion prices charged to customers 
the decrease in the average metal selling price was mainly due to a decrease in the average comex price for copper in from shipments to the automotive and ammunition segments each increased by compared to last year 
shipments to the automotive segment increased in as we increased our penetration into this end use category and an increase in automotive production in shipments to the ammunition segment increased as a result of increased domestic military demand 
shipments to the electronics telecommunications segment increased by in compared with but were still down about from the to average demand 
coinage shipments were down from last year due to reduced demand from the us mint primarily related to decreased demand for the state quarter program  the lack of public acceptance of the sacagawea coin and the continued general softness in the overall economy 
in summary  although strip shipments were up in the automotive and electronics segments  this was offset by lower coinage shipments and by sales to the electronics segment that continue to be well below their historical norms 
metals operating income was million higher in compared with operating income benefited by the increase over the previous year in strip volumes  as mentioned above  however  this benefit was partially offset by lower unit margins 
operating income was also favorably impacted by the inclusion of million of chase profits and various cost reduction initiatives including the early retirement program and the consolidation of monarch s distribution operations with aj oster which  on a combined basis  amounted to about million in cost savings year over year 
partially offsetting the cost reduction initiatives and higher volumes in were increased pension and medical costs of about million 
finally  the results included a million lifo inventory liquidation benefit offset by the negative impact of the east alton work stoppage in compared to sales decreased due to a significant decline in volumes associated with the weak economy and lower metal values and selling prices  offset in part by the sales associated with the monarch acquisition 
metals operating results were significantly lower primarily due to the economic slowdown  which resulted in substantially lower shipment levels 
a weak economy prevailed all year resulting in a significant reduction of strip shipments to key market segments of our industry 
automotive  coinage  electrical connectors  telecommunications segments served by olin aegis  our business that supplies customized and semi customized metal packaging for hybrid integrated circuits and thick ceramic substrates for the electronics segment and distributor segments served by oster  a network of metal service centers  customers had much lower demand for the industry s products 
in  strip shipments to the automotive and the coinage segments were lower than in by and  respectively 
the lack of acceptance by the general public of the sacagewea coin accounted for of the decline in strip shipments to the coinage segment in future demand is not expected to reach levels because of the current lack of coin requirements established by the united states treasury 
the decrease in strip shipments to the coinage segment was also caused by the decrease in demand for the state quarter program as the economy softened and coinage in general weakened  both of which are consistent with historical patterns 
in addition  shipments to the electronics telecommunications segment as a whole were lower than in by 
sales from oster were down in from the prior year 
in addition  the mill products operations in east alton  il took a two week maintenance shutdown in  with no similar shutdown in also  the strike at our east alton facility in the first quarter of had a moderately adverse impact on metals profits  while the reductions of lifo inventory quantities in increased operating income by approximately million pretax 
winchester in millions sales operating income compared to sales in were higher than primarily due to higher volumes and prices in the military and domestic commercial ammunition businesses 
winchester posted operating income of million in compared with million in the increase in sales accounted for most of the increase in operating income 
the cost benefit realized in associated with the early retirement incentive program and the absence of the effect of the strike were offset by the absence of the non recurring income from the settlement of a claim 
compared to sales in were slightly lower than primarily due to lower international sales 
international sales were million below last year s levels due to decreased foreign military business and unfavorable translation of australian sales 
domestic commercial sales were comparable to last year despite overall lower selling prices and the effects of the strike at our east alton facility in the first quarter 
our operating income decreased from million in to million in the loss of the lake city government contract approximately million  the impact of both the lower domestic commercial prices and the higher personnel related costs as a result of the new labor agreement at the east alton facility million and the impact of the strike million were the main contributors to this significant decrease in operating income 
outlook in the chlor akali segment we are expecting both chlorine and caustic soda prices to increase from the fourth quarter of to the first quarter of as our contracts reflect previously announced price increases 
we expect further selling price improvement in the second quarter of we expect operating rates to be in the range in the first quarter of as demand for chlorine from the vinyl industry seasonally increases 
by year end  we expect operating rates to be in the range 
for the full year  we are expecting a dramatic turnaround in our chlor alkali segment operating results compared to  due to higher selling prices  increased volumes and continued cost reduction initiatives 
natural gas prices  which are a significant cost factor for some other chlor alkali producers  are not projected to be as significant a cost factor for us  because we buy our electricity from utilities that derive their power primarily from coal  nuclear and hydroelectric sources 
also  we expect to report improved operating results from our sunbelt joint venture as the year progresses  due to rising selling prices 
in the metals segment  will include a full year of earnings from chase while chase was just included in the fourth quarter in we expect that overall demand for our strip and rod products in will be increasing from fourth quarter levels  which were negatively impacted by our customers desires to reduce inventories at the end of for the full year  we believe the strip and rod volumes will improve only marginally over in the first quarter  we made a decision to close our manufacturing plant in indianapolis  indiana 
the plant manufactures copper and copper alloy sheet and strip products and employs approximately people 
production at the indianapolis strip mill will be consolidated within our east alton  illinois facility 
while the indianapolis strip mill has been an important part of the metals segment since its acquisition in  reduced domestic consumption of strip products combined with capacity additions at east alton have lessened the need to maintain the indianapolis production base 
as a result of this closure and certain other actions  we expect to record a restructuring charge in the million pretax range in the first quarter of we expect one time cash costs to be in the million range 
for the full year  we expect to achieve pretax savings associated with this charge in the million range 
the savings depend on the precise timing of the shutdown 
at this time  we do not expect to see the full benefits of the savings until the second quarter of for we expect to have a full year s benefit from this million charge of approximately million pretax 
the closure of the indianapolis facility  a marginally stronger brass strip market  continuing efforts to reduce costs across the metals segment and the inclusion of the chase earnings should result in significantly improved metals segment operating results in compared to for the full year  we project that winchester will have a solid year 
as a result of the foregoing  we expect to be profitable in because of higher selling prices in the chlor alkali segment and a lower cost base in the metals segment 
for we expect that capital spending will be in the million range and depreciation and amortization will be in the million range 
the capital spending estimate for includes about million in the chase rod business and about million for the joint venture in china 
in  we expect to continue to accrue interest on taxes that may become payable in the future which will result in an effective tax rate in the range 
environmental matters in millions cash outlays remedial and investigatory spending charged to reserve capital spending plant operations charged to cost of goods sold total cash outlays reserve for environmental liabilities beginning balance charges to income businesses acquired remedial and investigatory spending ending balance the establishment and implementation of federal  state and local standards to regulate air  water and land quality has affected and will continue to affect substantially all of our manufacturing locations 
federal legislation providing for regulation of the manufacture  transportation  use and disposal of hazardous and toxic substances  and remediation of contaminated sites  has imposed additional regulatory requirements on industry  particularly the chemicals industry 
in addition  implementation of environmental laws  such as the resource conservation and recovery act and the clean air act  has required and will continue to require new capital expenditures and will increase operating costs 
we employ waste minimization and pollution prevention programs at our manufacturing sites 
we are party to various governmental and private environmental actions associated with waste disposal sites and manufacturing facilities 
associated costs of investigatory and remedial activities are provided for in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles governing probability and the ability to reasonably estimate future costs 
charges to income for investigatory and remedial efforts were material to operating results in   and and may be material to net income in future years 
such charges to income were million  million and million in   and respectively 
cash outlays for remedial and investigatory activities associated with former waste sites and past operations were not charged to income but instead were charged to reserves established for such costs identified and expensed to income in prior years 
cash outlays for normal plant operations for the disposal of waste and the operation and maintenance of pollution control equipment and facilities to ensure compliance with mandated and voluntarily imposed environmental quality standards were charged to income 
total environmental related cash outlays for are estimated to be million  of which million is expected to be spent on investigatory and remedial efforts  million on capital projects and million on normal plant operations 
historically  we have funded our environmental capital expenditures through cash flow from operations and expect to do so in the future 
our estimated environmental liability at the end of was attributable to sites  of which were usepa national priority list npl sites 
ten sites accounted for approximately of such liability and  of the remaining sites  no one site accounted for more than of our environmental liability 
four of these ten sites are in the investigatory stage of the remediation process 
in this stage  remedial investigation and feasibility studies are being conducted by us or other potentially responsible parties prps and a record of decision rod or its equivalent has not been issued 
at one of the ten sites  a rod or its equivalent has been issued by either the usepa or responsible state agency and we either alone  or as a member of a prp group  are engaged in performing the remedial measures required by that rod 
at three of the ten sites  part of the site is subject to a rod and another part is in the long term operation  maintenance and monitoring om m stage 
the two remaining sites are in long term om m 
all ten sites are either former manufacturing facilities or waste sites containing contamination generated by those facilities 
our consolidated balance sheets included liabilities for future environmental expenditures to investigate and remediate known sites amounting to million at december   and million at december   of which million and million were classified as other noncurrent liabilities  respectively 
the environmental liabilities included million from the chase acquisition 
those amounts did not take into account any discounting of future expenditures or any consideration of insurance recoveries or advances in technology 
those liabilities are reassessed periodically to determine if environmental circumstances have changed and or remediation efforts and our estimate of related costs have changed 
as a result of these reassessments  future charges to income may be made for additional liabilities 
annual environmental related cash outlays for site investigation and remediation  capital projects  and normal plant operations are expected to range between approximately million to million over the next several years  million to million of which is expected to be charged against reserves recorded on our balance sheet 
while we do not anticipate a material increase in the projected annual level of our environmental related costs  there is always the possibility that such increases may occur in the future in view of the uncertainties associated with environmental exposures 
environmental exposures are difficult to assess for numerous reasons  including the identification of new sites  developments at sites resulting from investigatory studies  advances in technology  changes in environmental laws and regulations and their application  the scarcity of reliable data pertaining to identified sites  the difficulty in assessing the involvement and financial capability of other prps and our ability to obtain contributions from other parties and the lengthy time periods over which site remediation occurs 
it is possible that some of these matters the outcomes of which are subject to various uncertainties may be resolved unfavorably against us  which could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition 
at december   we estimate we may have additional contingent environmental liabilities of million in addition to the amounts for which we have already taken a reserve 
liquidity  investment activity and other financial data cash flow data provided by used for in millions net operating activities capital expenditures net investing activities net financing activities in  income exclusive of non cash charges  proceeds from the refinancing of the tax exempt debt  the issuance of common stock and cash equivalents on hand were used to finance our working capital requirements  capital and investment projects  dividends and long term debt repayments including tax exempt debt 
operating activities in  the decrease in cash provided by operating activities was primarily attributable to lower operating results and a higher investment in working capital 
the higher investment in working capital was attributable to the metals segment where we are now selling more on a metal price pass through basis rather than on a toll basis and therefore have to inventory more metal 
in  the reduced accounts receivable and inventory levels offset the impact of the liquidation of higher year end accounts payable and accrued liability balances 
the accounts receivable and inventory levels were lower at the end of compared to the end of primarily due to the lower volume of metals business as compared to and the declining prices and volumes in our chlor alkali business 
capital expenditures capital spending in of million was lower than the capital spending decrease was primarily due to completion of projects that were begun in  primarily to expand production capacity in metals higher value added product categories  in particular high performance alloys 
these products are patented  specialty copper alloys that provide value added benefits to global customers in the computer  telecommunications and automotive industries 
this expansion was completed in the second half of with the majority of the spending occurring in in addition  all non essential capital spending was curtailed in in response to the weak operating results 
capital spending in was approximately of depreciation compared to in in  we plan to manage our capital spending at a level approximating of depreciation  or about million  an increase of approximately over the amount 
in  we plan to spend approximately million in connection with our joint venture  a metals service center  in china 
investing activities on september   we acquired of the stock of chase with the issuance of approximately million shares of our common stock 
the total consideration was approximately million  which represented the fair value of olin common stock issued 
chase  with full year sales of million  is a leading manufacturer and supplier of brass rod in the us and canada 
the purchase price exceeded the fair value of the identifiable net assets acquired by million 
the acquisition has been accounted for using the purchase method of accounting 
our operating results include the sales and profits for the fourth quarter of from chase 
in january  we received million for the sale of the stock of prudential insurance company 
we were awarded these shares of stock in as a result of prudential s conversion from a mutual company to a stock company 
in our efforts to dispose of non strategic  unproductive assets during a period of a soft economy and weak operating results  we sold the company owned airplane 
the disposition of property  plant and equipment in represents primarily the sale of the airplane at approximately book value 
the increase in for investments and advances in affiliated companies  at equity represents primarily our share of sunbelt s repayment of its series o notes and related interest expense 
in addition  we funded a portion of sunbelt s operating losses in in june  we acquired the stock of monarch for approximately million 
monarch was a privately held  specialty copper alloy manufacturer headquartered in waterbury  ct  with revenues of approximately million in it produces and distributes an array of high performance copper alloys and other materials used for applications in electronics  telecommunications  automotive products and building products 
as part of this acquisition  we acquired us patents 
we financed the purchase price through our credit facilities 
the purchase price exceeded the fair value of the identifiable net assets acquired by million 
the acquisition has been accounted for using the purchase method of accounting 
the operating results of monarch  which have been included in the accompanying financial statements since the date of acquisition  were not material 
financing activities on january   we entered into a new three year senior revolving credit facility of million  including a sublimit for letters of credit 
the new facility replaced our existing credit facilities and will expire on january  at december   we had million available under this senior revolving credit facility 
we issued million of letters of credit under a subfacility for the purpose of supporting certain long term debt and self insurance obligations 
we may select various floating rate borrowing options 
the senior credit facility includes various customary restrictive covenants  including restrictions related to the ratio of debt to earnings before interest expense  taxes  depreciation and amortization leverage ratio and the ratio of earnings before interest expense  taxes  depreciation and amortization to interest expense coverage ratio 
in the event that the leverage ratio equals or exceeds  we are required to grant a security interest in all of our us inventory and accounts receivables 
no assets of our subsidiaries will secure our obligation under our senior credit facility 
in december  we sold million of senior notes with a maturity date of december  we used million from the proceeds of the offering to repay the million notes in june in march  we also refinanced million of tax exempt debt to create additional capacity under our revolving credit facility by eliminating the need for an equivalent amount of letters of credit 
in january  we renegotiated our million note due the maturity date was extended to and the interest rate was reduced from to  effective january  during  and  we used million  million and million to repurchase million  million and million shares of our stock  respectively 
in  we sold our toluene diisocyanate and aliphatic diisocyanate businesses to arco chemical company for a sale price of million 
our board of directors decided to use a portion of the proceeds for the repurchase of shares of the corporation s common stock in order to enhance shareholder value 
on october  and april   our board of directors approved two share repurchase programs to repurchase a total of million shares of our outstanding common stock  of which approximately  shares remained to be repurchased as of december  in march  we issued and sold  shares of common stock at a public offering price of 
net proceeds from this sale were approximately million and provide liquidity and financial flexibility  and strengthen our financial position 
the net proceeds are available for general corporate purposes 
during  we issued  shares of common stock with a total value of million to the contributing employee ownership plan 
these shares were issued to satisfy the investment in our common stock resulting from employee contributions  our matching contributions and re invested dividends 
the percent of total debt to total capitalization decreased to at december   from at year end and was at year end the decrease in from was due to the repayment of the million notes offset in part by the effect of the lower shareholders equity at december  the increase in from year end was due to the new senior note borrowings and lower shareholders equity at december  dividends per common share were in  and total dividends paid on common stock amounted to million in  million in and million in the payment of cash dividends is subject to the discretion of our board of directors and will be determined in light of then current conditions  including our earnings  our operations  our financial conditions  our capital requirements and other factors deemed relevant by our board of directors 
in the future  our board of directors may change our dividend policy  including the frequency or amount of any dividend  in light of then existing conditions 
liquidity and other financing arrangements our principal sources of liquidity are from cash and cash equivalents  short term investments  cash flow from operations and short term borrowings under our senior revolving credit facility 
we also have access to the debt and equity markets 
cash flow from operations is subject to change as a result of the cyclical nature of our operating results  which have been affected recently by economic cycles and resulting downturn in many of the industries we serve  such as automotive  electronics and the telecommunications sectors 
in addition  cash flow from operations is affected by considerable changes in ecu prices caused by the changes in the supply demand balance of chlorine and caustic  resulting in the chlor alkali business having tremendous leverage on our earnings 
a per ecu price change equates to an million pretax profit change when we are operating at full capacity 
our current debt structure is used to fund our business operations and commitments from banks under our revolving credit facility are a source of liquidity 
as of december   we had long term borrowings  including the current installment  of million of which million was at variable rates 
we have entered into interest rate swaps on approximately million of our underlying debt obligations whereby we agree to pay variable rates to a counterparty who  in turn  pays us fixed rates 
annual maturities of long term debt are million in  million in  million in  million in  million in and million thereafter 
we use operating leases for certain properties  such as railroad cars  distribution  warehousing and office space  data processing and office equipment 
leases covering these properties generally contain escalation clauses except for railroad cars based on increased costs of the lessor  for primarily property taxes  maintenance and insurance and have renewal or purchase options 
future minimum rent payments under operating leases having initial or remaining non cancelable lease terms in excess of one year at december  are as follows million in  million in  million in  million in  million in and a total of million thereafter 
assets under capital leases are not significant 
on december   we entered into a long term  sulfur dioxide supply agreement with alliance specialty chemicals  inc alliance  formerly known as rfc so  inc alliance has the obligation to deliver annually  tons of sulfur dioxide 
alliance owns the sulfur dioxide plant  which is located at our charleston  tn facility and is operated by us 
the price for the sulfur dioxide is fixed over the life of the contract and  under the terms of the contract  we are obligated to make a monthly payment of approximately 
million regardless of the amount of sulfur dioxide purchased 
commitments related to this agreement are approximately million per year for each year of through and a total of million thereafter 
we utilize a credit facility  standby letters of credit and guarantees 
in january  we entered into a new senior revolving credit facility with a group of banks 
this credit facility is described above under the caption  financing activities 
as of december   we did not have any outstanding borrowings under this credit facility 
at december   we had outstanding standby letters of credit of million 
these letters of credit were used to support certain long term debt and self insurance obligations 
in december  we registered million of securities with the securities and exchange commission whereby from time to time  we may issue debt securities  preferred stock and or common stock and associated warrants 
at december   the entire million was available for issuance 
we and our partner  polyone corporation polyone own equally the sunbelt chlor alkali partnership sunbelt joint venture 
we market all of the caustic soda production for the venture  while thousand tons of the chlorine production is required to be purchased by oxy vinyls a joint venture between oxychem and polyone based on a formula related to the market price of chlorine 
the construction of this plant and equipment was financed by the issuance of million of guaranteed senior secured notes due the sunbelt joint venture sold million of guaranteed senior secured notes due  series o  and million of guaranteed senior secured notes due  series g 
we refer to these notes as the sunbelt notes 
the sunbelt notes bear interest at a rate of per annum payable semiannually in arrears on each june and december we have guaranteed the series o notes  and polyone has guaranteed the series g notes  in both cases pursuant to customary guaranty agreements 
our guarantee and polyone s guarantee are several  rather than joint 
therefore  we are not required to make any payments to satisfy the indebtedness of polyone 
an insolvency or bankruptcy of polyone will not automatically trigger acceleration of the sunbelt notes or cause us to be required to make payments under our guarantee  even if polyone is required to make payments under its guarantee 
however  if the sunbelt joint venture does not make timely payments on the sunbelt notes  whether as a result of a failure to pay on a guarantee or otherwise  the holders of the sunbelt notes may proceed against the assets of the sunbelt joint venture for repayment 
beginning on december  and each year thereafter until maturity of the sunbelt notes in  our sunbelt joint venture is required to repay approximately million of the notes  of which approximately million is attributable to the series o notes 
after the payment of million on the series o notes in december  our guarantee of these notes was million at december  in the event our sunbelt joint venture cannot make any of these payments  we would be required to fund our half of such payment 
in certain other circumstances  we may also be required to repay the sunbelt notes prior to their maturity 
we and polyone have agreed that  if we or polyone intend to transfer our respective interests in the sunbelt joint venture and the transferring party is unable to obtain consent from holders of of the aggregate principal amount of the indebtedness related to the guarantee being transferred after good faith negotiations  then we and polyone will be required to repay our respective portions of the sunbelt notes 
in such event  any make whole or similar penalties or costs will be paid by the transferring party 
critical accounting policies and estimates our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  sales and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
significant estimates in our consolidated financial statements include environmental  restructuring and other unusual items  litigation  income tax reserves including deferred tax asset valuation allowance  pension  postretirement and other benefits and allowance for doubtful accounts 
we base our estimates on prior experience  facts and circumstances and other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable 
actual results may differ from these estimates 
we believe the determination of our environmental cost accruals is a critical accounting policy 
accruals for environmental matters are recorded when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the liability can be reasonably estimated  based upon current law and existing technologies 
these amounts  which are not discounted and are exclusive of claims against third parties  are adjusted periodically as assessments and remediation efforts progress or additional technical or legal information becomes available 
environmental exposures are difficult to assess for numerous reasons  including the identification of new sites  developments at sites resulting from investigatory studies  advances in technology  changes in environmental laws and regulations and their application  the scarcity of reliable data pertaining to identified sites  the difficulty in assessing the involvement and financial capability of other potentially responsible parties and our ability to obtain contributions from other parties and the lengthy time periods over which site remediation occurs 
it is possible that some of these matters the outcomes of which are subject to various uncertainties may be resolved unfavorably against us  which could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition 
new accounting standards as of january   we adopted statement of financial accounting standards  sfas  no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  as amended by sfas no 
and no 
see our description of derivative financial instruments below for additional information 
in june  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued sfas no 
 business combinations 
sfas no 
requires that the purchase method of accounting be used for all business combinations initiated after june  sfas no 
also specifies certain criteria that must be met in order for intangible assets acquired in a purchase method business combination to be recognized and reported apart from goodwill 
we adopted the provisions of sfas no 
on july  in june  the fasb issued sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  which became effective and was adopted by us on january  sfas no 
requires that goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite useful lives no longer be amortized  but instead tested for impairment at least annually in accordance with the provisions of this statement 
sfas no 
also requires that intangible assets with estimable useful lives be amortized over their respective estimated useful lives to their estimated residual values  and reviewed for impairment in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
accordingly  we ceased amortizing goodwill totaling million as of january  we completed an initial impairment review of our goodwill balance during the second quarter of and determined an impairment charge was not required 
if sfas no 
had been in effect for the years ended december  and  net income loss of million and million would have been million and million respectively  representing the elimination of goodwill amortization 
for the years ended december  and reported basic and diluted net income loss per share of and would have been and respectively 
in june  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for asset retirement obligations 
sfas no 
requires that the fair value of a liability for an asset retirement be recognized in the period in which it is incurred if a reasonable estimate of fair value can be made 
the associated asset retirement costs are capitalized as part of the carrying amount of the long lived asset 
this statement is effective for fiscal years beginning after june   accordingly  we will adopt this standard in the first quarter of at this time  it is not practical to reasonably estimate the impact of adopting this statement on our financial statements 
in august  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
sfas no 
addresses the financial accounting and reporting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
this statement requires that one accounting model be used for long lived assets to be disposed of by sale whether previously held and used or newly acquired 
in addition  it broadened the presentation of discontinued operations to include more disposal transactions 
this statement is effective for fiscal years beginning after december   and interim periods within those fiscal years 
at the time of adoption on january   this statement did not have a material impact on our financial statements 
in june  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities 
sfas no 
addresses the accounting and reporting for costs associated with restructuring activities 
this new standard changes the timing of the recognition of restructuring charges 
liabilities for restructuring costs will be required to be recognized when the liability is incurred rather than when we commit to the plan 
sfas no 
is effective for restructuring activity initiated after december   accordingly  we will adopt this standard in the first quarter of derivative financial instruments in  the fasb issued statement no 
accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
it requires an entity to recognize all derivatives as either assets or liabilities in the statement of financial position and measure those instruments at fair value 
the implementation date of this statement is effective for all fiscal quarters of fiscal years beginning after june  we adopted fasb no 
on january   and use hedge accounting treatment for substantially all of our business transactions whose risks are covered using derivative instruments 
sfas no 
requires that all derivative instruments be recorded on the balance sheet at their fair value 
the accounting treatment of changes in fair value is dependent upon whether or not a derivative instrument is designated as a hedge and  if so  the type of hedge 
for derivatives designated as a fair value hedge  the changes in the fair value of both the derivative and the hedged item are recognized in earnings 
for derivatives designated as a cash flow hedge  the change in fair value of the derivative is recognized in other comprehensive income until the hedged item is recognized in earnings 
ineffective portions are recognized currently in earnings 
unrealized gains and losses on derivatives not qualifying for hedge accounting are recognized currently in earnings 
upon adoption of this statement  we recorded on january   assets totaling million and liabilities totaling million with an offsetting entry to accumulated other comprehensive income loss 
the new standard does not allow for the hedge accounting treatment on the portion of any hedge that is not effective 
the ineffectiveness  which was recorded at january   was a loss of less than million 
we account for forward contracts to buy and sell foreign currencies under sfas no 
 foreign currency translation and futures contracts to reduce the impact of metal price fluctuations under sfas no 
 accounting for futures contracts 
we enter into forward sales and purchase contracts to manage currency risk resulting from purchase and sale commitments denominated in foreign currencies principally australian dollar and canadian dollar 
all of the currency derivatives expire within one year and are for united states dollar equivalents 
at december  we had a forward contract to buy a foreign currency with a face value of million and no forward contracts to sell foreign currencies 
at december   we had no forward contracts to buy or sell foreign currencies 
the fair market value of the forward contract to buy at december  approximated the carrying value 
the counterparty to the forward contract is a major financial institution 
the risk of loss to us in the event of nonperformance by a counterparty would not be significant to our financial position or results of operations 
foreign currency exchange gains losses  net of taxes  were less than million in and and less than million in at december   we had open positions in futures contracts totaling million million 
if the futures contracts had been settled on december   we would have recognized a loss of million 
gains losses on futures contracts  net of taxes  were million in  million in and less than million in we use cash flow hedges of commodities such as copper  zinc  nickel and lead to provide a measure of stability in managing our exposure to price fluctuations 
we use interest rate swaps as a means of managing interest rates on our outstanding debt obligations 
these interest rate swaps are treated as fair value hedges 
at december  and  accumulated other comprehensive income loss included a pretax decline in fair value of million and million  respectively 
in addition  the unfavorable ineffective portion of changes in fair value resulted in a million charge to earnings for the years ended december  and offsetting the above  there were assets totaling million million and liabilities of million million 
our foreign currency forward contracts and certain commodity derivatives did not meet the criteria of sfas no 
to qualify for hedge accounting 
the cumulative effect of items not qualifying for hedge accounting for was not material to earnings 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to market risk in the normal course of our business operations due to our operations in different foreign currencies  our purchases of certain commodities  and our ongoing investing and financing activities 
the risk of loss can be assessed from the perspective of adverse changes in fair values  cash flows and future earnings 
we have established policies and procedures governing our management of market risks and the use of financial instruments to manage exposure to such risks 
certain raw materials  namely copper  lead  and zinc used primarily in our metals and winchester segments products are subject to price volatility 
depending on market conditions  we may enter into futures contracts and put and call option contracts in order to reduce the impact of metal price fluctuations 
as of december   we maintained open positions on futures contracts totaling million million at december  
assuming a hypothetical increase in commodity prices  which are currently hedged  we would experience a million million at december  increase in our cost of inventory purchased  which would be offset by a corresponding increase in the value of related hedging instruments 
we are exposed to changes in interest rates primarily as a result of our investing and financing activities 
investing activity is not material to our consolidated financial position  results of operations  or cash flow 
our current debt structure is used to fund business operations and commitments from banks under our revolving credit facility are a source of liquidity 
as of december   we had long term borrowings of million million at december  of which million million at december  was issued at variable rates 
as a result of our recent fixed rate financings  we entered into floating interest rate swaps in order to manage interest expense and floating interest rate exposure to optimal levels 
we have entered into approximately million of such swaps  whereby we agree to pay variable rates to a counterparty who  in turn  pays us fixed rates 
in all cases the underlying index for the variable rates is six month london interbank offered rate libor 
accordingly  payments are settled every six months and the term of the swap is the same as the underlying debt instrument 
in december  we swapped interest payments on million principal amount of our senior notes to a floating rate at december  
in february and march  we swapped interest payments on million and million principal amount  respectively  of our senior notes to floating rates 
terms of these swaps set the floating rate at the end of each six month reset period 
therefore  the interest rates for the current period will be set on june  we estimate that the rates will be between and 
in march  we refinanced four variable rate tax exempt debt issues totalling million 
the purpose of the refinancings was to eliminate the need for letter of credit support that used our liquidity 
in order to manage interest expense and floating interest rate exposure to optimal levels  we swapped the fixed rate debt of the newly refinanced bonds back to variable rate debt through interest rate swaps 
the interest rate on the swap of million will be set on april  and is expected to be between and  while at december  interest rates on the swaps of million and million were and  respectively 
these interest rate swaps reduced interest expense  resulting in a decrease in pretax loss of million and million in and  respectively 
if the actual change in interest or commodities pricing is substantially different than expected  the net impact of interest rate risk or commodity risk on our cash flow may be materially different than that disclosed above 
we do not enter into any derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes
