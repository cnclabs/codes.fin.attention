kcc orders and debt reduction and restructuring plan on february   we filed the debt reduction plan with the kcc outlining our plans for paying down debt and restructuring the company 
the debt reduction plan calls for the sale of our non utility assets  including our interests in protection one  protection one europe and oneok 
as part of the debt reduction plan  the first quarter dividend on our common stock was reduced to per share 
in addition  the debt reduction plan contemplates the potential issuance of additional westar energy equity  if needed to further reduce debt following the disposition of all material non utility assets 
on february   the kcc issued an order in which it stated that the debt reduction plan appears to make a good faith effort to address the concerns expressed in the kcc s prior orders and that the kcc needed additional time to review the debt reduction plan prior to addressing other issues 
the kcc also stayed the requirement of a december  order that we form a utility only subsidiary for our former kpl electric utility division kpl no later than august  the debt reduction plan replaced a previous financial plan to which we devoted extensive efforts throughout to obtain kcc approval 
this plan contemplated the sale of westar industries common stock in a rights offering 
we refer you to our annual report on form k for the year ended december  and subsequent quarterly reports on form q for further information on this financial plan and related kcc orders 
the kcc rejected this plan on november  and issued an order that directed us to file a new financial plan  to reverse specified intercompany transactions  to reduce debt by million annually in each of the next two years from internally generated cash flow  and to restructure our organizational structure so that kpl would be placed in a separate subsidiary with the amount of debt held by the utility not exceeding billion 
the order further established standstill protections requiring that we seek kcc approval before we enter into certain transactions with a non utility affiliate 
following our filing of a motion for reconsideration and clarification of this order  the kcc issued an order on december  directing that no later than august   kpl be held within a separate utility only subsidiary and that the consolidated debt for all of our utility businesses not exceed billion 
the standstill provisions of the december  kcc order potentially could have had a material adverse impact on protection one 
these standstill provisions are described in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements  rate matters and regulation 
on march   the kcc issued an order permitting us to 
table of contents make the payment due to protection one in under a tax sharing agreement and to continue making loans to protection one under a revolving credit facility 
in addition  the order permitted us to reimburse protection one approximately million for information technology and aviation services  subject to certain conditions 
the kcc staff and other parties to the kcc docket considering the debt reduction plan have filed comments on the debt reduction plan 
the kcc has not yet established a procedural schedule for considering the debt reduction plan and the related comments 
we are unable to predict what action the kcc will take with respect to the debt reduction plan 
the kcc orders dated november   december   february  and march  and the debt reduction plan are exhibits to this annual report on form k 
all of such exhibits are incorporated by reference herein

changes in oneok ownership on february   oneok repurchased from westar industries  shares of its series a convertible preferred stock  which were convertible into  shares of common stock 
we received million as a result of this sale  which was previously approved by the kcc 
we anticipate using all or a portion of the net proceeds to repurchase or provide for the repayment of all of the putable callable notes and a portion of our senior unsecured notes 
westar industries also exchanged its remaining shares of series a convertible preferred stock for  new shares of oneok s series d convertible preferred stock 
oneok has agreed to file a shelf registration statement covering the series d convertible preferred and common stock held by westar industries 
future sales will be subject to various conditions including the effectiveness of such registration  the required waiver or expiration of a day lock up period ending on july   and future market conditions 
as of march   westar industries holds an approximate ownership interest in oneok  assuming conversion of the series d convertible preferred stock 
in and prior periods  we accounted for our oneok common stock investment under the equity method of accounting 
during  we will account for our oneok common stock investment as an available for sale security under statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities  and mark to market its fair value through other comprehensive income 
we will begin accounting for our oneok series d convertible preferred stock investment under this method if and when a public market for these securities develops 
sale of protection one and protection one europe on january   we announced that our board of directors authorized management to explore alternatives for disposing of our investments in protection one and protection one europe 
the debt reduction plan provides for the sale of our interests in protection one europe with a targeted closing of mid and the sale of our interest in protection one with a targeted closing by late or early as a result  these operations were classified as discontinued operations during the first quarter of pursuant to the provisions of sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment and disposal of long lived assets 
as discontinued operations  we will be required to determine the fair value of our investment  which will be the net amount we expect to realize from the sale of the investment 
the investment must be reported at the lesser of our recorded basis or the estimated fair value 
if the fair value is less than our recorded basis  we will be required to record an expense equal to the amount  which could be material  by which our basis exceeds the estimated fair value 
we solicited and received indications of value for protection one europe from potential buyers 
these indications of value are within a range we would be willing to accept 
they indicated the recorded goodwill for protection one europe had no value 
accordingly  we recorded a million impairment charge in the fourth quarter of to reflect the impairment of all remaining goodwill at protection one europe 
we are willing to accept offers in the indicated range due to our ability to use the tax loss on this sale to offset the taxes that would otherwise be 
table of contents due from our sale of other investments 
we will recognize a million tax benefit in the first quarter of when protection one europe is classified as a discontinued operation 
ongoing investigations grand jury subpoena on september   we were served with a federal grand jury subpoena by the united states attorney s office in topeka  kansas  requesting information concerning the use of aircraft and our annual shareholder meetings 
since that date  the united states attorney s office has served additional subpoenas on us and certain of our employees requesting further information concerning the use of aircraft  executive compensation arrangements with mr 
wittig  mr 
lake and other former and present officers  the proposed rights offering of westar industries stock  and the company in general 
we are providing information in response to these requests and are fully cooperating in the investigation 
we have not been informed that we are a target of the investigation 
we are unable to predict the ultimate outcome of the investigation or its impact on us 
securities and exchange commission inquiry on november   the sec notified us that it would be conducting an inquiry into the matters involved in the restatement of our first and second quarter financial statements 
our counsel has communicated with the sec about these matters and other matters within the scope of the grand jury investigation 
we are unable to predict the ultimate outcome of the inquiry or its impact on us 
special committee investigation our board of directors appointed a special committee of directors to investigate management matters and matters that are the subject of the grand jury investigation and sec inquiry 
the special committee retained counsel and other advisors 
the special committee investigation has been completed and has not resulted in adjustments to our consolidated financial statements 
ferc subpoena on december   we received a subpoena from ferc seeking details on power trades with cleco corporation cleco and its affiliates  documents concerning power transactions between our system and our marketing operations and information on power trades in which we or other trading companies acted as intermediaries 
we have provided information to ferc in response to the subpoena 
we believe that our participation in these transactions did not violate ferc rules and regulations 
however  we are unable to predict the ultimate outcome of the investigation 
see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements  ongoing investigations ferc subpoena  for additional information 
call option in august  we entered into a call option with an investment bank related to the issuance of million of our putable callable notes 
this call option is required to be settled by august through either a cash payment or a remarketing or refinancing of the putable callable notes 
the ultimate value of the call option will be based on the difference between the year united states treasury rate on august  and 
if the year united states treasury rate on august  is less than  we will have a liability to the investment bank at that time 
at december   our potential liability under the call option was million 
based on the year forward treasury rate on march  of  we would be obligated to make a cash payment of approximately million to settle the call option if we did not remarket or refinance the notes 
the amount of our liability will increase or decrease approximately million for every basis point change in the year forward treasury rate 
if settled through a remarketing or refinancing  any liability related to the call option will be amortized as a credit to interest expense over the term of the new debt 
the investment bank will price the notes to yield a market premium adequate to allow the investment bank to retain proceeds equal to the fair value of the call option at settlement 

table of contents at the time of issuance of the notes in  we were not required by generally accepted accounting principles gaap to account separately for the call option 
however  when we began retiring these notes as a part of our overall debt reduction strategy  the portion of the call option associated with the retired notes became a free standing option required to be treated as a derivative instrument under sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  as amended by sfas nos 
and collectively  sfas no 

in addition  under sfas no 
 we are required to mark to market changes in the anticipated amount of the liability related to the portion of the million in notes that have been retired so that our balance sheet reflects the current fair value of the free standing portion of the call option 
for  we recognized a loss of million  net of million tax benefit  related to the fair value of the call option associated with the putable callable notes at the time the notes were retired 
this loss is included in our consolidated statements of income as part of the gain on extinguishment of debt line item of other income 
for  we also recorded an additional non cash charge of million  net of million tax benefit  to reflect mark to market changes in the fair value of the call option associated with the retired notes 
this charge is reflected in the other line item of other income in our consolidated statements of income 
in total  the loss recorded related to the fair value of the call option for the year ended december  was million  net of million tax benefit 
we intend to repurchase or provide for the repayment of the putable callable notes on or prior to june  any repurchase of these notes will require us to mark to market additional amounts of the call option 
from january  through march   we purchased million face value of our putable callable notes 
we cannot predict changes in the market value of the call option and therefore cannot estimate amounts of future mark to market non cash charges associated with the call option or the impact on our earnings 
impairment charges effective january   we adopted sfas no 
 accounting for goodwill and other intangible assets  and sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment and disposal of long lived assets 
as a result of implementing the new standards  we recorded a charge for the first quarter of of approximately million net of tax benefit and minority interests  of which million was related to goodwill and million was related to customer accounts 
in addition  in the fourth quarter of we recorded a million impairment charge  net of tax benefit and minority interests  to reflect the additional impairment of all remaining goodwill of protection one s north america segment 
we also recorded a million impairment charge to reflect the impairment of all remaining goodwill at protection one europe 
these accounting standards  the related charges and other related information are discussed in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements  impairment charges 
work force reductions during  we reduced our utility work force by approximately employees through a voluntary separation program 
we recorded a net charge of approximately million in related to this program 
we have replaced and may continue to replace some of these employees 
for additional information  see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements  work force reductions 
ice storm in late january  a severe ice storm swept through our utility service area causing extensive damage and loss of power to numerous customers 
through december   we incurred million for restoration costs  a portion of which was capitalized 
we have deferred and recorded as a regulatory asset on our december  consolidated balance sheet restoration costs of approximately million 
we have received an accounting authority order from the kcc that allows us to accumulate and defer for potential future recovery all operating and carrying costs related to storm restoration 
critical accounting policies our discussion and analysis of results of operations and financial condition are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with gaap 
the preparation of consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  
table of contents revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
we evaluate our estimates on an on going basis  including those related to bad debts  inventories  depreciation  revenue recognition  investments  customer accounts  goodwill  intangible assets  income taxes  pensions  post retirement and post employment benefits  decommissioning of wolf creek generating station wolf creek  environmental issues  contingencies and litigation 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
note of the notes to consolidated financial statements  summary of significant accounting policies  provides a summary of the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
the following is a brief description of the more significant accounting policies and methods used by us 
regulatory accounting we currently apply accounting standards for our regulated utility operations that recognize the economic effects of rate regulation in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for the effects of certain types of regulation  and  accordingly  have recorded regulatory assets and liabilities when required by a regulatory order or based on regulatory precedent 
regulatory assets represent incurred costs that have been deferred because they are probable of future recovery in customer rates 
regulatory liabilities represent obligations to make refunds to customers for previous collections for costs that are not likely to be incurred in the future 
we have recorded these regulatory assets and liabilities in accordance with sfas no 
if we were required to terminate application of sfas no 
for all of our regulated operations  we would have to record the amounts of all regulatory assets and liabilities in our consolidated statements of income at that time 
as of december   this would reduce our earnings by approximately million  net of applicable income taxes 
sfas no 
applies to our electric utility business segment 
we do not anticipate the discontinuation of sfas no 
in the foreseeable future 
see other information electric utility stranded costs for additional discussion of the application of sfas no 
depreciation utility plant is depreciated on the straight line method at the lesser of rates set by the kcc or rates based on the estimated remaining useful lives of the assets  which are based on an average annual composite basis using group rates that approximated during  during and during in its rate order of july   the kcc extended the estimated service life for certain of our generating assets  including wolf creek and the lacygne generating station  for regulatory rate making purposes 
the estimated retirement date for wolf creek was extended from to  although our operating license for wolf creek expires in  and the estimated retirement date for lacygne was extended to  although the term of our lease for lacygne expires in on april   we adopted the new depreciation rates as prescribed in the kcc order 
we continue to depreciate wolf creek over the term of our operating license  and we continue to depreciate lacygne over the term of our lease 
we have created a regulatory asset for the amount that our depreciation expense exceeds our regulatory depreciation expense 
on an annual basis  our depreciation expense will be reduced by approximately million as a result of these extensions 
if our generating license for wolf creek is not renewed or the term of our lease for lacygne is not extended  we will need to seek relief from the kcc to recover the remaining cost of these assets 
pension benefit plans the reported costs of our pension benefit plans  which include our portion of wolf creek nuclear operating corporation s costs  are impacted by the factors listed below 

table of contents pension costs are impacted by earnings on plan assets  plan amendments  contributions made to the plan and employee demographics including age  compensation levels and employment periods 
pension costs may be significantly affected by changes in actuarial assumptions  including anticipated rates of return on plan assets and discount rates used in determining the projected benefit obligation and pension costs 
our discount rate assumption ranged from to 
our discount rate was in and ranged from to in when our discount rate assumption decreases  our expense increases 
our expected rate of return assumption ranged from to  which is consistent with long term results of the plans 
the return assumption was the same for  and the following chart reflects the annual impact of a decrease in certain assumptions 
if the discount rate increased by  the impact would be a similar amount in the opposite direction 
change in assumption annual impact on projected benefit obligation annual impact on pension liability annual impact on projected pension expense in millions discount rate decrease rate of return on plan assets decrease we recorded pension expense of million in and pension income of million in the million increase is due primarily to lower returns on plan assets and an early retirement window that was offered in and in we expect to record approximately million of pension income 
pension plan assets are primarily made up of equity and fixed income investments 
the market value of the plan assets has been affected by declines in equity markets 
at december   the fair value of pension plan assets was million 
actual return on plan assets declined by approximately million during and by approximately million during absent a substantial recovery in the equity markets  pension costs  cash funding requirements and the additional pension liability could substantially increase in future years 
see note of the notes to consolidated financials statements  employee benefit plans  for additional information 
revenue recognition energy sales energy sales are recognized as delivered and include an estimate for energy delivered but unbilled at the end of each year 
power marketing activities are accounted for under the mark to market method of accounting 
under this method  changes in the portfolio value are recognized as gains or losses in the period of change 
the net mark to market change is included in energy sales in our consolidated statements of income 
the resulting unrealized gains and losses are recorded as energy trading assets and liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets 
we primarily use quoted market prices to value our power marketing and energy trading contracts 
when market prices are not readily available or determinable  we use alternative approaches  such as model pricing 
the market prices used to value these transactions reflect our best estimate of fair values considering various factors  including closing exchange and over the counter quotations  time value and volatility factors underlying the commitments 
results actually achieved from these activities could vary materially from intended results and could unfavorably affect our financial results 

table of contents monitored services revenues monitored services revenues are recognized when security services are provided 
system installation revenues  sales revenues on equipment upgrades and direct and incremental costs of installations and sales are deferred for residential customers with monitoring service contracts 
for commercial customers  revenue recognition is dependent upon each specific customer contract 
in instances when the company passes title to a system unaccompanied by a service agreement or the company passes title at a price that it believes is unaffected by an accompanying but undelivered service  the company recognizes revenues and costs in the period incurred 
in cases where the company retains title to the system or it prices the system lower than it otherwise would because of an accompanying service agreement  the company defers and amortizes revenues and direct costs 
deferred system and upgrade installation revenues are recognized over the expected life of the customer utilizing an accelerated method for residential and commercial customers and a straight line method for protection one s multifamily customers 
deferred costs in excess of deferred revenue are recognized over the initial contract term  utilizing a straight line method  typically two to three years for residential systems  five years for commercial systems and five to ten years for multifamily systems 
to the extent deferred costs are less than deferred revenues  such costs are recognized over the estimated life of the customer relationship 
deferred revenues also result from customers who are billed for monitoring and extended service protection in advance of the period in which such services are provided  on a monthly  quarterly or annual basis 
revenues from monitoring activities are recognized in the period such services are provided 
cumulative effects of accounting changes accounting for goodwill and for the impairment and disposal of long lived assets effective january   we adopted sfas no 
and sfas no 
sfas no 
established new standards for accounting for goodwill 
sfas no 
continues to require the recognition of goodwill as an asset  but discontinued amortization of goodwill 
in addition  annual impairment tests must be performed using a fair value based approach as opposed to an undiscounted cash flow approach required under prior standards 
sfas no 
established a new approach to determining whether our customer account asset is impaired 
the approach no longer permits us to evaluate our customer account asset for impairment based on the net undiscounted cash flow stream obtained over the remaining life of goodwill associated with the customer accounts being evaluated 
rather  the cash flow stream used under sfas no 
is limited to future estimated undiscounted cash flows from assets in the asset group  which include customer accounts  the primary asset of the reporting unit  plus an estimated amount for the sale of the remaining assets within the asset group including goodwill 
if the undiscounted cash flow stream from the asset group is less than the combined book value of the asset group  then we are required to mark the customer account asset down to fair value  by way of recording an impairment  to the extent fair value is less than our book value 
to the extent net book value is less than fair value  no impairment would be recorded 
to implement the new standards  an independent appraisal firm was engaged to help management estimate the fair values of protection one s and protection one europe s goodwill and customer accounts 
based on this analysis  we recorded a charge in the first quarter of of approximately million net of tax benefit and minority interests  of which million was related to goodwill and million was related to customer accounts 
accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities effective january   we adopted sfas no 
we use derivative instruments primarily swaps  options and futures to manage interest rate exposure and the commodity price risk inherent in some of our fossil fuel and electricity purchases and sales 
under sfas no 
 all derivative instruments  including our energy trading contracts  are recorded on our consolidated balance sheet as either an asset or liability measured at fair value 
changes in a derivative s fair value must be recognized currently in earnings unless specific hedge accounting criteria are met  in which case changes are reflected in other comprehensive income 
cash flows from derivative instruments are presented in net cash flows from operating activities 

table of contents derivative instruments used to manage commodity price risk inherent in fossil fuel and electricity purchases and sales are classified as energy trading contracts on our consolidated balance sheets 
energy trading contracts representing unrealized gain positions are reported as assets  energy trading contracts representing unrealized loss positions are reported as liabilities 
prior to january   gains and losses on our derivatives used for managing commodity price risk were deferred until settlement 
these derivatives were not designated as hedges under sfas no 
accordingly  on january   we recognized an unrealized gain of million  net of million of tax 
this gain is presented on our consolidated statement of income in as a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle 
after january   changes in fair value of all derivative instruments used for managing commodity price risk that are not designated as hedges are recognized in revenue as discussed above under revenue recognition energy sales 
accounting for derivatives under sfas no 
will increase volatility of our future earnings 
revenue recognition in the fourth quarter of  we adopted staff accounting bulletin sab no 
 revenue recognition  which had a retroactive effective date of january  the impact of this accounting change generally required deferral of certain monitored security services sales for installation revenues and direct sales related expenses 
deferral of these revenues and costs is generally necessary when installation revenues have been received and a monitoring contract to provide future service is obtained 
the cumulative effect of this change in accounting principle was a charge to income in of approximately million  net of million tax benefit  and is related to changes in revenue recognition at protection one europe 
prior to the adoption of sab no 
 protection one europe recognized installation revenues and related expenses upon completion of the installation 
accounting changes accounting for energy trading contracts in october  the financial accounting standards board fasb  through the emerging issues task force eitf  issued issue no 
 which rescinded issue no 
 accounting for contracts involved in energy trading and risk management activities 
as a result  all new contracts that would otherwise have been accounted for under issue no 
and that do not fall within the scope of sfas no 
can no longer be marked to market and recorded in earnings as of october  we are not affected by this change in accounting principle and are not required to reclassify any of our contracts 
eitf issue no 
also requires that energy trading contracts and derivatives  whether settled financially or physically  be reported in the income statement on a net basis effective january  we began to classify our energy trading contracts on a net basis during the third quarter of on july   we began reporting mark to market gains and losses on energy trading contracts on a net basis  whether realized or unrealized  in our consolidated income statements 
prior to july   we reported gains on these contracts in sales and losses in cost of sales in our consolidated income statements 
the changes are reflected in our consolidated financial statements for the year ended december  prior periods shown in our consolidated financial statements have been reclassified to reflect the effect of this change and to be comparable as required by gaap 
as a result of the net presentation  we expect significant reductions in our energy revenues and expenses from those reported in prior periods  which will not affect gross profit or net income 
a summary of the effects of this change for the years ended december   and is as follows 
table of contents changes to income statements year ended december  prior to reclassifications for net presentation after reclassifications for net presentation prior to reclassifications for net presentation after reclassifications for net presentation prior to reclassifications for net presentation after reclassifications for net presentation in thousands energy sales energy cost of sales energy gross profit operating results westar energy consolidated compared to we reported a loss of per share in compared to a loss of per share in this greater loss per share was due primarily to the impairment charges related to monitored services goodwill and customer accounts 
a decline in monitored services revenues also contributed to the loss 
improved results from utility operations and declines in cost of sales and operating expenses and increases in other income from monitored services partially offset these items 
for additional information  see the segment discussions below 
compared to we reported a loss of per share in compared to earnings of per share in this decrease resulted from decreased electricity sales caused by milder weather  the decrease in electric rates in accordance with the july  kcc rate order  higher operating losses in our monitored services segment  and the fourth quarter charge related to a work force reduction 
additionally  investment earnings and extraordinary gains on the retirement of debt were lower in than in segments of business our business is segmented based on differences in products and services  production processes and management responsibility 
we have identified three reportable segments electric utility  monitored services and other 
electric utility consists of our integrated electric utility operations  including the generation  transmission and distribution of power to our retail customers in kansas and to wholesale customers  and our power marketing activities 
monitored services  including the net effect of minority interests  is comprosed of our security alarm monitoring businesses in the united states and europe 
other includes our approximate ownership interest in oneok at december   which was reduced to a interest on february  and other investments in the aggregate not material to our business or results of operations 
we manage our business segments performance based on their earnings losses before interest and taxes ebit because ebit is the primary measurement used by our management to evaluate segment performance 
our business managers have direct control over the items that affect the ebit of their segments and we therefore believe ebit is an appropriate measure of segment performance 
ebit does not represent cash flow from operations as defined by gaap  should not be construed as an alternative to operating income and is indicative neither of operating performance nor cash flows available to fund our cash needs 
items excluded from ebit are significant components in understanding and assessing our financial performance 
interest expense  income taxes  discontinued operations  cumulative effects of accounting changes and preferred dividends are items that are excluded from the calculation of ebit 
our computation of ebit may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other

we provide a reconciliation of ebit to gaap income measurements in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements  segments of business 
electric utility we supply electric energy at retail to approximately  customers in kansas including the communities of wichita  topeka  lawrence  manhattan  salina and hutchinson 
we classify our customers as residential  commercial and industrial as defined in our tariffs 
we also supply electric energy at wholesale to the electric distribution systems of kansas cities and four rural electric cooperatives 
we have contracts for the sale  purchase or exchange of wholesale electricity with other utilities 
in addition  we have power marketing operations that purchase and sell electricity in areas outside our historical service territory 
regulated electric utility sales are significantly impacted by such things as regulation including rate regulation  customer conservation efforts  wholesale demand  the overall economy of our service area  the weather and competitive forces 
our wholesale sales are impacted by demand outside our service territory  the cost of fuel and purchased power  price volatility and available generation capacity 
our electric sales for the three years ended december were as follows in thousands residential commercial industrial total network integration a other b total retail power marketing wholesale and interchange total a network integration reflects a new network transmission tariff that requires us to pay to the southwest power pool spp all expenses associated with transporting power from our generating stations 
the spp then pays us for transmitting power to the point of delivery into our retail distribution system 
these receipts from the spp are reflected in revenues under the network integration classification 
for further information  see other information electric utility network integration transmission service below 
b other includes public street and highway lighting and miscellaneous electric revenues 
the following tables show changes in electric sales volumes  as measured by thousands of megawatt hours mwh of electricity we generate  for the three years ended december no sales volumes are shown for network integration or power marketing because these activities are not related to electricity we generate

table of contents change thousands of mwh residential commercial industrial other total retail wholesale and interchange total details concerning ebit and assets attributable to our electric utility segment are summarized in the tables below for the years ended december  in thousands depreciation and amortization earnings losses before interest and taxes december  in thousands identifiable assets compared to energy sales increased million  or  due primarily to the million in new network integration tariff revenues see other information electric utility network integration transmission service  a million increase in power marketing  wholesale and interchange revenues and a million increase in residential and commercial electric sales revenues 
power marketing  wholesale and interchange revenues increased primarily as a result of increased sales volumes  offset by lower wholesale prices 
favorable weather conditions and a slight increase in the number of utility customers contributed to the increase in residential and commercial electric sales revenues  which were offset by lower retail rates and decreased industrial revenues related to weak economic conditions 
cost of sales decreased million  or  due primarily to a million decrease in purchased power expense 
purchased power expense decreased due primarily to the increased availability of our generating units and lower prices 
gross profit increased million  or  for the reasons discussed above

additionally  the number of protection one customers declined by  customers due to the conversion of accounts to a common billing and monitoring system 
this new system reports number of customer accounts on the basis of one customer for every location provided service even if protection one has separate contracts to provide multiple services at a given location

network integration transmission service effective january   we began taking network integration transmission service under the spp s open access transmission tariff 
this provides a cost effective way for us to participate in a broader market of generation resources with the possibility of lower transmission costs 
this tariff provides for a zonal rate structure  whereby transmission customers pay a pro rata share  in the form of a reservation charge  for the use of the facilities for each transmission owner that serves them 
as a result  the spp has operational control over our transmission system  although we still own our transmission assets and maintain responsibility for dispatching  maintenance and storm restoration 
currently  all revenues collected within a zone are allocated back to the transmission owner serving the zone 
since we are a transmission provider for our zone and are currently the only transmission customer taking service from that zone  we are currently being assessed of the zonal costs and receiving all of the costs back as revenue  less servicing fees 
in  these network integration transmission costs were approximately million  and the associated revenues were approximately million  for a net expense of approximately million 
the revenues received are reflected in electric operating revenues  and the related charges are expensed 
stranded costs stranded costs for a utility business are commitments or investments in  and carrying costs on  property  plant and equipment  and other regulatory assets that exceed the amount that can be recovered in a competitive market 
we currently apply accounting standards that recognize the economic effects of rate regulation and record regulatory assets and liabilities related to our electric utility operations 
if we determine that we no longer meet the criteria of sfas no 
 we may have a material non cash charge to earnings 
reasons for discontinuing sfas no 
accounting treatment include increasing competition that restricts our ability to charge prices needed to recover costs already incurred or a significant change by regulators from a cost based rate regulation to another form of rate regulation 
we periodically review sfas no 
criteria and believe our net regulatory assets  including those related to generation  are probable of future recovery 
if we discontinue sfas no 
accounting treatment based upon competitive or other events  such as successful municipalization by areas we serve  the value of our net regulatory assets and our utility plant investments  particularly wolf creek  may be significantly impacted 
regulatory changes could adversely impact our ability to recover our investment in these assets 
as of december   we have recorded regulatory assets that are currently subject to recovery in future rates of approximately million 
of this amount  million is a receivable for income tax benefits previously passed on to customers 
the remainder of the regulatory assets are items that may give rise to stranded costs  including debt issuance costs  deferred employee benefit costs  deferred plant costs and coal contract settlement costs 
in a competitive environment  we may not be able to fully recover our entire investment in wolf creek 
kge presently owns of wolf creek 
we may also have stranded costs from an inability to recover our environmental remediation costs and long term fuel contract costs in a competitive environment 
if we determine that we have stranded costs and we cannot recover our investment in these assets  our future net utility income will be lower than our historical net utility income has been unless we compensate for the loss of such income with other measures

the epa contends that power plants are required to update emission controls at the time of major maintenance or capital activity 
we believe that maintenance and capital activities performed at our power plants are generally routine in nature and are typical for the industry 
we are complying with this information request  but cannot predict the outcome of this investigation at this time 
should the epa determine to take action  the resulting additional costs to comply could be material 
we would expect to seek recovery through rates of any settlement amounts 
the epa has initiated civil enforcement actions against other unaffiliated utilities as part of its initiative 
settlement agreements entered into in connection with some of these actions have provided for expenditures to be made over extended time periods 
superfund sites in december  we were identified as one of more than  potentially responsible parties at an epa superfund site in kansas city  kansas kansas city site 
based upon previous experience and the limited nature of our business transactions with the previous owners of the site  our obligation  if any  at the kansas city site is not expected to have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations 
nuclear decommissioning decommissioning is a nuclear industry term for the permanent shutdown of a nuclear power plant and the removal of radioactive components in accordance with nuclear regulatory commission nrc requirements 
the nrc will terminate a plant s license and release the property for unrestricted use when a company has reduced the residual radioactivity of a nuclear plant to a level mandated by the nrc 
the nrc requires companies with nuclear plants to prepare formal financial plans to fund decommissioning 
these plans are designed so that funds required for decommissioning will be accumulated prior to the termination of the license of the related nuclear power plant 
we accrue decommissioning costs over the expected life of the wolf creek generating facility 
the accrual is based on estimated unrecovered decommissioning costs  which consider inflation over the remaining estimated life of the generating facility and are net of expected earnings on amounts recovered from customers and deposited in an external trust fund 
the kcc reviews our decommissioning fund financial plans in two phases 
phase one is the approval of the decommissioning study  the current year dollar amount and the future year dollar amount 
phase two is the filing of a funding schedule by the owner of the nuclear facility detailing its plans of how to fund the future year dollar amount for the pro rata share of the plant 
on february   we filed an application with the kcc to modify the funding schedule to reflect an assumed life of wolf creek through see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements  rate matters and regulation 
this modification was granted on march  the filing reflects the current estimate in dollars of million  but a future estimate in through of billion 
an updated decommissioning and dismantlement cost estimate was filed with the kcc on august  costs outlined by this study were developed to decommission wolf creek following a shutdown 
the analyses relied upon the site specific  technical information developed in  updated to reflect current plant conditions and operating assumptions 
based on this study  our share of wolf creek s decommissioning costs  under the immediate dismantlement method  is estimated to be approximately million in dollars 
these costs include decontamination  dismantling and site restoration and are not inflated  escalated  or discounted over the period of expenditure 
we anticipate a kcc order on the august decommissioning study in the second quarter of the actual decommissioning costs may vary from the estimates because of changes in technology and changes in costs for labor  materials and equipment 

table of contents we will file a funding schedule to reflect the kcc s order on the august decommissioning study by the end of the second quarter of and anticipate a kcc order on the funding schedule in the third quarter of decommissioning costs are currently being charged to operating expense in accordance with the july  kcc rate order as modified by the kcc s approval of the march  funding schedule 
electric rates charged to customers provide for recovery of these decommissioning costs over the life of wolf creek as determined by the kcc through the nrc requires that funds to meet its decommissioning funding assurance requirement be in our decommissioning fund by the time our license expires in we believe that the kcc approved funding level will be sufficient to meet the nrc minimum financial assurance requirement 
however  our results of operations would be materially adversely affected if we are not allowed to recover the full amount of the funding requirement 
amounts expensed approximated million in and will remain unchanged through  subject to the august decommissioning cost review and revised funding schedule to be filed in the second quarter of these amounts are deposited in an external trust fund 
the average after tax expected return on trust assets is 
our investment in the decommissioning fund is recorded at fair value  including reinvested earnings 
it approximated million at december  and million at december  the balance in the trust fund decreased from to due to the decline in the market value of equity securities held in the trust 
trust fund earnings accumulate in the fund balance and increase the recorded decommissioning liability 
asset retirement obligations in june  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for asset retirement obligations 
sfas no 
provides accounting requirements for the recognition and measurement of liabilities associated with the retirement of tangible long lived assets 
under the standard  these liabilities will be recognized at fair value as incurred and capitalized and depreciated over the appropriate period as part of the cost of the related tangible long lived assets 
the adoption of sfas no 
will not impact income 
any income effects are offset by a regulatory asset created pursuant to sfas no 
retirement obligations associated with long lived assets included within the scope of sfas no 
are those for which a legal obligation exists under enacted laws  statutes  written or oral contracts  including obligations arising under the doctrine of promissory estoppel 
we adopted sfas no 
on january   which required us to recognize and estimate the liability for our share of the estimated cost to decommission wolf creek 
sfas no 
requires the recognition of the present value of the asset retirement obligation we incurred at the time wolf creek was placed into service in on january   we recorded an asset retirement obligation of million 
in addition  we increased our property and equipment balance  net of accumulated depreciation  by million 
these amounts were estimated based on the calculation guidelines of sfas no 
we also established a regulatory asset for million  which represents the accretion of the liability since and the increased depreciation expense associated with the increase in plant 
monitored services impairment charges effective january   we adopted sfas no 
and sfas no 
sfas no 
establishes new standards for accounting for goodwill 
sfas no 
continues to require the recognition of goodwill as an asset  but discontinues amortization of goodwill 
in addition  annual impairment tests must be performed using a fair value based approach as opposed to an undiscounted cash flow approach required under prior standards 
the completion of the impairment tests  based upon a valuation performed by an independent appraisal firm  as of january   indicated that the carrying values of goodwill at protection one and protection one europe had been impaired and impairment charges were recorded as discussed below 
another impairment test of protection one s goodwill and customer accounts was completed as of july  the date selected for protection one s annual impairment test  with the independent appraisal firm providing 
table of contents the valuation of the estimated fair value of protection one s reporting units  and no impairment was indicated 
protection one s stock price declined after regulatory orders were issued see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements  rate matters and regulation  including the kcc s december   order 
as a result  protection one retained the independent appraisal firm to perform an additional valuation of protection one s reporting units so it could perform an impairment test as of december   which resulted in the additional impairment charge discussed below 
sfas no 
established a new approach to determining whether our customer account asset is impaired 
the approach no longer permits us to evaluate our customer account asset for impairment based on the net undiscounted cash flow stream obtained over the remaining life of goodwill associated with the customer accounts being evaluated 
rather  the cash flow stream used under sfas no 
is limited to future estimated undiscounted cash flows from assets in the asset group  which include customer accounts  the primary asset of the reporting unit  plus an estimated amount for the sale of the remaining assets within the asset group including goodwill 
if the undiscounted cash flow stream from the asset group is less than the combined book value of the asset group  then we are required to mark the customer account asset down to fair value  by recording an impairment  to the extent fair value is less than our book value 
to the extent net book value is less than fair value  no impairment would be recorded 
the new rule substantially reduces the net undiscounted cash flows for customer account impairment evaluation purposes as compared to the previous accounting rules 
the undiscounted cash flow stream has been reduced from the year remaining life of the goodwill to the nine year remaining life of customer accounts for impairment evaluation purposes 
using these new guidelines  we determined that there was an indication of impairment of the carrying value of the customer accounts and an impairment charge was recorded as discussed below 
to implement the new standards  an independent appraisal firm was engaged to help management estimate the fair values of protection one s and protection one europe s goodwill and customer accounts 
based on this analysis  we recorded a charge in the first quarter of of approximately million net of tax benefit and minority interests  of which million was related to goodwill and million was related to customer accounts 
the impairment charge for goodwill recorded in the first quarter of is reflected in our consolidated statement of income as a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle 
the impairment charge for customer accounts is reflected in our consolidated statement of income as an operating expense 
these impairment charges reduce the recorded value of these assets to their estimated fair values at january  protection one completed an additional impairment test of goodwill as of december  we recorded an impairment charge of million  net of tax benefit and minority interests  in the fourth quarter of to reflect the impairment of all remaining goodwill of protection one s north america segment  which is reflected in our consolidated statement of income as an operating expense 
we solicited and received indications of value for protection one europe from potential buyers 
these indications of value are within a range we would be willing to accept 
they indicated the recorded goodwill of protection one europe had no value 
accordingly  we recorded a million impairment charge in the fourth quarter of to reflect the impairment of all remaining goodwill at protection one europe  which is reflected in our consolidated statement of income as an operating expense 
we are willing to accept offers in the indicated range due to our ability to use the tax loss on this sale to offset the taxes that would otherwise be due from our sale of other investments 
we will recognize a million tax benefit in the first quarter of when protection one europe is classified as a discontinued operation 

table of contents these charges for the year ended december   are detailed as follows impairment of goodwill impairment of customer accounts total in thousands protection one protection one europe total pre tax impairment income tax benefit minority interest net charge the investment at cost in customer accounts at december  was billion and at december  was approximately billion 
accumulated amortization of the investment in customer accounts at december  was million and at december  was million 
we recorded approximately million of customer account amortization expense during the year ended december   million during the same period of and million during the year ended december  customer account amortization expense is reduced primarily as a result of the impairment charge that reduced our customer account balance 
the table below reflects the estimated aggregate customer account amortization expense for and each of the four succeeding fiscal years 
in thousands estimated amortization expense we are required to perform impairment tests for long lived assets prospectively for our monitored services segment as long as it continues to incur recurring losses or for other matters that may negatively impact its businesses 
goodwill will be required to be tested upon certain triggering events  which include recurring operating losses  adverse business conditions  adverse regulatory rulings  declines in market values and other matters that negatively impact value 
given the potentially negative implications from the kcc s december  order  and the subsequent decline in protection one s stock price  protection one tested its goodwill for impairment at december   which resulted in the additional impairment charge discussed above 
if future impairment tests for either goodwill or customer accounts indicate fair value is less than book value  we will be required to recognize additional impairment charges on these assets in the future 
any such impairment charges could be material 
change in estimate of customer life during the first quarter of  protection one evaluated the estimated life and amortization rates for customer accounts  based on the results of a lifing study performed by a third party appraisal firm in the first quarter of the report showed protection one s north america customer pool can expect a declining revenue stream over the next years with an estimated average remaining life of years 
protection one s multifamily pool can expect a declining revenue stream over the next years with an estimated average remaining life of years 
taking into account the results of the lifing study and the inherent expected declining revenue streams for the north america and multifamily customer pools  in particular the first five years  protection one adjusted the rate of amortization on customer accounts for its north america and multifamily customer pools to better match the rate and period of amortization expense with the expected decline in revenues 
in the first quarter of  protection one changed its amortization rate for its north america pool to a year declining balance method from a year declining balance method 
for the multifamily pool  protection one will continue to amortize on a straight line basis utilizing a shorter nine year life 
protection one accounted for these amortization changes prospectively beginning january   as a change in estimate 
these changes in estimates increased amortization expense for the year ended december  by approximately million  net of million tax 
attrition customer attrition has a direct impact on the results of our monitored services operations since it affects its revenues  amortization expense and cash flow 
attrition is defined as a ratio  the numerator of which is the gross 
table of contents number of lost customer accounts for a given period  net of the adjustments described below  and the denominator of which is the average number of accounts for a given period 
in some instances  estimates are used to derive attrition data 
adjustments are made to lost accounts primarily for the net change  either positive or negative  in the wholesale base and for accounts that are covered under a purchase price holdback and are put back to the seller 
the gross accounts lost during a period are reduced by the amount of the guarantee provided for in the purchase agreements with sellers 
in some cases  the amount of the purchase holdback may be less than actual attrition experience 
adjustments to lost accounts for purchase holdbacks is expected to be lower in the future because protection one is purchasing fewer accounts in the types of transactions that create holdbacks and it has extinguished a substantial portion of its purchase holdback reserve 
the gross accounts lost during a period are not reduced by move in accounts  which are accounts where a new customer moves into the premises equipped with a protection one security system and vacated by a prior customer  or competitive takeover accounts  which are accounts where the owner of a premise monitored by a competitor requests that we provide monitoring services 
actual attrition experience shows that the relationship period with any individual customer can vary significantly 
customers service can be discontinued for a variety of reasons  including relocation  non payment  customers perception of value and competition 
a portion of the acquired customer base can be expected to discontinue service every year 
any significant change in the pattern of historical attrition experience would have a material effect on our results of operations from monitored services 
attrition is monitored each quarter based on an annualized and trailing twelve month basis 
this method utilizes the average customer account base for the applicable period in measuring attrition 
therefore  in periods of customer account growth  customer attrition may be understated and in periods of customer account decline  customer attrition may be overstated 
customer attrition for the years ended december   and is summarized below 
customer account attrition december  december  december  annualized fourth quarter trailing twelve month annualized fourth quarter trailing twelve month annualized fourth quarter trailing twelve month protection one protection one europe our monitored services segment had a net decrease of  customers from december  to december  attrition decreased at protection one in compared to for a variety of reasons  including an aggressive campaign dubbed save our subscribers  designed to retain existing customers 
an emphasis on customer service and attrition reduction by branch and monitoring center personnel

we reimbursed protection one million for tax year and million for tax year on march   the kcc issued an order that allows us to make a cash payment to protection one of approximately million for tax year 
table of contents financial advisory services protection one entered into an agreement pursuant to which it paid a quarterly fee to westar industries for financial advisory services equal to of its consolidated total assets at the end of each quarter 
this agreement was approved by the independent members of protection one s board of directors 
protection one incurred approximately million of such fees during the year ended december  these amounts have been eliminated in our consolidated financial statements

no additional loans will be made as a result of federal legislation that became effective july  transactions between westar energy and kge we perform kge s cash management function  including cash receipts and disbursements 
an intercompany account is used to record net receipts and disbursements between us and kge 
kge s net amount payable from affiliates approximated million at december   and the net amount receivable from affiliates approximated million at december  these intercompany charges have been eliminated in consolidation 
we provide all employees utilized by kge 
we allocate certain operating expenses to kge 
these expenses are allocated  depending on the nature of the expense  based on allocation studies  net investment  number of customers  and or other appropriate factors 
we believe such allocation procedures are reasonable 
transactions with protection one during the fourth quarter of  kge entered into an option agreement to sell an office building located in downtown wichita  kansas  to protection one for approximately million 
the sales price was determined by management based on three independent appraisers findings 
this transaction was completed during june we recognized a loss of million on this transaction and we expected to realize annual operating cost savings of approximately million 
the cost savings will be treated as a regulatory liability in accordance with a march   kcc order 
for the year ended december   we recorded million in cost savings as a regulatory liability 
protection one europe on february   westar industries purchased the european operations of protection one  and certain investments held by a subsidiary of protection one  for an aggregate purchase price of million 
westar industries paid approximately million in cash and transferred protection one debt securities with a market value of approximately million to protection one 
cash proceeds from the transaction were used to reduce the outstanding balance owed to westar industries on protection one s revolving credit facility 
no gain or loss was recorded on this intercompany transaction and the net book value of the assets was unaffected 
hedging activity we use financial and physical instruments to hedge a portion of our anticipated fossil fuel needs 
at the time we enter into these transactions  we are unable to determine what the value will be when the agreements are actually settled 

table of contents in an effort to mitigate fuel commodity price market risk  we use hedging arrangements to reduce our exposure to increased coal  natural gas and oil prices 
our future exposure to changes in fossil fuel prices will be dependent upon the market prices and the extent and effectiveness of any hedging arrangements into which we enter 
see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements  financial instruments  energy trading and risk management derivative instruments and hedge accounting hedging activities  for detailed information regarding hedging relationships and an interest rate swap we entered into during the third quarter of item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market price risks our hedging and trading activities involve risks  including commodity price risk  equity price risk  interest rate risk and credit risk 
commodity price risk is the risk that changes in commodity prices may impact the price at which we are able to buy and sell electricity and purchase fuels for our generating units 
these commodities have experienced price volatility in the past and can be expected to do so in the future 
this volatility may increase or decrease future earnings 
equity price risk is the risk we may be exposed to based on changes in the market value of our equity securities 
interest rate risk is the risk of loss associated with movements in market interest rates 
during  we used an interest rate swap to manage our exposure to variable interest rates 
the swap converted million of variable rate debt to a fixed rate 
in the future  we may continue to use swaps or other financial instruments to manage interest rate risk 
credit risk is the risk of loss resulting from non performance by a counterparty of its contractual obligations 
we have exposure to credit risk and counterparty default through our retail  power marketing and trading activities 
we maintain credit policies intended to reduce overall credit risk and actively monitor these policies to reflect changes and scope of operations 
we employ additional credit risk control mechanisms when appropriate  such as letters of credit  parental guarantees and standardized master netting agreements from counterparties that allow for some of the offsetting of positive and negative exposures 
credit exposure is monitored and  when necessary  the activity with a specific counterparty is limited until credit enhancement is provided 
results actually achieved from hedging and trading activities could vary materially from intended results and could materially affect our financial results depending on the success of our credit risk management efforts 
commodity price exposure we engage in both financial and physical trading to manage our commodity price risk 
we trade electricity  coal  natural gas and oil 
we use a variety of financial instruments  including forward contracts  options and swaps and trade energy commodity contracts daily 
we also use hedging techniques to manage overall fuel expenditures 
we procure physical product under fixed price agreements and spot market transactions 
we are involved in trading activities primarily to reduce risk from market fluctuations  capitalize on our market knowledge and enhance system reliability 
net open positions exist  or are established  due to the origination of new transactions and our assessment of  and response to  changing market conditions 
to the extent we have open positions  we are exposed to the risk that changing market prices could have a material  adverse impact on our financial position or results of operations 
we manage and measure the market price risk exposure of our trading portfolio using a variance covariance value at risk var model 
var measures the predicted worst case loss at a specific confidence level over a specified period of time 
in addition to var  we employ additional risk control processes such as stress testing  daily loss limits  and commodity position limits 
we expect to use the same var model and control processes in the use of the var method requires a number of key assumptions  including the selection of a confidence level for losses and the estimated holding period 
we express var as a potential dollar loss based on a 
table of contents confidence level using a one day holding period 
the calculation includes derivative commodity instruments used for both trading and risk management purposes 
the var amounts for and were as follows in thousands high low average we have considered a number of risks and costs associated with the future contractual commitments included in our energy portfolio 
these risks include credit risks associated with the financial condition of counterparties  product location basis differentials and other risks 
declines in the creditworthiness of our counterparties could have a material adverse impact on our overall exposure to credit risk 
we maintain credit policies with regard to our counterparties that  in management s view  reduce overall credit risk 
there can be no assurance that the employment of var  or other risk management tools we employ  will eliminate the risk of loss 
we are also exposed to commodity price changes outside of trading activities 
we use derivatives for non trading purposes and a mix of various fuel types primarily to reduce exposure relative to the volatility of market and commodity prices 
the wholesale power market is extremely volatile in price and supply 
this volatility impacts our costs of power purchased and our participation in power trades 
if we were unable to generate an adequate supply of electricity for our native load customers  we would purchase power in the wholesale market to the extent it is available or economically feasible to do so and or implement curtailment or interruption procedures as allowed for in our tariffs and terms and conditions of service 
to the extent open positions exist in our power marketing portfolio  we are exposed to changing market prices that may adversely impact our financial position and results of operations 
the increased expenses or loss of revenues associated with this could be material and adverse to our consolidated results of operations and financial condition 
from to  we experienced a decrease in the average price per mwh of electricity purchased for utility operations 
purchased power market volatility could be greater than the average price decrease indicates 
if we were to have a increase in our purchased power price from to  given the amount of power purchased for utility operations during  we would have exposure of approximately million of operating income 
due to the volatility of the power market  past prices cannot be used to predict future prices 
we use a mix of various fossil fuel types  including coal  natural gas and oil  to operate our system  which helps lessen our risk associated with any one fuel type 
a significant portion of our coal requirements are under long term contract  which removes most of the price risk associated with this commodity type 
during  we experienced an approximate increase  or per mmbtu  in our average cost for natural gas purchased for utility operations 
we decreased our gas usage by million mmbtu compared to the amount burned in due to the volatility of natural gas prices  we have begun to increasingly utilize our ability to switch to lower cost fuel types as the market allows 
we expect that exposure to natural gas price changes will not be material in due to our natural gas hedge that has fixed the price of our gas through july we use uranium to fuel our nuclear generating station and have on hand or under contract of wolf creek s uranium  uranium conversion and uranium enrichment needs for we have on hand or under contract of the uranium and uranium conversion and of the uranium enrichment required for operation of wolf creek through march the balance is expected to be obtained through spot market and contract purchases  which means we will be exposed to the price risk associated with these components 
additional factors that affect our commodity price exposure are the quantity and availability of fuel used for generation and the quantity of electricity customers will consume 
quantities of fossil fuel used for generation could vary dramatically from year to year based on the individual fuel s availability  price  deliverability  unit outages and nuclear refueling 
our customers electricity usage could also vary dramatically year to year based on the weather or other factors 

table of contents interest rate exposure we had approximately million of variable rate debt and current maturities of fixed rate debt as of december  a basis point change in each debt series benchmark rate  used to set the rate for such series would impact net income on an annualized basis by approximately million after tax 
under sfas no 
 we are required to mark to market changes in the anticipated amount of the liability related to the portion of the million in notes that have been retired so that our consolidated balance sheet reflects the current fair value of the free standing portion of the call option as discussed in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements  call option 
the amount of our liability will increase or decrease approximately million for every basis point change in the year forward treasury rate 
related to the call option  for the year ended december   we recorded a non cash mark to market charge of million  net of million tax benefit  to reflect the fair value of the call option associated with the retired notes 
we intend to repurchase or provide for the repayment of all or a portion of these notes on or prior to june  any repurchase of these notes will require us to mark to market additional amounts of the call option 
we cannot predict changes in the market value of the call option and therefore cannot estimate amounts of future mark to market non cash charges associated with the call option or the impact on our earnings 
foreign currency exchange rates we have foreign operations with functional currencies other than the us dollar 
as of december   the unrealized loss on currency translation was approximately million pretax 
a change in the currency exchange rates would not have a material effect on other comprehensive income 
equity price risk during  we were not substantially exposed to equity price risk 
as discussed in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements  changes in oneok ownership  we sold a substantial portion of our equity investment in oneok 
during  we will account for our oneok common stock investment as an available for sale security under sfas no 
 accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities and mark to market its fair value through other comprehensive income
