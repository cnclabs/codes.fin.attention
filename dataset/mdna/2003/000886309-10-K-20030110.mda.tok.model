item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations of this form k  we restructured our business in fiscal and in response to a significant decline in capital spending by our customers 
through this restructuring  we also sought to better position ourselves for profitable growth in the market segments where we believe we have a sustainable competitive advantage 
the six areas of our strategic focus are broadband connectivity products  ip cable equipment  dsl equipment  oss software  systems integration services  and products to extend the coverage of existing wireless networks 
the most significant strategic change we made in was our decision to withdraw from the optical components business  an area that was the subject of significant oversupply and intense competition 
in our restructured company  key components of our long term strategy include gaining market share in our areas of strategic focus  increasing our global market penetration  leveraging our technological capabilities across our various product groups  and lowering our cost structure to compete more effectively 
gaining market share 
in the current environment of reduced capital spending by communication service providers  we believe that we must gain market share in order to grow our business 
we intend to increase our market share by offering a compelling value proposition through a combination of product functionality  quality  price competitiveness and world class customer service  with particular emphasis on helping our customers lower their overall cost of providing communication services to end user customers 
increase our global market penetration 
we believe that significant opportunities for communications equipment vendors exist outside the united states as a result of global deregulation  substantial expansion or enhancement of communications services by non us providers  and the global expansion of multinational communications service providers 
our strategy is to grow our international business by aggressively pursuing and focusing our resources on high potential opportunities  leveraging our existing customer relationships  developing additional international distribution channels and seeking strategic alliances 
where appropriate  we have established our presence in international markets with manufacturing facilities  sales and technical support offices and systems integration capabilities to serve our customers outside the united states 
leverage our technological capabilities across our various product groups 
we have developed substantial expertise in copper twisted pair  coaxial and fiber optic connectivity  wireless  ip cable data telephony and dsl technologies  software products and systems integration services 
we have built these core competencies through internal development  acquisitions and technology licensing arrangements 
our strategy is to leverage our core competencies effectively across all of our product and service offerings in order to provide our customers new products with enhanced features  functions  cost effectiveness and network management tools for their evolving internet  data  video and voice service offerings 
this strategy also allows us to offer our customers custom tailored solutions that enable them to scale network offerings  more fully automate operations and accelerate service and revenue growth 
lowering our cost structure 
we intend to continue our efforts to lower our overall cost structure to become or remain a low cost industry leader in selected product areas  while also maintaining our reputation for high quality products and services and world class customer service 
our ability to implement our strategy effectively is subject to numerous uncertainties  many of which are described in exhibit a to this form k 
we cannot assure you that our efforts will be successful

product review and development as part of our ongoing business  we continually review individual product lines with attention to overlap and profitability 
we intend to add or eliminate product lines as appropriate to optimize our financial performance 
elimination of one or more product lines could result in charges associated with the disposition of manufacturing assets and facilities and possible workforce reductions 
sales and marketing we sell our products to customers in three primary markets the us public communications network market  which includes the regional bell operating companies rbocs  other telephone companies  long distance carriers  wireless service providers  cable television operators and other domestic public network providers  the us private and governmental markets  which include business customers and governmental agencies that own and operate their own internet  data  video and voice networks for internal use  and the public and private network markets outside of the united states 
we also sell products for each of these customer groups to oems of communications equipment 
the majority of our sales are made to telecommunications service providers  and one customer  verizon communications  inc  accounted for of our sales in fiscal financial information concerning sales of our products by segment and geographic area is contained in note to the consolidated financial statements in item of this form k 
due to the generally short lead times between receipt of a customer order and the time we ship the product  our committed backlog of orders is not a material portion of our annual revenues  and thus is not a meaningful indicator of future revenues 
we market our products outside the united states  primarily to telephone operating companies  cable television operators and wireless service providers for public communications networks located in africa  asia  australia  canada  europe  latin america  the middle east and the pacific 
our non us net sales accounted for approximately  and of our net sales in fiscal  and  respectively  and are not concentrated in any one country 
a substantial portion of our sales are made by a direct sales force 
we maintain sales offices throughout the united states and in asia  australia  canada  europe  latin america  the middle east and the pacific 
in the united states  our products are sold directly by our sales personnel as well as through value added resellers and distributors 
outside the united states  our products are sold directly by our field sales personnel and by independent sales representatives and distributors  as well as through other public and private network providers that distribute products outside the united states 
we maintain a customer service group that supports our field sales personnel 
the customer service group is responsible for application engineering  customer training  entering orders and supplying delivery status information 
we also have a field service engineering group that provides on site service to customers 
research and development we believe that our future success depends on our ability to adapt to the rapidly changing communications environment  to maintain our significant expertise in core technologies and to continue to meet and anticipate our customers needs 
we continually review and evaluate technological changes affecting the communications market and invest in applications based research and development 
as part of our long term strategy  we intend to continue an ongoing program of new product development that combines internal development efforts with acquisitions  strategic alliances and licensing or marketing arrangements relating to new products and technologies from sources outside adc 
our expenses relating to internal research and development activities were million  million and million in fiscal  and  respectively 
in recent years  increasingly significant portions of new communications equipment purchased by public network providers and private network customers have employed optical transmission  digital  semiconductor  wireless and broadband copper based technologies 
in the future  we believe that these purchasing trends will include ip technology and increasingly sophisticated  software intensive oss and network management systems 
as a result  our internal and external product development activities are primarily directed at the following areas the continued development of our ip based products  such as cuda systems for internet  data  video and voice services  the development of network oss software including billing  customer management  network performance and service assurance software  the continued development of our dsl systems for integrated internet  data  video and voice applications over the existing copper based telecommunications infrastructure  and the incorporation of atm and ip technologies into other internet  data  video and voice products for public communications networks 
new product development often requires long term forecasting of market trends  the development and implementation of new processes and technologies and a substantial capital commitment 
due to the uncertainties inherent in each of these elements  we cannot assure you that we will develop any new products on a timely basis or at all 
moreover  we cannot assure you that any new products we develop will achieve market acceptance 
competition competition in the communications equipment industry is intense  particularly in light of reduced spending levels by our customers 
many of our competitors have more extensive engineering  manufacturing  marketing  financial and personnel resources than we have 
in addition  rapid technological developments within the communications industry have resulted in frequent changes among our group of competitors 
currently  our primary competitors include for broadband infrastructure and access products adtran  allen telecom  arris group  avaya  cisco systems  corning  eci telecom  lucent technologies  motorola and telect 
for integrated solutions products and services alcoa fujikura  amdocs  bechtel  convergys  greenwoods  lucent technologies  portal software  spie and tti 
we believe that our success in competing with other communications product manufacturers depends primarily on the following factors our engineering  manufacturing  sales and marketing skills  the price  quality and reliability of our products  and our delivery and service capabilities 
although the market for our products historically has not been characterized by significant price competition  we have experienced increasing pricing pressures from competitors in some of the markets for our products  particularly in dsl products and systems integration services  as well as general pricing pressure from our customers as part of their cost reduction efforts 
we believe that technological change  the increasing addition of internet  data  video and voice services to integrated broadband  multimedia networks  continuing regulatory changes and industry consolidation or new entrants will continue to cause rapid evolution in the competitive environment of the communications equipment market 
at this time it is difficult to predict the full scope and nature of this evolution 
so long as capital is accessible or our competitors are able to maintain adequate capital resources  we believe that the rapid technological changes that characterize the communications equipment industry will continue to make the markets in which we compete attractive to new entrants or delay the exit of weak competitors  respectively 
increased competition could result in price reductions  reduced margins and the loss of market share 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to compete successfully with existing or new competitors 
competitive pressures may materially and adversely affect our business  operating results or financial condition 
manufacturing and suppliers we manufacture a wide variety of products that are fabricated  assembled and tested in our own facilities in the united states 
in an effort to reduce costs and improve customer service  we also utilize production facilities outside the united states in addition to sourcing key components and raw materials outside the united states 
the manufacturing process for our electronic products consists primarily of assembly and testing of electronic systems built from fabricated parts  printed circuit boards and electronic components 
the manufacturing process for our connectivity products is completely vertically integrated and consists primarily of fabrication of jacks  plugs and other basic components from raw materials  assembly of components and testing 
our sheet metal  plastic molding  stamping and machining capabilities permit us to configure components to customer specifications  provide competitive lead times and control production costs 
we also utilize several outsource manufacturing companies to manufacture  assemble and test certain of our products  principally within our ip cable  dsl and wireless product lines 
we estimate that products obtained from outsourced manufacturers accounted for approximately of our total revenues in fiscal we purchase raw materials and component parts from many suppliers 
these purchases consist primarily of copper wire  optical fiber  steel  brass  nickel steel alloys  gold  plastics  printed circuit boards  solid state components  discrete electronic components and similar items 
although many of these items are single sourced  we have experienced no significant difficulties to date in obtaining adequate quantities 
these circumstances could change  however  and we cannot guarantee that sufficient quantities or quality of raw materials and component parts will be as readily available in the future or  if available  that we will be able to obtain them at favorable prices 
proprietary rights we own a portfolio of us and foreign patents relating to our products 
these patents  in the aggregate  constitute a valuable asset 
we do not believe  however  that our business is dependent upon any single patent or any particular group of related patents 
we have registered the initials adc alone and in conjunction with specific designs as trademarks in the united states and various foreign countries 
employees as of october   we employed approximately  people 
during the restructuring of our business in fiscal  we reduced our number of employees by approximately  through involuntary workforce reductions  unreplaced attrition and as a result of our divestitures 
we consider relations with our employees to be good

item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations marketplace conditions our operating results during fiscal and were affected adversely by the downturn in general economic conditions  and a particularly strong downturn in the communications equipment industry 
in this economic environment  many of our customers have deferred capital spending  reduced their equipment purchases and announced plans to further reduce capital expenditures in fiscal a majority of our revenues continue to be derived from telecommunication service providers 
these customers in particular have greatly reduced their spending on communications equipment  resulting in significant reductions in our revenues 
moreover  some of our customers have experienced serious financial difficulties  which in some cases resulted in bankruptcy filings or cessation of operations 
when the downturn in communications equipment spending first became evident in fiscal  we implemented a restructuring plan to reduce operating expenses and capital spending and to narrow the focus of our business 
as it became evident in fiscal that our industry was experiencing an even more pronounced and prolonged economic downturn  we took additional measures to realize further cost savings and focus on the following six strategic areas broadband connectivity products  ip cable equipment  dsl equipment  oss software  systems integration services  and wireless network coverage products 
our actions to date have included the sale or closure of non strategic product lines 
in fiscal  we sold our broadcast tv video routing and a portion of our optical components product lines 
we also closed down our avidia multiplexer and optical laser product lines and halted further development of the us version of our ian product line 
in fiscal  we sold our cable broadcast tv transmission  broadband wireless transmission  enterprise access products  wireless components  and enhanced services software product lines 
we also sold a portion of our optical components product line and closed down our cellworx transport product line 
significant reductions in discretionary spending 
the disposition of surplus equipment 
consolidation of facilities 
substantial reductions in our workforce 
despite these restructuring actions  we may be unable to meet expected revenue levels in any particular quarter  in which case our operating results could be materially adversely affected if we are unable to further reduce our expenses in time to counteract such a decline in revenues 
our ability to grow our business is dependent on our ability to effectively compete with our current products and services  our ability to develop and introduce new products  and on the growth of the communications equipment and services market 
the communications equipment industry is highly competitive  and we cannot guarantee that our new or enhanced products and services will meet with market acceptance or be profitable 
growth in the market for broadband communications products and services depends on a number of factors  including the availability of capital to communications service providers  the amount of capital expenditures by communications service providers  new regulatory and legal requirements and end user demands for internet  data  video  voice and other communications services 
our results of operations have historically been subject to seasonal factors  with stronger demand for our products during our fourth fiscal quarter ending october primarily as a result of customer budget cycles and our fiscal year end incentives and weaker demand for our products during our first fiscal quarter ending january primarily as a result of the number of holidays in late november  december and early january  the development of annual capital budgets by our customers during that period  and a general industry slowdown during that period 
there can be no assurance that these historical seasonal trends will continue in the future 
for instance  due to the economic downturn in the communications equipment and services market during fiscal and  this historical trend was not evident in either fiscal year 
a more detailed description of the risks to our business related to seasonality  along with other risk factors associated with our business  can be found in exhibit a to this annual report on form k for fiscal impairment and non recurring charges due to the rapid decline in the communications equipment industry and our efforts to streamline our business in response  we recorded significant impairment and non recurring charges in fiscal and impairment charges represent a write down of the carrying value of long lived assets principally goodwill and facilities to their estimated fair market value 
non recurring and other restructuring related charges represent the direct costs of exiting certain product lines or businesses and the costs of downsizing our business 
a brief explanation of these charges follows  and a more thorough summary is contained in note to the consolidated financial statements in item of this form k 
fiscal during fiscal  we incurred the following charges in millions impairment charges non recurring charges other restructuring related charges impairment charges 
our impairment charges were calculated in accordance with our policy for accounting for long lived assets see application of critical accounting policies long lived assets and goodwill  below 
of the total impairment charges of million in fiscal  million related to the write down of goodwill and million related to the write down of fixed assets 
as a result of our decision to exit the optical components product line  we recognized a million goodwill impairment charge 
in addition  in accordance with sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  we tested our remaining goodwill for impairment in the fourth quarter see note to the consolidated financial statements in item of this form k 
this test indicated that a significant impairment of goodwill had occurred 
accordingly  a million goodwill impairment charge was recognized  which consisted of million of the goodwill recognized when our integrated solutions segment acquired two european companies during fiscal and  as well as the million of remaining goodwill associated with our broadband infrastructure and access business 
after these write downs  our remaining goodwill as of october   was million  which relates solely to our integrated solutions segment 
of the total fixed asset impairment charge of million  million relates to our decision to sell our glenrothes  scotland manufacturing facility 
the remaining charges are primarily related to our decision to exit the optical components  avidia multiplexer  and the us version of our ian product lines 
non recurring charges 
the million of non recurring charges consist principally of million related to the consolidation of facilities  million for employee severance costs related to our workforce reduction  and million for in process research and development costs relating to our decision to purchase the interest of our joint venture partner in three technology development partnerships 
million of the facilities consolidation costs is related to our decision to extend the lease on our world headquarters facility 
this charge represents the reduction in fair market value of the facility below the value we had guaranteed to the lessor 
see liquidity and capital resources finance related transactions below  for a further discussion of our world headquarters lease 
the balance of the facilities consolidation costs relate to lease termination costs for excess facilities  as we deactivated approximately million square feet  or of our total space  during fiscal during fiscal  we reduced our workforce by approximately  employees or of our total workforce  which included approximately  employees impacted by reductions in force  with the remainder resulting from attrition and our divestitures 
other restructuring related charges 
we also incurred other restructuring related charges in fiscal in the net amount of million for inventory write downs and the costs of completing certain sales contracts for discontinued product lines 
these charges are reported in cost of sales million and selling and administration expense million reversal of previous charges in our consolidated statements of operations 
see note to the consolidated financial statements in item of this form k for further details on these items 
fiscal during fiscal  we incurred the following charges in millions impairment charges non recurring charges other restructuring related charges impairment charges 
of the total million of impairment charges in fiscal  million related to the write down of goodwill and million related to the write down of fixed assets 
the goodwill impairment charge was recognized as a result of our decision to exit non strategic product lines 
the fixed asset impairment charge of resulted from the consolidation of unproductive and duplicative facilities as well as the exit from non strategic product lines 
both the goodwill and fixed asset impairment charges were recognized in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of 
the amount of these impairment charges was based on our estimates of the fair value of the assets 
non recurring charges 
the million of non recurring charges related to our actions to downsize our business in response to declining sales 
these charges consisted principally of million for employee severance costs related to our workforce reduction  and million in facilities consolidation costs  which consist principally of lease termination costs 
during fiscal  we reduced our workforce by approximately  employees  or of the total workforce  which included approximately  employees impacted by reductions in force 
we also deactivated approximately million square feet of excess facilities  or of our total active space during fiscal in addition  we incurred million of acquisition and integration costs and other restructuring charges in fiscal  principally related to our acquisitions of commtech corporation and france electronique in early fiscal other restructuring related charges 
we incurred additional restructuring related charges in fiscal in the amount of million relating to inventory write downs and the costs of completing certain sales contracts for discontinued product lines 
these charges were reported in cost of sales million and selling and administration expense million in our consolidated statements of operations 
see note to the consolidated financial statements in item of this form k for further details on these items 
effect of restructuring charges on future cash flow the following table provides detail on the remaining restructuring accrual by category as of october  and in millions type of charge employee severance costs facilities consolidation inventory and committed sales contracts committed sales contracts administrative total we believe that our entire restructuring accrual of million as of october  will have to be paid in cash 
of this amount  million will be paid from our unrestricted cash shown as cash and cash equivalents on our balance sheet and million will be paid from our restricted cash shown as restricted cash on our balance sheet as follows the million of employee severance will be paid in fiscal from unrestricted cash  the million of committed sales contracts administrative will be paid in fiscal from unrestricted cash  million of the facilities consolidation costs relates principally to excess leased facilities 
of the million  we estimate million will be paid in fiscal with the remainder being paid over the respective lease terms ending through  from unrestricted cash  and the balance of million of facilities consolidation costs will be paid from our restricted cash balance 
this amount represents the cash pledged to secure our lease obligations on three long term operating leases  and will be used to pay down the lease obligation in exchange for a reduced purchase option price  or to purchase the leased property at the end of the lease term or sooner if we dispose of the property prior to the end of the lease term 
see liquidity and capital resources finance related transactions below for a further discussion of these leases 
establishment of the restructuring accrual was based on our assumptions of the relevant costs at the time the restructuring decisions were made 
the accrual is periodically adjusted based on new information and actual costs incurred 
the ultimate resolution of the accrual may result in further adjustments  which may have a material effect on our operating results 
results of operations our financial statements for fiscal have been restated to include the operations of pairgain technologies  inc and broadband access systems  inc  both of which were acquired in fiscal in transactions accounted for using the pooling of interests method of accounting 
both of these acquisitions were made by our broadband infrastructure and access segment 
see note to the consolidated financial statements in item of this form k for additional information on these acquisitions

operating segment net sales net sales net sales broadband infrastructure and access  integrated solutions total    net sales fiscal vs 
fiscal net sales were billion and billion for fiscal and  respectively  reflecting a decrease 
international net sales comprised and of our net sales in fiscal and  respectively 
the decrease in net sales was largely attributable to lower volumes of products sold due to significant reductions in communication service provider capital budgets  as well as the lack of new network build outs or significant expansions of existing networks 
the decline was most pronounced for our broadband connectivity products  but occurred across all product lines with the exception of our ip cable products  which had increased sales over the prior year 
sales of our software products also declined  which we believe was in part due to the fact that these products had been targeted for the competitive local exchange carrier market  a segment which has been severely affected by a lack of capital resources  causing many of these companies to cease operations 
in response  during fiscal  we repositioned our software products to add applications for next generation wireless providers  enterprises and media and content providers  which we believe will present broader and higher growth opportunities 
we believe this target market transition contributed to the year over year decline in sales 
the sales decline was also due to the absence of sales from product lines we divested in fiscal and sales from divested product lines were million  million  and million in fiscal  and  respectively 
see note to the consolidated financial statements in item of this form k for a further breakdown of divested product lines net sales by segment 
fiscal vs 
fiscal net sales were billion and billion for fiscal and  respectively  reflecting a decrease 
international net sales comprised of and of our net sales in fiscal and  respectively 
during fiscal  net sales of broadband infrastructure and access products declined by over fiscal the decrease in fiscal primarily resulted from lower sales for broadband connectivity systems due to a weakened communications equipment industry and lower carrier spending budgets 
sales of most other products declined by smaller dollar amounts and percentages 
broadband infrastructure and access sales represented approximately of our net sales in fiscal during fiscal  net sales of integrated solutions products increased by over fiscal both software systems and systems integration services contributed to sales growth 
sales of systems integration services grew as a result of broadening our us and european carrier and oem customer base  which resulted in market share gains 
we also benefited from the expansion of our presence into europe due to the acquisitions of systems integration businesses in the united kingdom and france during september and november  respectively 
our sales growth in software systems resulted from our acquisitions of centigram communications corporation  which was completed in july  and commtech corporation  which was completed in february the operations of centigram were divested on october   in connection with the sale of our enhanced services software product line 
we also divested a substantial portion of commtech in november of fiscal as part of our restructuring initiatives 
international sales increased as a percentage of total sales from fiscal to fiscal  primarily due to the fact that the us communications equipment market declined prior to the european and asian markets 
also  our acquisitions of systems integration businesses in the united kingdom and france in september and november  respectively  increased our european sales in fiscal gross profit fiscal vs 
fiscal during fiscal and  gross profit percentages were and  respectively 
the decrease in gross profit percentage is primarily due to a decrease in sales volume without a corresponding reduction in fixed factory expenses  and a shift in sales mix to lower margin products and services 
also  in fiscal and  million and million of other restructuring related charges for inventory write offs and other costs to exit certain sales contracts were included in cost of product sold  respectively 
we anticipate that our future gross profit percentage will continue to be affected by many factors  including sales mix  competitive pricing  timing of new product introductions and manufacturing volume 
fiscal vs 
fiscal during fiscal and  gross profit percentages were and  respectively 
this decrease was primarily the result of approximately million of inventory write offs and other costs to exit certain sales contracts in connection with our restructuring efforts in fiscal that were included in cost of product sold 
in addition  gross profit for ongoing product lines for fiscal was affected negatively by increased charges of approximately million for additional inventory and warranty reserves  which were taken in response to current market conditions 
the decrease in gross profits also is due in part to a decrease in sales volume and a shift in sales mix to lower margin products 
operating expenses fiscal vs 
fiscal total operating expenses for fiscal and were billion and billion  representing and of net sales  respectively 
included in these operating expenses were non recurring charges of million and million  other restructuring related charges reversals of million and million and impairment charges of million and million in fiscal and  respectively  which are discussed above 
in addition  operating expenses for fiscal and included non cash stock compensation expenses of million and million  respectively 
fiscal non cash stock compensation expenses are associated with our acquisition of broadband access systems bas 
fiscal operating expenses include non cash stock compensation expenses related to our acquisition of bas as well as our acquisition of centigram communications corporation 
non cash stock compensation expenses related to centigram communications corporation are not included in operating expenses for fiscal because we divested the centigram operations through the sale of our enhanced services software product line in fiscal due to the significance of our restructuring activities and the fact that the non cash stock compensation expenses relate to business acquisitions  we believe that a more meaningful presentation of our year over year operating expense performance would exclude these impairment charges  non recurring charges  other restructuring related charges and non cash stock compensation expenses 
operating expenses  excluding the impairment charges  non recurring charges  other restructuring related charges and the non cash stock compensation expenses  were million for fiscal  a reduction from billion for fiscal  representing and of net sales  respectively 
the decrease in absolute dollars of operating expenses  before impairment charges  non recurring charges  other restructuring related charges and non cash stock compensation expenses  was primarily due to the ongoing cost savings from our restructuring efforts as well as the divestiture of certain business units and product lines 
the increase in operating expenses excluding impairment charges  non recurring charges  other restructuring related charges and the non cash stock compensation expenses as a percentage of net sales was primarily due to fixed and variable costs incurred by us that could not be reduced as quickly as the rate of decline in net sales 
research and development expenses were million for fiscal  representing a decrease from million for fiscal we believe that given the rapidly changing technology and competitive environment in the communications equipment industry  continued commitment to product development efforts will be required for us to remain competitive 
accordingly  we intend to continue to allocate substantial resources  as a percentage of our net sales  to product development for each of our operating segments 
selling and administration expenses were million for fiscal  representing a decrease of from million for fiscal this decrease reflects a beneficial realization of our restructuring efforts 
in addition  selling and administration expenses decreased million from due to the divestiture or discontinuance of certain business units and product lines in fiscal also included in the fiscal and amounts were million and million  respectively  in selling and administration expenses reversals incurred to complete certain non cancelable sales contracts and contract cancellation payments to customers as a result of our decision to exit certain product lines 
in accordance with sfas no 
we did not record goodwill amortization in fiscal compared to million of goodwill amortization expense in fiscal fiscal vs 
fiscal total operating expenses for fiscal and were billion and billion  respectively  representing and of net sales  respectively 
included in operating expenses were non recurring charges of million and million  other restructuring related charges of million and and impairment charges of million and for fiscal and  respectively 
the fiscal non recurring charges  other restructuring related charges and impairment charges are discussed above 
the non recurring charges in fiscal represent costs associated with our acquisition of pairgain  broadband access systems and centigram 
these operating expenses also include non cash stock compensation expenses of million and million in fiscal and  respectively  associated with our acquisitions of broadband access systems and centigram  which were completed during fiscal operating expenses  excluding the impairment charges  non recurring charges  other restructuring related charges  and non cash stock compensation expenses were billion and billion for fiscal and fiscal  respectively  representing and of net sales  respectively 
the increase in operating expenses as a percentage of net sales before impairment charges  non recurring charges  other restructuring related charges and non cash compensation expenses was due primarily to charges for increased operating reserves that were recorded in response to market conditions in fiscal these increased operating reserves for ongoing product lines related primarily to additional bad debt reserves of million 
the decrease in absolute dollars of operating expenses  excluding the impairment charges  non recurring charges  other restructuring related charges  and non cash stock compensation expenses from the prior year reflects our effort to reduce costs and streamline our operations in response to the weakened market conditions in fiscal research and development expenses were million for fiscal  representing a decrease from million for fiscal this decrease reflected our efforts to control expenses 
selling and administration expenses were million for fiscal  representing an increase of over expenses of million for fiscal this increase reflects approximately million in selling and administration expenses for payroll and other non production costs incurred to complete non cancelable sales contracts and to make contract cancellation payments to customers as a result of our decision to exit certain product lines 
in addition  we incurred approximately million of additional bad debt provision in fiscal due to declining market conditions 
these increases were partially offset by reduced employee costs resulting from reductions in our overall workforce that occurred in fiscal several of our acquisitions have been accounted for as purchase transactions in which the initial purchase price exceeded the fair value of the acquired assets 
as a result of our acquisition activity  goodwill amortization increased to million in fiscal  compared to million in fiscal other income expense  net other income expense  net includes net interest income expense  gain or loss on the write down  sale or conversion of our investments  gain or loss on the sale or shutdown of certain product lines and other items 
each of these items is discussed below 
interest the net interest income expense category represents net interest on cash and cash equivalents as well as debt 
interest income was million in fiscal  million in fiscal and million in fiscal our interest income increased over fiscal due to higher average cash balances maintained during fiscal  partially offset by lower yields on our short term investments 
interest income decreased from fiscal to fiscal primarily due to lower average cash balances 
interest expense was million  million and million in fiscal  and  respectively 
see liquidity and capital resources below for a discussion of cash and debt levels 
write down  sale or conversion of investments fiscal during fiscal  we sold common stock of certain companies in our investment portfolio and settled related hedging arrangements for a gain of million 
these gains were offset by non cash write downs in the amount of million for our marketable securities investments  and million for our non marketable securities 
see note to the consolidated financial statements in item of this form k for further discussion of our investment activity 
fiscal during fiscal  we sold common stock of certain companies in our portfolio and settled related hedging arrangements for a net gain of million 
this gain was more than offset by a non cash loss of million we recognized for the decline in the market value of our marketable and non marketable securities 
of this non cash loss  million was attributable to the write down in the value of our marketable securities of redback networks  inc  which we acquired in fiscal pursuant to redback network s acquisition of siara systems  inc  in which we were an early investor 
fiscal in the second quarter of fiscal  siara systems  inc  in which we held a ownership interest  was acquired by redback networks in a stock for stock transaction valued at approximately billion 
our initial investment in siara systems was million 
upon consummation of the acquisition of siara systems by redback networks  our investment was marked to market through earnings and was reflected on the balance sheet at the market value of the redback networks shares 
the non cash gain recognized on the conversion of these shares was million 
sale or shutdown of product lines fiscal during fiscal  we sold non strategic product lines in broadcast tv video routing and optical components 
we also closed down our avidia multiplexer and our optical laser product lines and halted further development of the us version of our ian product line 
these products did not meet our growth  profitability and market leadership criteria 
the sales of these assets generated approximately million in cash  net of cash disposed  in fiscal included in these sales and closures were domestic operations in california  minnesota and texas  as well as international operations in australia and sweden 
these product lines generated annual net sales of approximately million  million and million and operating losses of million  million and million in fiscal  and  respectively 
as a result of these actions  we recorded total losses on sales or shutdowns of approximately million in fiscal fiscal during fiscal  we sold non strategic product lines in cable broadcast tv transmission  broadband wireless transmission  enterprise access products  wireless components  optical components and enhanced services software 
we also closed down our cellworx transport product line in fiscal the sales of these assets generated approximately million in cash  net of cash disposed  in fiscal included in these sales were domestic operations in california  connecticut  minnesota  oregon and pennsylvania  as well as international operations in argentina  austria  denmark and finland 
these product lines generated annual net sales of approximately million and million and operating losses of million and million in fiscal and  respectively 
as a result of these actions  we recorded total losses on sales or shutdowns of approximately million in fiscal fiscal in fiscal  we recognized a million gain on the divestiture of the microelectronics group by pairgain technologies  inc patent infringement settlement during fiscal  we recognized a million gain from the settlement of a patent infringement lawsuit we brought against a competitor 
fixed assets in connection with our efforts to streamline and focus our operations to reduce costs  we sold excess equipment in fiscal and as a result of these sales  we recognized a million and million loss in fiscal and  respectively 
there were no gains or losses associated with fixed assets in fiscal other  net other  net primarily represents the gain or loss on foreign exchange transactions  loss on sale leaseback transactions and our share of losses in equity method investments 
other net expense was approximately million  million and in fiscal  and  respectively 
income taxes fiscal vs 
fiscal the effective income tax rate for fiscal and was affected by certain non deductible impairment charges  as well as no benefit recognized for losses incurred in the fourth quarter of fiscal in addition as a result of our cumulative losses over the past two years and the full utilization of our loss carryback potential  we concluded during the third quarter of fiscal that a full valuation allowance against our net deferred tax assets was appropriate 
accordingly  we recorded a valuation allowance of million during fiscal fiscal vs 
fiscal the effective income tax rate for fiscal was affected by certain non deductible impairment charges  whereas  the effective income tax rate for fiscal was affected by non deductible charges for certain acquisition fees 
during fiscal  we made an election for us tax purposes that gave rise to a million non current deferred tax asset 
this election related to a business combination that was accounted for as pooling of interests 
therefore  the recognition of this tax asset was recorded as an increase to paid in capital 
net loss fiscal vs 
fiscal net loss was billion or per diluted share for fiscal  compared to net loss of billion or per diluted share for fiscal fiscal vs 
fiscal net loss was billion or per diluted share for fiscal  compared to net income of million or per diluted share for fiscal segment disclosures broadband infrastructure and access segment detailed information regarding our broadband infrastructure and access segment is provided in the following table dollars in millions for the years ended october  external sales   operating income loss depreciation and amortization capital expenditures at october  assets   operating income loss excludes certain charges and expenses as described in note to the consolidated financial statements in item of this form k 
broadband infrastructure and access sales decreased billion  or  in fiscal compared to fiscal  primarily due to decreased demand for broadband connectivity systems  components  an overall weakness in the telecommunications equipment industry and product lines sold or shutdown in fiscal and in fiscal  economic and industry weakness also led to a sales decrease of million  or  compared to fiscal during fiscal  operating loss for the broadband infrastructure and access segment increased by million compared to fiscal this increase resulted primarily from a decrease in sales volume and a shift in product sales mix to lower margin products 
during fiscal  we incurred losses of million compared to operating income of million in fiscal fiscal operating income decreased primarily for the same reasons as it decreased in fiscal as a result of the restructuring initiative undertaken in fiscal and  we expect to realize future cost savings through improvements in our cost structure and operating processes 
during fiscal  depreciation and amortization decreased million compared to fiscal this decrease is the result of our restructuring efforts in fiscal and fiscal  which led to a reduction in our global production capacity 
implementation of sfas no 
did not have a significant impact on amortization because goodwill amortization is not allocated to segments 
capital expenditures decreased million and million  in fiscal and  respectively 
the decrease in fiscal and was a result of our company wide efforts to limit capital expenditures in light of the industry downturn 
integrated solutions segment detailed information regarding our integrated solutions segment is provided in the following table dollars in millions for the years ended october  external sales operating income loss depreciation and amortization capital expenditures at october  assets operating income loss excludes certain charges and expenses as described in note to the consolidated financial statements in item of this form k 
integrated solutions sales decreased million  or  in fiscal compared to fiscal during fiscal  many of our customers reduced their spending budgets as well as focused on improving their existing infrastructure rather than building new capacity 
in addition  we shifted the market focus for our software products away from competitive local exchange carriers and into next generation service providers  enterprises and media and content providers 
this transition led to a decline in software sales in fiscal fiscal amounts also include million of sales from product lines sold prior to fiscal  which represented of net sales 
the increase in fiscal sales over fiscal sales primarily was attributable to an expansion of our us and european carrier and oem customer base  which resulted in market share gains 
in the fourth quarter of fiscal and the first quarter of fiscal  we expanded our systems integration service capabilities into europe with the acquisitions of computer telecom installations ltd 
in september and france electronique s telecom systems integration business in november fiscal net sales also include million of sales from product lines sold during fiscal during fiscal  operating loss for the integrated solutions segment decreased million compared to fiscal the decrease in operating loss was primarily due to cost savings achieved as a result of our restructuring initiatives in fiscal and fiscal operating income decreased by million compared to fiscal the decrease was due primarily to an increase in bad debt reserves in light of the sharp decline in the telecommunications industry and the restructuring of our workforce to correspond to the decrease in telecommunications equipment and software integration projects throughout the year 
depreciation and amortization decreased by million in fiscal and increased by million in fiscal the fiscal decrease is the result of the fiscal and restructuring efforts  which reduced the size of our global operations 
implementation of sfas no 
did not have a significant impact on amortization because goodwill amortization is not allocated to segments 
capital expenditures decreased million  or  and million  or  in fiscal and  respectively 
the decrease in fiscal and was a result of our company wide efforts to limit capital expenditures in light of the industry downturn 
application of critical accounting policies and estimates investments we hold equity interests in both publicly traded and privately held companies 
when the carrying value of an investment exceeds its fair value and the decline in value is deemed to be other than temporary  we write down the value of the investment and establish a new cost basis 
fair values for investments in public companies are determined using quoted market prices 
fair values for investments in privately held companies are estimated based upon one or more of the following factors the values of the most recent round of financing  quoted market prices of comparable public companies  or analyses of historical and forecasted financial information 
we regularly evaluate our investments based on criteria that include  but are not limited to  the duration and extent to which the fair value has been less than the carrying value  the current economic environment and the duration of any market decline  and the financial health and business outlooks of the portfolio s companies 
we generally believe that an other than temporary decline occurs when the fair value of a publicly traded investment is below the carrying value for nine consecutive months 
future adverse changes in these or other factors could result in an other than temporary decline in the value of our investments  thereby requiring us to write down such investments 
our ability to liquidate our positions in the investments in privately held companies will be affected to a significant degree by the lack of an actively traded market  and we may not be able to dispose of these investments in a timely manner 
as of october   our investments in publicly and privately held companies had a current cost basis after giving effect to other than temporary impairment charges and estimated fair value of million 
inventories we state our inventories at the lower of first in  first out cost or market 
in assessing the ultimate realization of inventories  we are required to make judgments as to future demand requirements compared with current or committed inventory levels 
our reserve requirements generally increase as our projected demand requirements decrease due to market conditions  technological and product life cycle changes as well as longer than previously expected usage periods 
we have experienced significant changes in required reserves in recent periods due primarily to declining market conditions 
it is possible that significant increases in inventory reserves may be required in the future if there is a further decline in market conditions 
alternatively  if market conditions improve significantly  we may find it necessary to reverse a portion of the reserves 
as of october   we had million reserved against our inventories 
long lived assets goodwill we evaluate the carrying value of our long lived assets  consisting primarily of property and equipment  whenever certain events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of these assets may not be recoverable  in accordance with statement of accounting standards no 
 accounting for the impairment of long lived assets 
such events or circumstances include  but are not limited to  a prolonged industry downturn  a significant decline in our market value  or significant reductions in projected future cash flows 
in assessing the recoverability of our long lived assets  we compare the carrying value to the undiscounted future cash flows the assets are expected to generate 
if the total of the undiscounted future cash flows is less than the carrying amount of the assets  we write down such assets based on the excess of the carrying amount over the fair value of the assets 
fair value is generally determined by calculating the discounted future cash flows  including long term forecasts of the amounts and timing of overall market growth and our percentage of that market  grouping of assets  discount rate and terminal growth rates 
changes in these estimates could have a material adverse effect on the assessment of our long lived assets  thereby requiring us to write down the assets 
see note to the consolidated financial statements in item of this form k for details on our impairment charges 
we adopted sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets during we are required to test goodwill for impairment annually or at other times if events have occurred or circumstances exist that indicate the carrying value of goodwill may no longer be recoverable 
the impairment test for goodwill involves a two step process step one consists of a comparison of the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount  including the goodwill allocated to each reporting unit 
if the carrying amount is in excess of the fair value  step two requires the comparison of the implied fair value of the reporting unit goodwill with the carrying amount of the reporting unit goodwill 
any excess of the carrying value of the reporting unit goodwill over the implied fair value of the reporting unit goodwill will be recorded as an impairment loss 
fair value of the business units was determined using the income approach 
under the income approach  value is dependent on the present value of future economic benefits to be derived from ownership 
the income approach requires significant estimates about future cash flows and the discount rates 
see note to the consolidated financial statements in item of this form k for information about the results of the goodwill impairment tests 
at october   million of goodwill remained on our books  related solely to our integrated solutions segment 
restructuring accrual during fiscal and  we recorded significant restructuring charges representing the direct costs of exiting certain product lines or businesses and the costs of downsizing our business 
such charges were established in accordance with eitf liability recognition for certain employee termination benefits and other costs to exit an activity including certain costs incurred in a restructuring and represent our best estimate at the date the charges were taken 
adjustments for changes in assumptions are recorded in the period they become known 
changes in assumptions could have a material effect on our restructuring accrual as well as our consolidated results of operations 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue when persuasive evidence of a final agreement exists  delivery has occurred  the selling price is fixed or determinable and collectibility is reasonably assured 
revenue from product sales is primarily recognized at the time of delivery and acceptance  and after consideration of all the terms and conditions of the customer contract 
revenue from services consists of fees for systems requirements  system design and analysis  customization and installation services  ongoing system management  system enhancements  service bureau processing  facilities management and maintenance 
services revenue is recognized as the services are performed  primarily on a time and materials basis and to a lesser extent on a fixed fee basis over the term of the services provided 
revenue from maintenance contracts is recognized ratably over the term of the agreement  generally one year 
revenue from the licensing of software rights is recognized at the time of delivery of the software to the customer  provided that we have no remaining service obligations  collectibility is reasonably assured and the fees are fixed and determinable 
where there are service obligations that are essential to the functionality of the software installed  license fees are recorded over the term of the initial customization period 
the assessment of collectibility is particularly critical in determining whether or not revenue should be recognized in the current market environment 
as part of the revenue recognition process  we determine whether trade and notes receivable are reasonably assured of collection based on various factors  including an evaluation of whether there has been deterioration in the credit quality of our customers  which could result in us being unable to collect or sell the receivables 
in situations where it is unclear as to whether we will be able to sell or collect the receivable  revenue and related costs are deferred 
costs are recognized when it has been determined that the collection of the receivable is unlikely 
we record provisions against our gross revenue for estimated product returns and allowances in the period when the related revenue is recorded 
these estimates are based on factors that include  but are not limited to  historical sales returns  analyses of credit memo activities  current economic trends and changes in our customers demand 
should our actual product returns and allowances exceed our estimates  additional reductions to our revenue would result 
allowance for uncollectible accounts we are required to estimate the collectibility of our trade receivables and notes receivable 
a considerable amount of judgment is required in assessing the realization of these receivables including the current creditworthiness of each customer and related aging of the past due balances 
in order to assess the collectibility of these receivables  we perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers financial condition 
through these evaluations we may become aware of a situation where a customer may not be able to meet its financial obligations due to deterioration of its financial viability  credit ratings or bankruptcy 
the reserve requirements are based on the best facts available to us and are reevaluated and adjusted as additional information is received 
our reserves are also based on amounts determined by using percentages applied to certain aged receivable categories 
these percentages are determined by a variety of factors including  but are not limited to  current economic trends  historical payment and bad debt write off experience 
significant increases in reserves have been recorded in recent periods and may occur in the future due to deteriorating market conditions 
we are not able to predict changes in the financial condition of our customers and if circumstances related to our customers deteriorate  our estimates of the recoverability of our receivables could be materially affected and we may be required to record additional allowances 
alternatively  if we provided more allowances than are ultimately required  we may reverse a portion of such provisions in future periods based on our actual collection experience 
as of october   we had million reserved against our account receivables 
warranty we provide reserves for the estimated cost of warranties at the time revenue is recognized 
we estimate the costs of our warranty obligations based on our warranty policy or applicable contractual warranty  our historical experience of known product failure rates  and use of materials and service delivery costs incurred in correcting product failures 
in addition  from time to time  specific warranty accruals may be made if unforeseen technical problems arise 
should our actual experience relative to these factors differ from our estimates  we may be required to record additional warranty reserves 
alternatively  if we provide more reserves than we need  we may reverse a portion of such provisions in future periods 
as of october   we reserved million related to future estimated warranty costs 
income taxes and deferred taxes we utilize the liability method of accounting for income taxes 
deferred tax liabilities or assets are recognized for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the book and tax bases of assets and liabilities 
we regularly assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income  and we record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amounts we believe to be realizable 
we consider projected future taxable income and ongoing tax planning strategies in assessing the amount of the valuation allowance 
if we determine we will not realize all or part of our deferred tax assets  an adjustment to the deferred tax asset will be charged to earnings in the period such determination is made 
as a result of the cumulative losses over the past two years  and the full utilization of our loss carryback potential  we concluded during the third quarter of fiscal that a full valuation allowance against our net deferred tax assets was appropriate 
the valuation allowance at october  was million 
in addition  we expect to provide a full valuation allowance on any future tax benefits until we can sustain a level of profitability that demonstrates our ability to utilize these assets 
recently issued accounting pronouncements in october  the financial accounting standards board issued sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
sfas supersedes sfas sfas primarily addresses significant issues relating to the implementation of sfas and develops a single accounting model for long lived assets to be disposed of  whether primarily held  used or newly acquired 
the provisions of sfas will be effective for fiscal years beginning after december  we will apply this standard beginning in fiscal prior to adopting this standard  we wrote down long lived assets  excluding goodwill  by million and million in fiscal and  respectively  by applying sfas no 
in june  the financial accounting standards board issued sfas no 
accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities 
sfas no 
supersedes eitf no 
the principle difference between sfas no 
and eitf no 
relates to when an entity can recognize a liability related to exit or disposal activities 
sfas no 
requires a liability be recognized for a cost associated with an exit or disposal activity when the liability is incurred 
eitf no 
allowed a liability  related to an exit or disposal activity  to be recognized at the date an entity commits to an exit plan 
the provisions of sfas no 
are effective on january  accordingly  we will apply this standard to all exit or disposal activities initiated after january  liquidity and capital resources cash cash and cash equivalents  primarily short term investments in commercial paper with maturities of less than days and other short term investments had a balance of million at october   which is a decrease of million compared to october  the major uses of cash during fiscal were a million net increase in restricted cash which reduced the balance in cash and cash equivalents  million in property  plant  and equipment additions  and million used to pay down current liabilities as well as net cash losses from operations 
these cash outflows were partially offset by million provided from income tax refunds  and million from more effective working capital management such as account receivable collections  lower inventory requirements  and lower prepaid assets 
in addition  we received million on the sale of available for sale securities 
as of october   we had restricted cash of million 
restricted cash represents cash pledged to various financial institutions to secure certain of our obligations  and thus is not available to us for working capital 
the majority of this restricted cash relates to four long term operating lease obligations  with the remainder representing cash collateral for letters of credit  guarantees relating to vendor financing transactions  and foreign currency hedging activities 
we expect that million of our restricted cash will be used to settle the four long term lease obligations it secures  and accordingly will never become available to us for general working capital purposes 
the remainder of the restricted cash is expected to become available to us upon satisfaction of the obligations pursuant to which the letters of credit  guarantees or currency hedging arrangement was issued 
we are entitled to the interest earnings on our restricted cash balances 
during fiscal  cash increased by million compared to fiscal in addition  as of october   we held approximately million in marketable securities 
our primary source of cash in fiscal was million from the collection of accounts receivable combined with lower inventory requirements compared to fiscal in addition  in fiscal we generated million from the divestiture of certain product lines and businesses and million from investment sale proceeds 
these cash sources were partially offset by decreased earnings  million from paying down current liabilities  million from higher prepaid and other assets  and million of capital expenditures 
finance related transactions we are a party to four operating lease agreements related to certain of our facilities  including our eden prairie  minnesota headquarters facility 
these leases have expiration dates ranging from to  depending on whether we exercise our renewal options 
these operating leases  which are sometimes referred to as synthetic leases  contain minimum residual value guarantees by us at the end of the lease term and also give us a purchase option at the end of the lease term 
if we choose to retain the property at the end of the lease term  or if the lease is terminated prematurely  we must pay the purchase option price 
if we dispose of the property at the end of the lease term  we must pay any shortfall of the sales proceeds as compared to the purchase option price  not to exceed the amount of the residual value guarantee to the lessor 
the aggregate purchase option price and minimum residual value guarantees from all of these leases are approximately million and million  respectively 
our obligations under these leases are secured by million in cash collateral  which is classified as restricted cash on our balance sheet 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal  we concluded that the fair market value of our headquarters facility was significantly less than the minimum value we had guaranteed the lessor 
as we intend to occupy this facility in the long term  we amended this lease to extend the lease term by an additional two years 
in connection with this amendment  we paid the lessor million from our restricted cash  which was the difference between the existing purchase option price and the current fair market value of the facility  and obtained reductions in the purchase option price and minimum residual value guarantee 
with the exception of our world headquarters facility  we do not intend to continue to occupy the other three leased facilities for the full lease term 
accordingly  we are attempting to sell these facilities 
in order for us to sell these leased facilities we must first purchase the facilities from the lessor for the purchase option price which we will fund through the use of restricted cash 
as the fair market value of these facilities is likely to be less than the amount payable to the lessor for the purchase option price  we may incur additional non recurring charges related to the disposal of these leased facilities 
the net sales proceeds obtained from a buyer of these facilities would be available to us as unrestricted cash 
in november of fiscal  we purchased one of these leased facilities from the lessor for million  using the restricted cash pledged for this lease to pay the purchase price  and immediately sold the facility for million 
the million sales proceeds became available to us as unrestricted cash 
in december  we entered into an accounts receivable securitization arrangement with a financial institution 
the purpose of this securitization arrangement was to allow us to accelerate the cash realized from our receivables  and to provide an additional liquidity resource 
during the fiscal year ended october   the amount available under this arrangement ranged from million to million  and the amount available as of october  was approximately million 
as of october   there have been no sales of receivables under this arrangement 
we do not expect to utilize this facility and do not consider it a significant source of liquidity 
capital expenditure and investment commitments as of october   we had commitments both cancelable and non cancelable for capital expenditures related to the ongoing operation of our business of approximately million 
these commitments primarily reflect future equipment purchases as well as improvements to existing buildings and facilities 
the commitments are estimated to be paid by the end of fiscal we intend to fund these expenditures from cash on hand 
in connection with our investment activity  we invested in two independent venture capital funds in fiscal our investment in these funds are recorded as long term assets on our balance sheet 
we committed to invest an aggregate of million in these funds as capital calls were made by the fund managers 
as of october   our outstanding unfunded commitment was million 
we expect that our remaining commitment will be funded through the use of cash on hand over the course of the next three years 
vendor financing we have worked with customers and third party financiers to find a means of financing projects by negotiating financing arrangements 
as of october   and  we had commitments to extend credit of million  million and million for such arrangements  respectively 
the total amount drawn and outstanding under the commitments was approximately million  million and million  respectively  as of october   and the commitments to extend credit are conditional agreements generally having fixed expiration or termination dates and specific interest rates  conditions and purposes 
these commitments may expire without being drawn 
some of these commitments enable the customer to draw on the commitment after the customer has made payment to us for the products we sold  up to the amount the customer previously paid to us 
accordingly  amounts committed may affect future cash flows 
we regularly review all outstanding commitments  and the results of these reviews are considered in assessing the overall risk for possible credit losses 
at october   we had approximately million in loss reserves in the event of non performance related to these financing arrangements 
during fiscal we sold a participation interest in one of our vendor financing notes receivable for cash equal to million 
this sale was without any discount to the face amount of the receivable  was with full recourse to us  and our recourse obligation is secured by a letter of credit 
we accounted for this sale of a participation interest as a loan  and thus recorded a million long term note payable 
see note to the consolidated financial statements in item of this form k 
working capital outlook our main source of liquidity continues to be our unrestricted cash on hand 
in addition  based on our recent operating losses  we expect to receive a federal income tax refund in the range of to million during the first calendar quarter of although we expect to continue to use our unrestricted cash to fund operating losses in the near term and to pay million of our restructuring accrual  we believe that our current unrestricted cash on hand and cash from the expected federal income tax refunds should be adequate to fund our working capital requirements  planned capital expenditures and restructuring costs through fiscal and beyond 
however  if our operating losses are more severe than expected or continue longer than expected  we may find it necessary or desirable to seek other sources of financing to support our capital needs and provide available funds for working capital 
in addition  should we determine to make any significant acquisitions  additional sources of capital may be required 
given the current state of the communications equipment industry  there are few alternatives available as sources of financing 
commercial bank financing is not available at this time to us or to many companies in our industry 
accordingly  any plan to raise additional capital would likely involve an equity based or equity linked financing  such as the issuance of convertible debt  common stock or preferred stock  which would be dilutive to existing shareowners 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to market risk from changes in security prices  foreign exchange rates and interest rates 
market fluctuations could affect our results of operations and financial condition adversely 
we  at times  reduce this risk through the use of derivative financial instruments 
we do not enter into derivative financial instruments for the purpose of speculation 
changes in interest rates are not expected to have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial condition or results of operations because we have only million of interest bearing notes payable as of october  as described in note to the consolidated financial statements in item of this form k  we maintain an investment portfolio of common stock in three publicly traded companies in the telecommunications or technology industries 
this portfolio was developed primarily through investments in privately held companies  which later became publicly traded 
the investments in two of these companies  vyyo  inc and interwave communications international  ltd  have been written down to a nominal value 
the investment in the third company  redback networks  is classified as an available for sale security and  consequently  is recorded on the balance sheet at its written down fair value 
the values recorded for these investments are subject to market price volatility 
assuming an immediate decrease in our publicly traded investments  the hypothetical reduction in shareowners investment related to these holdings is estimated to be million as of october  we also hold minority investments in a number of companies that are not publicly traded 
these investments are included in long term assets and are carried at their written down cost of million 
we monitor these investments for impairment and make appropriate reductions in carrying value when necessary 
we also are exposed to market risk from changes in foreign exchange rates 
to mitigate the risk from these exposures  we have instituted a balance sheet hedging program 
the objective of this program is to protect our net monetary assets and liabilities in non functional currencies from fluctuations due to movements in foreign exchange rates 
the program operates in markets where hedging costs are beneficial 
we attempt to minimize exposure to currencies in which hedging instruments are unavailable or prohibitively expensive by managing our operating activities and net asset positions 
the majority of hedging instruments utilized are forward contracts with maturities of less than one year 
foreign exchange contracts reduce our overall exposure to exchange rate movements  since gains and losses on these contracts offset losses and gains on the underlying exposure 
see note to the consolidated financial statements in item of this form k for information about our foreign exchange hedging program and the notional and fair values of our hedge instruments
