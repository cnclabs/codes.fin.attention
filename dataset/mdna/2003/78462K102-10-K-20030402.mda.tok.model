transaction 
in december  spss completed the acquisition of netgenesis corp 
see note 
a portion of the purchase price was attributable to acquired in process technology  as the development work associated with netgenesis version had not reached technological feasibility and was believed to have no alternative future use 
spss assessed the fair value of the acquired in process technology using an income approach 
future cash flows were projected over five years discounted to present value using a discount rate of based on the project and the market risks associated with the research and development project and resulting product 
specific consideration was given to the stage of development of the research and development effort  which was complete  both in terms of costs invested as of the acquisition date relative to completion costs and technical achievements 
in projecting future revenue streams from the project  spss considered many factors including competition  market growth estimates  time to market and additional sales and marketing leverage that spss could provide to the netgenesis suite of products 
on february   spss acquired all of the issued and outstanding shares of capital stock of lexiquest  sa  a corporation organized under the laws of france

the expected benefit in was lowered by a nondeductible loss arising from a consolidated subsidiary 
during  the provision for income taxes represented a tax rate of approximately 
the effective rate for the income tax benefit was lower than the statutory rate primarily due to an increase in the valuation allowance and nondeductible in process research and development charges 
during  the provision for income taxes represented a tax rate of approximately  excluding the effect of monies transferred out of japan in the tax rate benefited from the reduction of the deferred tax valuation allowance 
liquidity and capital resources spss generated  in cash from operations in compared to  in and  in cash from operations in came primarily from collections of open accounts receivable of  delayed trade payable payments of  and income tax accruals of  these amounts were offset by a reduction of accrued expenses of  and deferred revenue of  operating results in the fourth quarter benefited from cost reductions related to the restructuring of the company s field operations in the third quarter 
this restructuring reduced the spss sales force by  total staff by  and total payroll by 
in addition  the company closed its offices in miami  florida  and reduced its facilities in chicago  illinois  london  england  cambridge  massachusetts  and point richmond  california 
these and other cost reductions combined with higher revenues to increase the company s cash from operations to  for the twelve months ended december   from a cash usage from operations of  in the nine months ended september  the overall net loss in was largely the result of noncash charges for software write offs and increased depreciation and amortization expense 
cash from operations in came primarily from collections of open accounts receivable of  which was partially offset by the net operating loss 
cash from operations in came primarily from the company s net income of  investing activities resulted in the net use of  in   in and  in in  cash was primarily used for capital expenditures of  and capitalized software development costs of  spss also paid  to acquire lexiquest   to acquire netexs  and made scheduled payments totaling  to aol 
proceeds of  were received from the maturities and sales of marketable securities 
in   in cash was used in net capital expenditures  along with  for capitalized software development costs   in earn out payments to the former shareholders of integrated solutions limited isl  and  related to the aol transaction  offset by  provided by net proceeds from marketable securities

the company s capital expenditures  primarily for computer equipment and software  leasehold improvements and office furniture  were approximately  in  and are projected to be approximately  in and  in spss expects capital expenditures during to include computers and software  primarily for use in internal product development and systems for sales and order entry 
spss does not believe that the implementation of its business strategy will require substantial additional capital expenditures in comparison with historical capital expenditure levels that had consisted primarily of product development costs and other expenses 
cash provided by financing activities was  in  while  in   in cash was used in financing activities 
in  financing activities provided cash of  in  net borrowings under line of credit agreements totaled  and proceeds from the issuance of common stock were  primarily through the exercise of stock options and employee purchases through the employee stock purchase plan

the company s accounts receivable balance increased  in during  the company made considerable efforts to collect outstanding receivables  including hiring additional collections personnel 
these actions and decreased revenues contributed to the decrease of  in net accounts receivable in the company s deferred revenue balance increased  in due primarily to the aforementioned  adjustment recorded in connection with the implementation of the aicpa technical practice aids 
the relationship of the increase in accounts receivable in to the revenue decrease of in was caused by the deferring of revenues in accordance with aicpa technical practices aids regarding software revenue recognition  reducing net revenues by  with no corresponding reduction in accounts receivable  and the timing of sales at the end of  when approximately  was billed in the last month 
in  the accounts receivables balance decreased  while net revenues increased  in over  reflecting the company s continued focus on collections 
in may  spss revised its loan agreement with bank one  na as successor by merger to american national bank and trust company of chicago 
under this loan agreement  spss had an available  unsecured line of credit with bank one  under which borrowings bear interest at either the prime interest rate or the eurodollar rate  depending on the circumstances 
the company s agreement with bank one required spss to comply with certain specified financial ratios and tests  and  among other things  restricted the company s ability to incur additional indebtedness  create liens on assets  make investments  engage in mergers  acquisitions or consolidations where spss is not the surviving entity  sell assets  engage in certain transactions with affiliates  and amend its organizational documents or make changes in capital structure 
spss was not in compliance with certain covenants in the loan agreement at the end of each fiscal quarter and received a waiver from bank one as of the end of each quarter  and as of december  in connection with these waivers  spss agreed to amend the terms of the bank one borrowing arrangement to renew the revolving credit facility for an amount not to exceed  in addition  spss agreed to secure its banks borrowings with both its domestic accounts receivable and general intangibles and the assets of spss us inc  a wholly owned subsidiary of spss 
as of december   spss had  outstanding under its line of credit with bank one 
on march   however  spss entered into a new four year  million credit facility with foothill capital corporation 
the foothill facility includes a four year term loan in the amount of  and a revolving line of credit 
the maximum amount spss may borrow under the revolving line of credit portion of the facility will depend upon the value of spss s eligible accounts receivable generated within the united states 
on april   spss paid all of its outstanding obligations to bank one and terminated the bank one line of credit 
additionally  the company has immediate availability of  under the revolving line of credit 
the terms and conditions of the foothill credit facility are specified in a loan and security agreement  dated as of march   by and between foothill and spss 
the term loan portion of the facility bears interest at a rate of above prime  with potential future reductions of up to in the interest rate based upon spss s achievement of specified ebitda targets 
one component of the revolving line of credit will bear interest at a rate of prime plus 
on the remainder of the revolving line of credit  spss may select interest rates of either prime plus or libor plus with respect to each advance made by foothill 
the term loan of  will be paid down evenly over the four year period ie   per year over the next four years 
as a result of the refinancing   of the company s line of credit borrowings of  that existed as of december  have been classified as long term 
the foothill facility requires spss to meet certain financial covenants including minimum ebitda targets and includes additional requirements concerning  among other things  the company s ability to incur additional indebtedness  create liens on assets  make investments  engage in mergers  acquisitions or consolidations where spss is not the surviving entity  sell assets  engage in certain transactions with affiliates  and amend its organizational documents or make changes in capital structure 
the facility is secured by all of spss s assets located in the united states 
showcase corporation  a minnesota corporation and wholly owned subsidiary of spss  and netgenesis corp  a delaware corporation and wholly owned subsidiary of spss  have guaranteed the obligations of spss under the loan and security agreement 
this guaranty is secured by all of the assets of showcase and netgenesis 
spss intends to fund its future capital needs through operating cash flows and borrowings on our new credit facility 
spss anticipates that amounts available from cash and cash equivalents on hand  under its line of credit  and cash flows generated from operations  will be sufficient to fund the company s operations and capital requirements for the foreseeable future 
however  no assurance can be given that changing business circumstances will not require additional capital for reasons that are not currently anticipated or that the necessary additional capital will then be available to spss on favorable terms or at all 
summary disclosures about contractual obligations and commercial commitments the following table reflects a summary of spss s contractual cash obligations less than total year years years after years united kingdom mortgage      litigation settlement   notes payable     merger consideration aol  undiscounted    capital lease commitments   international operations significant growth in the company s international operations also occurred from to revenues from international operations increased from to of total net revenues between and  and were approximately of total net revenues in management believes that  excluding acquisition related expenses  the overall profitability of the company s north american and international operations are essentially the same 
as international revenues increase  spss may experience additional foreign currency exchange risk 
to mitigate these effects  spss from time to time hedges its transaction exposure ie  the effect on earnings and cash flows of changes in foreign exchange rates on receivables and payables denominated in foreign currencies through the use of foreign currency options  primarily yen 
spss does not hedge its foreign currency exposure in a manner that would entirely eliminate the effects of changes in foreign exchange rates on the company s consolidated net income 
accordingly  the company s reported revenues and net income have been  and in the future may be affected by  the changes in foreign exchange rates  excluding acquisition related expenses 
on december   the company did not have any option contracts outstanding 
during  offsetting  of spss consolidated operating losses was  of operating income generated outside of the united states 
of the non us income  approximately was generated in euro nations and was generated in gbp nations

critical accounting policies and estimates the consolidated financial statements of spss have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
on an on going basis  management evaluates its estimates and judgments  including those related to revenue recognition  capitalized software development costs  and the valuation of accounts receivable  long lived assets and deferred income taxes 
management bases its estimates and judgments on historical experience and on various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
management believes the following critical accounting policies  among others  affect its more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements 
software revenue recognition the company applies aicpa statement of position sop  software revenue recognition  which specifies the criteria that must be met prior to spss recognizing revenues from software sales 
spss s policy is to record revenue only when the following criteria are met a persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists spss and the customer have executed a written agreement  contract or other evidence of an arrangement 
b delivery has occurred product has been shipped or delivered to customer  depending on the applicable terms 
spss s standard contract does not contain acceptance clauses 
in the event that spss modifies the terms of its standard contract to provide that final delivery is contingent upon the customer accepting the applicable product  spss does not recognize revenue for that product until the customer has accepted the product 
c the vendor s fee is fixed or determinable the arrangement indicates the price of the license and the number of users  and the related payment terms are within one year of delivery of the software 
d collectibility is probable spss sells to customers it deems creditworthy 
standard terms for payment are days 
spss periodically extends payment terms to three to six months  but does not extend payment terms past one year 
spss primarily recognizes revenue from product licenses  net of an allowance for estimated returns and cancellations  at the time the software is delivered 
revenue from certain product license agreements is recognized upon contract execution  product delivery  and customer acceptance 
revenue from postcontract customer support pcs or maintenance agreements  including pcs bundled with product licenses  is recognized ratably over the term of the related pcs agreements 
some product licenses include commitments for insignificant obligations  such as technical and other support  for which an accrual is provided 
revenue from training  consulting  publications  and other items is recognized as the related products or services are delivered or rendered 
revenues from fixed price contracts are recognized using the percentage of completion method of contract accounting as services are performed to develop  customize and install the company s software products 
the percentage completed is measured by the percentage of labor hours incurred to date in relation to estimated total labor hours for each contract 
management considers labor hours to be the best available measure of progress on these contracts 
spss enters into arrangements which may consist of the sale of a licenses of the company s software  b professional services and maintenance or c various combinations of each element 
revenues are recognized based on the residual method under sop  modification of sop software revenue recognition  when an agreement has been signed by both parties  delivery of the product has occurred  the fees are fixed or determinable  collection of the fees is probable and no other significant obligations remain 
historically  the company has not experienced significant returns or offered exchanges of its products 
for multiple element arrangements  each element of the arrangement is analyzed and spss allocates a portion of the total fee under the arrangement to the undelivered elements  such as professional services  training and maintenance based on vender specific objective evidence of fair value 
revenues allocated to the undelivered elements are deferred using vendor specific objective evidence of fair value of the elements and the remaining portion of the fee is allocated to the delivered elements generally the software license  under the residual method 
vendor specific objective evidence of fair value is based on the price the customer is required to pay when the element is sold separately ie  hourly time and material rates charged for consulting services when sold separately from a software license and the optional renewal rates charged by the company for maintenance arrangements 
if an element of the license agreement has not been delivered  revenue for the element is deferred based on its vendor specific objective evidence of fair value 
if vendor specific objective evidence of fair value does not exist  all revenue is deferred until sufficient objective evidence exists or all elements have been delivered 
if the fee due from the customer is not fixed or determinable  revenue is recognized as payments become due 
if collectibility is not considered probable  revenue is recognized when the fee is collected 
amounts allocated to license revenues under the residual method are recognized at the time of delivery of the software when vendor specific objective evidence of fair value exists for the undelivered elements  if any  and all the other revenue recognition criteria discussed above have been met 
revenues from professional services are comprised of consulting  implementation services and training 
consulting services are generally sold on a time and materials basis and include services such as installation and building non complex interfaces to allow the software to operate in customized environments 
services are generally separable from the other elements under the arrangement since the performance of the services is not essential to the functionality ie the services do not involve significant production  modification or customization of the software or building complex interfaces of any other element of the transaction 
revenues for professional services and training are recognized when the services are performed 
spss does not have non fixed price multiple element arrangements that include software and consulting arrangements 
these are typically time and materials arrangements that list expected total cost for the services 
the services typically consist of assisting the customer in cleaning and organizing its data prior to the use of the software  or creating customized reports for the customer 
these services may be performed by any number of firms and have no direct bearing on the customer s use of the software 
if the customer chooses  it does not have to have spss perform any work on its data prior to installation and it does not have to have any additional reports created for its business 
maintenance revenues consist primarily of fees for providing when and if available unspecified software upgrades and technical support over a specified term 
maintenance revenues are recognized on a straight line basis over the term of the contract 
spss offers a annual licenses with maintenance renewable annually  b perpetual licenses with both annual and multi year maintenance  and c multi year licenses with multi year maintenance 
vendor specific objective evidence does not exist for annual licenses with one year of maintenance 
for perpetual license arrangements with one year of maintenance  vendor specific objective evidence is established based on the renewal rate of maintenance which is a set percentage of the total contract price  in accordance with technical practice aids tpa  fair value of pcs with a consistent renewal percentage  but varying dollar amounts  and software revenue recognition 
vendor specific objective evidence of fair value is not determinable for perpetual and multi year arrangements with multi year maintenance 
spss licenses software  primarily to end users  on a perpetual basis and on an annual and multi year basis 
under a perpetual license  the customer is granted an indefinite right to use the software 
spss has a day return policy for these types of licenses and the company calculates its return allowance using a month rolling average based on actual returns during the prior months 
under an annual license  the customer is granted the right to use the software for one year and may not return or cancel during the first year 
for each type of license  post contract customer support maintenance is offered 
under perpetual licenses  it is the customer s option to renew maintenance each year 
under an annual license  the customer must renew the license and maintenance to continue to use the software 
in both cases  spss contacts the customer two months before the scheduled renewal date to determine the customer s renewal intentions 
if the customer indicates that it intends to renew the license  spss will issue a new invoice 
in some cases  customers ultimately cancel a license even though they initially indicated a willingness to renew 
these cancellations are tracked in a month rolling average to determine the cancellation percentage that spss will accrue as its cancellation allowance 
during and  the company concurrently purchased software licenses from and sold software licenses to several customers 
the company utilizes the purchased technology internally and had the ability to determine the fair value of the licenses sold 
the company recorded revenues of  and  during and  respectively  related to these sales 
in  the company concurrently sold software to and purchased software from a customer 
the purchased software was to be sold in the ordinary course of business and was recorded at its carryover basis 
the company recorded revenues of  in related to this sale 
during  the aicpa staff released several tpa s for the software industry  consisting of questions and answers related to the financial accounting and reporting issues of sop as a result of the issuance of these tpa s  spss performed a comprehensive review of their revenue recognition policies to ensure compliance with recent authoritative literature 
on a prospective basis beginning in the fourth quarter of  spss applied the standards set forth in tpa fair value of pcs in a short term time based license and software revenue recognition and tpa fair value of pcs in perpetual and multi year time based licenses and software revenue recognition 
as a result of the application of the tpa s  spss recognized the revenue from short term time based licenses and perpetual licenses with multi year maintenance terms ratable over the term of the contract 
the company recorded a one time adjustment of approximately  to defer revenue for contracts entered into during the fourth quarter of capitalization of certain software development costs software development costs incurred by spss in connection with the company s long term development projects are capitalized in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for the costs of computer software to be sold  leased  or otherwise marketed 
spss has not capitalized software development costs relating to development projects where the net realizable value is of short duration  as the effect would be immaterial 
spss reviews capitalized software development costs each period and  if necessary  reduces the carrying value of each product to its net realizable value 
as of january   spss adopted sop  accounting for the costs of computer software developed or obtained for internal use 
this standard requires that certain costs related to the development or purchase of internal use software be capitalized and amortized over the estimated useful life of the software 
sop also requires that costs related to the preliminary project stage and post implementation operations stage of an internal use computer software development project be expensed as incurred 
during  and  spss capitalized   and  respectively  and amortized   and  respectively  of internal use computer software 
accounts receivable the management of spss must make estimates of accounts receivable that will not be collected 
spss performs ongoing credit evaluations of its customers and adjusts credit limits based upon payment history and the customer s credit worthiness  as determined by spss s review of their current credit information 
spss continuously monitors collections and payments from its customers and maintains a provision for estimated credit losses based upon historical experience and any specific customer collection issues that it has identified 
while such credit losses have historically been within management s expectations and the provisions established  spss cannot guarantee that it will continue to experience the same credit loss rates as in the past 
if the financial condition of spss customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
long lived assets spss assesses the impairment of identifiable intangibles  long lived assets and related goodwill and enterprise level goodwill whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
factors spss considers important which could trigger an impairment review include significant underperformance relative to expected historical or projected future operating results  significant changes in the manner of use of the acquired assets or the strategy for spss s overall business and significant negative industry or economic trends 
when spss determines that the carrying value of intangibles  long lived assets and related goodwill may not be recoverable based upon the existence of one or more of the above indicators of impairment  spss would use an estimate of undiscounted future cash flows to measure whether the asset is recoverable over its estimated useful life 
if estimated undiscounted future cash flows are less than the carrying amount of the asset  the asset is considered impaired and an expense is recorded in an amount required to reduce the carrying amount of the asset to its then fair value 
income taxes spss recognizes deferred tax assets and liabilities based on the differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and the tax bases of assets and liabilities 
spss regularly reviews its deferred tax assets for recoverability and establishes a valuation allowance based on historical taxable income  projected future taxable income  and the expected timing of the reversals of existing temporary differences to reduce its deferred tax assets to the amount that it believes is more likely than not to be realized

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company is exposed to market risk from fluctuations in interest rates on borrowings under its borrowing arrangement that bears interest at either the prime rate or the eurodollar rate 
as of december   the company had  outstanding under this borrowing arrangement 
a basis point increase in interest rates would result in an additional  of annual interest expense  assuming the same level of borrowing 
the company is exposed to market risk from fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates 
since a substantial portion of the company s operations and revenue occur outside the united states  and in currencies other than the us dollar  the company s results can be significantly affected by changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
to manage its exposure to fluctuations to currency exchange rates  the company may enter into various financial instruments  such as options 
these instruments generally mature within months 
gains and losses on these instruments are recognized in other income or expense 
were the foreign currency exchange rates to depreciate immediately and uniformly against the us dollar by percent from levels at december   spss management expects this would have a material adverse effect on the company s financial results 
on december   the company did not have any option contracts outstanding 
the company s derivative instruments do not qualify for hedge accounting treatment under fas no 
accordingly  gains and losses related to changes in the fair value of these instruments are recognized in income in each financial reporting period
