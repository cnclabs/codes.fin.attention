item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations general critical accounting policies and estimates this discussion and analysis of landamerica s financial condition and results of operations is based upon its consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
the company s significant accounting policies are disclosed in note to the accompanying financial statements 
the company believes that the following are its most critical accounting policies revenue recognition 
premiums on title insurance written by the company s employees are recognized as revenue when the company is legally or contractually entitled to collect the premium 
premiums on insurance written by independent agents are generally recognized when reported by the agent and recorded on a gross versus net basis 
agency premiums are typically remitted to the company days after the close of the real estate transaction 
title search and escrow fees are recorded as revenue when an order is closed 
policy and contract claims 
a provision for estimated future claims payments is recorded at the time policy revenue is recorded 
payment experience for the company and the industry extends for more than years after the issuance of a policy 
due to the length of time over which claim payments are made and regularly occurring changes in underlying economic conditions  these estimates are subject to variability 
as general economic conditions decline  claims experience has been shown to deteriorate leading to increases in such losses as mechanics liens and defalcations 
these factors tend to diminish as economic conditions improve 
loss provision rates are reviewed periodically and adjusted by management as experience develops or new information becomes known 
in establishing loss provision rates  management considers historical experience  current economic conditions and the mix of business 
the company s independent consulting actuaries perform projections of required reserves as considered necessary during the year and at year end 
these projections are compared to recorded reserves to evaluate the adequacy of such recorded reserves and any necessary adjustments are included in current operations 
long lived assets 
the company reviews long lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
if indicators of impairment are present  the company estimates the future cash flows expected to be generated from the use of those assets and their eventual disposal 
the company would recognize an impairment loss if the future cash flows were less than the carrying amount 
deferred tax asset 
the company recorded net deferred tax assets at december  and related primarily to policy and contract claims  the write off of intangibles and employee benefit plans 
based upon the company s historical results of operations  the existing financial condition of the company and management s assessment of all other available evidence  management believes that the benefit of these assets will more likely than not be realized 
a valuation allowance is provided for deferred tax assets if it is more likely than not that some portion or all of these items will expire before the company is able to realize their benefit 
goodwill 
on january  the company adopted the financial accounting standards board fasb statements of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 business combinations  and no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
under these rules  goodwill and intangible assets deemed to have indefinite lives is no longer amortized but is subject to annual impairment tests in accordance with the statements 
prior to july   goodwill was subject to periodic amortization on a straight line basis over its estimated life 
other intangible assets will continue to be amortized over their useful lives 
during the fourth quarter of before adoption of sfas no 
 the company changed its method for assessing the recoverability of goodwill not associated with impaired assets from an undiscounted cash flow approach to a discounted cash flow approach and wrote off a portion of its recorded goodwill see note to consolidated financial statements 
pension 
the company sponsors a defined benefit pension plan which is valued by an actuary annually 
the valuation is dependent on significant assumptions 
one significant assumption is that of the expected long term rate of return on plan assets 
the use of expected long term rates of return may result in recognized returns that are greater or less than actual returns in any given year 
over time the expected returns are used to approximate actual long term returns which result in a pattern of expense recognition that more closely matches the service lives of typical employees 
the company uses long term and actual historical returns  its asset mix and future estimates of long term investment returns to develop its long term return for plan assets 
another significant assumption in valuing the pension liability is the discount rate 
the discount rate utilized is based on rates available on high quality fixed income debt instruments available at the end of each year 
overview the company s primary business is the provision of real estate transaction services  including the insurance of titles to real property  which is greatly influenced by the real estate economy 
during the three year period from through  the company s title operations benefited from three distinct factors 
operations were expanded through the acquisition of title insurance agents  expenses were tightly monitored and controlled and the economic environment for the company s products improved 
during  the company decided to place increased emphasis on other products and services related to real estate transactions 
as a result  in october  the company acquired primis  inc  a web based provider of real estate services 
in  the acceptance of primis technology by the company s customer base proved to be much slower than anticipated  necessitating a fourth quarter non cash write off of intangibles  including goodwill  acquired in the acquisition 
in the company decided to exit its residential appraisal business 
in connection with that decision  the company recorded exit and termination costs of million 
revenues the company s operating revenues  consisting of premiums  title search  escrow and other fees  are dependent on overall levels of real estate and mortgage refinance activity  which are influenced by a number of factors including interest rates and the general state of the economy 
in addition  the company s revenues are affected by the company s sales and marketing efforts and its strategic decisions based on the rate structure and claims environment in particular markets 
premiums and fees are determined both by competition and by state regulation 
revenues from direct title operations are recognized at the time real estate transactions close  which is generally to days after the opening of a title order 
operating revenues from independent agents are recognized when the issuance of a policy is reported to the company by an agent 
this typically results in delays averaging days from the closing of real estate transactions until the recognition of revenues from agents 
as a result  there can be a significant lag between changes in general real estate activity and their impact on the portion of the company s revenues attributable to agents 
in addition to the premiums and related fees  the company earns investment income from its investment portfolio of primarily fixed maturity securities 
investment income includes dividends and interest as well as realized capital gains or losses on the portfolio 
the company regularly reexamines its portfolio strategies in light of changing earnings or tax situations 
factors affecting profit margins and pre tax profits the company s profit margins are affected by several factors  including the volume of real estate and mortgage refinance activity  policy amount and the nature of real estate transactions 
volume is an important determinant of profitability because the company  like any other real estate services company  has a significant level of fixed costs arising from personnel  occupancy costs and maintenance of title plants 
because premiums are based on the face amount of the policy  larger policies generate higher premiums although expenses of issuance do not necessarily increase in proportion to policy size 
cancellations affect profitability because costs incurred both in opening and in processing orders typically are not offset by fees 
commercial transactions tend to be more profitable than residential transactions 
the company s largest expense is commissions paid to independent agents 
the company regularly reviews the profitability of its agents  adjusting commission levels or canceling certain agents where profitability objectives are not being met and expanding operations where acceptable levels of profitability are available 
the company continually monitors its expense ratio  which is the sum of salaries and employee benefits  agency commissions and other expenses exclusive of interest  goodwill  exit and termination costs and write off of intangibles expressed as a percentage of operating revenues 
generally  title insurance claim rates are lower than other types of insurance because title insurance policies insure against prior events affecting the quality of real estate titles  rather than against unforeseen  and therefore less predictable  future events 
see critical accounting policies and estimates policy and contract claims for further discussion 
seasonality historically  residential real estate activity has been generally slower in the winter  when fewer families buy or sell homes  with increased volumes in the spring and summer 
residential refinancing activity is generally more uniform throughout the seasons  but is subject to interest rate variability 
the company typically reports its lowest revenues in the first quarter  with revenues increasing into the second quarter and through the third quarter 
the fourth quarter customarily may be as strong as the third quarter  depending on the level of activity in the commercial real estate market 
in the through period  the typical seasonality of the title insurance business was influenced by changes in the levels of refinancing activity

the second item is a one time non cash pre tax charge of million related to impairment of acquisition related intangibles that resulted from the primis acquisition 
the primis acquisition experienced performance levels below forecast due to slower than anticipated acceptance of its technology by the company s customer base 
in the fourth quarter of  prior to the adoption of sfas discussed below under accounting changes  the company elected to change its accounting policy for assessing the recoverability of goodwill from one based on undiscounted cash flows to one based on discounted cash flows 
the company believed that using the discounted cash flow approach to assess recoverability is a preferable policy as it is consistent with the methodology used by the company to evaluate investment and acquisition decisions see note to consolidated financial statements 
in connection with this change  the company incurred a non cash pre tax charge of million
