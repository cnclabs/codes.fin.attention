table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto 
management s discussion of income the consolidated statements of income included in item of this annual report summarize the operating performance of lafarge north america inc for the past three years 
to facilitate analysis  net sales and operating profit are discussed by operating segment and are summarized in the table below 
see note segment and related information in the notes to consolidated financial statements for further segment information 
our three operating segments are construction materials the production and distribution of construction aggregate  ready mixed concrete  other concrete products and asphalt  and the construction and paving of roads 
cement and cement related products the production and distribution of portland and specialty cements and slag  fly ash and associated blended products  and the processing of fuel quality waste and alternative raw materials for use in cement kilns 
gypsum the production and distribution of gypsum drywall and related products 

table of contents year ended december in millions net sales construction materials cement and cement related products gypsum eliminations total gross profit construction materials cement and cement related products gypsum total operational overhead and other expenses construction materials cement and cement related products gypsum total income from operations construction materials cement and cement related products gypsum total corporate and unallocated expenses earnings before minority interests  interest and income taxes assets construction materials cement and cement related products gypsum corporate  and unallocated assets total year ended december  net sales our net sales decreased percent in to  million from  million in the increase in gypsum net sales partially offset the slight decline in cement net sales and the more significant drop in sales of our construction materials operations  driven mostly by lower asphalt and paving sales and the absence of sales from recently divested operations 
by region  us net sales increased slightly to  million in compared to  million in  with canadian net sales decreasing percent to  million in the drop in canadian net sales was primarily due to significantly lower asphalt and paving sales in the ontario market 
except for gypsum drywall and canadian aggregate and concrete volumes  sales volumes decreased in most of our product lines due to weaker demand as a result of the sluggish commercial building sector 
these 
table of contents decreases were offset by improved pricing  which held up in most of our business lines in spite of slowing markets 
construction materials net sales from construction materials operations totaled  million in  percent lower than the all time high of  million in  with the most significant drop coming from asphalt and paving activity 
asphalt and paving sales totaled million  down percent from demand in canada was lower with volumes off percent compared to as a civil servants strike in ontario resulted in a slowdown in construction activity and delays in project tendering 
further contributing to the net sales decline was a slowing demand in the colorado and new mexico highway paving markets  resulting in increased competitive activity and decreased prices 
overall asphalt and paving volumes were down percent for the whole year  as us operations showed a smaller decline compared to canada 
ready mixed concrete sales totaled million  down percent from last year 
overall ready mix concrete shipments were million cubic yards in  percent lower than the previous year 
in the us  volumes were down percent to million cubic yards 
excluding divested wisconsin operations  heritage volumes in the us were down percent for the year  with lower volumes reported in most of our markets 
in the eastern us  most of the shortfall occurred in the fourth quarter due to a return to normal winter weather and slowing activity in maryland and new york 
western us volumes dropped during the last half of the year as economic conditions deteriorated in colorado and new mexico 
average selling prices increased percent during the year as increases in most of our key markets were sufficient to offset lower prices in toronto  colorado and new mexico 
in toronto  a sharp decline in commercial construction and overcapacity in the industry led to a difficult pricing environment 
deterioration in the construction economy in colorado and new mexico resulted in both lower volume and prices 
net sales of construction aggregates were million  percent higher than shipments of construction aggregates were percent lower in at million tons  with us volumes down percent as a result of weaker demand in the great lakes and western us markets 
canadian volumes were percent higher than levels  as strong volumes in western canada offset a percent drop in eastern canada 
average selling prices in were percent higher than last year 
cement and cement related products cement net sales declined modestly from  million in to  million in as a percent shortfall in shipments was largely offset by improved selling prices 
sales volumes for the year reached million tons  down percent in both the us and canada 
sales volumes  which had spiked higher in the last three months of due to mild winter weather  fell percent in the fourth quarter as a series of winter storms hampered construction activity in the great lakes and eastern us markets 
in canada  the decline in sales volumes resulted from lower consumption in western canada  where we have our largest market share  due in part to lower oil field activity early in the year 
for the full year  average prices in the us increased slightly less than percent while average selling prices in canada were up percent in local currency  reflecting the impact of price increases implemented earlier in the year as well a favorable product mix 
gypsum net sales from gypsum operations increased by percent to million from million in drywall sales volumes reached billion square feet  a percent increase compared to prior year largely because of added production from the newark  new jersey plant that we acquired in january shipments from heritage plants were up percent for the year 
production increased at every plant in the network except at the wilmington  delaware facility  which we idled in the fourth quarter 
manufacturing performance continued to improve at our two state of the art plants in kentucky and florida  which shipped billion square feet of drywall in  or percent of our total production 
additionally  drywall prices averaged per thousand square feet  a percent improvement compared to last year following industry 
table of contents price increases in march and september 
overall  drywall demand weakened in the fourth quarter in our heritage business  and prices declined to the lower s by year end 
gross profit and cost of goods sold gross profit as a percentage of net sales increased to percent from percent in  primarily reflecting a significant improvement in gypsum results 
construction materials gross profit as a percentage of net sales was percent in  in line with levels as improved margins on aggregates offset some deterioration in asphalt and paving 
cement gross profit as a percentage of net sales was percent in  which is at the same level as in the prior year 
the following table summarizes our cement and clinker production in millions of tons and our clinker production capacity utilization rate years ended december cement production clinker production clinker capacity utilization cement production was essentially in line with  while clinker production increased percent 
us cement production totaled million tons  similar to levels  while canadian cement production decreased percent to million tons 
clinker capacity increased with the start up of the new sugar creek plant  which was not fully utilized for the entire year  resulting in a decrease in average capacity utilization at us plants to percent in from percent last year 
canadian clinker capacity utilization decreased slightly to percent in from percent in largely the effect of a strike at our bath  ontario plant during the first part of gypsum gross profit from operations as a percentage of net sales was percent in  a turn around from the negative gross profit minus percent from this improvement resulted from to a significant increase in selling prices and reduced variable costs  reflecting lower energy  paper and gypsum costs due to both raw material price trends and improved efficiency 
selling and administrative expenses selling and administrative expenses totaled million in compared with million in as a percentage of net sales  selling and administrative expenses reached percent in  an increase of percent 
the increase resulted primarily from approximately million in reorganization and relocation costs incurred during the year in our businesses  as well as programs to increase bench strength and to create and improve shared services across our operations 
goodwill amortization our operating results reflect the new financial accounting standards board fasb rules under which we are no longer permitted to amortize goodwill 
the absence of goodwill amortization increased income from operations by million in compared to income from managed assets income from managed assets  net amounts to million in compared to million in  which represents a full year of blue circle north america management fees 
the significant increase million in direct and allocated cost and expenses to million in reflects the hiring of virtually all of the employees of blue circle north america as of january  and an increase in other cost 
table of contents and expenses that are directly allocated to the managed assets 
we are fully reimbursed for these expenses under the terms of the management agreement 
other income expense  net other income expense  net was million in compared to million in this includes among others  million divestment gains in  which is million more than in  the reversal of the natural gas derivative mark to market provision of million and a million decrease in the cost of our accounts receivable securitization program 
these favorable items were mostly offset by the million provision for the idling of our gypsum drywall plant in wilmington  delaware and an million increase in pension and other retirement benefits expenses 
performance by line of business construction materials our construction materials operations before corporate and unallocated expenses earned million on sales of billion  down from earnings of million on sales of billion 
asphalt and paving operations accounted for million of the earnings decline  while the absence of profits from recent divestments accounted for another million 
the balance of the earnings decline of million resulted primarily from lower earnings of our ready mix concrete business and higher sg a expense due in part to approximately million in non recurring reorganization costs incurred during the year 
while volumes generally declined in  the combination of market price increases and greater focus on higher value added products enabled us to achieve year over year price improvement in most of our product lines 
in spite of a percent decline in volumes  aggregates profits for the year of million equaled those in as generally higher selling prices and improved cost performance offset the negative volume impact 
ready mix profits declined million to million in this decline occurred primarily in three markets in the western us  where weak market conditions throughout the second half of the year led to lower volumes  in toronto  where competitive activity and lower commercial construction resulted in a significant drop in selling prices  and in montreal  where we experienced a month concrete truck drivers strike 
in several other markets  the general decline in commercial construction activity contributed to a deterioration in ready mix margins in as a greater proportion of our volumes were sold to the lower margin residential construction market 
asphalt and paving operations earned million in  about million less than in prior year 
margins deteriorated in canada and the us due to a significant drop in volumes percent for asphalt and percent for paving  which effect was partially offset by lower production costs 
while we do not foresee significant improvement in the western us highway paving market in  it appears that ontario is poised to rebound from the low activity levels suffered in cement and cement related products in spite of lower sales volumes  cement operations reported only a percent decline in operating profits to million  as the volume shortfall and million of costs associated with a six month strike at the bath  ontario cement plant were partially offset by improved prices  the favorable impact on depreciation expense of a change in the estimated useful lives of our cement plants and lower fixed manufacturing costs  particularly in the area of maintenance 
cement operating margins of percent were slightly higher than the successful start up of our new plant near kansas city and our slag operations in chicago and the conversion of the exshaw  alberta plant to coal  should positively impact our cement performance in gypsum our gypsum drywall operations reported an operating loss of million  million better than last year s operating loss of million 
a combination of strong volume growth  percent including the newark  new jersey facility  higher selling prices and improved operating efficiency helped the gypsum 
table of contents division reduce its operating loss 
average us selling prices for the year were approximately per msf  up from in during the year  progress was made in lowering our cost structure as variable manufacturing costs per thousand square feet msf were percent lower than while transportation and delivery costs were down percent 
the reduction in variable costs was primarily attributable to lower energy  paper and gypsum costs due to a combination of lower raw material prices as well as improved efficiency 
these cost savings were partially offset by higher labor costs related to the higher production levels of a portion of our natural gas requirements has been contracted at fixed prices 
in  the fixed prices were higher than the market prices resulting in a million unfavorable impact on our results 
these contracts will expire in and are currently generating a favorable impact as market prices have increased above the fixed prices in our contracts 
the operating loss of million excludes a million charge recorded in other income expense  net for the idling of our wilmington  delaware plant 
earnings before minority interests  interest and income taxes ebit ebit improved by million or five percent to million in from million in the improved performance of our gypsum division helped offset the decline in results of our construction materials and cement businesses  resulting in an million improvement in profit from operations 
in addition  a reduction in corporate and unallocated expenses of million was recorded in we recognized a pre tax charge to earnings of million related to the idling of our gypsum drywall plant in wilmington  delaware 
this move is expected to save us about million per year in operating costs 
this provision together with increased pension and other post retirement expenses million were offset by the absence of million in goodwill amortization under new fasb rules  the reversal of the million derivative loss for our natural gas contracts recorded in and a million increase in divestment gains due primarily to the sale of our paving stones business 
ebit from us operations was million  million lower than ebit from canadian operations was million  million higher than interest expense interest expense for the year was million  down million from due to a combination of lower debt and lower interest rates 
capitalized interest was million in  down from million in with substantially all of our long term construction projects now completed  we do not expect to capitalize any significant amounts of interest in interest income interest income was million  an increase of million from million in as increased cash from our canadian operations generated higher interest income 
income taxes income tax expense decreased from million in to million in  including the recognition of approximately million in non recurring us tax benefits in the fourth quarter 
we reversed a million deferred tax valuation allowance in the fourth quarter of considering the continued favorable long term outlook of the us market for our products  particularly in light of our ability to generate taxable income during the recent economic downturn  and our projection of future taxable income in the us  we have determined that there is no longer sufficient reason to believe that the recorded deferred tax asset will not be realized 
in addition  a favorable one time tax adjustment totaling million was recorded in the fourth quarter to reflect the final settlement of various issues with both us and canadian tax authorities 
excluding these one time tax benefits  the effective tax rate for the full year was slightly over percent 

table of contents net income net income improved by percent to million per diluted share in  despite the prolonged economic slowdown and return to normal winter weather conditions in the last three months of the year 
in  we recorded net income of million per diluted share 
overall  in a difficult environment  our performance in most product lines was solid and our results demonstrate the benefits of our geographic and product line diversification 
our full year profitability held up very well in spite of a contraction of the market  and us cement prices have improved in spite of lower demand 
profitability and operating margins in the aggregates business have been maintained and aggregate prices have improved in a weaker market 
our gypsum business  while still in a loss position  has significantly improved in terms of volumes  prices and costs 
we still need further improvement to return the gypsum business to a profitable level  but we believe that the programs we have put in place  including our decision to idle the wilmington plant  will enable us to achieve this objective 
our weakest performance in was in our paving business 
the deterioration in the ontario market  due largely to the civil servants strike and its related impact on project tendering  and a very competitive market place and lower demand in the western us resulted in a significant deterioration in the profitability of this product line 
finally  in certain markets  such as metropolitan toronto  metro denver  montreal and new mexico our ready mix concrete profitability suffered in general outlook looking forward  at this time in the us it appears that demand for most of our products is likely to contract modestly in while the housing market continues to perform well  commercial construction is not expected to improve in public works  and in particular  road and highway construction is somewhat uncertain 
however  congress and the us president recently approved fiscal tea funding in excess of billion 
budget constraints at the state level  are likely to influence the actual level of public works activity that is tendered in in canada economic growth is expected to continue to outpace the us we believe that the ontario paving activity will recover from a weak  which should improve earnings in that sector 
in the company intends to maintain its emphasis on mitigating the effects of lower demand through performance improvements including price improvements wherever possible and further cost reduction measures 
in addition to likely weaker market conditions  two significant factors will impact the comparability of our results in first  we will not benefit from the million of one time tax gains recorded in the fourth quarter of and our effective tax rate should return to a more normal level of approximately percent in secondly  our pension expense is expected to increase by million due to both lower discount rates and a reduction in the expected return on pension plan assets 
we expect to partly offset the adverse tax and pension impacts with a number of positive items from our performance improvement initiatives such as improved efficiency  lower costs and increased marketing focus 
some of the most significant areas of expected performance improvement are the full year benefits of our new cement plant near kansas city  lower fuel costs at the exshaw  alberta plant and the impact of the wilmington plant idling 
in addition  our sg a expenses should be favorably impacted by the absence of approximately million in reorganization and relocation costs we incurred in year ended december  net sales our net sales increased percent in to  million from  million in us net sales were  million  an increase of million or six percent 
sales volumes increased in all main product lines due to strong demand for our products and acquisitions 
additionally  aggregate and ready mixed concrete selling prices increased as well 
these increases were partly offset by lower average selling prices for gypsum drywall and cement 
despite the devaluation in the canadian dollar  canadian net sales improved 
table of contents million  or percent  to  million 
this increase was driven by recent acquisitions  most significantly the december merger with the warren paving materials group 
in addition  our heritage operations contributed to the canadian net sales increase as ready mixed concrete  aggregate and cement sales volumes increased by four percent  five percent and four percent  respectively 
construction materials net sales from construction materials operations reached a new high of  million  a percent increase from  reflecting improved sales volumes and average selling prices in both the us and canada 
overall ready mixed concrete shipments were million cubic yards in  seven percent higher than  and aggregate sales volumes were million tons  percent higher than asphalt and paving sales reached million  up percent from the warren paving materials group operations acquired in december and other recent acquisitions accounted for most of the improvement in shipments compared to last year 
in the us  net sales increased by million  or percent  to million 
ready mixed concrete sales volumes increased by eight percent mainly due to strong demand and the acquisition  in february  of pine hill materials corp 
and american readi mix concrete corporation  partially offset by lower sales volumes in wisconsin where we sold our operations in the fourth quarter of average selling prices for ready mixed concrete in the us increased by four percent due to implemented price increases and increased sales of higher value ready mixed concrete 
aggregate sales volumes in the us increased by percent due to the impact from recent acquisitions and a three percent increase in our heritage operations 
aggregate average selling prices increased by one percent compared to in canada  net sales increased by million  or percent  to  million 
ready mixed concrete sales volumes in canada increased six percent from levels primarily due to increased demand brought on by the strength of the toronto economy and the absence of the effect of a ready mixed concrete drivers strike in toronto in ready mixed concrete average selling prices increased by three percent in local currency  however  due to the devaluation of the canadian dollar  average selling prices declined one percent in us dollars 
the increase in average selling price resulted from general price increases and increased sales of higher value ready mixed concrete 
canadian aggregate sales volumes were percent ahead of levels mainly due to the merger with the warren paving materials group at the end of excluding the impact of the warren operations  aggregate sales volumes increased six percent 
aggregate average selling prices increased six percent in local currency  however  due to the devaluation of the canadian dollar  the effective increase in us dollars was reduced to two percent 
the average selling price was also favorably impacted by product and customer mix 
asphalt and paving sales increased percent to million  as heritage operations increased percent with the warren paving materials group accounting for the balance of the improvement 
cement and cement related products net sales from cement operations increased by two percent to  million from  million in due to increased sales volumes 
cement sales volumes totaled million tons  a two percent increase from  while the average selling price per ton in us dollars  net of freight costs net realization  declined slightly 
us net sales increased by million to million  as the benefit from mild weather in the fourth quarter led to a two percent increase in cement shipments 
net realization in the us declined one percent due to competitive pressures in certain markets and product and customer mix 
canadian cement net sales increased three percent to million from million in cement shipments in canada increased by four percent primarily due to the strong economy in ontario and favorable weather in the fourth quarter 
net realization rose by four percent in local currency  however  due to the devaluation of the canadian dollar  the effective increase in us dollars was reduced to one percent 
the increase in net realization resulted from annual price increases and improved product and market mix 
also included in sales from our cement operations are sales of cement related products of million  a seven percent increase from  representing million tons of slag and fly ash 

table of contents gypsum net sales from gypsum operations increased by percent to million from million in drywall sales volumes increased percent while average selling prices declined nearly percent compared to the volume increase reflects sales of million square feet of drywall from our new palatka  florida plant  which started production in january  as well as the ramp up of production at our silver grove  kentucky plant  where sales volumes increased million square feet over last year 
drywall prices continued the trend from and deteriorated through the first half of due to increased industry capacity 
we implemented three price increases in the second half of the year that have held fairly well  however  prices softened slightly late in the fourth quarter  following the normal seasonal pattern 
gross profit and cost of goods sold gross profit as a percentage of net sales decreased to percent from percent in  primarily reflecting a significant decline in gypsum results 
construction materials gross profit as a percentage of net sales declined slightly to percent in from percent in due to a change in our product portfolio to more asphalt and paving  which has lower margins  arising from the december merger with the warren paving materials group 
cement gross profit as a percentage of net sales decreased slightly to percent compared to percent in the average cash production cost per ton of cement in was equal to as lower fixed costs resulting from continued emphasis on performance improvement in our production facilities were offset by higher variable costs  primarily energy 
the cash production cost per ton increased slightly in the us due to purchased clinker at our sugar creek  missouri plant  but were offset by operating efficiencies at our canadian plants 
the following table summarizes our cement and clinker production in millions of tons and the clinker production capacity utilization rate years ended december cement production clinker production clinker capacity utilization cement production was essentially in line with  while clinker production declined two percent 
us cement production totaled million tons  down one percent  while canadian cement production increased four percent to million tons 
clinker capacity utilization at us plants declined to percent from percent due to slightly reduced production at several plants 
canadian clinker capacity utilization decreased slightly to percent from percent largely the result of decreased production at our exshaw  alberta plant where we extended the normal winter shutdown through the first quarter to help mitigate exorbitant gas prices 
gypsum operations reflect a negative gross profit as a percentage of net sales of percent  a decrease of percentage points from  due to the erosion of selling prices during  costs associated with the start up of a paper mill joint venture and the new production facility in palatka  florida  and increased energy costs 
selling and administrative expenses selling and administrative expenses were million in compared with million in the increase resulted from growth in our construction materials operations and costs associated with the implementation of the shared service center for our construction materials group 
however  selling and administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales decreased to percent from percent in  as efficiency programs helped to mitigate inflationary cost increases 

table of contents goodwill amortization amortization of goodwill was million in and million in the increase reflects amortization of goodwill resulting from the merger with the warren paving materials group 
income from managed assets income from managed assets  net amounts to million in this represents the blue circle north america management fee which started in july  when the management agreement related to the managed assets took effect 
other direct and allocated cost and expenses of million related to the managed assets were fully reimbursed under the terms of the management agreement 
other income expense  net key categories with amounts for and  respectively include gains on sale of fixed assets million and million  gains on divestitures of businesses million and million  loss on the sale of receivables under our securitization program million and million  losses on natural gas commodity contracts million and zero  losses or gains for pension and other postretirement benefit expense million loss and million gain  equity income million and million  expenses for restructuring million and zero  foreign exchange transaction gains or losses million loss and million gain  and other miscellaneous gains or losses million loss and million net gain 
divestment gains in related primarily to the disposal of our joint venture interest in centennial concrete pipe products and non strategic ready mixed concrete businesses in milwaukee  wisconsin 
the loss on the natural gas forward contracts resulted from recording a liability on the fair value of the commodity contracts in accordance with sfas no 
due to a decline in forward gas prices below the fixed contractual amounts 
pension and other post retirement benefits expense increased by million mainly because of special termination benefits of million and a decrease in the discount rate for the related liabilities 
restructuring costs in relate to the costs associated with reorganizing the cement business in the second half of performance by line of business construction materials operating profit from construction materials operations before corporate and unallocated expenses was million  million higher than this increase was driven by million of contribution from the warren operations  which were not part of lafarge in  positive contributions from other recent acquisitions and improvements in our heritage operations 
ready mixed concrete and aggregate sales volumes and average selling prices both increased compared to these items were partially offset by a change in our product portfolio as the paving business  which operates at lower margins  represents a more significant portion of our total portfolio 
us operations earned million  million better than this increase was due to higher ready mixed concrete and aggregate sales volumes of eight percent and percent  respectively  and higher average selling prices for ready mixed concrete and aggregate of four percent and one percent  respectively 
these improvements were partially offset by increased rental expense and repair and maintenance costs 
despite a million reduction in earnings due to the impact of the weaker canadian dollar  the canadian operations earned million  million better than the increased earnings were due to higher ready mixed concrete and aggregate sales volumes of six percent and percent  respectively  and higher average selling prices of three percent and six percent  respectively  in local currency 
however  due to the devaluation of the canadian dollar  ready mixed concrete average selling prices declined one percent in us dollars and aggregate average selling prices increased only two percent in us dollars 
these items were partially offset by increased repair and maintenance costs 
cement and cement related products operating profit from cement operations before corporate and unallocated expenses was million  a million or one percent decline from the decrease resulted primarily from a decline in the canadian dollar and start up related costs for the new production line at our sugar creek  missouri plant 

table of contents during the second half of  we reorganized our cement operations into five geographic regions 
the new organization  designed to better serve our customers  was implemented effective january  in the us  operating profit totaled million  million or eight percent lower than the decrease resulted from a slight decline in net realization due to competitive pressures in certain markets and increased fuel and power costs  which were largely offset by a two percent increase in sales volumes 
there was also an increase in distribution costs arising from the spring flooding of the mississippi river  as well as start up costs for our new kiln line outside kansas city  missouri  which cost approximately million 
our canadian cement operations reported an operating profit of million  million higher than in  despite a million reduction in earnings due to the impact of the weaker canadian dollar 
the increased earnings were primarily due to increased sales volumes of four percent and net realization of four percent in local currency 
however  due to the devaluation of the canadian dollar  the effective increase in us dollars was reduced to one percent 
these positives were partially offset by increased fuel and power costs 
operating profit from our cement related products slag and fly ash included in the cement results was million  a million increase from gypsum our gypsum drywall operations reported an operating loss of million  million higher than last year s operating loss of million 
the decrease in profitability was due to depressed drywall prices  increased energy costs  higher fixed costs associated with the start up of a paper mill joint venture and increased operating costs associated with the start up of the new palatka  florida drywall plant 
our silver grove and palatka drywall plants have both consistently improved their efficiency throughout the year and costs have progressively come down in both plants 
in the fourth quarter  the silver grove plant operated at a modest profit while the palatka plant was slightly below the breakeven level 
earnings before minority interests  interest and income taxes ebit in  ebit was million  a million or seven percent decline from this drop in profitability was affected by a million decline in our gypsum segment s results as well as approximately million of non recurring costs and a million impact from a decline in the value of the canadian dollar 
these were partially offset by the million gains on sale of assets  including the sale of our joint venture interest in centennial concrete pipe products and certain non strategic ready mixed concrete businesses in wisconsin 
the non recurring costs consisted of million of natural gas derivative expense that is expected to reverse in and million of fixed costs related to the new sugar creek  missouri cement plant scheduled to start up in the first half of ebit in the us was million  million lower than ebit from canadian operations was million  million higher than despite a devaluation in the canadian dollar which had an impact of million 
interest expense interest expense increased by million in to million primarily due to higher debt levels in interest capitalized was million and million in and  respectively 
interest income interest income decreased million in  primarily from the absence this year of the favorable impact on last year s results of the million interest receivable from the canadian customs and revenue agency recorded from the settlement of transfer pricing and cost sharing issues for the to calendar years see note income taxes in the notes to the consolidated financial statements for further information 
the remaining decline relates primarily to a decrease in short term investments in canada see management s discussion of cash flows and a reduction in interest rates 

table of contents income taxes income tax expense decreased from million in to million in mostly from lower us pre tax income and the impact of lower federal and provincial tax rates in canada 
the income tax benefited from a one time adjustment of approximately canadian million approximately us million to reduce deferred tax balances to reflect the reduction in canadian tax rates 
we expect the multi year relief plan to positively impact earnings from canadian operations going forward 
excluding this one time adjustment  our effective income tax rate increased to percent for compared to percent in due to the impact of non tax deductible dividends paid to minority interests in net income we reported net income of million in compared with million in the major reason for the decline in profitability was the losses incurred in our gypsum operations  as well as non recurring charges consisting of a loss on natural gas derivatives and fixed costs related to the new sugar creek  missouri cement plant which commenced production in the first half of and a decline in the canadian dollar 
other factors affecting the company critical accounting policies certain of our critical accounting policies require the use of judgment in their application or require estimates of inherently uncertain matters 
although our accounting policies are in compliance with generally accepted accounting principles  a change in the facts and circumstances of the underlying transactions could significantly change the application of the accounting policy and the resulting financial statement impact 
listed below are those policies that we believe are critical and require the use of complex judgment in their application 
goodwill on january   we fully adopted the provisions of sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
sfas no 
was issued in june and requires that goodwill no longer be amortized but reviewed annually or more frequently if impairment indicators arise for impairment 
in our goodwill impairment test  we use a combination of a market approach and an income approach 
in the market approach  we compare our reporting units with similar businesses  business ownership interests or manufacturing facilities that have been sold 
in the income approach  we estimate the discounted value of the sum of the expected future cash flows 
similar to our review for impairment of long lived assets  evaluations for impairment are significantly impacted by estimates of future prices for our products  the evolution of expenses  economic trends in the construction sector and other factors 
pension plans and other postretirement benefits the accounting for pension plans and other postretirement benefits requires us to make certain assumptions that have a significant impact on the expenses and liabilities that we recorded for pension plans and other postretirement benefits 
the primary assumptions made to account for pension plan and other postretirement benefit expenses and liabilities are as follows us plans canadian plans long term asset return rate liability discount rate discount rate for other postretirement benefits for was established at 
the expected long term rate of investment return on pension plan assets is based on historical performance  current and long term outlook and the asset mix in the pension trust funds 
the discount rates 
table of contents are an estimate of the assumed settlement rates for pension plans and other postretirement benefits based upon the expected amounts and timing of projected benefits payments 
the pension plan and other postretirement benefit expenses are impacted by the year end assumptions for the discount rate and the return rate on assets pension plan only 
if the discount rate assumption had been lowered by one percent  pension plan and other postretirement benefit expenses would have increased by approximately million 
if the asset returns rate assumption had been lowered by one percent  pension plan expenses would have increased by approximately million 
we expect our pension plan and other postretirement benefit expenses to increase by million from to  and our minimum required cash contribution to defined benefit pension plans to increase by million  due to both lower discount rates and a reduction in the expected return of pension plan assets 
the accumulated benefit obligation is also impacted by the discount rate 
the impact of decreasing the discount rate assumption by one percent as of december  would have been to increase the accumulated benefit obligation as of december  by approximately million  and would have increased the additional minimum pension liability amount by approximately million 
the allocation of pension plan assets as of december  is as follows us master trust canadian master trust us equity non us equity domestic fixed income cash total impairment or disposal of long lived assets we account for long lived assets in accordance with the provisions of sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
sfas no 
requires that long lived assets be reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
recoverability of assets is measured by comparing the carrying amount of an asset to future undiscounted net cash flows expected to be generated by the asset 
such evaluations for impairment are significantly impacted by estimates of future prices for our products  capital needs  economic trends in the construction sector and other factors 
if such assets are considered to be impaired  the impairment to be recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceeds the fair value of the assets 
assets to be disposed of are reflected at the lower of their carrying amount or fair value less cost to sell 
environmental remediation liabilities when we determine that it is probable that a reasonably estimable liability for environmental matters has been incurred  an undiscounted estimate of the required remediation costs is recorded as a liability in the consolidated financial statements  without offset of potential insurance recoveries 
environmental expenditures that extend the life  increase the capacity or improve the safety or efficiency of company owned assets or are incurred to mitigate or prevent future environmental contamination may be capitalized 
other environmental costs are expensed when incurred 
revenue recognition revenue from the sale of cement  cement related  aggregates  ready mixed concrete  concrete products  asphalt and gypsum drywall is recorded when title and ownership are transferred upon delivery of the products 
revenue from waste recovery and disposal is recognized when the material is received  tested and accepted 
revenue from road construction contracts is recognized on the basis of units of work completed  while revenue from other indivisible lump sum contracts is recognized using the cost to cost method to determine the percentage of completion 
amounts billed to a customer in a sales transaction related to shipping and handling are included in net sales  and costs incurred by the seller for shipping and handling are classified as cost of goods sold 
derivative instruments and hedging activities we use commodity based derivatives to manage our exposure to commodity price fluctuations 
we periodically enter into forward purchase agreements for a 
table of contents portion of our anticipated gas and power purchases to hedge price risk associated with fluctuations in market prices 
to the extent possible  we elect to apply the normal purchases or sales exception in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for certain derivative instruments and certain hedging activities  an amendment of sfas normal purchases and normal sales are contracts that provide for the purchase or sale of something other than a financial instrument or derivative instrument that will be delivered in quantities expected to be used or sold by us over a reasonable period in the normal course of business 
often this exception to the requirements of sfas no 
 accounting for certain derivative instruments and certain hedging activities  will apply to purchases of commodities used in our production process that would otherwise be considered derivative instruments 
when applied  this exception allows us to not recognize these derivatives on the balance sheet at their fair value as required by sfas no 
when the normal purchases or sales exception is not applied  the derivatives are recognized on the balance sheet at their fair value 
we may execute derivatives for purposes of hedging various commodity price and financial exposures 
for those derivatives that qualify for hedge accounting  on the date the derivative contract is entered into we designate the derivative as a hedge and document the hedge relationship as either a fair value or cash flow hedge in accordance with the requirements of sfas no 
we formally document all relationships between hedging instruments and hedged items  as well as its risk management objective and strategy for undertaking various hedge transactions 
this process includes linking all derivatives that are designated as fair value  cash flow or foreign currency hedges to specific assets and liabilities on the balance sheet or to specific firm commitments or forecasted transactions 
we also formally assess  both at the hedge relationship s inception and on an ongoing basis  whether the derivatives that are used in hedging transactions are highly effective in offsetting changes in fair values or cash flows of hedged items 
when it is determined that a derivative is not highly effective as a hedge or that it has ceased to be a highly effective hedge  we discontinue hedge accounting prospectively 
we will only apply hedge accounting to those relationships that have been properly designated and documented and are anticipated to be highly effective 
classification of a change in a derivative s fair value is determined by whether the derivative is designated in a qualifying hedge relationship 
for a derivative in a qualifying cash flow hedge  the effective portion of the derivative s fair value change is reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive loss in the consolidated balance sheets and in the consolidated statements of shareholders equity 
for a derivative in a qualifying fair value hedge  effective changes in the fair value are reported in the consolidated statements of income  along with changes in the value of the hedged item for the risk being hedged 
in both fair value and cash flow hedge relationships  any hedge ineffectiveness is reported as a component of other income expense  net in the current period s consolidated statement of income 
environmental matters our operations  like those of our competitors  are subject to federal  state  provincial and local environmental laws and regulations that impose liability for cleanup or remediation of environmental pollution and hazardous waste  require pollution control and prevention measures to be undertaken and require certain permits and approvals for us to conduct many of our operations 
as a consequence  we maintain an environmental program designed to monitor and control environmental matters relevant to us  including changes in applicable laws and regulations as well as instances where corrective action may be needed 
we recruit  employ and train personnel experienced in environmental matters who are responsible for identifying developments relating to environmental matters and bringing them to management s attention  including emergency reporting and quarterly reporting of environmental matters 
we routinely audit our properties to determine whether environmental remediation may be required  the amount of any necessary related provisions  the status of remedial activities undertaken and whether improvements may be required to meet current and future environmental requirements 
we may capitalize environmental expenditures that extend the life  increase the capacity  improve the safety or efficiency of assets or that are incurred to mitigate or prevent future environmental contamination 
we expense other environmental costs when incurred 
our environmental capital expenditures and expenses were not material for the years ended december   and and we do not believe that the ultimate resolution of our known environmental contingencies  for which we have recorded provisions for 
table of contents estimated probable liabilities  will have a material adverse effect on our financial condition  results of operations or liquidity 
however  our environmental expenditures have increased over time and are likely to increase in the future 
changes to existing or new environmental laws or regulations may impose substantial further environmental obligations on us 
such changes may include revised epa boiler and industrial furnaces regulations  final maximum achievable control technology provisions governing air toxic emissions  new cement kiln dust management standards or programs  revised state implementation plans regarding nox reductions  revised state implementation plans regarding reduction of fine particulate matter particles  federal major source permit requirements  and implementation of the kyoto protocol  if ratified 
we cannot presently determine the effect such changes may have on us  including the nature and amount of any required capital expenditures or other remedial actions  or on our financial condition  results of operations or liquidity 
management s discussion of cash flows the consolidated statements of cash flows summarize our main sources and uses of cash 
these statements show the relationship between the operations presented in the consolidated statements of income and liquidity and financial resources depicted in the consolidated balance sheets 
our liquidity requirements arise primarily from the funding of capital expenditures  working capital needs  debt service obligations and dividends 
we usually meet our operating liquidity needs through internal generation of cash except in the event of significant acquisitions 
short term borrowings are generally used to fund seasonal operating requirements  particularly in the first two calendar quarters 
cash flows from operations the net cash provided by operations for each of the three years presented reflects our net income adjusted for non cash items 
the changes in working capital are discussed in management s discussion of financial position 
the non cash adjustment for depreciation  depletion and amortization in decreased million due to the absence of goodwill amortization this year million and the change in useful lives of our cement plants reduction of million in depreciation expense  partially offset by increased depreciation related to recent capital expenditures including the new sugar creek cement plant and the acquired newark gypsum plant 
the million increase in depreciation  depletion and amortization in was due to higher capital expenditures and acquisitions 
gains on sale of assets increased million in of which million was attributable to the increase in gains on divested businesses 
the adjustment for other non cash charges and credits  net increased to million in from negative million in  mainly related to the provision of million related to the idling of the wilmington plant and the increase in pension and other post retirement benefit expenses 
cash flows from investing in  net cash used for investing was million compared to million in capital expenditures decreased million in largely because ongoing development projects  such as the construction of the palatka  florida gypsum drywall plant and the sugar creek  missouri plant  were completed in early and early  respectively 
spending on acquisitions decreased million in to million  as we only had one sizable acquisition in continental gypsum 
capital expenditures are expected to total approximately million to million in excluding acquisitions 
we intend to invest in projects that maintain or improve the performance of our plants as well as in acquisition opportunities that we believe will enhance our competitive position in the us and canada 
proceeds from the sale of non strategic assets and property  plant and equipment totaled million in compared to million in  with the proceeds mainly coming from the divestment of the pressure pipe and paving stone operations in eastern canada 
in  net cash used for investing decreased million compared to capital expenditures decreased million in largely because ongoing development projects  such as the construction of the 
table of contents silver grove  kentucky and palatka  florida gypsum drywall plants  were completed in and early  respectively 
spending on acquisitions decreased million from the relatively high level in due to the merger with the warren paving materials group in late december and the acquisition of the presque isle quarry in june redemptions of short term investments  net  decreased million from due to selling short term investments in the prior year to finance the merger with the warren paving materials group 
proceeds from the sale of non strategic assets  surplus land and other miscellaneous items totaled million in compared to million in due mainly to the disposal of our joint venture interest in centennial concrete pipe products and milwaukee ready mixed concrete businesses 
cash flows from financing in  net cash consumed by financing was million compared to million in this change of million resulted from the net repayment of short term borrowings of million in versus net proceeds from the issuance of short term borrowings of million in offset by an increase in the issuance of equity securities of million  a decrease in repayment of long term debt million and the repurchase of common stock of million none in 
we have access to a wide variety of short term and long term financing alternatives in both the us and canada and have a syndicated  committed  five year revolving credit facility with eleven participants totaling million 
at december  and  no amounts were outstanding under these credit facilities 
during  we entered into a receivables securitization program to provide a cost effective source of working capital and short term financing 
under the program  we agreed to transfer  on a revolving basis  an undivided percentage ownership interest in a designated pool of accounts receivable to unrelated third party purchasers up to a maximum of million 
under the agreements  new receivables are added to the pool as collections reduce previously sold receivables 
we continue to service  administer and collect the receivables sold  which as of december  and  totaled million and million  respectively 
since this program is accounted for as a sale of receivables  the related cash flows are included in net cash provided by operations 
management s discussion of financial position the consolidated balance sheets summarize our financial position at december  and we are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risk inherent in our canadian revenues  expenses  assets and liabilities denominated in canadian dollars  as well as interest rate risk inherent in our debt 
as more fully described in the notes to consolidated financial statements  we primarily use fixed rate debt instruments to reduce the risk of exposure to changes in interest rates and have used forward treasury lock agreements in the past to hedge interest rate changes on anticipated debt issuances 
the value reported for canadian dollar denominated net assets increased from december  as a result of a rise in the value of the canadian dollar relative to the us dollar 
at december   the us dollar equivalent of a canadian dollar was versus at december  based on results  if the value of the canadian dollar relative to the us dollar changed by percent  our consolidated net assets would change by approximately percent and net income would change by approximately percent 
liquidity is not materially impacted  however  since canadian earnings are considered to be permanently invested in canada 
working capital  excluding cash  short term investments  current portion of long term debt and the impact of exchange rate changes million  increased million from december  to december  receivables  net including due from affiliates  excluding an exchange rate impact of million  decreased million primarily due to decreased levels of sales in the fourth quarter of compared to and an increase in receivables sold under our securitization program 
inventories increased million  excluding the exchange rate impact of million  due to decreased levels of sales in the fourth quarter of compared to and additional inventory in gypsum related to the acquisition of the newark  new jersey plant and an increase in raw material sourcing 
the decrease of million in accounts payable and accrued liabilities  excluding the exchange rate impact of million  resulted mainly from lower 
table of contents activity levels at the end of the fourth quarter compared to and a decrease in amounts payable under our receivable sales agreement 
income taxes payable decreased million  excluding the exchange rate impact of million  due to the timing of installment payments 
net property  plant and equipment increased million during  excluding the exchange rate impact of million  primarily due to the continental gypsum acquisition and the expansion of the sugar creek  missouri cement plant and the construction of slag production and grinding operations in chicago 
capital expenditures and acquisitions of fixed assets totaled million in goodwill relates primarily to the redland  warren and presque isle transactions 
our capitalization is summarized in the following table december long term debt other long term liabilities and minority interests shareholders equity total capitalization no major changes in our capitalization occurred for the year ended december  as compared to december  the increase in the percentage of other long term liabilities and minority interests can mainly be attributed to the increase in the minimum pension liability 
our summary of contractual obligations as of december  is as follows in thousands less than total one year years years years long term debt minority interest obligations operating lease purchase obligations total management s discussion of shareholders equity the consolidated statements of shareholders equity summarize the activity in each component of shareholders equity for the three years presented 
in  shareholders equity increased by million  mainly from net income of million  the exercise of stock options for million and a foreign currency translation adjustment of million resulting from a percent increase in the value of the canadian dollar relative to the us dollar 
these were partially offset by the recognition of a million additional minimum pension liability  net of income taxes  and dividend payments  net of reinvestments  of million 
in  shareholders equity increased by million  mainly from net income of million and the exercise of stock options for million 
these were partially offset by dividend payments  net of reinvestments  of million  a change in the foreign currency translation adjustment of million resulting from a six percent decrease in the value of the canadian dollar relative to the us dollar  share repurchases of million and the recognition of a million minimum pension liability  net of income taxes 
common equity interests include our par value per share common stock and the lafarge canada inc exchangeable preference shares  which are exchangeable into our common stock and have comparable voting  dividend and liquidation rights 
our common stock is traded on the new york and toronto stock 
table of contents exchanges under the ticker symbol laf and the exchangeable preference shares on the toronto stock exchange under the ticker symbol lcipre the following table reflects the range of high and low closing prices of common stock by quarter for and as quoted on the new york stock exchange quarters ended mar jun sep dec stock prices high low stock prices high low dividends are summarized in the following table in thousands  except per share amounts years ended december common equity dividends less dividend reinvestments net cash dividend payments common equity dividends per share there have been no changes in the dividend rate since october management s discussion of selected consolidated financial data the selected consolidated financial data highlights certain significant trends in our financial condition and results of operations 
in  net sales increased by eight percent primarily due to favorable economic conditions supporting demand in most segments and increased average selling prices 
in  net sales increased by two percent due to acquisitions throughout our operations and improving economic conditions 
in  net sales increased by percent mainly due to recent acquisitions primarily warren paving materials group in canada  increased volumes from our heritage operations as well as increased average selling prices for ready mixed concrete and aggregate and canadian cement 
these were partially offset by reduced average selling prices for cement in the us and gypsum drywall 
in  net sales decreased percent as decreased volumes in most of our product lines  except for gypsum  were only partially off set by price improvements 
see management s discussion of income for additional details 
inflation rates in recent years have not been a significant factor in our net sales or earnings growth 
we continually attempt to offset the effect of inflation by improving operating efficiencies  especially in the areas of selling and administrative expenses  productivity and energy costs 
we compete with other suppliers of our products in all of our markets 
the ability to recover increasing costs by obtaining higher prices for our products varies with the level of activity in the construction industry  the number  size and strength of competitors and the availability of products to supply a local market 
net cash provided by operations consists of net income adjusted primarily for depreciation and changes in operating working capital 
we are in a capital intensive industry and  as a result  we recognize large amounts of depreciation 
we have used our cash provided by operations to expand our markets  improve the performance of our plants and other operating equipment  and to reduce our net debt position 

table of contents capital expenditures and acquisitions  excluding the redland assets that were acquired for million in but were accounted for similar to a pooling of interests  totaled  million over the past five years 
these included the construction of new drywall plants in kentucky and florida  acquisition of the newark gypsum drywall plant  acquisition of a cement plant and related limestone quarry  cement plant projects to increase production capacity and reduce costs  including the new richmond  british columbia cement plant and the sugar creek  missouri cement plant  the installation of receiving and handling facilities for substitute fuels and raw materials  the building and purchasing of additional distribution terminals and water transportation facilities to extend markets and improve existing supply networks  the expansion of our cement related products operations  the expansion of asphalt  paving and aggregate operations through the merger with the warren paving materials group  the acquisition of ready mixed concrete plants and aggregate operations  including our acquisition of the presque isle quarry  rocky mountain materials  pine hill materials corp  american readi mix concrete corporation and several other small tuck in acquisitions  and the renewal of the construction materials mobile equipment fleet 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to commodity price  interest rate and foreign currency risks 
we have defined strict policies and procedures to measure  manage and monitor our market risk exposures 
our policies do not permit any speculative market position 
we have instituted management rules based on a segregation of operations  financial and administrative control  and risk measurement 
we use financial instruments only to hedge existing or anticipated financial and commercial exposures 
we undertake this hedging in the over the counter market with a limited number of highly rated counter parties 
our positions in derivative financial instruments are monitored using various techniques  including the fair value approach 
commodity price risk we are subject to commodity risk with respect to price changes principally in coal  coke  natural gas  electricity and diesel fuel 
we attempt to limit our exposure to changes in commodity prices by entering into long term contracts and increasing our use of alternative fuels 
we occasionally use commodity based derivatives to manage our exposure to commodity price fluctuations 
we execute these commodity based derivatives for the purpose of hedging the economic exposure to commodity price changes  not for trading or speculative purposes 
by using derivative financial instruments to hedge exposures to changes in commodity prices  we are exposed to credit risk and market risk 
credit risk is the failure of the counter party to perform under the terms of the derivative contract 
when the fair value of a derivative contract is positive  the counter party owes us  which creates credit risk for us 
when the fair value of a derivative contract is negative  we owe the counter party and  therefore  do not have a credit risk 
we minimize the credit risk in derivative instruments by entering into transactions only with what we believe are high quality counter parties 
market risk is the adverse effect on the value of a financial instrument that results from a change in commodity prices 
we manage market risk by establishing and monitoring parameters that limit the types and degree of market risk that may be undertaken 
as such  a percent change in the commodity prices for hedged items would cause a change on our december  consolidated net assets and the consolidated other comprehensive income by less than million  net of any other impact 
such a change would have no impact on net income as our derivatives qualify as cash flow hedges with the effective portion of the fair value change reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive loss 
foreign currency risk translation risks the assets  liabilities  income and expenses of our canadian operating entities are denominated in a foreign currency 
our financial statements are presented in us dollars 
thus  assets  liabilities  income and expenses denominated in currencies other than us dollars must be translated into us dollars at the applicable exchange rate to be included in our financial statements 

table of contents if the us dollar increases in value against the canadian dollar  the value in us dollars of assets  liabilities  income and expenses originally recorded in the canadian dollar will decrease 
conversely  if the us dollar decreases in value against the canadian dollar  the value in us dollars of assets  liabilities  income and expenses originally recorded in canadian dollars will increase 
thus  increases and decreases in the value of the us dollar relative to the canadian dollar has a direct impact on the value in us dollars of our canadian dollar denominated assets  liabilities  income and expenses  even if the value of these items has not changed in their original currency 
at december  and for the year then ended  approximately percent of our consolidated net assets and percent of consolidated net income was attributable to subsidiaries that prepare their financial statements in canadian dollars 
as such  a percent change in the us dollar canadian dollar exchange rate would cause a change on consolidated net assets and consolidated net income by approximately million and million  net of any other impact  respectively 
transaction risks we are subject to limited foreign currency exchange risks as a consequence of commercial exposures as a result of purchase and sale transactions in currencies other than our operating currencies 
our exposure to changes in foreign currency exchange risks related to transactions is insignificant 
interest rate risk we are exposed to interest rate risk exposure through our debt 
in the past we have entered into interest rate forward agreements to reduce our exposure to market risks from changing interest rates related to anticipated debt issuances 
these contracts were terminated in when the hedged forecasted debt was issued  and any resulting hedging gains and losses from these contracts are reported as a component of the carrying amount of the hedged debt and are being recognized as a yield adjustment over the remaining debt terms 
at december   we had no derivative instruments related to interest rates 
we assess interest rate cash flow risk by continually identifying and monitoring changes in interest rate exposures that may adversely impact expected future cash flows and by evaluating hedging opportunities 
we maintain risk management control systems to monitor interest rate cash flow risk attributable to both our outstanding or forecasted debt obligations 
the risk management control systems involve the use of analytical techniques  including cash flow sensitivity analysis  to estimate the expected impact of changes in interest rates on our future cash flows 
our interest rate exposure can be subdivided into the following risks price risk for fixed rate financial assets and liabilities by contracting a fixed rate liability  for example  we are exposed to an opportunity cost in the event of a fall in interest rates 
changes in interest rates impact the market value of fixed rate assets and liabilities  leaving the associated financial income or expense unchanged 
at december   percent of our consolidated indebtedness was at fixed rates 
for a further discussion of our financial policy and interest rate exposure  see the note debt of the notes to consolidated financial statements reported in item of part ii of the annual report  which is incorporated herein by reference 
cash flow risk for floating rate assets and liabilities changes in interest rates have little impact on the market value of floating rate assets and liabilities  but directly influence our future income or expense flows 
we use variable rate debt to finance our operations 
at december   approximately percent of our consolidated indebtedness was at variable rates  which exposes us to variability in interest payments due to changes in interest rates 
as such  a one percent change in the average interest rate would have caused a change in consolidated net income of approximately million  net of any other impact
