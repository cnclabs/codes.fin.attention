during fiscal year  we acquired substantially all of the assets and assumed certain liabilities of evelocity corporation evelocity  a company that provides an electronic billing service for corporate legal departments 

table of contents during fiscal year  we acquired certain assets and assumed certain liabilities of the a group of companies the limited a  a company that provides electronic funds transfer software and payment managed services to the uk market 
our goal is to be the leading global provider of frm solutions and services 
our customer base  at over  companies  is in industries such as financial services  health care  technology  communications  education  media  manufacturing and government and includes approximately half of the fortune companies and of the ftse financial times stock exchange companies 
our revenues are primarily derived from the following three sources software license fees 
we derive software license revenues from our software applications  which are generally based on the number of software applications and user licenses purchased  including paybase  webseries encompassing webseries payments and webseries electronic banking nettransact and ipoint 
fees from the sale of paybase  webseries payments and ipoint software licenses are generally recognized upon delivery of the software to the customer 
certain software arrangements  primarily those involving nettransact and webseries electronic banking are often recognized on a percentage of completion basis over the life of the project due to the fact that they require significant customization and modification and involve extended implementation periods 
service and maintenance fees

professional services revenues associated with software license arrangements that include significant customization and modification are generally recognized on a percentage of completion basis over the life of the project 
revenues relating to our webseries legal e billing product and our other transactional based product offerings are recognized at the time transactions are processed 
certain of our offerings  particularly our outsourced and transactional service offerings  require customers to pay a non refundable set up or installation fee 
in such cases  since the up front payment does not reflect a separate earnings process by bottomline  these fees are deferred and are recognized as revenue over the estimated term of the customer relationship  which is generally three years 
equipment and supplies revenues 
we derive equipment and supplies revenues from the sale of printers  check paper and magnetic ink character recognition toners 
these revenues are normally recognized at the time of delivery 
equipment and supplies revenue also includes postage and shipping related charges billed to customers 
recent accounting pronouncements in july  the financial accounting standards board issued sfas no 
 business combinations and sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
sfas no 
eliminated the pooling of interests method of accounting for acquisitions  and was effective for all business acquisitions completed after june  under the provisions of sfas no 
 which the company adopted on july   intangible assets with finite useful lives are amortized over their estimated useful lives in proportion to the economic benefits consumed 
such intangible assets are subject to the impairment provisions of sfas no 
discussed below 
goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite useful lives are no longer amortized  but are instead tested for impairment annually  or more frequently when events or circumstances occur indicating that an asset might be impaired 
upon adoption of sfas  the company performed a transitional impairment test on all indefinite lived intangible assets  including goodwill 
as more fully discussed in note to the accompanying consolidated 
table of contents financial statements  as a result of the transitional impairment test the company recorded an impairment charge of million associated with goodwill in the bottomline europe reporting unit 
this impairment change is reflected in the company s consolidated statement of operations as a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle 
effective july   the company adopted sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
sfas no 
supersedes sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of and provides a single accounting model for the disposal of long lived assets 
the adoption of sfas did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
in november  the emerging issues task force reached consensus on eitf no 
 accounting for revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables  which addresses how to account for arrangements that may involve the delivery or performance of multiple products  services and or rights to use assets 
the guidance of eitf will be applicable to agreements entered into in fiscal periods beginning after june  fiscal for the company and companies will be permitted to apply the consensus guidance to all existing arrangements as the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle 
bottomline will adopt eitf on july  the company believes that its current accounting is consistent with the provisions of eitf and therefore does not believe that it will have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
effective january   the company adopted sfas no 
 accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities 
sfas addresses the financial accounting and reporting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities and supersedes emerging issues task force issue no 
 liability recognition for certain employee termination benefits and other costs to exit an activity including certain costs incurred in a restructuring 
sfas requires that costs associated with an exit or disposal activity be recognized when a liability is incurred  rather than at the date of an entity s commitment to an exit plan 
the adoption of sfas did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
effective january   the company adopted fasb interpretation no 
 guarantor s accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees  including indirect guarantees of indebtedness of others fin 
fin requires certain guarantees to be recorded at fair value and requires new disclosures related to guarantees 
the initial recognition and measurement provisions of fin were effective for guarantees issued or modified after december  additionally  new disclosure requirements applicable to all guarantees subject to the scope of fin  including guarantees that arose prior to december   are effective for financial statements issued for periods ending after december  the adoption of fin did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements  however the company has modified its disclosures herein as required by the pronouncement 
effective january   the company adopted sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure an amendment of fasb statement no 
sfas provides for alternative methods of voluntary transition to the fair value based method of accounting for stock based employee compensation  and it requires more prominent disclosures  in both interim and annual financial statements  about the method of accounting for stock based employee compensation and the effect of the method used on reported financial results 
sfas is effective for interim periods beginning after december   and for annual periods ending after december  the adoption of sfas did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements  since the company elected to continue to account for its stock based compensation using the intrinsic value method prescribed in apb however  the company has modified its disclosures herein as required by the pronouncement 
in january  the financial accounting standards board issued interpretation no 
 consolidation of variable interest entities fin 
fin requires variable interest entities to be consolidated by the primary beneficiary of the entity if certain criteria are met 
fin is effective immediately for all variable interest entities created after january  for variable interest entities arising before february   fin is effective 
table of contents in the first fiscal year or interim period beginning after june  effective as of july  for the company 
the company is currently evaluating the impact of fin  although at this time we do not believe that it will have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
reclassifications certain prior year amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current year presentation 
recent developments critical accounting policies and significant judgments and estimates we believe that several accounting policies are important to understanding our historical and future performance 
we refer to such policies as critical because these specific areas generally require us to make judgments and estimates about matters that are uncertain at the time we make the estimate  and different estimates which also would have been reasonable could have been used 
these critical accounting policies and estimates relate to revenue recognition  goodwill and intangible assets and our equity investments 
these critical policies  and our procedures related to these policies  are discussed below 
in addition  refer to note to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for a discussion of all of our significant accounting policies 
revenue recognition we derive our revenues from the sale of software licenses  professional services  software maintenance and equipment and supplies 
we recognize revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery of the product has occurred  the fee is fixed and determinable and collectibility is probable 
we consider a non cancelable fully executed agreement or customer purchase order to be persuasive evidence of an arrangement 
we consider delivery to have occurred upon transfer of product title to the customer  or completion of services rendered 
we consider the fee to be fixed or determinable if the fee is not subject to adjustment  or if we have not granted extended payment terms to the customer our normal payment terms do not exceed days 
we consider collection to be probable if our internal credit analysis indicates that the customer will be able to pay amounts as they become due under the arrangement 
our sales arrangements can contain multiple revenue elements  such as software licenses  professional services  and hardware and software maintenance 
revenue earned on software arrangements involving multiple elements which qualify for separate element treatment is allocated to each element based on the relative fair values of those elements 
revenue is recognized for each element when the aforementioned revenue recognition criteria have been met 
certain of our software development arrangements require significant customization and modification and extended implementation periods 
these arrangements do not qualify for separate element revenue recognition treatment  as described above  and instead must be accounted for under contract accounting 
under contract accounting  companies must select from two generally accepted methods of accounting the completed contract method and the percentage of completion method 
the completed contract method recognizes revenue only upon contract completion  and all project costs and revenues are reported as deferred items in the balance sheet until that time 
the percentage of completion method recognizes revenue on a contract as the work progresses  as a percentage of cumulative costs incurred compared to the total estimated project costs 
we have historically used the percentage of completion method of accounting for our long term and custom contracts  since we believe that we can make reasonably dependable estimates of progress toward completion 
progress is measured based on cumulative costs incurred  as measured at the end of each reporting period  as a percentage of total expected project costs 
accordingly  the revenue we record in any reporting period for sales arrangements accounted for on a percentage of completion basis is dependent upon our estimates of the remaining costs that will be incurred in fulfilling our contractual obligations 
our estimates of total contract costs 
table of contents at the end of any reporting period could prove to be materially different from final actual contract costs  as determined only at subsequent stages of project completion 
we solicit the input of our project professional staff on a monthly basis as well as at the end of each reporting period  for purposes of evaluating estimates toward completion  so that our estimates are based on the most recent cost projections available 
goodwill and intangible assets effective july   we adopted the provisions of sfas relating to goodwill and intangible assets 
we were required to perform a transitional impairment test upon adoption to determine the amount of goodwill impairment  if any 
based on the results of this impairment test  we recorded an impairment charge of million associated with goodwill in the bottomline europe reporting unit 
this amount has been recorded as a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle in our consolidated statement of operations 
we utilized an outside valuation firm to assist us in calculating the required fair value amounts in connection with our impairment review 
the principal component of each fair value calculation is the determination of discounted future cash flows  and there are a number of variables that we considered for purposes of projecting these future cash flows 
there is inherent uncertainty involved with this estimation process  and while our estimates are consistent with our internal planning assumptions the ultimate accuracy of these estimates is only verifiable over time 
the particularly sensitive components of these estimates include  but are not limited to the selection of an appropriate discount rate  our projected overall revenue growth and mix of revenue  our gross margin estimates which are highly dependent on our mix of revenue  the level of bottomline us products that will be sold by bottomline europe  our software product life cycles  the attrition rate of our customers  particularly those who contribute to our recurring revenue streams such as software maintenance  our planned level of operating expenses  and our effective tax rate the use of different assumptions or projections  in some or all of the areas noted above  would likely have resulted in different fair value results  thus affecting our determination of overall goodwill impairment 
we are required to test our goodwill at least annually for impairment 
in addition to the transitional impairment test we performed upon implementation of sfas  we also performed our annual goodwill impairment test during the fourth quarter of the fiscal year 
as a result of this test  we concluded that no further goodwill impairment had occurred 
at june   our goodwill carrying value was  and  in our bottomline us and bottomline europe reporting units  respectively 
there can be no assurance that there will not be additional impairment charges recorded in subsequent periods as a result of our on going impairment review 
in addition to our goodwill review  we also perform periodic reviews of the carrying value of our other intangible assets 
these intangible assets consist of acquired technology  customer lists and customer contracts 
we specifically consider whether any indicators of impairment are present  including whether there has been a significant decrease in the market price of an asset whether there has been a significant adverse change in the extent or manner in which an asset is used  and whether there is an expectation that the asset will be sold or disposed of before the end of its originally estimated useful life 

table of contents if indicators of impairment are present  an estimate of the undiscounted cash flows that the specific asset is expected to generate must be made  to ensure that the carrying value of the asset can be recovered 
these estimates involve significant subjectivity  similar to that which accompanies our goodwill valuation process 
at june  the carrying value of our intangible assets  excluding goodwill  was  none of these assets were deemed to be impaired 
equity investments we hold two equity investments in non publicly traded companies over which we do not exercise significant influence 
these investments are included within other assets in our consolidated balance sheet and are accounted for on a cost basis 
under the cost method of accounting  investments in non publicly traded companies are carried at cost and are adjusted only for other than temporary declines in their fair values 
we periodically evaluate the carrying value of these investments for purposes of determining recoverability 
this evaluation consists of a review of both qualitative and quantitative factors  including a review of the investee s financial condition  results of operations  operating trends and financial ratios and  as available  forecasts and projections 
we also consider the investee s access to capital and its financing alternatives 
our review and analysis is highly dependent on receiving timely and accurate financial information from the investees 
should our analysis of these factors prove to be incorrect  our results of operations could be affected 
during the fiscal years ended june  and june   we recorded charges of  and  respectively  related to impairment that we judged to be other than temporary in our investments 
the remaining carrying value of our equity investments was  at june  fiscal year ended june  compared to fiscal year ended june  revenues total revenues decreased by million to million in the fiscal year ended june  from million in the fiscal year ended june   a decrease of

software license fees represented of total revenues in the fiscal year ended june  compared to of total revenues in the fiscal year ended june  the decrease in software license fees in dollars and as a percentage of revenues was primarily due to a reduction in software license revenues generated in the us as a result of a continued slowdown in overall information technology it spending in the us  offset in part by an increase in the foreign currency exchange rate of the uk 
based on current plans  we anticipate that fiscal year software license fees will increase in fiscal year service and maintenance

service and maintenance fees represented of total revenues in the fiscal year ended june  compared to of total revenues in the fiscal year ended june  the increase in service and maintenance fees in dollars and as a percentage of revenues was due to the revenue contribution from our webseries legal ebilling offering which we introduced in may following our acquisition of substantially all of the assets of evelocity corporation  an increase in professional services revenues generated in europe and an increase in the foreign currency exchange rate of the uk  offset in part by a reduction in professional services revenues generated in the us

equipment and supplies sales decreased by approximately million to million in the fiscal year ended june  from million in the fiscal year ended june   a decrease of 
equipment and supplies sales represented of total revenues in the fiscal year ended 
table of contents june  compared to of total revenues in the fiscal year ended june  the decrease in equipment and supplies revenues was attributable to a decrease in revenues in the us and europe as a result of the continued migration of customers to our web based products and solutions  which are not equipment and supplies intensive  offset in part by an increase in the foreign currency exchange rate of the uk 
based on current product plans  we anticipate that fiscal year equipment and supplies revenues will approximate fiscal year levels 
cost of revenues software licenses 
software license costs consist of expenses incurred by us to manufacture  package and distribute our software products and related documentation  costs of licensing third party software incorporated into our products  and royalties to northern trust on revenues from our nettransact product 
software license costs increased by approximately  to million in the fiscal year ended june  from million in the fiscal year ended june   an increase of 
software license costs increased to of software license fees in the fiscal year ended june  compared to in the fiscal year ended june  the increase in software license costs was due primarily to an increased share of software license revenues generated in europe and an increase in the volume of certain third party software used with some of our us products  on which we pay a royalty 
software revenues generated in europe have historically carried a lower gross margin than us software revenues due to the cost of third party software  which is incorporated into and sold with the europe software products 
based on current product plans  we anticipate that fiscal year software license costs  as a percentage of revenues  will approximate fiscal year levels 
service and maintenance 
service and maintenance costs include salary expense and other related costs for our customer service  maintenance and help desk support staffs  as well as third party contractor expenses used to complement our professional services team

based on current product plans  we anticipate that fiscal year service and maintenance costs  as a percentage of revenues  will approximate fiscal levels 
equipment and supplies 
equipment and supplies costs decreased by approximately  to million in the fiscal year ended june  from million in the fiscal year ended june  equipment and supplies costs were of equipment and supplies sales in the fiscal year ended june  compared to in the fiscal year ended june  the decrease in equipment and supplies costs was attributable to the associated decrease in equipment and supplies revenues 
the increase in equipment and supplies costs as a percentage of equipment and supplies revenues was attributable to reduced profit margins in europe  resulting from an increase in shipping costs which carry no gross margin and  to a lesser extent  from higher third party costs associated with supplies that are sold in europe 
the uk began experiencing higher third party costs in the current fiscal year and our expectation is that this higher cost structure will continue 
based on current product plans  we anticipate that fiscal year equipment and supplies costs  as a percentage of revenues  will approximate fiscal year levels 
operating expenses sales and marketing sales and marketing 
sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of salaries and other related costs for sales and marketing personnel  sales commissions  travel  public relations  marketing materials and trade shows

table of contents from million in the fiscal year ended june   a decrease of 
sales and marketing expenses were of total revenues in the fiscal year ended june  compared to in the fiscal year ended june  sales and marketing expenses decreased in the us as a result of a reduction in salaries and commissions  resulting from reduced headcount and lower revenues  particularly software revenues 
these reductions were partially offset by employee severance and separation related costs as a result of cost reduction initiatives implemented in the us and in the uk during the first six months of fiscal year and by an increase in the foreign currency exchange rate of the uk

in connection with our acquisition of flashpoint  we assumed all of the outstanding common stock options of flashpoint  which were exchanged for options to purchase our common stock  and recorded deferred compensation of million relating to the intrinsic value of the unvested options 
the deferred compensation is being amortized to expense over the remaining vesting period of the options and resulted in  and  of stock compensation expense for the fiscal years ended june  and june   respectively

table of contents certain factors that may affect future results investing in our common stock involves a high degree of risk 
you should carefully consider the risks and uncertainties described below before making an investment decision involving our common stock 
the risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones facing our company 
additional risks and uncertainties may also impair our business operations 
if any of the following risks actually occur  our business  financial condition or results of operations would likely suffer 
in that case  the trading price of our common stock could fall  and you may lose all or part of the money you paid to buy our common stock 
the slowdown in the economy has affected the market for information technology solutions  including our products and services  and if this slowdown continues our future financial results could be materially adversely affected as a result of continuing unfavorable economic conditions and reduced capital spending by our customers and potential customers  demand for our products and services has been adversely affected 
this has resulted in decreased revenues  particularly software license revenues  and a decline in our growth rate 
to date  the us marketplace has been particularly affected but there can be no assurance that this trend will not extend  to the same degree  to the uk marketplace 
our future results will be materially and adversely affected if this slowdown continues or worsens and our revenues continue to be adversely impacted 
in connection with the economic slowdown  we have implemented several cost reduction initiatives in an attempt to improve our profitability 
if current economic conditions continue or worsen  these cost reductions may prove to be inadequate and we may experience a material adverse impact on our business  operating results  and financial condition 
our common stock has experienced and may continue to undergo extreme market price and volume fluctuations stock markets in general  and the nasdaq stock market in particular  have experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations  particularly in recent years 
broad market fluctuations of this type may adversely affect the market price of our common stock 
the stock prices for many companies in the technology sector have experienced wide fluctuations that often have been unrelated to their operating performance 
the market price of our common stock has experienced and may continue to undergo extreme fluctuations due to a variety of factors  including general and industry specific business  economic and market conditions  actual or anticipated fluctuations in operating results  including those arising as a result of any impairment of goodwill or other intangible assets related to our past acquisitions  changes in or our failure to meet analysts or investors estimates or expectations  public announcements concerning us  including announcements of litigation  our competitors or our industry  introductions of new products or services or announcements of significant contracts by us or our competitors  acquisitions  strategic partnerships  joint ventures  or capital commitments by us or our competitors  adverse developments in patent or other proprietary rights  and announcements of technological innovations by our competitors 
our fixed costs may lead to operating results below analyst or investor expectations if our revenues are below anticipated levels  which could adversely affect the market price of our common stock a significant percentage of our expenses  particularly personnel and facilities costs  are relatively fixed and based in part on anticipated revenue levels 
we have undergone  and are currently experiencing  slowing growth 
table of contents rates due to the current economic climate 
a decline in revenues without a corresponding and timely slowdown in expense growth could continue to negatively affect our business 
significant revenue shortfalls in any quarter may cause significant declines in operating results since we may be unable to reduce spending in a timely manner 
quarterly operating results that are below the expectations of public market analysts could adversely affect the market price of our common stock 
factors that could cause fluctuations in our operating results include the following economic conditions which may affect our customers and potential customers budgets for information technology expenditures  the timing of orders and longer sales cycles  particularly due to the increased average sales price of our software solutions  the timing of product implementations  which are highly dependent on customers resources and discretion  the incurrence of costs relating to the integration of software products and operations in connection with acquisitions of technologies or businesses  and the timing and market acceptance of new products or product enhancements by either us or our competitors 
because of these factors  we believe that period to period comparisons of our results of operations are not necessarily meaningful 
our mix of products and services could have a significant effect on our financial condition  results of operations and the market price of our common stock our products and services have considerably varied gross margins 
software revenues in general yield significantly higher gross margins than do our service  maintenance  and equipment and supplies revenue streams 
in the past year we have experienced a decrease in software license fees  particularly in the us  as a result of the continued slowdown in overall it spending 
if software license fees continue to decline or if the mix of our products and services in any given period does not match our expectations  our results of operations and the market price of our common stock could be significantly affected 
as a result of our acquisitions  we could be subject to significant future write offs with respect to intangible assets  which may adversely affect our future operating results in july  the financial accounting standards board issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  which required that goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite useful lives no longer be amortized  but instead be tested annually for impairment  or more frequently when events or circumstances occur indicating that goodwill might be impaired 
effective july   we adopted sfas no 
 which required us to perform a transitional impairment test on all indefinite lived intangible assets 
in connection with our transition to sfas  we recorded an impairment charge of million in relation to the goodwill of our bottomline europe reporting unit 
at june   the carrying value of our goodwill and our other intangible assets was million and million  respectively 
we could be subject to future impairment charges with respect to these intangible assets  or intangible assets arising as a result of additional acquisitions in future periods 
such charges could have a material adverse effect on our future operating results 
we face risks associated with our international operations that could harm our financial condition and results of operations in recent periods  a significant percentage of our revenues has been generated by our international operations  and our future growth rates and success are in part dependent on our continued growth and success in 
table of contents international markets 
as is the case with most international operations  the success and profitability of our international operations are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties that include  in addition to the risks our business as a whole faces  the following difficulties and costs of staffing and managing foreign operations  differing regulatory and industry standards and certification requirements  the complexities of foreign tax jurisdictions  reduced protection for intellectual property rights in some countries  currency exchange rate fluctuations  and import or export licensing requirements 
a significant percentage of our revenues to date have come from our payment management offerings and our performance will depend on continued market acceptance of these solutions a significant percentage of our revenues to date have come from the license and maintenance of our payment management offerings and sales of associated products and services 
any significant reduction in demand for our payment management offerings could have a material adverse effect on our business  operating results and financial condition 
our future performance could depend on the following factors continued market acceptance of our payment management offerings as a payment management solution  prospective customers dependence upon enterprises seeking to enhance their payment functions to integrate electronic payment capabilities  our ability to introduce enhancements to meet the market s evolving needs for secure payments and cash management solutions  and continued acceptance of desktop and enterprise software  and laser check printing solutions 
our future financial results will depend upon the acceptance of electronic invoice presentment product offerings in an emerging market our electronic invoice presentment business model is in the early stages of market adoption  even though the product has been generally available from us and our competitors for some time 
customers and potential customers may not be ready to adopt our electronic invoice presentment business model  or may be slower to adopt the model than we  or the public market analysts  anticipate 
if this emerging market does not adopt our business model or the market does not respond as quickly as we expect  our future results could be materially and adversely affected 
we face significant competition in our targeted markets  including competition from companies with significantly greater resources in recent years we have encountered increasing competition in our targeted markets 
we compete with a wide range of companies  ranging from small start up enterprises with limited resources  which compete principally on the basis of technology features or specific customer relationships  to large companies  which can leverage significant customer bases and financial resources 
given the size and nature of our targeted markets  the implementation of our growth strategy and our success in competing for market share generally may be dependent on our ability to grow our sales and marketing capabilities and maintain a critical level of financial resources 
we have undergone  and are currently experiencing  slowing growth rates due to current economic conditions 
if this slower growth rate continues or accelerates  we could lose market share to competitors 

table of contents integration of acquisitions or strategic investments could interrupt our business and our financial condition could be harmed we have made several acquisitions of companies and assets in the past  including the acquisition of substantially all of the assets and certain of the liabilities of evelocity corporation in may  and may  in the future  acquire or make investments in other businesses  products or technologies 
any acquisition or strategic investment we have made in the past or may make in the future may entail numerous risks 
for example  in december  protel  inc sought to add bottomline as a defendant in a claim by protel alleging infringement of certain protel patents by technology we acquired from evelocity  which claim we subsequently settled 
in addition to exposure to litigation from parties  including stockholders and creditors  affiliated with a company or business unit we acquire  our business is subject to risks that include the following difficulties integrating acquired operations  personnel  technologies or products  diversion of management s focus from our core business concerns  write offs related to impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets  entrance into markets in which we have no or limited prior experience or knowledge  dilution to existing stockholders and earnings per share  incurrence of substantial debt  exposure to litigation from other third parties  including claims related to intellectual property or other assets acquired or liabilities assumed  and inadequacy of existing operating  financial and management information systems to support the combined organization or new operations 
any such difficulties encountered as a result of any merger  acquisition or strategic investment could adversely affect our business  operating results and financial condition 
our success depends on the widespread adoption of the internet as a medium for electronic business our future success will in large part depend upon the willingness of businesses and financial institutions to adopt the internet as a medium of e business 
these entities will probably accept this medium only if the internet provides substantially greater efficiency and enhances their competitiveness 
in addition  critical issues involved in the commercial use of the internet are not yet fully resolved  including concerns regarding the internet s security  reliability  ease of access and quality of service 
to the extent that any of these or other issues inhibit or limit the adoption of the internet as a medium of e commerce  our business prospects could be adversely affected 
if electronic business does not continue to grow or grows more slowly than expected  demand for our products and services may be reduced 
we depend on key employees who are skilled in e commerce  payment  cash management and invoice presentment methodology and internet and other technologies our success depends upon the efforts and abilities of our executive officers and key technical employees who are skilled in e commerce  payment methodology and regulation  and internet  database and network technologies 
the loss of one or more of these individuals could have a material adverse effect on our business 
we currently do not maintain key man life insurance policies on any of our employees 
while some of our executive officers have employment agreements with us  the loss of the services of any of our executive officers or other key employees could have a material adverse effect on our business  operating results and financial condition 

table of contents we must attract and retain highly skilled personnel with knowledge in e commerce  payment  cash management and invoice presentment methodology and internet and other technologies we believe that our success is in part dependent upon our ability to attract  hire  train and retain highly skilled technical  sales and marketing  and support personnel  particularly with expertise in e commerce  payment  cash management and invoice methodology and internet and other technologies 
competition for qualified personnel is intense 
as a result  we may experience increased compensation costs that may not be offset through either improved productivity or higher sales prices 
there can be no assurances that we will be successful in attracting  recruiting or retaining existing personnel 
based on our experience  it takes an average of nine months for a salesperson to become fully productive 
we cannot assure you that we will be successful in increasing the productivity of our sales personnel  and the failure to do so could have a material adverse effect on our business  operating results and financial condition 
an increasing number of large and more complex customer contracts may impact the timing of our revenue recognition and affect our operating results  financial condition and the market price of our stock due to an increasing number of large and more complex customer contracts in the us  we have experienced  and will likely continue to experience  delays in the timing of our revenue recognition 
these large and complex customer contracts generally require significant implementation work  product customization and modification resulting in the recognition of revenue on a percentage of completion basis 
delays in revenue recognition on these contracts could affect our operating results  financial condition and the market price of our common stock 
increased competition may result in price reductions and decreased demand for our product solutions the payments and electronic invoice presentment software markets in which we compete are intensely competitive and characterized by rapid technological change 
some competitors in our targeted markets have longer operating histories  significantly greater financial  technical  and marketing resources  greater brand recognition and a larger installed customer base than we do 
we expect to face additional competition as other established and emerging companies enter the markets for payment and electronic invoice presentment software solutions 
in addition  current and potential competitors may make strategic acquisitions or establish cooperative relationships to expand their product offerings and to offer more comprehensive solutions 
this growing competition may result in price reductions of our products and services  reduced revenues and gross margins and loss of market share  any one of which could have a material adverse effect on our business  operating results and financial condition 
our success depends on our ability to develop new and enhanced software  services and related products the payments and electronic invoice presentment software markets in which we compete are subject to rapid technological change and our success is dependent on our ability to develop new and enhanced software  services and related products that meet evolving market needs 
trends that could have a critical impact on us include rapidly changing technology  which could cause our software to become suddenly outdated or could require us to make our products compatible with new database or network systems  evolving industry standards  mandates and laws  such as those mandated by the national automated clearing house association and the association for payment clearing services  and developments and changes relating to the internet that we must address as we maintain existing products and introduce any new products 
there can be no assurance that technological advances will not cause our technology to become obsolete or uneconomical 
if we are unable to develop and introduce new products  or enhancements to existing products  in a timely and successful manner  our business  operating results and financial condition could be materially adversely affected 

table of contents any unanticipated performance problems or bugs in our product offerings could have a material adverse effect on our future financial results if the products that we offer do not continue to achieve market acceptance  our future financial results will be adversely affected 
since certain of our software solutions are still in early stages of adoption  any unanticipated performance problems or bugs that we have not been able to detect could result in additional development costs  diversion of technical and other resources from our other development efforts  negative publicity regarding us and our products  harm to our customer relationships and exposure to potential liability claims 
in addition  if these products do not enjoy wide commercial success  our long term business strategy will be adversely affected  which could have a material adverse effect on our business  operating results and financial condition 
we could incur substantial costs resulting from warranty claims or product liability claims our software license agreements typically contain provisions that afford customers a degree of warranty protection in the event that our software fails to conform to its written specifications 
these agreements typically contain provisions intended to limit the nature and extent of our risk of warranty and product liability claims  however there is a risk that a court might interpret these terms in a limited way or could hold part or all of these terms to be unenforceable 
furthermore  some of our licenses with our customers are governed by non us law  and there is a risk that foreign law might provide us less or different protection 
while we maintain general liability insurance  including coverage for errors and omissions  we cannot be sure that our existing coverage will continue to be available on reasonable terms or will be available in amounts sufficient to cover one or more large claims 
although we have not experienced any material warranty or product liability claims to date  a warranty or product liability claim  whether or not meritorious  could result in substantial costs and a diversion of management s attention and our resources  which could have an adverse effect on our business  operating results and financial condition 
we could be adversely affected if we are unable to protect our proprietary technology and could be subject to litigation regarding our intellectual property rights  causing serious harm to our business we rely upon a combination of patent  copyright and trademark laws and non disclosure and other intellectual property contractual arrangements to protect our proprietary rights 
however  we cannot assure you that our patents  pending applications for patents that may issue in the future  or other intellectual property will be of sufficient scope and strength to provide meaningful protection of our technology or any commercial advantage to us  or that the patents will not be challenged  invalidated or circumvented 
we enter into agreements with our employees and customers that seek to limit and protect the distribution of proprietary information 
despite our efforts to safeguard and maintain our proprietary rights  there can be no assurance that such rights will remain protected or that we will be able to detect unauthorized use and take appropriate steps to enforce our intellectual property rights 
in recent years  there has been significant litigation in the united states involving patents and other intellectual property rights 
we may be a party to litigation in the future to protect our intellectual property rights or as a result of an alleged infringement of the intellectual property rights of others 
these claims  whether or not meritorious  could require us to spend significant sums in litigation  pay damages  delay product installments  develop non infringing intellectual property or acquire licenses to intellectual property that is the subject of the infringement claim 
these claims could have a material adverse effect on our business  operating results and financial condition 
we may incur significant costs from class action litigation as a result of expected volatility in our common stock in the past  companies that have experienced market price volatility of their stock have been the targets of securities class action litigation 
in august  we were named as a party in one of the so called laddering 
table of contents securities class action suits relating to the underwriting of our initial public offering 
we could incur substantial costs and experience a diversion of our management s attention and resources in connection with such litigation  which could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
our future financial results will depend on our ability to manage growth effectively in the past  rapid growth has strained our managerial and other resources 
recently  we have undergone  and are currently experiencing  slowing growth rates due to economic conditions 
if our historical growth rate resumes  our ability to manage such growth will depend in part on our ability to continue to enhance our operating  financial and management information systems 
we cannot assure you that our personnel  systems and controls will be adequate to support future growth  if any 
if we are unable to manage growth effectively  should it occur  the quality of our services  our ability to retain key personnel and our business  operating results and financial condition could be materially adversely affected
