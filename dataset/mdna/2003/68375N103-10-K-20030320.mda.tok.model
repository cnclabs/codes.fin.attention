item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations in this section  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  references to we  us  our  and ours refer to exegenics  inc the following discussion should be read in conjunction with  and is qualified in its entirety by  the financial statements and the notes thereto included in this report 
this discussion contains certain forward looking statements that involve substantial risks and uncertainties 
when used in this report the words anticipate  believe  estimate  expect and similar expressions as they relate to our management or us are intended to identify such forward looking statements 
our actual results  performance or achievements could differ materially from those expressed in  or implied by  these forward looking statements 
historical operating results are not necessarily indicative of the trends in operating results for any future period 
we are focused on creating and acquiring drug candidates that can be successfully developed and marketed as pharmaceutical products to fight human diseases 
from the time of our founding in until  our efforts were devoted to discovery research activities related to potential therapies for human disease and to improvement by genetic engineering of technologies for producing certain products manufactured and marketed by other companies 
through we had not created a commercially viable drug candidate  nor had our efforts in production technology improvement research led to any commercially viable manufacturing processes 
accordingly  during  a new ceo was hired and we evaluated all of our systems and programs 
as a result of the systems evaluation we installed a new financial accounting process and system and settled a shareholder dispute that resulted in a cash payout 
during our programs evaluation we identified those programs that we believed had no near term potential to create drug leads or to generate near term revenues and began efforts to out license those technologies 
to date these marketing activities have not resulted in any out licenses for any of those technologies 
one program  taxanes production research  was generating research services revenue  but had fallen well behind the originally anticipated schedule for delivering a microbial fermentation alternative for manufacturing taxol r 
thus  we set genetic engineering goals for this program and  because taxol r recently had become available generically  initiated discussions with our partner  bristol myers squibb bms  regarding their continuing interest in this project 
our program evaluation identified two platform technologies quantum core technology qct and oasis or optimized anti sense inhibitory sequence that we believed had the potential to generate revenues based on providing drug lead creation services to the broader pharmaceutical industry 
thus  we began attempts to market qct and oasis to other companies in the expectation that we could generate revenues from partnering these technologies with pharmaceutical companies 
in addition  we re focused these technology programs and set drug lead creation goals for them 
to date these marketing activities have not resulted in any material contracts for utilizing our technologies  nor have any drug lead candidates been created 
with the lack of progress in discovery research  taken together with market conditions  we came to believe that we can best build shareholder value and most effectively utilize our financial resources by the acquisition of external programs that have a greater potential for producing revenue than we can generate with our current internal programs 
thus  in we initiated a new strategy that focuses on accessing products in  or very close to  clinical development in humans and applying our resources to accelerate that development 
in mid bms indicated to us that  because of their de emphasis on funding external taxanes manufacturing research  the research services contract between them and the company would not be renewed 
in june  we implemented restructuring activities to discontinue non productive scientific programs  programs that we have been unable to outlicense  and programs without external funding including the taxanes production program 
as of december  we had completed the termination of all our internal scientific programs except for work on the qct platform technology  which had generated a small services contract with a major pharmaceutical company 
in an effort to maximize our existing financial resources  we eliminated the personnel related to the terminated programs as well as support related administrative positions 
associated research collaborations  non productive licensing and royalty agreements and non productive patent agreements have been terminated as well 
most consulting agreements and agreements with most of the members of our scientific advisory board that were discovery research related have also been terminated 
the only significant agreements not so terminated as of december   are the master license agreement mla with bms in which we have assigned to bms our rights to certain paclitaxel associated technologies  a paclitaxel associated license agreement with washington state university foundation wsurf in which wsurf assigned to us their rights to certain patents  and a license to certain anti sense related patents at the university of texas at dallas utd 
as of november  we had reached conceptual agreement with bms to terminate the mla and are in the process of negotiating final terms of that agreement 
we continue to support limited operations related to qct in an attempt to create novel compounds that may be advanced towards clinical drug candidates and pharmaceutical products 
qct is a computer assisted drug design technology platform primarily targeted to the inhibition of enzymes involved in disease processes 
to date we have been unsuccessful in demonstrating our capability to develop drugs using this technology internally or by partnering with other companies 
there can be no assurance that we will be successful in these efforts or that we will continue to fund these operations 
during the first quarter of  we announced the discovery of a series of novel chemical entities nces 
these nces demonstrated in vitro activity against gram positive bacterial pathogens  including staphylococcus aureus  that are resistant to ordinary antibiotics 
we filed a provisional us patent application regarding the structure and use of these agents 
while these compounds are interesting  there are numerous research hurdles  such as increased activity and less toxicity that must be overcome before we could put any one of them into a preclinical development program 
thus  owing to the long term development timeframe and the uncertain outcome of development  we have curtailed our activities related to this discovery 
in the event we decide to continue our research  there can be no assurance that we will overcome these hurdles or otherwise be successful in producing clinical drug candidates 
early in  we engaged petkevich partners p p  a financial advisory firm  to assist us in the endeavor to locate and obtain pharmaceutical compounds in or close to human clinical trials 
together with p p we identified and examined a number of opportunities that would fulfill the product acquisition goal and also provide financial and operational synergies 
our engagement of p p was initially for a one year period  but the board has approved  and we are engaged in the process of finalizing an agreement for  the renewal of such engagement 
we undertook discussions with several companies and executed a merger agreement with a private company in september owing to market conditions  this agreement was terminated by mutual agreement in november we are currently evaluating other companies and technologies that may provide these opportunities 
there can be no assurance that we will be successful in these efforts 
on march   we announced the election of joseph m 
davie md  md to our board of directors  filling the board seat vacated by the previously announced resignation of dr 
arthur bollon 
our actual research and development and related activities may vary significantly from current plans depending on numerous factors  including changes in the costs of such activities from current estimates  the results of our research and development programs  the results of clinical studies  the timing of regulatory submissions  technological advances  determinations as to commercial potential and the status of competitive products 
the focus and direction of our operations will also be dependent upon the establishment of collaborative arrangements with other companies  the availability of financing and other factors 
our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis we evaluate our estimates  including those related to investments  intangible assets  income taxes  contingencies and litigation 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
revenue from research support agreements is recognized ratably over the length of the agreements 
revenue resulting from contracts or agreements with milestones is recognized when the milestone is achieved 
amounts received in advance of services to be performed or the achievement of milestones are recorded as deferred revenue 
payments to third parties in connection with nonrefundable license fees are being recognized over the period of performance of related research and development activities 
we record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
while we have considered future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for the valuation allowance  in the event we were to determine that we would be able to realize deferred tax assets in the future in excess of its net recorded amount  an adjustment to the net deferred tax asset would increase income in the period such determination was made 
likewise  should we determine that we would not be able to realize all or part of our net deferred tax asset in the future  an adjustment to the net deferred tax asset would be charged to income in the period such determination was made 
results of operations fiscal year ended december  compared to fiscal year ended december  revenues revenues for and were primarily attributable to license and research and development payments  including those from our agreements with bms 
we recognized revenues of  during fiscal  compared to  for fiscal  a decrease of  or 
the decrease was a result of the completion of the funding related to our research and development agreement with bms  offset by a laboratory services agreement executed in december  in the aggregate amount of   of which was recognized in research and development expenses we incurred research and development expenses of  during fiscal and  during fiscal  a year to year decrease of  or 
the decrease in research and development expenses in from was primarily due to the discontinuation of research projects and related activities as we implemented our revised strategy 
the overall decrease was comprised of a  decrease in research salaries  a  decrease in expenses for contract research  licenses and royalties  a  decrease in research services and supplies  a  decrease in facility costs  partially offset by a  increase in equipment and depreciation expenses for equipment placed in service in the latter part of and a  charge for employee related expenses previously charged to g a expense 
general and administrative expenses general and administrative expenses for fiscal were  compared to  for fiscal  a decrease of  or 
general and administrative expenses decreased primarily as a result of a  decrease in legal fees in due to a settlement fee of  and  of legal expenses recognized in decreases in salaries and wages of  a  decrease in expenses related to the amortization of purchased intellectual property and a  decrease in employee related expenses now charged to r d expense were offset by a  increase in expenses related to patents and intellectual property and a  increase in professional consulting charges 
merger expenses we recognized an aggregate of  in expenses related to our terminated merger with idds  which included  in legal fees   in fees to the financial advisor and  in other fees for audit  printing and investor relations services  a  termination fee paid to idds and a  expense related to establishing the reserve account for the idds convertible note 
there were no comparable expenses for fiscal expenses related to strategic redirection as a result of our decision to redirect our business strategy  we recognized  in expenses from operations terminated in fiscal these expenses included  for severance payments   for facility lease space for the terminated operations through december    for losses for equipment no longer used   in impairment charges for software deemed to be of no value and  for charges related to leased equipment utilized for the terminated operations 
we recognized  in expenses related to severance payments from operations terminated in the fiscal year other income other income for fiscal was  as compared to  during fiscal the gain in was due to recognizing the relinquishment of certain patent rights 
interest income interest income for fiscal was  as compared to  for fiscal  a decrease of  or 
the decrease in interest income was due to lower interest rates and declining investable balances as disbursements were made

we recognized revenues of  during fiscal  compared to  for fiscal  an increase of  or 
the increase was a result of the extension of our research and development agreement with bms 
research and development expenses we incurred research and development expenses of  during fiscal and  during fiscal  an increase of  or 
the increase in research and development expenses in from was due to the hiring of additional scientific staff in  expenses for research services including a non cash charge related to options granted to consultants  additional commitments to fund external research  increased depreciation expense  and an increase in office and laboratory supplies required to support our increased activities 
expenses in primarily include  for research consultants   for contract research and  for lab supplies and other research services 
general and administrative expenses general and administrative expenses for fiscal were  compared to  for fiscal  an increase of  or 
general and administrative expenses increased as a result of higher salary costs  additional travel and lodging expenses including relocation reimbursements  increases in legal and professional fees  including a  charge for a dispute settlement  and a non cash expense for the issuance of options 
these expenses were substantially offset by a decrease in public and financial relations expenses  as well as a decrease in tax expenses 
expenses in include  for expense related to our corporate restructuring activities   for audit fees and other accounting related services   for legal fees related to patents and intellectual property   for company and employee insurance and  for legal services  of which the consulting and legal services were mainly due to assistance with our reorganization and ongoing corporate activities 
expenses related to strategic redirection as a result of our decision to redirect our business strategy  we recognized  in expenses related to severance payments from operations terminated in the fiscal year there were no comparable expenses for fiscal other income other income for fiscal was  as compared to during fiscal the increase was due to recognizing a gain for the relinquishment of certain patent rights 
interest income interest income for fiscal was  compared to  for fiscal  a decrease of  or 
the decrease in interest income was due to lower interest rates and declining investable balances as disbursements were made 
net loss we incurred net losses of  during fiscal and  during fiscal the increase in net loss of  or  is a result of the aforementioned changes in our operations

liquidity and capital resources at december  we had cash  cash equivalents and investments of approximately  plus restricted cash of  during  we used approximately  to fund our operating activities  principally related to a net loss of  for the year 
we sold approximately  of laboratory equipment and paid  on our capital lease 
since inception we have financed our operations from debt and equity financings as well as fees received from licensing and research and development agreements 
during  we exercised our right of redemption related to  of our class c  d and other warrants and options and received net proceeds of approximately  we have no material capital commitments for the year ending december  we believe that we have sufficient cash on hand at december  to finance our operations through at least january  we have enhanced our cash planning procedures to ensure continual review and revision of the allocation of financial resources to the programs that have the highest priority and represent the best long and short term profit potential 
however  there can be no assurance that we will generate sufficient revenues  if any  to fund our operations after such period or that any required financings will be available  through bank borrowings  debt or equity offerings  or otherwise  on acceptable terms or at all 
as our common stock has not maintained a bid price of greater than under nasdaq s listing guidelines  our common stock was due to be delisted from the nasdaq national market on october  prior to that date  however  we successfully applied to have the listing of our common stock transferred to the nasdaq smallcap market 
transferring to the nasdaq smallcap market provided us with a grace period until january  to comply with nasdaq s minimum bid price requirement 
on that date  nasdaq granted us an additional day grace period to comply  since we met the core initial listing standards for the nasdaq smallcap market as of that date 
if we fail to meet the continued listing standards by the time this additional grace period terminates on july   our common stock would be delisted from the nasdaq smallcap market 
this would likely have an adverse impact on the trading price and liquidity of our common stock 
if our common stock were to be delisted  trading  if any  in the common stock may continue to be conducted on the otc bulletin board upon application by the requisite market makers 
it is possible  however  that nasdaq will revise the applicable rules to provide an extended grace period 
recent accounting pronouncements in july  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for obligations associated with the retirement of long lived assets 
the objective of fas is to provide accounting guidance for legal obligations associated with the retirement of tangible long lived assets 
the retirement obligations included within the scope of fas are those that an entity cannot avoid as a result of the acquisition  construction or normal operation of a long lived asset 
components of larger systems also fall under fas  as well as tangible long lived assets with indeterminable lives 
fas is required to be adopted on january  in april  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 rescission of fas nos 
  and  amendment of fasb  and technical corrections as of april as a result  the accounting for gains and losses from extinguishment of debt and sale leaseback transactions will be affected by fas the provisions of fas related to the rescission of statements  and shall be applied in fiscal years beginning after may  the provisions of fas related to statement shall be effective for transactions occurring after may  in june  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities 
fas nullifies emerging issues task force issue no 
 liability recognition for certain employee termination benefits and other costs to exit an activity including certain costs incurred in a restructuring 
fas requires a liability for a cost associated with an exit or disposal activity to be recognized when the liability is incurred rather than on the date of an entity s commitment to an exit plan and establishes that fair value is the objective for initial measurement of the liability 
the provisions of fas shall be effective for exit or disposal activities initiated after december  with earlier application encouraged 
the provisions of issue shall continue to apply for an exit activity initiated under an exit plan that met the criteria of issue prior to fas s initial application 
we believe that the adoption of these accounting standards will not have a material impact on our financial statements 
effective january   we adopted the provisions of financial accounting standards no 
business combinations  no 
goodwill and other intangible assets and no 
accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
the impact of adopting these standards on our financial position and results of operations was immaterial 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our exposure to financial market risk  including changes in interest rates  relates primarily to our marketable security investments 
we generally place our marketable security investments in high credit quality instruments  primarily us government obligations and corporate obligations with contractual maturities of less than one year 
we do not believe that a basis point increase or decrease in interest rates would significantly impact our business 
we do not have any derivative instruments 
we operate only in the united states and all our transactions have been made in us dollars 
we do not have any material exposure to changes in foreign currency exchange rates
