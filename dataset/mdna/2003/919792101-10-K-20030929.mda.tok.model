item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview the company is a leading packager and distributor of industrial  medical and specialty gases  welding equipment and supplies  and propane in states in the eastern united states 
the company s net sales have grown  primarily as a result of acquisitions  at a compound annual rate of approximately per year since the company started business in  increasing from  in that year to million in fiscal in fiscal  gases accounted for approximately of net sales  welding equipment and supplies accounted for approximately of net sales  and cylinder and tank rental and other accounted for approximately of net sales 
the company believes it has been successful in executing its strategy of growth through acquisitions  having completed acquisitions since some acquisitions have had  and the company expects some future acquisitions will have  a dilutive effect upon the company s income from operations and income before tax for a short period following consummation 
this temporary dilution occurs because some of the benefits of acquisitions  such as leveraging of operating and administrative expenses  improved product gross margins and real sales growth  occur over a period ranging from two to eight quarters  depending upon the complexity of integrating each acquisition into the company s existing operations 
the consideration for most acquisitions includes a combination of a cash payment at closing  seller financing and payments under covenants not to compete and consulting agreements 
in most cases  operating cash flow of an acquired business is positive in a relatively short period of time 
for many acquisitions  the company believes that projections of future cash flows justify payment of amounts in excess of the book or market value of the assets acquired  resulting in goodwill being recorded 
the company s results are subject to moderate seasonality  primarily due to fluctuations in the demand for propane  which is highest during winter months falling in the company s second and third fiscal quarters 
seasonality of total sales has increased as propane sales have increased as a percentage of total sales 
operating and administrative expenses are comprised primarily of salaries  benefits  transportation equipment operating costs  facility lease expenses and general office expenses 
these expenses are generally fixed on a quarter to quarter basis 
the company believes that changes in these expenses as a percentage of sales should be evaluated over the long term rather than on a quarter to quarter basis due to the moderate seasonality of sales mentioned above and the generally fixed nature of these expenses 
historically  the company s gross profit margins as a percentage of sales have been higher on the sale of gases than on the sale of welding equipment and supplies hard goods 
future acquisitions may affect the company s gross profit margins as a percentage of sales depending upon the product mix of the acquired businesses 
results of operations the following table sets forth  for the periods indicated  certain items in the company s consolidated statements of operations as a percentage of net sales

for each of the facilities being closed  the company determined the expected date for operations to cease and revised the estimated useful lives for applicable assets accordingly

critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires management to make judgments  assumptions and estimates that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes 
note to the consolidated financial statements describes the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements 
estimates are used for  but not limited to  determining the net carrying value of trade receivables  inventories  goodwill  other intangible assets and employee health care benefit reserves 
actual results could differ from these estimates 
the following critical accounting policies are impacted significantly by judgments  assumptions and estimates used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements 
trade receivables the company estimates the collectability of its trade receivables on a monthly basis 
management has established an allowance for doubtful accounts to adjust the carrying value of trade receivables to fair value based on an estimate of the amount of trade receivables that are deemed uncollectible 
the allowance for doubtful accounts is determined based on historical experience  economic trends and management s knowledge of significant accounts 
management believes that the allowances for doubtful accounts as of june  and are adequate 
inventories the company s inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market 
the company writes down its inventory for estimated obsolescence or unmarketable inventory equal to the difference between the cost of inventory and the estimated market value based upon its physical condition as well as assumptions about future demand and market conditions 
if actual demand or market conditions in the future are less favorable than those estimated  additional inventory write downs may be required 
estimates of physical losses of inventory are made on a quarterly basis based upon historical results 
goodwill and other intangible assets the company adopted sfas  goodwill and other intangible assets  as of july  sfas requires goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite useful lives not to be amortized  but instead be tested for impairment at least annually 
the company has elected to perform its annual test for indications of goodwill impairment as of june th of each year 
the annual impairment test used by the company includes a discounted cash flow analysis as well as other tests of the market value of its business entity 
the discounted cash flow analysis requires the use of significant estimates  assumptions and judgments 
examples include i projections on company operating performance  ii assumptions as to the company s cost of capital  and iii assumptions as to the availability of capital in the future 
employee health care benefits payable the company has self funded health care benefit programs in place whereby a third party administrator settles and pays incurred claims on an on going basis 
the company estimates the level of outstanding claims  at any point in time  including claims incurred but not reported  based upon historical payment patterns  knowledge of individual claims and estimates of health care costs 
the company has stop loss insurance coverage in place to limit the extent of individual claims 
valuation of long lived assets long lived assets to be held and used are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable 
estimates of the remaining useful lives of assets are reviewed at least annually at the close of the fiscal year 
determination of recoverability is based on an estimate of discounted or undiscounted future cash flows resulting from the use of the assets and its eventual disposition 
measurement of an impairment loss for long lived assets that management expects to hold and use is based on the fair value of the assets 
fluctuations in quarterly results the company generally has experienced higher sales activity during its second and third quarters as a result of seasonal sales of propane  with corresponding lower sales for the first and fourth quarters 
the following table sets forth  for the periods indicated  the company s quarterly sales as a percentage of the respective fiscal year s sales 
results for any one or more periods are not necessarily indicative of continuing trends 
years ended june  first quarter second quarter third quarter fourth quarter as a result  income from operations and net income typically are higher for the second and third quarters than for the first and fourth quarters of the fiscal year 
the timing of acquisitions may also have an appreciable effect on quarter to quarter earnings 
inflation the impact of inflation on the company s operating results has been moderate in recent years  reflecting generally low rates of inflation in the economy and the company s historical ability to pass purchase price increases to its customers in the form of sales price increases 
while inflation has not had  and the company does not expect that it will have  a material impact upon operating results  there is no assurance that the company s business will not be affected by inflation in the future
