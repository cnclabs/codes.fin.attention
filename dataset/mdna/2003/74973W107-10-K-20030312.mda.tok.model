item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion should be read in connection with the information contained in the consolidated financial statements and notes to consolidated financial statements 
the following information contains forward looking statements within the meaning of the private securities litigation reform act of  and are subject to the safe harbor created by that act 
such forward looking statements may be identified by their use of words like expects  anticipates  intends  projects  or other words of similar meaning 
forward looking statements are based on expectations and assumptions regarding future events 
in addition to factors discussed throughout this report  the following factors and risks should also be considered  including  without limitation  statements regarding the future availability and prices of raw materials  competition in the titanium industry  demand for the company s products  the historic cyclicality of the titanium and aerospace industries  increased defense spending  the success of new market development  long term supply agreements  the ultimate determination of pending trade petitions  global economic conditions  the company s order backlog and the conversion of that backlog into revenue  labor relations  the long term impact of the events of september  and the continuing war on terrorism  and other statements contained herein that are not historical facts 
because such forward looking statements involve risks and uncertainties  there are important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied by such forward looking statements 
these and other risk factors are set forth below in the outlook section  as well as in the company s other filings with the securities and exchange commission sec over the last months  copies of which are available from the sec or may be obtained upon request from the company 
overview historically  a majority of the us titanium industry s output has been used in aerospace applications 
the cyclical nature of the aerospace industry has been the principal cause of the fluctuations in performance of companies engaged in the titanium industry 
over the past years  titanium mill product shipments registered a cyclical peak of million pounds in and a low of million pounds in in the period  most major commercial airlines reported stronger operating profits and  during this same period  aircraft manufacturers increased build rates 
from a peak in  demand was reduced in and again in primarily due to excess inventory within the supply network 
in  demand was modestly improved compared to and improved again in as supply and demand reached an equilibrium 
build rates were forecast to continue to improve throughout  however  because of the terrorist events of september   and airline financial difficulties leading up to the events  the outlook changed suddenly and dramatically 
as a result  demand and production changed downward for and  as highlighted in the outlook section 
the latest figures on the airline industry according to the airline monitor  at december   indicate that the leading manufacturers of commercial aircraft  the boeing company and airbus  reported an aggregate of  aircraft under firm order  which represents a decrease when compared to the backlog at december  of  aircraft 
while the total backlog has declined  it remains at a level in excess of  units which at today s production rate equates to over years of production for boeing and airbus 
there can be no assurance that it will remain at this level  but a significant production backlog is expected to be in place over the next few years 
the long term outlook for this segment over the next years is that approximately  large jets  and  regional jets for new and replacement aircraft will be required to support the demand of increased passenger travel  effectively doubling the current fleet of commercial aircraft 
demand from defense markets has been expanding in recent years 
defense budgets are increasing  particularly in the us  where acquisition includes numerous aircraft and ground support systems that utilize titanium and other specialty metals 
the major programs that require extensive use of titanium in the jet engine and airframe structure are fighter aircraft such as the f  f a  f  and jsf f  and in military transports like the c in europe  the eurofighter  a joint country and joint services aircraft  has also been launched 
military ground and naval equipment programs using titanium are also underway  with more being considered  in the us and europe 
military demand is expected to continue its growth in and beyond 
however  this growth is not expected to completely offset the drop in the commercial aerospace sector in the near term 
the company estimates that total us industry shipments of titanium mill products in decreased to approximately million pounds  from million pounds in in recent years  the company has devoted significant resources to developing new markets for titanium in the oil and gas and geothermal energy production industries 
in addition to designing and fabricating the world s first all titanium high pressure drilling riser in  the company has also produced significant quantities of seamless titanium pipe for use in geothermal energy applications 
the company also supplied titanium stress joints for use in production riser systems located in the gulf of mexico and in indonesia 
the company conducts its operations for oil and gas and geothermal energy from its houston  texas facility under the name rti energy systems  inc rti energy systems also engineers  designs and markets offshore riser systems  stress joints  drill pipe and components 
on december   the company purchased the remaining of the outstanding shares of reamet 
since  the company had owned of the outstanding shares of reamet 
reamet  located in villette  france  is a premier distributor of titanium products to the french market  serving aerospace  military and industrial customers 
reamet s largest customer is airbus with which it has a contract to supply titanium  principally in the form of cut plate 
reamet now operates as part of the fabrication and distribution group 
rti s strategy is to build on its leading position in the worldwide titanium industry while maintaining a strong financial condition and stringent quality  safety and environmental standards 
rti is emphasizing higher margin products in its traditional markets  while continuing to develop new markets and products that add value to traditional products by extruding  fabricating  and distributing them to end users 
results of operations year ended december  compared to year ended december  net sales net sales decreased to million for the year ended december  compared to net sales of million in sales for the company s titanium group amounted to million for the year ended december  compared to million in shipments of titanium mill products were million pounds in the year ended december   compared to million pounds in  a decrease 
mill product shipments in the year ended december  were lower than those in as commercial aerospace demand for forged mill products declined 
average realized prices on mill products for the year ended december  increased to per pound from per pound in the increase in average realized prices for mill products resulted primarily from a decreased mix of lower value added forged mill products when compared to sales for the company s fabrication and distribution group amounted to million in the year ended december   compared to million in  a decrease of million  or 
this decrease primarily reflects reduced demand in distribution sales in the united states and europe  partially offset by an increase in energy market sales 
in the case of the company s distribution businesses  sales decreased approximately million while the company s energy business reflected a million increase 
gross profit gross profit amounted to million  or of sales for the year ended december  compared to a gross profit of million or of sales in this increase in gross margin of  or  is primarily due to the titanium group cost reduction efforts  increased sales in energy markets  and the discontinuance of goodwill amortization in due to the adoption of statement of financial accounting standards no 
sfas no 
 goodwill and intangible assets  partially offset by reduced volume in domestic and european distribution sales 
selling  general and administrative expenses selling  general and administrative expenses amounted to million or of sales for the year ended december   compared to million or of sales in the increase in selling  general and administrative expenses was million  or 
research  technical and product development expenses research  technical and product development expenses amounted to million in compared to million in this decrease of million  or  primarily reflects a reduction in amounts spent on research and development for the energy market products 
operating income operating income for the year ended december  amounted to million  or of sales compared to million  or of sales  in this increase of million  or  consists of an increase in operating income from the titanium group of million primarily due to cost reduction efforts 
the fabrication and distribution group generated an increase in operating income of million due to energy market sales and the discontinuance of goodwill amortization in due to the adoption of sfas no 
 partially offset by a decrease in demand in domestic and european distribution sales 
other income other income for the year ended december  amounted to million  compared to million in the same period of the decrease reflects the fact that the company recognized a gain of million on the sale of shares in  that were received by the company in as a result of the demutualization of one of its insurance carriers in which it was a participant  compared to million on the initial receipt of those shares in this decrease was partially offset by an increase in the amount received from boeing of million in settlement of contractually specified damages for failing to meet minimum order volumes when compared to a similar payment received in refer to outlook commercial aerospace markets for more information on the boeing contractual settlement 
interest expense interest expense for the years ended december  and december   which primarily reflected the amortization of certain fees associated with the company s credit agreement and capitalized leases  amounted to million 
at december   the company had no debt 
income taxes in the year ended december   the company recorded an income tax expense of million compared to a million expense recorded in the effective tax rates for the year ended december  and were approximately and  respectively 
the effective tax rate of for the year ended december  was greater than the federal statutory rate of primarily due to state income taxes 
the effective tax rate of for the year ended december  was greater than the federal statutory rate of primarily due to state income taxes and non deductible goodwill amortization 
cumulative effect of change in accounting principle the cumulative loss effect of a change in accounting principle for the year ended december  of million  net of million in income taxes  results from the company s adoption of sfas no

the gross charge of million represents the recognition of the net liability for the fair value of a foreign currency forward purchase contract upon adoption 
net income net income for the year ended december  amounted to million or of sales  compared to million or of sales in the comparable period 
this change consists of an increase in operating income from the titanium group of million primarily due to continuing cost reduction efforts 
this increase was also due to an increase in operating income in the fabrication and distribution group of million due to an increase in energy market sales and the discontinuance of goodwill amortization in due to the adoption of sfas no 
 partially offset by a decrease in demand in domestic and european distribution sales 
this increase also reflects an increase in the amount received from boeing of million  net of tax  in settlement of contractually specified damages for failing to meet minimum order volumes when compared to similar amounts received in these increases are partially offset by a decrease in gains recognized of million  net of tax  on the sale of shares received by the company in as a result of the demutualization of one of its insurance carriers in which it was a participant  when compared to similar amounts in year ended december  compared to year ended december  net sales net sales increased to million for the year ended december  compared to net sales of million in sales for the company s titanium group amounted to million for the year ended december  compared to million in shipments of titanium mill products were million pounds in the year ended december   compared to million pounds in  a increase 
mill product shipments in the year ended december  were higher than those in as aerospace demand for forged mill products improved 
average realized prices on mill products for the year ended december  decreased to per pound from per pound in the decrease in average realized prices for mill products resulted primarily from an increased mix of lower value added forged mill products when compared to sales for the company s fabrication and distribution group amounted to million in the year ended december   compared to million in  an increase of million  or this increase reflects the acquisition of reamet  improvements in energy market sales  and continued improvements in distribution sales in the united states and europe 
partially offsetting was a reduction in sales of fabricated products due to the delayed startup of the new extrusion facility in houston 
gross profit gross profit amounted to million  or of sales for the year ended december  compared to a gross profit of million or of sales in this increase in gross margin of  or  is primarily due to the acquisition of reamet  increased sales in energy markets  and improvements in demand for distribution products  partially offset by the impact of a reduction in sales of fabricated products due to the delayed implementation of the new extrusion facility in houston 
selling  general and administrative expenses selling  general and administrative expenses amounted to million or of sales for the year ended december   compared to million or of sales in the increase in selling  general and administrative expenses of million  or  reflects the impact of the reamet acquisition  higher than anticipated startup and relocation costs associated with the installation of a new extrusion press in houston  as well as increased expenses in the distribution businesses as a result of increased sales volume 
research  technical and product development expenses research  technical and product development expenses amounted to million in compared to million in this increase of million  or  primarily reflects amounts spent on research and development on products for the energy market 
operating income operating income for the year ended december  amounted to million  or of sales compared to million  or of sales  in this increase of million  or  consists of a decrease in operating income from the titanium group of million primarily due to a decrease in realized prices as a result of an increased mix of lower value added forged mill products 
this decrease was more than offset by an increase in operating income in the fabrication and distribution group of million due to the acquisition of reamet and improved distribution and energy market sales  offset by higher than expected startup costs and a reduction in revenues due to the delayed implementation of the new extrusion facility in houston 
other income other income for the year ended december  amounted to million  compared to million in this increase primarily reflects a gain of million from a stock distribution to the company as a result of the demutualization of one of its insurance carriers in which it was a participant  partially offset by the absence of a gain on sale of a portion of the company s now closed ashtabula  ohio facilities which was recorded in interest expense interest expense for the year ended december  amounted to million compared to million in the decrease is primarily the result of reduced borrowing levels 
at december   the company had no debt 
interest expense in primarily reflected the amortization of certain fees associated with the company s credit agreement and capitalized leases 
income taxes in the year ended december   the company recorded an income tax expense of million compared to a million expense recorded in the effective tax rates for the year ended december of and were approximately and  respectively 
the effective tax rates of and were greater than the federal statutory rate of primarily due to state income taxes and non deductible goodwill amortization 
cumulative effect of change in accounting principle the cumulative loss effect of a change in accounting principle for the year ended december  of million  net of million in income taxes  results from the company s adoption of sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
the gross charge of million represents the recognition of the net liability for the fair value of a foreign currency forward purchase contract upon adoption 
net income net income for the year ended december  amounted to million or of sales  compared to million or of sales in the comparable period 
this increase reflects the acquisition of reamet  improved distribution and energy market sales  a reduction in interest expense  and the gain resulting from a distribution of stock to the company from one of its insurance carriers 
this was partially offset by higher than expected startup costs and a reduction in operating margin due to the delayed implementation of the new extrusion facility in houston 
outlook the terrorist attacks of september   and their effect on the general economy  will continue to have a significant influence on business conditions for several years 
commercial aerospace markets the largest impact has been on commercial aerospace markets  which provided approximately of rti s sales in airline operators experienced a dramatic drop in travel immediately following september  which has resulted in significant losses within their industry causing a reduced demand for new aircraft 
the primary builders of large commercial aircraft  boeing and airbus  adjusted their build rates beginning in downward to reflect the expected change in demand 
the exact magnitude of the downturn on commercial aerospace remains uncertain for  and it could be further exacerbated if a war in the middle east impacts commercial travel 
titanium mill products that are ordered by the prime aircraft producers and their subcontractors are generally ordered in advance of final aircraft production by to months 
this is due to the time it takes to produce a final assembly or part that is ready for installation in an airframe or jet engine 
discussions are currently being held with rti s customers concerning their requirements for the commercial aircraft business over the next twelve months 
it is expected that shipments from rti to this segment will be reduced somewhat in the effect of the reduction in commercial aircraft demand on rti will be mitigated somewhat by the long term agreement rmi entered into with boeing on january  under this agreement  rmi supplies boeing and its family of commercial suppliers with up to million pounds of titanium products annually 
the agreement  which began in  has an initial term of five years and  is subject to review by the parties prior to expiration in under the accord  boeing receives firm prices in exchange for rmi receiving a minimum volume commitment of million pounds per year 
if volumes fall short of the minimum commitment  the contract contains provisions for financial compensation 
in accordance with the agreement  and as a result of volume shortfalls in   and  boeing settled claims of approximately million in both and and million in the claim for will be settled during the st quarter  and is expected to be approximately million 
given the state of the commercial aircraft industry  it is not expected that boeing will meet the minimum in  the final year of the contract  and accordingly  a similar payment will be called for in early beginning in  business between the companies not covered by other contracts will be conducted on a non committed basis  that is  no volume commitment by boeing and no commitment of capacity or price by rmi 
rti  through its french subsidiary reamet  entered into an agreement with the european aeronautic defense and space company eads in april to supply value added titanium products and parts to the eads group of companies  including airbus 
the contract is in place through  subject to extension 
defense markets the importance of military markets to rti  approximately of revenues  is expected to rise in and beyond due to increased defense budgets  and increased hardware purchases by the us government  partially brought about by the events of september  it is estimated that overall titanium consumption will be increased within this segment in globally  but it is not expected to completely offset the decrease in the market caused by the drop in the commercial aerospace sector 
rti believes it is well positioned to provide mill products and fabrications to this segment if increased consumption is required to support defense needs 
rti supplies titanium and other materials to most military aerospace programs  including the f  c  f a  f  jsf f and in europe  the mirage  and eurofighter 
the company was chosen by bae systems ro defence uk to supply the titanium components for the new xm lightweight mm howitzer 
delivery is expected to begin in and continue through initial deliveries will be to the us marine corps  followed by deliveries to the us army and the italian and british armed forces 
it is anticipated that over guns may be produced 
sales under this contract could potentially exceed million 
lockheed martin  a major customer of the company  was awarded the largest military contract ever on october   for the military s billion joint strike fighter program 
the aircraft  which will be used by all branches of the military  is expected to consume  to  pounds of titanium per airplane 
timing and order patterns  which are likely to extend well into the future for this program  have not been quantified  but may be as many as  to  planes over the next to years 
the company has been notified that it has been selected as the supplier of titanium sheet and plate for the design and development phase over the next five years 
industrial and consumer markets the remaining of rti s sales are generated in various industrial and consumer markets  where business conditions are expected to be mixed over the next year or two 
revenues from oil and gas markets achieved new highs for rti in  and forecasts for indicate continued strong demand  due to the increase in deep water projects predicted over the next several years 
despite the weak economy  the company believes that oil and gas exploration will continue at an accelerated pace for the next several years 
in april  rti energy systems  inc was selected by unocal to provide production riser equipment in connection with their west seno project off the coast of indonesia 
rti is providing the high fatigue riser engineering design  in addition to the manufacture of components using a combination of titanium and steel 
this project continues into and is expected to lead to other opportunities in indonesia over the next several years 
the initial contract exceeds million 
on july   rti was selected to provide titanium alloy for a billion nickel cobalt mining facility being developed by inco  ltd 
at goro in the french overseas territory of new caledonia 
rti was selected for its expertise in the design and production of a highly corrosion resistant  ruthenium enhanced titanium alloy astm grade which it originally developed for the oil gas industry 
this contract was completed on schedule in if the general economy declines  demand from industrial market customers  such as chemical processing companies  may decrease 
backlog the company s order backlog for all market segments decreased to million as of december   from million at december   principally due to a drop off in titanium mill products 
liquidity and capital resources net cash flows from operating activities totaled million in compared to million in the change in net cash flows from operating activities for the year ended december   compared to  primarily reflects an increase in net income and a decrease in accounts receivable  offset by a decrease in other current liabilities 
in and  million and million  respectively  was generated through a reduction in working capital and other balance sheet line items 
the company s working capital ratio was to at december  during and  the company s cash flow requirements for capital expenditures were funded with cash provided by operations 
the company anticipates that it will be able to fund its capital expenditure requirements for with funds generated by operations 
at december   the company had a borrowing capacity equal to million  the amount of the facility  or a borrowing base equal to the sum of of qualifying accounts receivable and of qualifying inventory whichever is less 
on september   rti filed a universal shelf registration with the securities and exchange commission 
this registration permits rti to issue up to million of debt and or equity securities at an unspecified future date 
the proceeds of any such issuance could be utilized to finance acquisitions  capital investments or other general purposes  however  rti has not issued any securities to date and has no immediate plans to do so 
while there is no guarantee that the company will be able to generate sufficient cash flow from operations to fund its operations and capital expenditures in  the company believes it can maintain adequate liquidity through a combination of cash reserves and available borrowing capacity 
also  as rti currently has no debt  and based on the expected strength of cash flows  the company does not believe there is any material near term risks relating to fluctuations in interest rates 
contractual obligations and commitments following is a summary of the company s contractual obligations and other commercial commitments as of december  contractual obligations thereafter total operating leases        capital leases total contractual obligations        other commercial commitments thereafter total standby letters of credit   total other commercial commitments   the company s other commercial commitments at december  represent standby letters of credit primarily related to commercial performance guarantees 
capital expenditures gross capital expenditures for the year ended december  amounted to million including million for completion of the company s new  ton extrusion press in houston 
capital spending in totaled million  including million for the houston extrusion press 
capital spending for is budgeted at approximately million 
credit agreement at december   the company maintained a credit agreement entered into on april   which provides a million three year unsecured revolving credit facility 
this agreement replaced the previously existing million five year unsecured revolving credit facility entered into september  the company can borrow up to the lesser of million or a borrowing base equal to the sum of of qualifying accounts receivable and of qualifying inventory 
under the terms of the facility  the company  at its option  will be able to borrow at a a base rate which is the higher of pnc bank s prime rate or the federal funds effective rate plus per annum  or b libor plus a spread ranging from to determined by the ratio of the company s consolidated total indebtedness to consolidated earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization 
the credit agreement contains restrictions  among others  on the minimum shareholders equity required  the minimum cash flow required  and the maximum leverage ratio permitted 
at december   there was million of standby letters of credit outstanding under the facility  the company was in compliance with all covenants  and had a borrowing capacity equal to million 
environmental matters the company is subject to environmental laws and regulations as well as various health and safety laws and regulations that are subject to frequent modifications and revisions 
while the costs of compliance for these matters have not had a material adverse impact on the company in the past  it is impossible to predict accurately the ultimate effect these changing laws and regulations may have on the company in the future 
at december  and  the amount accrued for future environmental related costs was million 
of the total amount accrued at december   million is expected to be paid out during and is included in the other accrued liabilities line of the balance sheet 
the remaining million is recorded in other non current liabilities 
based on available information  rmi believes its share of potential environmental related costs  before expected contributions from third parties  is in a range from million to million  in the aggregate 
the amount accrued is net of expected contributions from third parties other than insurers of approximately to million  which the company believes are probable 
the company has been receiving contributions from such third parties for a number of years as partial reimbursement for costs incurred by the company 
as these proceedings continue toward final resolution  amounts in excess of those already provided may be necessary to discharge the company from its obligations for these projects 
the ultimate resolution of these environmental matters could  individually or in the aggregate  be material to the consolidated financial statements 
however  management believes that the company will remain a viable and competitive enterprise even though it is possible that these matters could be resolved unfavorably

acquisitions on october   rti acquired all of the capital stock of ncm for million and the payment by rti of certain bank debt amounting to million 
the million purchase price consisted of million in cash  a million note  payable january   bearing interest at per annum  and million of the company s common stock valued at per share 
ncm is a manufacturer and distributor of high temperature and corrosion resistant alloys such as titanium  stainless steel and nickel  in long bar form  to the aerospace  chemical processing  oil and gas exploration and production  and power generation industries 
in addition to the manufacturing facilities  ncm operated four distribution centers in the united states and one in england 
also on october   rti acquired all of the assets of weld tech  for million in cash and the payment of a million note owed by weld tech to a corporation  the shareholders of which were also partners of weld tech 
weld tech  based in houston  texas  now operates under the name rti energy systems 
weld tech provides engineering and fabrication services for the oil and gas industry  including weld design  fabrication and repair  as well as materials engineering and testing services 
on december   rti acquired the remaining outstanding shares of reamet of villette  france for million 
net of cash acquired  the company s additional investment equaled million 
reamet is a premier distributor of titanium products to the french market  serving aerospace  military and industrial customers 
reamet s largest customer is airbus  with which it has a contract to supply titanium  principally in the form of cut plate 
rti is in the process of evaluating other potential acquisition candidates to determine if they are likely to increase the company s earnings and value 
rti evaluates such potential acquisitions on the basis of their ability to enhance or improve the company s existing operations or capabilities  as well as the ability to provide access to new markets and or customers for its products 
rti may make acquisitions using its available cash resources  borrowings under its existing credit facility  new debt financing  the company s common stock  joint venture partnership arrangements or any combination of the above 
critical accounting policies rti s financial statements are prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles accepted in the united states of america 
these principles require management to make estimates and assumptions that have a material impact on the amounts recorded for assets and liabilities and resultant revenue and expenses 
management estimates are based on historical evidence and other available information  which in management s opinion provide the most reasonable and likely result under the current facts and circumstances 
under different facts and circumstances expected results may differ materially from the facts and circumstances applied by management 
of the accounting policies described in note and others not expressly stated but adopted by management as the most appropriate and accurate under the current facts and circumstances  the effect upon the company of the policy of goodwill and asset valuation  deferred taxes  pensions  other postretirement benefits and environmental liabilities would be most critical if management estimates were incorrect 
in the case of goodwill and property plant and equipment  if future product demand or market conditions reduce management s expectation of future cash flows from these assets  a write down of the carrying value of goodwill or property plant and equipment may be required 
in the case of deferred tax assets  management has provided under current facts and circumstances what it believes to be adequate allowances for reduced value 
similarly to goodwill and property plant and equipment  should the future benefit of deferred tax assets become impaired because of the possibility of reduced utilization  an increase to the valuation allowance and corresponding charge to expense may be required 
included in the company s accounting for its defined benefit pension plans are assumptions on future discount rates  expected return on assets and rate of future compensation changes 
the company considers current market conditions  including changes in interest rates and plan asset investment returns  as well as longer term assumptions in determining these assumptions 
actuarial assumptions may differ materially from actual results due to changing market and economic conditions  higher or lower withdrawal rates or longer or shorter life spans of participants 
these differences may result in a significant impact to the amount of net pension expense or income recorded in the future 
the discount rate is used to determine the present value of future payments 
in general  the company s liability increases as the discount rate decreases and vice versa 
the company reduced its discount rate in to from in to incorporate recent lower interest rates 
decreases in the level of plan assets have a direct impact on the amount of periodic pension expense the company records 
during  the value of the company s plan assets declined due to a general decline in interest rates and equity values 
incorporating recent market and economic conditions  we decreased the company s expected long term rate of return on plan assets to in from in the rate of return for is a key assumption in estimating the company s pension expense for at december   the estimated accumulated benefit obligation related to plan assets exceeded the value of those plan assets 
this was primarily due to the previously mentioned discount rate change and decrease in the level of plan assets 
as a result the company increased its minimum pension liability and recorded a charge to equity of million net of deferred taxes 
we also expect that pension expense in will increase by approximately million 
the company currently does not have any minimum funding obligations under erisa but continually evaluates whether the best use of its cash may include a contribution to the pension plans 
if the company chooses to make a contribution prior to the funding deadline  the increase in pension expense will likely decrease 
the company provides for environmental liabilities when these liabilities become probable and can be reasonably determined 
the company regularly evaluates and assesses its environmental responsibilities 
should facts and circumstances indicate that a liability exists or that previously evaluated and assessed liabilities have changed  the company will record the liability or adjust the amount of an existing liability 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk in the normal course of business  the company is exposed to market risk and price fluctuations related to the purchases of certain materials and supplies used in its manufacturing operations 
the company obtains competitive prices for materials and supplies when available 
the majority of the company s raw material purchases for titanium sponge are made under long term contracts with negotiated prices 
the company s long term credit arrangement is based on rates that float with libor based rates or bank prime rates and the carrying value approximates fair value 
at december   the company had no outstanding obligations under this credit arrangement 
the company is subject to foreign currency exchange exposure for purchases of materials  equipment and services  including wages  which are denominated in currencies other than the us dollar  as well as non dollar denominated sales 
from time to time the company may use forward exchange contracts to manage these risks  although they are generally considered to be minimal 
the majority of the company s sales are made in us dollars  which minimizes exposure to foreign currency fluctuation
