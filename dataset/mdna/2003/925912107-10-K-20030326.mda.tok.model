overview via net 
works is a single source provider of managed internet services to small and medium sized businesses 
via is headquartered in europe and has operations in france  germany  italy  the netherlands  portugal  spain  switzerland  the united kingdom and the united states 
we are currently implementing a strategic plan that aims to take via to a position of profitability and to further be recognized by our customers and the market as an expert provider of business communications solutions 
from through our initial public offering in february  we focused on raising capital to fund our acquisition strategy 
we raised approximately million in equity capital  in the aggregate  which enabled us to acquire separate internet service providers in countries by the end of following our initial public offering  while we continued to build out our targeted geographic footprint through acquisitions  we also sought to establish a strong regional management structure and sophisticated back office systems 
from to the end of our financial results and operating performance were severely impacted by the economic downturn in the global economy as well as a number of internal challenges  including poor execution of the in country integration of our acquired operations  several restatements of our financial results and an unacceptable level of negative cash flow caused by continuing operating losses and capital expenditures for systems build out projects 
all of these factors led to the resignation of several of our senior executives in early in january  our board of directors appointed an experienced turnaround executive to drive a reduction in cash used  improve internal controls and return the company to a path towards profitability 
the turnaround plan that was adopted by via led to the sale of our operations in argentina  austria  brazil  ireland and mexico  the closure of our office in belgium  the suspension of our multi vendor integrated provisioning  billing and customer care platform  tightened controls on expenditures and an overall reduction of headcount from at december  to by the end of these and other actions led to improvements in our cash flow and our adjusted ebitda loss 
by the fourth quarter of  we had reduced our quarterly cash flow used in operating and investing activities to million from fourth quarter of million 
from to our aggregate net cash flow used in operating activities and net cash used in investing activities was reduced from million to million 
our adjusted ebitda loss from continuing operations improved to million for the year as compared to million for the year in november  we appointed a new chief executive officer  rhett williams  who together with a newly constituted executive team has developed a strategic plan to lead the next phase of via s turnaround and intensify the focus on improving our operational performance and achieving profitable revenue growth 
under this plan  via is seeking to transform its operations from nine largely independent local organizations to a single internationally oriented  sales focused and functional based organization 
our plan also calls for the outsourcing of systems and processes associated with certain network management  it  finance and administrative functions 
as a further component of the plan  via will take measures to improve the quality of its sales force by recruiting new sales professionals  establishing robust sales management processes and introducing highly leveraged compensation plans 
we are also seeking to improve sales productivity by managing low value customers through telesales or indirect channels 
we have also begun a comprehensive rationalization of our product portfolio and plan on introducing new products designed specifically for larger smes in clearly identified vertical industry segments 
for more information on our strategic plan see part i  business  of this form k 
there are significant risks and dependencies inherent in our ability to execute on our plan 
these risks and dependencies  as well as other risks that pertain generally to our business are described above under risk factors in item adjusted ebitda  as used in overview above  in the table under reportable segment financial information and in the table under quarterly results of operations in this section  represents operating loss from continuing operations before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization  impairment and restructuring charges and non cash stock compensation charges 
adjusted ebitda should not be considered an alternative to net income loss  when determined in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states  or gaap 
in addition  the measure of adjusted ebitda we use may not compare to other  similarly titled measures used by other companies 
below is a reconciliation of total adjusted ebitda from continuing operations to loss from continuing operations before income taxes and minority interest and to net cash used in operating activities for the year ended december  for the year ended december  for the year ended december  adjusted ebitda from continuing operations   non cash compensation   impairment and restructure charges   depreciation and amortization    operating loss from continuing operations interest income  net    other expense and foreign currency gains losses  net   loss from continuing operations before income taxes and minority interest adjusted ebitda from continuing operations add back for net loss restructuring charges  interest income  net    other expense and foreign currency gains losses  net  income taxes  minority interest  adjustments to reconcile net loss from continuing operations to net cash used in operating activities provision benefit for doubtful accounts receivable   loss on investment  unrealized foreign currency transaction gains losses  minority interest in loss of consolidated subsidiaries  non cash other expense  write off of note receivable from related party changes in asset and liabilities  net of acquisitions   net cash used in operating activities    management uses adjusted ebitda to compare performance over periods without non cash and non recurring items factored in 
those are analyzed separately as they are specific to the period 
as this document will be elaborating further on the specific charges eliminated from the loss from continuing operations before income taxes and minority interest  we feel that when discussing operation and strategic changes in our results over the years  adjusted ebitda is a more appropriate measure 
discontinued operations as part of our turnaround plan and our focus on substantially reducing our negative cash flow  we determined to cease funding certain country operations deemed to not materially contribute to our financial strength in the long term 
consistent with this conclusion  we completed the sale of our operations in argentina  austria and ireland during the operation in argentina  which had been included in the americas region for segment reporting  was sold on june  to an unrelated third party purchaser 
the austrian operation  which had been included in the european region for segment reporting  was sold to the then current management team on may  the irish operation  which had been included in the european region for segment reporting  was sold on august  to a former shareholder and managing director of the irish operation 
these operations were sold for nominal consideration and we recognized a gain on the disposal of the three operations in the aggregate amount of million  which was entirely due to the reclassification of the accumulated foreign currency translation adjustment to the statement of operations 
effective january   via adopted statement of financial accounting standard sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
as each of the argentine  austrian and irish operations disposed of during represent a component of an entity as defined by sfas  we have classified each operation as a discontinued operation for all periods presented 
revenues related to the discontinued operations through the date of sale were approximately million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the pre tax loss  excluding accounting for the sale transaction  related to discontinued operations was approximately million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
businesses transferred under contractual arrangement in may and september of also as a part of our turnaround plan  we closed transactions for the sale of our brazilian and mexican operations  respectively  to the then current management teams 
under these transactions  we sold of the outstanding capital stock of entities for nominal consideration  which included a promissory note payable and a loan payable 
consistent with the accounting treatment prescribed under staff accounting bulletin sab topic e  we will neither treat these operations as discontinued operations nor consolidate any future results of these operations 
the total assets and liabilities related to the brazilian and mexican operations are shown on the consolidated balance sheet under the captions assets and liabilities of businesses transferred under contractual arrangement 
the results of our brazilian operation through the date of sale are included within the results from continuing operations for and therefore our results contain only five months of results versus the twelve months included in the results 
likewise  the results of our mexican operation through the date of sale are included within the results from continuing operations for and therefore our results contain only nine months of results versus the twelve months included in the results 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for a detailed discussion of terms 
as the operations in brazil and mexico will not have a continuing contribution to the company s operations  management believes it is more meaningful to analyze trends on the results after excluding the results of brazil and mexico as detailed in the table below

in  we managed our business by geographic regions  namely the americas and europe  and we evaluated performance based on revenues and adjusted ebitda 
see discussion on usefulness of the measure and reconciliation of adjusted ebitda under overview in this section 
certain prior year data has been reclassified to conform to the current regional groupings 
the following table presents information about our two market segments and our corporate activities  individually and on a consolidated basis 
year ended december  dollars in thousands total europe assets    total americas assets    total corporate assets    total consolidated assets    europe total revenue    adjusted ebitda    impairment and restructuring charges   americas total revenue    adjusted ebitda    impairment and restructuring charges  corporate total revenue adjusted ebitda    impairment and restructuring charges   consolidated total revenue    adjusted ebitda    impairment and restructuring charges   critical accounting policies our critical accounting policies are as follows recognition of revenue  estimation of valuation allowances and accrued liabilities and valuation of long lived assets 
recognition of revenue we derive our revenue from the sale of internet goods and services  specifically internet connectivity services and other internet value added services  such as networking  hosting  security and professional services 
as described below  management judgments and estimates must be made in connection with the revenue recognized in any accounting period 
material differences might result in the amount and timing of our revenue for any period if our management made different judgments or utilized different estimates  primarily with respect to our collectibility assessment 
for revenue transactions we apply the provisions of staff accounting bulletin no 
revenue recognition 
we recognize revenue from the sale of internet goods and services when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred or services have been rendered  the fee is fixed or determinable and collection of the resulting receivable is reasonably assured 
at the time of the transaction  we assess collectibility based on a number of factors  including past transaction history with the customer and the credit worthiness of the customer 
if we determine that collection of a fee is not reasonably assured  the revenue is generally recognized upon the receipt of cash  provided other revenue recognition criteria have been satisfied 
our practices regarding the evidence of an arrangement vary from country to country 
generally  for sales  other than those completed over the internet  we use either a purchase order or a customer agreement as evidence of an arrangement 
for sales over the internet  we generally use a credit card authorization as evidence of an arrangement 
all of our connectivity services revenue is recognized as it is earned over the period the services are provided 
revenues from the sale of value added internet services  including web hosting  are also recognized over the period in which the services are provided 
revenue from installation  training and consulting is recognized as the related services are rendered  although such amounts have not been material 
revenue from hardware and third party software sales and configuration is recognized upon delivery or installation of the products  depending on the terms of the arrangement  provided other revenue recognition criteria have been satisfied 
estimation of valuation allowances and accrued liabilities the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires our management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amount of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reported period 
specifically  our management must make estimates of the collectibility of our accounts receivables and the amount of our accrued telecommunications cost 
management considers current economic trends  historical bad debts  accuracy of billing data  customer credit worthiness and changes in customer payment patterns when analyzing specific accounts receivable balances to determine the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts 
at least quarterly  our management performs a detailed review of the accounts receivable balance to ensure that our consolidated allowance for doubtful accounts is sufficient to cover uncollectible amounts 
this assessment has a material effect on the financial statements of the company 
at december   accounts receivables of million are stated net of allowances of million december  million and million respectively 
amounts charged to the statement of operations for continuing operations totaled million for the year ended december   compared to a net release of million for the year ended december  as stated above  management makes estimates of the amount of telecommunications expense to accrue in each reporting period 
we pay other network providers for transit  which allows us to transmit our customers information to or from the internet over their networks 
we also pay other recurring telecommunications costs  including the cost of the local telephone lines our leased line customers use to reach our pops and access our services 
as network providers often bill on a semi annual or longer basis and such invoices have historically been subject to dispute when received  management must make estimates of the total amount due to each provider at the end of each reporting period based on internal documentation and historical trends 
to date our estimates have not materially differed from amounts ultimately due 
valuation of long lived assets and goodwill on a periodic basis  management reviews the carrying value of the investment in our operations to determine if an event has occurred  with respect to any operation  which could result in an impairment of long lived assets 
in its review  management considers the following market and competitive factors  including trends within the telecommunications industry broadly and the market for internet access specifically  as well as general economic trends operating and financial trends  including significant underperformance relative to expected historical or projected operating results and business outlook for each operation  including changes in the expected revenues and cash flows for each of our operations  changes in our customers and the services that they require and our strategic plans for each business 
the carrying amounts of acquired intangible assets and other tangible long lived assets are reviewed if facts or changes in circumstances suggest that they may be impaired 
if this review indicates the carrying amounts of long live assets will not be recoverable  as determined based on estimated undiscounted future cash flows of the acquired assets  the carrying amounts of the long lived assets are reduced to their estimated fair value under statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
accounting for impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
in the second quarter of  we recorded impairment charges of  see note to the consolidated financial statements for further information 
in  in accordance with the provisions of sfas no 
 accounting for goodwill and other intangible assets  we have ceased amortization of goodwill 
under sfas  we performed an impairment analysis of our goodwill as of january  upon adoption 
there was no impairment of goodwill as a result of our transitional analysis as of that date 
we have elected december as our annual impairment review date for all reporting units 
upon completion of our annual review during the fourth quarter of  we impaired million of the goodwill related to our united kingdom operation 
the triggering event for the impairment was future revenue and cost estimates based on our strategic plan as discussed in part i of this form k 
the fair value calculated as of december  was based on a discounted cash flow model with appropriate market and business risk factored in 
the discounted cash flow model for each reporting unit was based on the financial forecasts relating to the strategic plan for three years to december  and constant annual growth rates thereafter 
the process of generating our strategic plan required management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts of future revenues  costs and cash flows 
in addition  the use of a discounted cash flow model requires management to make estimates and assumptions about the discount factor  timing of cash flows  terminal values and future growth rates 
no adjustments have been made to the fair value of net assets or the recognition of previously unrecognized intangible assets in calculating the implied fair value of goodwill 
changes to these assumptions can have a material impact on the discounted cash flows and the outcome of the impairment review 
sfas also requires that goodwill be tested for impairment in interim periods if certain events occur indicating that the carrying value of goodwill may be impaired 
if  for example  the company fails to achieve the benefits assumed from its strategic plan  as reflected in the discounted cash flow model  further impairment may arise 
during the second quarter of  the total remaining goodwill balance for our italian operation of  was written off in its entirety in light of the significant underperformance of that operation during the first half of the year 
the total goodwill balance remaining at december  is million

results of operations year ended december  compared with the year ended december  revenue twelve months ended december  december  increase decrease in thousands of dollars revenue   revenue for the year ended december  decreased to million as compared to million for the year ended december  the decrease in revenue is primarily a result of the sale of our operations in brazil and mexico during the second and third quarters of  respectively 
as previously discussed in this section  because of the way these two sales were structured they were not accounted for as discontinued operations and therefore their partial year results continue to be reported in our consolidated results of operations 
see table under businesses transferred under contractual obligation in this section for further information 
we experienced an increase in revenues at our switzerland operation as a result of a customer list purchased during the second quarter of our revenue at all other operations was consistent with or lower than levels due to the continued slowdown in corporate technology spending  continued internal disruptions and distractions caused by turnover of staff and management and by on going system and process remediation efforts as well as a reduction of our sales and marketing efforts 
in prior reporting periods  we have provided information on categories of revenues that we generate 
because of the limitations we have experienced in and with our legacy billing platforms and our ongoing projects to address these limitations  we are not currently able to provide an accurate breakdown of our revenues 
we anticipate that when we have completed our various systems and process remediation efforts  we will begin again to report revenue categories 
operating costs and expenses internet services twelve months ended december  december  increase decrease in thousands of us dollars internet services   of total revenue our internet services operating costs are the costs we incur to carry customer traffic to and over the internet 
we lease lines that connect our points of presence  or pops  either to our own network or to other network providers 
we pay other network providers for transit  which allows us to transmit our customers information to or from the internet over their networks 
we also pay other recurring telecommunications costs and personnel costs  including the cost of the local telephone lines our customers use to reach our pops and access our services  and costs related to customer support and care 
internet services operating costs were million for the year ended december   compared with million for the year ended december  the decrease in internet services costs is primarily due to the decrease in costs at our brazilian and mexican operations  which were sold during the second and third quarters of as previously discussed in this section  because of the way these two sales were structured they were not accounted for as discontinued operations 
see table under businesses transferred under contractual obligation in this section for further information 
additionally  during  we incurred approximately  of settlement costs associated with the cancellation of network contracts associated with our us based network  which was cancelled due to the sale of our latin american operations 
we will continue to actively review our cost structure to reduce or redirect costs that are not warranted 
selling  general and administrative twelve months ended december  december  increase decrease in thousands of us dollars selling  general administrative costs   of total revenue our largest selling  general and administrative s  g a expenses are compensation costs  the costs associated with marketing our products and services  and professional fees paid to outside consultants 
compensation costs include salaries and related benefits  commissions  bonuses and costs associated with staff reductions 
in many of our markets  we are required to make significant mandatory payments for government sponsored social welfare programs  and we have little control over these costs 
our marketing expenses include the costs of direct mail and other mass marketing programs  advertising  customer communications  trade show participation  web site management and other promotional costs 
other s  g a expenses include the costs of travel  rent  utilities  insurance and bad debt expense 
in and  our professional fees included the cost of using outside consultants to assist with the implementation of our financial and back office systems at our operating companies  the data validation projects in germany and the uk  as well as the cost of using outside consultants for financial review and attestation engagements 
we incurred s  g a expenses of million for the year ended december   a decrease from the million we incurred for the year ended december  these decreases are tied directly to our cost cutting measures  which have included meaningful headcount reductions  substantial marketing and advertising budget reductions and tighter controls on costs across the company 
compensation expense decreased from million in to million in  a decrease of million 
the decrease corresponds to our reduction in headcount from to  offset by severance and other termination benefits and costs related to our cost cutting efforts and selling of operations 
we anticipate that compensation costs will continue to decrease in based on the headcount reductions during in conjunction with our cost cutting measures  marketing and sales expenses decreased from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  included in this total of million was approximately  related to a customer list purchased at our switzerland operation 
as there was a high degree of uncertainty regarding the future recoverability of the asset  the entire purchase price was expensed in the period incurred 
professional fees decreased from million in to million in the costs in were primarily due to the implementation of our financial systems and our suspended integrated billing  provisioning and back office system  the integrated platform 
as part of our ongoing cost cutting measures  we suspended the development and deployment of the integrated platform during the first quarter of the costs in were primarily due to accounting fees and fees charged by outside vendors in connection with data validation projects 
as a result of the issues arising from the legacy billing systems and business processes substantial reserves were previously recorded against the carrying value of receivables 
in  bad debt expense was million 
the billing system and process improvements made during  combined with our intensified focus on cash collection  have resulted in the collection of accounts receivable previously provided against 
therefore  the bad debt expense in  was a benefit of million 
we anticipate that these billing system and process improvements will continue through  but do not expect further material collections against amounts previously reserved 
our s  g a expenses include the amortization of deferred compensation 
in march  we recorded forfeitures of unvested stock options in the amount of million  which reduced the deferred compensation balance to zero with a corresponding adjustment to additional paid in capital 
as a result  we did not record any deferred compensation expense for the second  third and fourth quarters of the deferred compensation amortization for the twelve months ended december  was  the deferred compensation expense recorded in was million 
depreciation and amortization twelve months ended december  december  increase decrease in thousands of us dollars depreciation and amortization   of total revenue the largest component of our depreciation and amortization expense in prior periods was the amortization of the goodwill and other acquired intangible assets arising from our acquisitions 
goodwill  which has been amortized over five years  is created when the price at which we acquire a company exceeds the fair value of its net tangible and intangible assets 
as a result of our acquisitions  we amortized substantial amounts of goodwill and other intangible assets in prior years 
in january  upon adoption of sfas  the company reclassified acquired workforce of  as goodwill and ceased amortizing the remaining goodwill balance 
other intangible assets  consisting of customer lists  continue to be amortized over their estimated useful lives 
we also recognize depreciation expense primarily related to telecommunications equipment  computers and network infrastructure 
we depreciate telecommunications equipment and computers over their useful lives  generally ranging from three to five years 
the cost of network infrastructure  net of impairment charges  purchased under indefeasible right of use agreements  or iru  is being amortized over the lesser of the estimated useful life or term of the agreement  generally to years 
our depreciation and amortization expense was million for the year ended december   down from million for the year ended december  for the period   or  of our depreciation and amortization expense was related to the amortization of intangible assets and million  or was related to the depreciation of fixed assets 
for the period  million  or  of our depreciation and amortization expense was related to the amortization of acquisition goodwill and other intangible assets and million  or was related to the depreciation of fixed assets 
the decrease in depreciation of fixed assets is related to the asset impairment  which was recorded in the fourth quarter of these impairment charges reduced the balance of fixed assets by million 
impairment and restructuring charges twelve months ended december  december  increase decrease in thousands of us dollars impairment and restructuring charges   of total revenue during  management concluded that an impairment of our long lived assets and goodwill had occurred 
as a result  we recorded an impairment charge of million 
this impairment charge is comprised of million related to goodwill and other acquired intangible assets at our united kingdom and italian operations and  related to fixed assets at our italian operation 
during the second quarter of  management concluded that an impairment of goodwill had occurred 
as a result  we recorded goodwill impairment charges of million related to operations in our americas and european regions 
the goodwill impairment charges for these regions were million and  respectively 
additionally  during the fourth quarter of  management concluded that an impairment of our long lived assets had occurred 
as a result  million of goodwill and other acquired intangible assets and million of fixed assets were recorded as impairment charges as of december  the goodwill and other acquired intangible assets impairment charges for europe and the americas was million and million  respectively 
the fixed asset impairment for the corporate and regional iru companies  europe and the americas was million  million and million  respectively 
as a result of our ongoing strategic and operational review  we suspended the development and deployment of our integrated platform 
during the year ended december   we recorded an impairment charge of million to write off costs capitalized during the development of the integrated platform 
as a part of our focus on europe as our core operating region  we are in the process of moving our principal headquarter functions from reston  virginia to europe 
in conjunction with this relocation  we recorded a restructuring charge of million during the third quarter of additionally  during the fourth quarter of we recorded a restructuring charge of  related to severance and other payments made at our spanish and italian operations 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for further information 
there were no similar charges recorded in interest income  net twelve months ended december  december  increase decrease in thousands of us dollars interest income  net   of total revenue we earn interest income primarily by investing our available cash in short term treasury securities funds 
to date  this interest income has been partially offset by interest expense  largely arising from purchase and lease financing of equipment 
for the year ended december   we earned million in interest income  a decrease over the million we earned for the year ended december  interest income in and was generated from investing funds received from our initial public offering in february  until those funds were used for acquisitions  operating expenses or capital expenditures 
net proceeds from the public offering were million 
the decrease in the interest income is the combined result of the decrease in the available cash for investing and the decrease in the interest rates 
we also incurred  of interest expense for the year  as compared to  of interest expense incurred in interest expense relates to the debt arising from the notes payable to the former owners of businesses acquired and vendor financing at both the subsidiary and corporate levels 
other expense  net twelve months ended december  december  increase decrease in thousands of us dollars other expense  net  of total revenue for the year ended december   we incurred other expense  net in the amount of million 
other expense  net includes a  loss resulting from a loan made to a related party in the first quarter additionally  in the third quarter of as a part of our transaction to sell via net 
works mexico  we entered into a convertible credit agreement with the then current management of via net 
works mexico in the amount of million 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for further information 
for the year ended december   we incurred other expense  net of  these costs primarily relate to the impairment of a residual investment security at our mexican operation in the third quarter of foreign currency gains losses  net twelve months ended december  december  increase decrease in thousands of us dollars foreign currency gains losses  net   of total revenue we recognized a million foreign currency gain for the year ended december   as compared to a million foreign currency loss for the year ended december  the gains and losses in both years were primarily due to the change in the euro and its impact on our euro denominated cash accounts as well as the revaluation of intercompany balances 
we established the euro denominated cash accounts in connection with our initial public offering in february  in which we sold shares of our common stock for both us dollars and euros 
at december   via maintained a cash reserve of million euros 
income tax benefit expense twelve months ended december  december  increase decrease in thousands of us dollars income tax benefit expense of total revenue while we have incurred consolidated operating losses from inception through december   we have recorded a benefit for income taxes of approximately  largely as a result of income tax refunds received in based on net operating loss carrybacks related to our wholly owned subsidiary  via net 
works usa  inc fka interactive multimedia corporation for the year ended december  prior to its acquisition by via net 
works inc in august  via net 
works usa inc 
generated taxable income  which was offset by losses carried back from the tax year 
at the end of  we anticipated a federal refund of approximately  in addition to the federal refund  we were also able to offset losses with a state carryback loss claim that resulted in  of state refunds in the current year 
additionally  there is a small amount of foreign income tax benefit  as well as a deferred tax benefit related to the change from a net deferred tax liability to zero 
we have provided a valuation allowance for our net deferred tax assets of  million reducing our net deferred tax assets to zero 
valuation allowances are used to reduce the net deferred tax assets to the amounts considered more likely than not to be realized 
changes in estimates of future taxable income can materially change the amount of such valuation allowances 
at december  and  via had us net operating loss carryforwards of approximately million and million  respectively  which may be used to reduce future taxable income 
these us net operating losses begin to expire in at december  and  via had net operating loss carryforwards generated from its foreign subsidiaries of approximately million and million  respectively  of which million expires between and and million has an indefinite carryforward period 
year ended december  compared with the year ended december  revenue twelve months ended december  december  increase decrease in thousands of dollars revenue   revenue for the year ended december  decreased to million as compared to million for the year ended december  revenue was severely impacted by a combination of market conditions and internal disruptions 
tightened capital markets and a slowdown in corporate technology spending led to a lengthening of sales cycles and lower revenues 
our revenues also suffered from a combination of integration and management issues 
during we completed the consolidation of multiple acquired operations into single country operations in four of our largest markets germany  uk  france and the netherlands 
in retrospect  these integration efforts proved to be more distracting to local management than anticipated 
in certain of the countries  poor execution of integration processes affected sales  billing and customer care functions of the operations  which in turn negatively impacted revenues 
during we replaced the country manager in nine of our country operations  including in three of our top four markets 
a number of these operations also replaced management at other critical functions 
via s revenues were further impacted by a slower then anticipated transition of our sales force from order processors to direct sales as the hiring and training of a technically proficient direct sales force proved more difficult than originally planned 
the turnover of top management at these operations  the distraction of ongoing integration activities and the process of developing a direct sales force  together  had a significant negative impact on via s ability to respond quickly to the rapidly changing economic climate 
we continued to address issues that arose in related to our integrations and we continued to expend significant management time and incur significant expenses related to these ongoing efforts in certain of our markets 
we anticipated that in such markets  which include our german and uk operations  these ongoing efforts would continue to distract management and staff from revenue generating activities in in prior reporting periods  we had provided information on categories of revenues that we generate 
because of the systemic errors and limitations we experienced in and with our legacy billing platforms and our ongoing projects to address these and process issues  we were not able to provide an accurate breakdown of our revenues 
we anticipated that when we had completed our various systems and process remediation efforts  we would again begin to report revenue categories 
operating costs and expenses internet services twelve months ended december  december  increase decrease in thousands of us dollars internet services   of total revenue our internet services operating costs were the costs we incurred to carry customer traffic to and over the internet 
we leased lines that connected our points of presence  or pops  either to our own network or to other network providers 
we paid other network providers for transit  which allowed us to transmit our customers information to or from the internet over their networks 
we also paid other recurring telecommunications costs and personnel costs  including the cost of the local telephone lines our customers used to reach our pops and accessed our services  and costs related to customer support and care 
internet services operating costs were million for the year ended december   compared with million for the year ended december  the decrease in actual expenses was a result primarily of a decrease in revenues to which these costs related 
we incurred these costs primarily to lease lines  purchase transit for the local networks and to compensate customer care personnel 
additionally  we incurred operating costs associated with our international network 
selling  general and administrative twelve months ended december  december  increase decrease in thousands of us dollars selling  general administrative costs   of total revenue our largest selling  general and administrative expenses s  g a were compensation costs  the costs associated with marketing our products and services  and professional fees paid to outside consultants 
compensation costs included salaries and related benefits  commissions and bonuses and costs associated with staff reductions 
in many of our markets  we were required to make significant mandatory payments for government sponsored social welfare programs  and we had little control over these costs 
our marketing expenses included the costs of direct mail and other mass marketing programs  advertising  customer communications  trade show participation  web site management and other promotional costs 
our professional fees included the cost of using outside consultants to assist with the implementation of our financial and back office systems at our operating companies  as well as the cost of using outside consultants for financial review and attestation engagements 
other s  g a expenses included the costs of travel  rent  utilities  insurance and bad debt expense 
trends in our s  g a costs were affected by two countervailing factors 
in we continued our aggressive strategy and acquired additional internet services providers 
simultaneously  we began to focus on organic growth by hiring additional sales  marketing  finance and technical personnel  as well as additional or replacement infrastructure and systems 
these new hires and purchases were intended to permit us to scale our operations to take advantage of the ongoing explosive growth in the internet and technology sectors 
as we implemented our organic growth plan  our expenses ramped up through the latter part of and into beginning late in the first quarter  we began to see rapidly deteriorating economic conditions and declining revenue growth rates in all our markets 
in response  our operations began cost reduction programs  including the reduction of direct costs  staff and  in some cases  the consolidation of office space 
we have incurred certain non recurring expenses relating to staff lay offs and lease terminations  among other things 
these expenses have increased our general and administrative expenses 
however  we expected recurring general and administrative expense to decline as we continued our cost reduction programs 
we incurred s  g a expenses of million for the year ended december   a increase over the million we incurred for the year ended december  approximately million or of the increase relates to the eight operations that we purchased during and did not subsequently sell in  which were consolidated for only a portion of  but were consolidated for all of compensation expense increased from million in to million in  an increase of million 
approximately million of this increase relates to severance payments and termination benefits provided in connection with the termination of approximately employees incurred under our cost reduction program 
another million can be attributed to the eight operations that we purchased during and did not subsequently sell in  which were consolidated for only a portion of  but were consolidated for all of our compensation cost increased during the first half of as our employee count grew to over  and then began decreasing as we reduced our headcount to less than  employees by december  in conjunction with our cost cutting measures  marketing and sales expenses decreased from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  professional fees increased from million in to million in primarily due to the implementation of our financial systems and our multi vendor integrated provisioning  billing and customer care platform  or integrated platform 
during  we substantially completed the implementation throughout the organization of our new financial accounting software system 
also in  we decided to suspend development and deployment of our integrated billing  provisioning and back office system 
bad debt expense for the year ended december  and was million and million  respectively 
the increase in bad debt expense was partially attributable to the deteriorating economic conditions  which necessitated more conservative estimates regarding bad debt reserves 
additionally  we completed in country integrations of several of our operations 
due to significant turnover in the collections staff at these locations  significant delays to the collections processes occurred  which adversely affected the aging and potential collectibility of customer account balances 
through december  we recorded deferred stock compensation totaling million in connection with the grant of stock options to employees 
this amount represented the difference between the fair market value of our common stock on the dates these options were granted and the exercise price of the options  net of forfeitures of non vested stock options upon employee termination 
the amount was included as a component of stockholders equity and was being amortized over the vesting period of the individual options  generally four years

goodwill  which was amortized over five years  was created when the price at which we acquired a company exceeded the fair value of its net tangible and intangible assets 
as a result of our acquisitions  we amortized substantial amounts of goodwill and other intangible assets 
we also recognized depreciation expense primarily related to telecommunications equipment  computers and network infrastructure 
we depreciated telecommunications equipment and computers over their useful lives  generally ranging from three to five years 
the cost of network infrastructure purchased under indefeasible right of use agreements  or iru  was amortized over the lesser of the estimated useful life or term of the agreement  generally to years 
our depreciation and amortization expense was million for the year ended december   up from million for the year ended december  this increase was primarily due to the amortization of goodwill related to the consolidated operations that we owned for all of  but that we owned for only a portion of the acquisition of these operations and the implementation of our international network also increased our depreciation expense for telecommunications equipment  computers and other fixed assets

interest income  net twelve months ended december  december  increase decrease in thousands of us dollars interest income  net   of total revenue we earned interest income primarily by investing our available cash in short term treasury securities funds 
this interest income was partially offset by interest expense  largely arising from purchase and lease financing of equipment

we established the euro denominated cash accounts in connection with our initial public offering in february  in which we sold shares of our common stock for both us dollars and euros 
the remainder of the loss was contributed by fluctuations in the five other non euro linked currencies in which we held assets 
income tax benefit expense twelve months ended december  december  increase decrease in thousands of us dollars income tax benefit expense  of total revenue while we incurred consolidated operating losses from inception through december   we recorded a benefit for income taxes of approximately  largely as a result of income tax refunds expected based on net operating loss carrybacks related to our wholly owned subsidiary  via net

in addition  there was a small amount of foreign income tax benefit  as well as a deferred tax benefit related to the change from a net deferred tax liability to zero 
we provided a valuation allowance for our net deferred tax assets of million reducing our net deferred tax assets to zero 
valuation allowances were used to reduce the net deferred tax assets to the amounts considered more likely than not to be realized 
changes in estimates of future taxable income can materially change the amount of such valuation allowances

quarterly results of operations the information below has been derived from our unaudited consolidated financial statements

we had negative cash flow of million during  leaving us with million in cash and cash equivalents and  in restricted cash at december  unlike many players in our industry  via has avoided incurring any significant debt and to date maintains a strong balance sheet 
although management is considering various alternatives related to the structural reorganization of our operations along centralized functional lines  the company has not made any significant capital commitments to date 
however  the execution of our strategic plan will significantly increase from levels our capital expenditures  restructuring and other non recurring costs associated with the strategic plan 
we believe that the cash expenditures associated with execution of the strategic plan are necessary to accelerate our path toward profitability 
even with these planned expenditures  we believe that our available cash will be sufficient to fund our working capital and capital expenditures requirements for the foreseeable future 
however  unless the capital markets improve in the interim  we cannot assure you that we will be able to obtain further financing if we are unsuccessful in reaching a steady positive cash flow position before our cash reserves are depleted 
since inception  we have financed our operations primarily through the sale of equity securities 
we raised approximately million in the aggregate through three private preferred stock offerings between august and april through our initial public offering of common stock in february  we raised approximately million  net of underwriting discounts and commissions 
at december   we had cash and cash equivalents of million and restricted cash of  cash used in operating activities was million for the year ended december  and million for the year ended december  cash flows from operating activities can vary significantly from period to period depending on the timing of operating cash receipts and payments and other working capital changes  especially accounts receivable  other current assets  accounts payable  accrued expenses and other current liabilities 
in both periods  our net losses were the primary component of cash used in operating activities  offset by significant non cash depreciation  amortization  impairment charges  non cash stock compensation charges  provision for doubtful accounts receivable and unrealized foreign currency transaction losses 
cash used in investing activities was million for the year ended december  and million for the same period in in  we used cash to purchase property and equipment  provide a loan to a related party and increase our restricted cash balance 
in  we used cash to increase our investment in one partially owned operation and to make two contingent earn out payments in connection with acquisitions 
in  we used million for the purchase of property and equipment

as of december   we had the following contractual obligations in thousands of us dollars contractual obligations total less than year years years after years debt capital lease obligations operating leases including operations and maintenance payments under iru agreements      total      foreign currency exchange risks in and prior to the sale of our operations in argentina  austria  brazil  ireland and mexico  we conducted business in seven different currencies  including the euro and the us dollar 
the value of foreign currencies fluctuates in relation to the us dollar 
at the end of each reporting period  the revenues and expenses of our operating companies are translated into us dollars using the average exchange rate for that period  and their assets and liabilities are translated into us dollars using the exchange rate in effect at the end of that period 
fluctuations in these exchange rates impact our financial condition  revenues and results of operations  as reported in us dollars 
exchange rates can vary significantly 
the euro high and low rates varied by approximately in relation to the us dollar during the year ended december  this variation affects the average exchange rates used to translate amounts on the income statement 
at december   the euro exchange rate was approximately above where it was at the beginning of the year 
this variation affects the ending exchange rates used to translate amounts on the balance sheet 
this fluctuation in the exchange rate resulted in a foreign currency gain of million for the year ended december  these gains and losses are primarily due to the impact of the fluctuation in the value of the euro on our euro denominated cash accounts as well as the revaluation of intercompany balances 
future changes in the value of the euro could have a material impact on our financial position and results of operations 
we also experienced fluctuations in other exchange rates 
our local operations transact business in their local currencies 
they do not have significant assets  liabilities or other accounts denominated in currencies other than their local currency  and therefore are not subject to exchange rate risk with respect to their normal operations  with the exception of intercompany transactions 
on a consolidated basis  we are subject to exchange rate risks because we translate our local operations financial data into us dollars 
as of january   the euro became the sole legal currency for of the european union member countries 
this includes nine of our then operating markets 
as a result  during  we conducted business in only seven currencies compared to currencies in recent accounting pronouncements in april  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued sfas no 
 revision of fas nos 
 and  amendment of fasb and technical corrections 
sfas no 
rescinds  amends or makes various technical corrections to certain existing authoritative pronouncements and is effective for fiscal years beginning after may for the rescission of fas no 
and fas no

via does not believe the adoption of sfas no 
will have a material impact on the financial condition or results of operations 
in june  the fasb issued sfas  accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities 
sfas supercedes emerging issues task force eitf issue no 
liability recognition for certain employee termination benefits and other costs to exit an activity 
this statement is effective for exit disposal activities that are initiated after december   with early adoption encouraged 
via plans to adopt sfas on january  and does not believe that the adoption of sfas will have a material impact on its financial position and results of operations 
in november  the fasb issued interpretation number  guarantor s accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees  including indirect guarantees of indebtedness of others fin 
this interpretation requires certain disclosures to be made by a guarantor in its interim and annual financial statements about its obligations under certain guarantees that it has issued 
it also requires a guarantor to recognize  at the inception of a guarantee  a liability for the fair value of the obligation undertaken in issuing the guarantee 
the disclosure requirements of fin are effective for interim and annual periods ending after december  the initial recognition and initial measurement requirements of fin are effective prospectively for guarantees issued or modified after december  as the company has not entered into any material guarantee obligations  the adoption of the recognition and initial measurement requirements of fin will not have a material impact on our financial position  cash flows or results of operations 
in january  the fasb issued fin  consolidation of variable interest entities an interpretation of arb no 

fin clarifies the application of accounting research bulletin no 
 consolidated financial statements  to certain entities in which equity investors do not have the characteristics of a controlling financial interest or do not have sufficient equity at risk for the entity to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support from other parties 
fin explains how to identify variable interests entities and how an enterprise assesses its interests in a variable interest entity to decide whether to consolidate that entity 
it requires existing unconsolidated variable interest entities to be consolidated by their primary beneficiaries if the entities do not effectively disperse risks among parties involved 
it also requires certain disclosures by the primary beneficiary of a variable interest entity and by an enterprise that holds significant variable interests in a variable interest entity where the enterprise is not the primary beneficiary 
fin is effective immediately to variable interest entities created after january  and to variable interest entities in which an enterprise obtains an interest after that date  and effective for the first fiscal year or interim period beginning after june  to variable interest entities in which an enterprise holds a variable interest that it acquired before february  the company does not currently believe that there are any additional entities that will need to be consolidated following its adoption of fin item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the following discussion relates to our exposure to market risk  related to changes in interest rates and changes in foreign exchange rates 
this discussion contains forward looking statements that are subject to risks and uncertainties 
actual results could differ materially due to a number of factors  as set forth in the risk factors section in item of this form k 
via has exposure to financial market risks  including changes in interest rates and foreign exchange rates 
at december  and  via s financial instruments consisted of short term investments and fixed rate debt related to acquisitions and network purchases 
our investments are generally fixed rate short term investment grade and government securities denominated in us dollars 
at december  and all of our investments were due to mature within three months and the carrying value of such investments approximates fair value 
the majority of our debt obligations had fixed rates of interest and were due within one year of the balance sheet date 
as mentioned previously in the foreign currency exchange risks section  via has euro denominated cash accounts held by subsidiaries with a functional currency in us dollars 
therefore  this exposes the company to foreign currency exchange rate risk in the statement of operations 
at december   a percent increase or decrease in the level of the euro exchange rate against the dollar with all other variables held constant would have resulted in a realized gain or loss of million 
as of december   a percent increase or decrease in the level of the euro exchange rate against the us dollar with all other variables held constant would result in a realized gain or loss of million 
the change in exposure from year to year is related to the change in the balance of the euro cash account 
to minimize the company s exposure to foreign currency exchange rate risk in  via purchased million worth of us dollars on march   thus substantially reducing the balance in the euro cash account 
the company continues to hold approximately million in the euro cash account and remains exposed to changes in the foreign currency rate 
however  such rate fluctuations should have a smaller impact as the balance has been reduced 
additionally  via is exposed to foreign exchange rate risk related to its obligations denominated in foreign currencies 
these obligations are a result of acquiring operating companies in various european countries 
via is also subject to risk from changes in foreign exchange rates for its international operations  which use a foreign currency as their functional currency and are translated into us dollars 
these risks have not been reduced through hedging arrangements
