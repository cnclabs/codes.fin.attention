item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis contains forward looking statements that are based upon current expectations 
forward looking statements involve risks and uncertainties 
our actual results and the timing of events may differ significantly from the results discussed in the forward looking statements 
factors that might cause such a difference include  but are not limited to  those discussed in business risk factors as well as those discussed elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
historical operating results are not necessarily indicative of results that may occur in future periods 
you should read the following discussion and analysis in conjunction with item selected financial data  and item financial statements and supplementary data included elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
overview our mission is to become a source of novel  small molecule therapeutic drugs to meet large  unmet medical needs 
our business model is to develop a portfolio of drug candidates and to take these through phase ii clinical trials  after which we intend to seek partners for completion of clinical trials  regulatory approval and marketing 
we have incurred net losses since inception and expect to incur substantial and increasing losses for the next several years as we continue to move drug candidates into and through preclinical and clinical stages of drug development and expand our research and development activities 
to date  we have funded our operations primarily through the sale of equity securities  non equity payments from collaborative partners and capital asset lease financings 
we received our first funding from our collaborative partners in december as of december   including both research funding and equity investments  we had received an aggregate of million from our collaborative partners  including million in the year ended december  as of december   our accumulated deficit was approximately million 
we expect our sources of revenue for the next several years to consist primarily of payments under our current and future corporate collaborations 
under these arrangements  sources of revenue may include up front payments  funded research  milestone payments and royalties 
the process of carrying out our research programs for our collaborative partners and the development of our own non partnered products to the later stages of development will require significant additional research and development expenditures  including preclinical testing and clinical trials 
these activities  together with our general and administrative expenses  are expected to result in substantial operating losses for the foreseeable future 
we will not receive product revenue unless we or our collaborative partners complete clinical trials  obtain regulatory approval and successfully commercialize one or more of our products 
to date  we have entered into collaborations with four major pharmaceutical companies johnson johnson  pfizer  novartis and daiichi 
johnson johnson  pfizer and novartis have contributed nearly all of our revenues over the last three years 
the daiichi collaboration was entered into in the last half of in july  we expanded our collaboration with novartis with the initiation of our angiogenesis program  the fourth and final program in our novartis collaboration 
pursuant to the expanded novartis collaboration  we received a million up front payment from novartis  which is being recognized as revenue ratably through july in addition  the expanded collaboration provides that the angiogenesis research program will be carried out at rigel  provides for research reimbursement through the middle of and includes potential future milestones and royalty payments to us 
in conjunction with the original collaboration  novartis paid million for  shares of our series d preferred stock that converted to  shares of common stock upon the completion of our initial public offering 
the original collaboration also allowed for an additional equity investment by novartis of up to million that was callable by us until our initial public offering 
we exercised this right and sold to novartis  shares of common stock at per share concurrent with the closing of the our initial public offering 
in may  novartis elected to conclude the research phases of our two initial joint projects in the autoimmunity and transplant rejection areas  after months each  effective in november and february  respectively 
in december  johnson johnson elected to extend the research phase of our collaboration for an additional two years  and we estimate that this extension will result in additional research reimbursement through the end of of approximately million  of which million has been received as of december  in february  the research phase of our collaboration with pfizer concluded with pfizer accepting a total of seven validated targets 
under our collaboration with pfizer  we expect that these validated targets will continue through the drug discovery and development process at pfizer 
in august  we signed an agreement for the establishment of a collaboration with daiichi to pursue research related to a specific protein degradation target 
per the agreement  the research phase of this collaboration is for three years 
we will be working with daiichi to discover and develop cancer pharmaceutical drugs 
under the terms of the collaboration agreement  daiichi has paid us an upfront amount and a milestone payment  is obligated to pay us ongoing research support and may become obligated to pay us certain other milestones payments 
in addition  we will receive royalties on any commercialized products to emerge from the collaboration 
the initial stages of the collaboration focused on the development of the assay for a specific target and the initiation of hts to identify therapeutic molecules we and daiichi would like to advance to later stages of drug development 
under terms of the agreement  we retain the rights to co develop and co promote products resulting from this collaboration in north america while daiichi retains co development and promotion rights in the remainder of the world 
a summary of these partnerships is as follows partner research program commencement date research phase termination date johnson johnson tumor growth cell cycle inhibition december  december pfizer asthma allergy ige production in b cells january  february novartis transplant rejection t cell activation may  november novartis autoimmunity disease b cell activation august  february novartis chronic bronchitis conducted at novartis january  ongoing at novartis novartis tumor growth inhibition of tumor angiogenesis july  july daiichi tumor growth protein degradation oncology target august  august under the terms of these collaborations  johnson johnson  novartis and daiichi have agreed to provide up to approximately million in future research funding over the next three years  none of which is cancelable at the option of these partners 
in addition  we may receive additional payments upon the achievement of specific research and development milestones and royalties upon commercialization of any products 
in order to maintain and increase proceeds from collaborations  we are exploring new opportunities with existing and new potential collaborators 
our earliest partnerships focused on the early stages of drug discovery  specifically on target discovery and validation  while our collaboration with johnson johnson has been expanded to also include both chemistry and compound hts  and our recent collaboration with daiichi focuses on drug discovery and development 
we currently anticipate that in order to support our current research programs we will need to self fund  at an increased rate of spending  our own research programs to later stages of development prior to partnering with collaborative partners 
therefore  it is expected that future collaborative partnerships may have an expanded focus and could include hts  combinatorial and medicinal chemistry  preclinical evaluations and or clinical development 
for some programs  we may also seek to enter into collaborations for the development of compounds that we have discovered 
the timing  the amount of funds received and the scope of any new collaborations are uncertain  and any compound collaboration will depend on the successful progress of clinical trials 
new  expanded or larger collaborations will also be necessary to offset any decrease in proceeds as collaborations come to the end of their terms 
our remaining novartis program focused on angiogenesis is a multiple year agreement with the research phase terminating in  the johnson johnson collaboration concludes its research phase at the end of and the daiichi collaboration concludes its research phase in august as each collaboration reaches the conclusion of its research phase  the parties may evaluate the status of the collaboration and  if appropriate  seek to extend the research phase of the collaboration agreement or negotiate alternative terms 
in june  we resolved a dispute with inoxell a s formed as a spinout from pharmexa formally m e biotech by entering into a global patent settlement concerning certain drug target identification technologies  which includes both cross licensing and joint ownership to certain patents and allows for worldwide freedom of operation for both companies 
in september  we entered into a technology transfer agreement with questcor pharmaceuticals  inc and acquired the license and technology to a hepatitis c research program 
under the terms of this agreement  we have paid a nonrefundable and noncreditable fee of  issued to questcor  shares of series e preferred stock that subsequently converted to  shares of common stock upon completion of the our initial public offering and will be responsible for satisfying certain milestones and royalties 
we were also committed to invest a total of million in research and development expenses over a two year period through this committed spending level was achieved midway through the agreement terminates upon the expiration of the last patent within the agreement 
we accounted for the series e preferred stock at per share based on the deemed fair value of our common stock at the date of sale  and we expensed the aggregate value of approximately million in september  as the acquired technology was not yet fully developed and had no alternative use 
critical accounting policies and the use of estimates our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to terms of the research collaborations  investments  stock compensation  impairment issues  the estimated useful life of assets  and contingencies 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our financial statements 
revenue recognition non refundable  up front payments received in connection with research and development collaboration agreements  including technology access fees  are deferred and recognized on a straight line basis over the relevant periods of continuing involvement  generally the research term 
revenues related to collaborative research with our corporate collaborators are recognized as research services are performed over the related funding periods for each contract 
under these agreements  we are required to perform research and development activities as specified in each respective agreement 
the payments received are not refundable and are generally based on a contractual cost per full time equivalent employee working on the project 
research and development expenses under the collaborative research agreements approximate or exceed the revenue recognized under such agreements over the term of the respective agreements 
deferred revenue may result if we were not to incur the required level of effort during a specific period in comparison to funds received under the respective contracts 
milestones are recognized pursuant to collaborative agreements upon the achievement of these specified at risk milestones 
royalties will be recognized as earned in accordance with the contract terms when the third party results are reliably measurable and collectibility is reasonably assured 
stock based compensation we recorded no deferred stock compensation with respect to options granted to employees for the year ended december  we recorded deferred stock compensation with respect to options granted to employees of approximately million and million in the years ended december  and  respectively  representing the difference between the deemed fair value of our common stock for financial reporting purposes on the date these options were granted and the exercise price 
these amounts have been reflected as components of stockholders equity  and the deferred expense is being amortized to operations over the vesting period of the options  generally four to five years  using the graded vesting method 
we amortized deferred stock compensation of million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
at december   we had a total of million remaining to be amortized over the remaining vesting periods of the stock options 
in addition to the amortization of the deferred stock compensation  we also record charges associated with options granted to consultants in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states that involve the periodic revaluation of outstanding unvested consultant options based upon the current market value of our common stock and other assumptions  including the expected future volatility of our stock price 
we recognized stock based compensation recovery for revaluation of consultant options of million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
we recognized stock based compensation expense for revaluation of consultant options of million for the year ended december  even though the number of unvested outstanding options issued to consultants continues to decline  we expect to see continued fluctuations in the future as a portion of these options are revalued based on the current market price of our common stock through the application of the graded vesting method 
years ended december   and revenues 
contract revenues from collaborations were million in  compared to million in and million in revenues in  and consisted primarily of research support and amortization of upfront fees from the continuation of our collaborations with pfizer  johnson johnson  novartis  and  in only  daiichi 
in and  revenues also included milestone payments for targets delivered and accepted from certain collaborators 
revenue was flat in as compared to primarily due to a combination of the end of the research phase of the pfizer collaboration  offset by a full year of the angiogenesis program with novartis and the commencement of the collaboration with daiichi 
the increase in revenues of million from to was primarily due to the commencement of the angiogenesis program with novartis in july and milestones achieved in the johnson johnson and pfizer programs 
we expect contract revenues from collaborations to be a significant component of our total revenues for the foreseeable future 
research and development 
research and development expenses were million in  compared to million in and million in excluding stock based compensation  research and development expenses were million in  compared to million in and million in the increase in of million reflects primarily the continued expansion of our drug development infrastructure  the addition of both drug development and research headcount  increased outside contract efforts  increased preclinical activities  the commencement of clinical trials and costs associated with our intellectual property 
in september  we began the phase i clinical trial of our lead compound  r  in the united kingdom and subsequently filed an ind application for this compound with the fda for the clinical indication of allergic rhinitis 
the increase in of million primarily reflected the expansion of our drug development infrastructure  the addition of both drug development and research headcount  increased outside contract efforts  increased preclinical activities and costs associated with our intellectual property 
we expect research and development expenses to increase in future years  particularly as we continue to move our solely owned drug candidates through preclinical activities and into clinical trials 
the scope and magnitude of future research and development expenses are difficult to predict at this time given the number of studies that will need to be conducted for any of our potential products as well as our limited capital resources 
in general  biopharmaceutical development involves a series of steps beginning with identification of a potential target and including  among others  proof of concept in animals and phase i  ii and iii clinical studies in humans each of which is typically more expensive than the previous step 
success in development therefore results in increasing expenditures 
our research and development expenditures currently include costs for scientific personnel  supplies  equipment  consultants  patent filings  sponsored research  allocated facility costs and costs related to clinical trials 
because of the number of research projects we have ongoing at any one time  and the ability to utilize resources across several projects  the majority of our research and development costs are not directly tied to any individual project and are allocated among multiple projects 
our project management is based primarily on scientific data and supplemented by these cost allocations  which are based primarily on human resource time incurred on each project 
as a result the costs allocated to a project do not necessarily reflect the actual costs of the project 
accordingly  we do not maintain actual cost incurred information for our projects on a project by project basis 
general and administrative expenses 
general and administrative expenses were million in  compared to million in and million in the increases in both and of million and million  respectively  were primarily attributable to higher employee costs and greater infrastructure costs to support the growing research and development activities 
we expect that general and administrative expenses will increase in the future to support the continued growth of our research and development efforts as our products continue to move into clinical trials 
net interest expense 
net interest expense was  in  compared with net interest income of million in and million in interest income results from our interest bearing cash and investment balances  whereas interest expense is the result of our capital lease obligations associated with fixed asset purchases 
in  interest expense exceeded interest income due primarily to a reduction in interest rates on our owned securities 
the increase in net interest income in is directly related to the investment interest earned from the proceeds of our initial public offering in december of deemed dividend to series e preferred stockholders 
in february  we completed a private placement of  shares of series e preferred stock at per share for net proceeds of approximately million 
at the date of issuance  we believed the per share price of represented the fair value of the preferred stock 
subsequent to the commencement of the our initial public offering process  we re evaluated the fair value of our common stock as of february and determined it to be per share 
accordingly  the increase in fair value resulted in a beneficial conversion feature of million that was recorded as a deemed dividend to the preferred stockholders in in august  we issued  shares of series e preferred stock to one of our directors 
we recorded a deemed dividend of approximately  at the time of issuance 
effect of new accounting standards in june  the financial accounting standards board or fasb issued fas  accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities  which addresses accounting for restructuring  discontinued operation  plant closing or other exit or disposal activity 
fas requires companies to recognize costs associated with exit or disposal activities when they are incurred rather than at the date of a commitment to an exit or disposal plan 
fas is to be applied prospectively to exit or disposal activities initiated after december  the adoption of fas is not expected to have a significant impact on our financial position or results of operations 
in november  the fasb issued interpretation no 
or fin  guarantor s accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees  including indirect guarantees of indebtedness of others 
fin elaborates on the existing disclosure requirements for most guarantees  including residual value guarantees issued in conjunction with operating lease agreements 
it also clarifies that at the time a company issues a guarantee  the company must recognize an initial liability for the fair value of the obligation it assumes under that guarantee and must disclose that information in its interim and annual financial statements 
the initial recognition and measurement provisions apply on a prospective basis to guarantees issued or modified after december  we have made the disclosure requirements in our our adoption of the recognition requirements of fin are not expected to have a material impact on our results of operations and financial position 
in january  the fasb issued interpretation no 
or fin  consolidation of variable interest entities 
fin requires a variable interest entity to be consolidated by a company if that company is subject to a majority of the risk of loss from the variable interest entity s activities or entitled to receive a majority of the entity s residual returns or both 
a variable interest entity is a corporation  partnership  trust  or any other legal structures used for business purposes that either a does not have equity investors with voting rights or b has equity investors that do not provide sufficient financial resources for the entity to support its activities 
a variable interest entity often holds financial assets  including loans or receivables  real estate or other property 
a variable interest entity may be essentially passive or it may engage in research and development or other activities on behalf of another company 
the consolidation requirements of fin apply immediately to variable interest entities created after january  the consolidation requirements apply to older entities in the first fiscal year or interim period beginning after june  certain of the disclosure requirements apply to all financial statements issued after january   regardless of when the variable interest entity was established 
our adoption of fin is not expected to have a material impact on our results of operations and financial position 
in december  the fasb issued statement no 
 accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure 
fas amends fas accounting for stock based compensation to provide alternative methods of transition for a voluntary change to the fair value based method of accounting for stock based employee compensation 
in addition  fas amends the disclosure requirements of fas to require more prominent disclosures in both annual and interim financial statements about the method of accounting for stock based employee compensation and the effect of the method used on reported results 
the additional disclosure requirements of fas are effective for fiscal years ending after december  we have elected to continue to follow the intrinsic value method of accounting as prescribed by accounting principles board opinion no 
or apb  accounting for stock issued to employees  to account for employee stock options 
in november  the emerging issues task force or eitf reached a consensus on issue no 
 revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables 
eitf issue no 
provides guidance on how to account for arrangements that involve the delivery or performance of multiple products  services and or rights to use assets 
the provisions of eitf issue no 
will apply to revenue arrangements entered into in fiscal periods beginning after june  we believe the adoption of this standard will have no material impact on our financial statements 
liquidity and capital resources we have financed our operations from inception primarily through sales of equity securities  contract payments payable to us under our collaboration agreements and equipment financing arrangements 
as of december   we had received million in gross proceeds from the sale of equity securities  including million from collaborators  and had received million in research funding from collaborators 
in addition  as of december   we had financed  through leases and loans  the purchase of equipment and leasehold improvements totaling approximately million 
as of december   we had million in cash  cash equivalents and available for sale securities  as compared to million as of december   a decrease of million 
this decrease was attributable to a combination of approximately million in net cash used in operating activities offset by proceeds of million  net of commissions and offering costs  from the sale of  shares of our common stock in two offerings in january and february under our shelf registration statement 
we also invested million in capital equipment and had debt service payments of million in conjunction with our equipment financing arrangements 
these payments were offset by million of proceeds from lease financing and million from the sale of our stock through incentive stock option plans 
as of december   we had million in capital lease obligations associated with our financed purchase of equipment and leasehold improvements 
all existing equipment financing agreements as of december  are secured by the equipment financed  bear interest rates in a range of to and are due in monthly installments through in addition  three of these agreements have balloon payments at the end of each loan term  while the fourth agreement allows us to purchase the assets financed at the fair market value or of the original acquisition cost at the end of the financing term 
in july  we entered into a tenant improvement and equipment lease line agreement for an aggregate total of million 
due to the amendment of the master lease agreement for our veterans blvd 
facility signed in october we have terminated this financing arrangement as of december   we had a total of million available for draw down under all financing agreements 
during our office and research facility located at east grand in south san francisco was leased under an operating lease that terminated in conjunction with a year lease for our current office and research facilities at veterans blvd 
in south san francisco signed in may under the terms of the lease signed in  we were to occupy our new facilities in late and were to concurrently terminate our lease of our former facility at east grand in south san francisco 
we determined that the lease for our current facility was an operating lease in accordance with fas in connection with the termination of the current east grand lease  we accelerated the amortization of tenant improvements and accrued rent charges over the expected remaining life of the lease and incurred minimal costs in connection with the terminated lease 
the veterans blvd 
research and office facilities were constructed as a build to suit facility 
under the original lease  we were obligated to fund approximately million of the total tenant improvement obligations 
in october  we amended this original lease to provide for a delay of the rent commencement date until february  and an increase in the tenant improvement allowance to cover all of the expected remaining construction obligations on the facility 
the lease was also amended to increase the future rental commitments to compensate for the delay of the rent commencement and the increase in the tenant improvement allowance 
since the amendment was considered a material change to the original lease  we reviewed the accounting treatment for this amended lease and again determined the lease to be an operating lease 
we moved into the new facility during february prior to the signing of the amendment  we had been directly paying a portion of the pre construction and construction costs related to the new facility 
these costs were being capitalized on our balance sheet as construction in progress 
per the terms of the amendment  we have estimated that the landlord will be responsible for reimbursing to us all of the costs that we had previously capitalized 
therefore  we have reclassified these costs into a short term asset receivable from landlord in our financial statements 
the following are our contractual commitments by fiscal year as of december  associated with debt obligations  lease obligations  and contracted research obligations total in thousands capital leases    facilities leases      contracted research total      on january   we implemented a restructuring plan to reduce the rate of our cash consumption and better align our operating structure with current and expected future economic conditions 
the restructuring plan included an immediate reduction in force of approximately percent  or employees  to employees with reductions occurring in all functional areas 
two of our officers were included in this reduction in force 
we also deferred a portion of certain officers salaries 
we believe that our existing capital resources  together with anticipated payments under current collaborations  will be sufficient to support our current operating plan and spending through the end of september we will require additional financing to fund our operations as currently planned beyond that date 
while we have been actively seeking both financing and corporate partnering opportunities  we cannot assure you that a sufficient financing or corporate partnering transaction can be completed on acceptable terms  or at all 
if a sufficient financing or corporate partnering transaction cannot be completed or assured  we will not be able to continue our current operating plans and will be forced to reduce the scale of our operations 
if a sufficient financing or corporate partnering transaction is not reasonably assured by the middle of may  we will complete our r clinical trial currently under way and continue only with certain external preclinical studies in our hepatitis c program 
all other external studies would be terminated 
if as of june  a sufficient financing or corporate partnering transaction is not reasonably assured  we will be required to significantly scale back our operations by reducing our headcount by approximately and significantly reducing all discretionary spending 
we anticipate that upon the execution of these actions  our existing capital resources will be sufficient to support the substantially reduced funding of our current programs as well as our operations through the end of to the extent we raise additional capital by issuing equity securities  our stockholders would at this time experience substantial dilution 
our future funding requirements will depend on many factors  including  but not limited to our ability to maintain our existing collaboration partnerships  our ability to establish and the scope of new collaborations  the progress and number of research programs carried out at rigel  the progress of the research and development efforts of our collaborators  any changes in the breadth of our research and development programs  our ability to meet the milestones identified in our collaborative agreements that trigger payments  our ability to maintain and establish new corporate relationships and research collaborations  our ability to acquire or license other technologies or compounds  if any  the progress and success of preclinical studies and clinical trials of our drug candidates conducted by us or our collaborative partners or licensees  our ability to manage our growth  competing technological and market developments  the costs and timing of obtaining  enforcing and defending our patent and intellectual rights  the costs and timing of regulatory approvals  and expenses associated with unforeseen litigation 
in addition  we are constantly reviewing potential opportunities to expand our technologies or add to our portfolio of drug candidates 
in the future  we may need further capital in order to acquire or invest in technologies  products or businesses 
for the next several years  we do not expect the cash generated from our operations to generate the amount of cash required by our future cash needs 
we expect to finance future cash needs through strategic collaborations  debt financing and the sale of equity securities 
we cannot assure you that additional financing or collaboration and licensing arrangements will be available when needed or that  if available  this financing will be obtained on terms favorable to us or our stockholders 
insufficient funds may require us to delay  scale back or eliminate some or all of our research or development programs  to lose rights under existing licenses or to relinquish greater or all rights to product candidates at an earlier stage of development or on less favorable terms than we would otherwise choose or may adversely affect our ability to operate as a going concern 
if additional funds are obtained by issuing equity securities  substantial dilution to existing stockholders may result 
as of december   we had federal net operating loss carryforwards of approximately million to offset future taxable income 
we also had federal research and development tax credit carryforwards of approximately million 
if not utilized  net operating loss and credit carryforwards will begin to expire in utilization of the net operating losses and credits may be subject to a substantial annual limitation due to ownership change limitations provided by the internal revenue code of the annual limitation may result in the expiration of our net operating losses and credits before they can be used 
you should read note of the notes to our financial statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve principal while at the same time maximizing the income we receive from our investments without significantly increasing risk 
some of the securities in which we invest may have market risk 
this means that a change in prevailing interest rates may cause the fair value amount of the investment to fluctuate 
for example  if we hold a security that was issued with a fixed interest rate at the then prevailing rate and the prevailing interest rate later rises  the market value amount of our investment will decline 
to minimize this risk in the future  we intend to maintain our portfolio of cash equivalents and short term investments in a variety of securities  including commercial paper  money market funds and government and non government debt securities 
in  and  we maintained an investment portfolio primarily in depository accounts and corporate commercial paper 
due to the short term nature of these investments  we believe we do not have a material exposure to interest rate risk arising from our investments 
therefore  no quantitative tabular disclosure is provided 
we have operated primarily in the united states  and all funding activities with our collaborators to date have been made in us dollars 
accordingly  we have not had any exposure to foreign currency rate fluctuations
