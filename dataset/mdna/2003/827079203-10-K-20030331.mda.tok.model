siliconix incorporated assumes no obligation to update this information 
overview siliconix incorporated the company is engaged in designing  manufacturing  and marketing power and analog semiconductor products 
the company is a leading manufacturer of power mosfets  power ics  and analog signal processing devices for computers  cellular phones  fixed communication networks  automobiles and other electronic systems 
power mosfets are low voltage  surface mount products primarily used in the communication  computer  and automotive markets  as well as other industrial and consumer applications 
power ics are integrated circuits used in communication and data storage applications 
the signal processing products are a wide array of commodity products such as analog switches  low power mosfets  and jfets used in the industrial and consumer markets 
the company manufactures power products in a class six inch wafer fabrication facility in santa clara  california and subcontracts wafer fabrication through an affiliate in itzehoe  germany 
the company completed the process of transferring its power product technology to a subcontractor in japan and production started there in however  the transfer of the technology is an on going process as new technologies are developed 
this approach leverages lower manufacturing costs in certain overseas markets to ensure an adequate supply of wafers in the future 
the manufacturing of wafers for analog switches and multiplexers is done in santa clara and through an outsourcing arrangement by a foundry in dresden  germany 
a subcontractor in beijing  china manufactures small signal transistors 
the company uses additional fabrication subcontractors in taiwan and the united states for selected processes 
assembly and test facilities include a company owned facility in kaohsiung  taiwan  a leased facility in shanghai  china  and subcontractors in the philippines  taiwan  israel  china  thailand and korea 
vishay intertechnology  inc vishay owns an interest in the company 
vishay  a fortune  company listed on the nyse  is one of the world s largest manufacturers of discrete semiconductors diodes  rectifiers  transistors  optoelectronics  and selected ics and passive electronic components resistors  capacitors  inductors  and transducers 
the company s components can be found in products manufactured in a very broad range of industries worldwide 
vishay is headquartered in malvern  pennsylvania  and has plants in sixteen countries employing over  people 
the company s products are sold by the vishay worldwide sales organizations that operate as three regionally based legal entities 
the three regions consist of north america  europe and asia 
the aim of the vishay sales structure is to unify the activities of the member companies  provide efficiencies by eliminating the duplications of many functions  and bring greater value to end customers by allowing them to deal with one entity for their semiconductor purchasing needs 
vishay sales organizations function as undisclosed agents of the company  through commission arrangements at a fixed percentage of sales made in each region for all sales related functions  however  the ownership of all sales  accounts receivable  inventory  and risk of loss remains with siliconix  with the exception of the north america region

critical accounting policies the following are the company s critical accounting policies revenue recognition the company records revenues at the time that it ships products to its customers 
many of its shipments are to distributors  who purchase for resale to end users 
the distributors have certain limited rights to return products 
they are also entitled to certain price protection benefits  which give them credit for unsold products that they continue to hold in inventory when the company reduces its book prices for these items 
at the time the company records sales to these distributors  the company also recognizes allowances against net sales for estimated product returns and price protection 
to estimate these allowances  the company reviews historical returns and price adjustments on both a consolidated level and on an individual distributor level as well as the general business and economic climate 
these procedures require the exercise of significant judgments and they enable the company to estimate reasonably future credits for returns and price adjustments 
accounts receivable the company s receivables represent a significant portion of its current assets 
the company is required to estimate the collectability of its receivables and to establish allowances for the amount of receivables that will prove uncollectible 
the company bases these allowances on its historical collection experience  the length of time the receivables are outstanding  the financial circumstances of individual customers  and general business and economic conditions 
inventories the company values its inventories at the lower of cost or market  with cost determined under the first in first out method and market based upon net realizable value 
the valuation of its inventories requires management to make market estimates 
the valuation of inventory at the lower of cost or market requires the use of estimates as to the amounts of current inventory that will be sold 
these estimates are dependent on the company s assessment of current and expected orders from its customers

in january  the fasb issued fasb interpretation no 
fin  consolidation of variable interest entities 
fin clarifies the application of accounting research bulletin no 
 consolidated financial statements  to certain entities in which equity investors do not have the characteristics of a controlling financial interest or do not have sufficient equity at risk for the entity to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support from other parties 
fin applies immediately to variable interest entities created after january   and to variable interest entities in which an enterprise obtains an interest after that date 
it applies in the first fiscal year or interim period beginning after june  to variable interest entities in which an enterprise holds a variable interest that it acquired before february  fin applies to public enterprises as of the beginning of the applicable interim or annual period 
the company does not believe there will be a material effect on its financial condition or results of operations from the adoption of the provisions of fin risk factors the company has in the past  and may in the future  make forward looking statements within the meaning of the private securities litigation reform act of these statements might be expressed by using words such as estimates  assumes  expects  and anticipates  and are subject to risks and uncertainties  many of which are beyond the company s control  that could cause actual results to differ materially from those predicted 
such risks and uncertainties include  but are not limited to  the following technological change and competition the markets for the company s products and technologies are characterized by rapidly changing technology  frequent new product introductions  and declining average selling prices over product life cycles 
the company s future success is highly dependent upon the timely completion and introduction of new products and technologies at competitive prices and performance levels  and upon having those products selected for design into products of leading manufacturers 
in addition  the company must respond to competitors in the company s markets 
if the company is not able to make timely introduction of new products and technologies  or to respond effectively to competition  its business and operating results could be adversely affected 
variable demand the semiconductor industry has historically been highly cyclical and has been subject to significant downturns characterized by diminished product demand 
a material portion of the company s revenues has recently been derived from the worldwide communication and computer markets 
these markets have historically been somewhat volatile  as demand for the end products in these markets has varied widely from time to time 
if demand for these end products should decrease significantly  the producers thereof could reduce their purchase of the company s products that in turn could have a materially adverse effect on the company s consolidated financial position and results of operations 
political and economic considerations in recent years  a large and increasing portion of the company s net sales  operating profits  manufacturing production  and growth has come from its international operations 
as a result  the company s business activities and its results could be significantly affected by the policies of foreign governments and prevailing political  social  and economic conditions 
dependence on key suppliers the company uses numerous suppliers to supply raw materials for the manufacture and support of its products 
although the company makes reasonable efforts to ensure that materials are available from multiple suppliers  this is not always possible 
accordingly  certain key materials are obtained from a single supplier or a limited group of suppliers 
these suppliers are  in some cases  thinly capitalized  independent companies that generate significant portions of their business from the company and or a small group of other companies in the semiconductor industry 
the company has sought and will continue to seek to minimize the risk of production and service interruptions and or shortages of key materials by selecting and qualifying alternative suppliers for key materials  monitoring the financial stability of key suppliers  and maintaining appropriate inventories of key materials 
there can be no assurance that the company s results of operations will not be materially and adversely affected if  in the future  the company does not receive sufficient materials to meet its requirements in a timely and cost effective manner 
intellectual property matters the semiconductor industry is characterized by litigation regarding patent and other intellectual property rights 
the company has on occasion been notified that it may be infringing patent and other intellectual property rights of others 
in addition  customers purchasing components from the company have rights to indemnification under certain circumstances if such components violate the intellectual property rights of others 
further  the company has observed that in the current semiconductor industry business environment  companies have become more aggressive in asserting and defending patent claims against competitors 
while the company will continue to vigorously defend its intellectual property rights  the company may become party to disputes regarding patent licensing and cross patent licensing 
although licenses are generally offered in such situations and the company has successfully resolved these situations in the past  there can be no assurance that the company will not be subject to future litigation alleging intellectual property rights infringement  or that the company will be able to obtain licenses on acceptable terms 
an unfavorable outcome regarding one of these matters could have a material adverse effect on the company s business and operating results 
interest and currency rate exposure in the normal course of business  the financial position of the company is routinely subjected to a variety of risks  including market risks associated with interest rate movements  currency rate movements on non us dollar denominated assets and liabilities  and collectibility of accounts receivable 
due to the short term nature of the company s investment portfolio  an immediate percent increase in interest rates will not have a material effect on the company s near term financial condition or results of operations 
the company does not use derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes 
net foreign currency gains and losses did not have a material effect on the company s results of operations for fiscal  or environmental regulations to date  the company s compliance with federal  state and local laws or regulations that have been enacted to regulate the environment has not had a material adverse effect on the company s capital expenditures  earnings  or competitive or financial position 
for more information  see item  legal proceedings and note  contingencies in the consolidated financial statements 
however  the company could be subject to fines  suspension of production  alteration of its manufacturing processes  or even cessation of its operations if it fails to comply with present or future government regulations related to the use  storage  handling  discharge  or disposal of toxic  volatile or otherwise hazardous chemicals used in its manufacturing processes 
earthquakes the company s principal manufacturing facility and executive offices are located in santa clara  california 
a number of earthquakes have occurred in this region  some of them severe 
no material retrofitting is required to bring the buildings comprising the santa clara facility into compliance with current applicable seismic codes 
no assurance can be given  however  that in the event of a major earthquake  the resulting damage would not materially impact or even interrupt the company s production  either of which could materially adversely affect the company s financial condition and results of operations 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk in the normal course of business  the financial position of the company is routinely subjected to a variety of risks  including market risks associated with interest rate movements  currency rate movements on non us dollar denominated assets and liabilities  and collectibility of accounts receivable
