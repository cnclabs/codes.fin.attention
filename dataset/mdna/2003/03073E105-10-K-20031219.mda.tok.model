in order to enhance comparability to the fiscal results  we have included pro forma information for fiscal results of operations 
for purposes of this discussion  pro forma refers to the combined results of amerisource and bergen for fiscal they are not necessarily indicative of the actual results which might have occurred had the operations and management of amerisource and bergen been combined at the beginning of fiscal the following information also includes the results of operations for the year ended september  on a pro forma basis by reportable segment 
to further improve the comparability between fiscal years  the pro forma combined information for the year ended september  excludes amortization of goodwill see note to the consolidated financial statements and reflects the full allocation of bergen s former corporate segment to the company s pharmaceutical distribution and pharmerica segments 
such pro forma information and the related discussion is limited to the line items comprising operating income 
due to the changes in the company s debt structure which occurred in connection with the merger  pro forma combined interest expense for fiscal would not be directly comparable to the company s fiscal interest expense

year ended september  compared with year ended september  consolidated results operating revenue  which excludes bulk deliveries  for the fiscal year ended september  increased to billion from billion in the prior fiscal year 
this increase is primarily due to increased operating revenue in the pharmaceutical distribution segment 
the company reports as revenue bulk deliveries to customer warehouses  whereby the company acts as an intermediary in the ordering and delivery of pharmaceutical products 
bulk deliveries for the fiscal year ended september  decreased to billion from billion in the prior fiscal year 
this decrease was primarily due to the company s conversion of a portion of its bulk and other direct business with its primary bulk delivery customer to business serviced through the company s various warehouses 
due to the insignificant service fees generated from bulk deliveries  fluctuations in volume of bulk deliveries have no significant impact on operating margins 
however  revenue from bulk deliveries has had a positive impact to the company s cash flows due to favorable timing between the customer payments to the company and the payments by the company to its suppliers 
gross profit of  million in the fiscal year ended september  reflects an increase of from  million in the prior fiscal year 
as a percentage of operating revenue  gross profit in the fiscal year ended september  was  as compared to the prior year percentage of 
the decrease in gross profit percentage in comparison with the prior fiscal year reflects declines in both the pharmaceutical distribution and pharmerica segments primarily due to changes in customer mix and competitive selling price pressures  offset in part by the positive aggregate margin impact resulting from the company s recent acquisitions 
distribution  selling and administrative expenses  depreciation and amortization dsad a of  million in the fiscal year ended september  reflects an increase of compared to  million in the prior fiscal year 
as a percentage of operating revenue  dsad a in the fiscal year ended september  was compared to in the prior fiscal year 
the decline in the dsad a percentage from the prior fiscal year ratio reflects improvements in both the pharmaceutical distribution and pharmerica segments due to customer mix changes  operational efficiencies and continued benefits from the merger integration effort 
in connection with the merger  the company developed integration plans to consolidate its distribution network and eliminate duplicate administrative functions  which are expected to result in synergies of approximately million annually by the end of fiscal the company s plan is to have a distribution facility network consisting of facilities in the next three to four years 
this will be accomplished by building six new facilities  expanding seven facilities  and closing facilities 
during fiscal  the company began construction activities on three of its new facilities and completed two of the seven facility expansions 
during fiscal and  the company closed six and seven distribution facilities  respectively 
the company anticipates closing three additional facilities in fiscal in september  the company announced plans to close seven distribution facilities in fiscal  consisting of six former amerisource facilities and one former bergen facility 
a charge of million was recognized in the fourth quarter of fiscal related to the amerisource facilities  and included million of severance for approximately warehouse and administrative personnel to be terminated  million in lease and contract cancellations  and million for the write down of assets related to the facilities to be closed 
approximately million of costs related to the bergen facility were included in the merger purchase price allocation 
during the fiscal year ended september   severance accruals of million recorded in september were reversed into income because certain employees who were expected to be severed either voluntarily left the company or were retained in other positions within the company 
during the fiscal year ended september   the company announced further integration initiatives relating to the closure of bergen s repackaging facility and the elimination of certain bergen administrative functions  including the closure of a related office facility 
the cost of these initiatives of approximately million  which included million of severance for approximately employees to be terminated  million for lease cancellation costs  and million for the write down of assets related to the facilities to be closed  resulted in additional goodwill being recorded during fiscal at september   substantially all of the employees have been terminated

in the future  the company expects to incur an additional million of employee severance costs relating to the fiscal initiatives 
as of september   approximately employees had been provided termination notices as a result of the fiscal initiatives  of which were terminated 
additional amounts for integration initiatives will be recognized in subsequent periods as facilities to be consolidated are identified and specific plans are approved and announced

accordingly  the costs of the operations management office are included within distribution  selling and administrative expenses in the company s consolidated statements of operations 
operating income of million for the fiscal year ended september  reflects an increase of from million in the prior fiscal year 
special items reduced the company s operating income by million in the fiscal year ended september  and by million in the prior fiscal year 
the company s operating income as a percentage of operating revenue was in the fiscal year ended september  compared to in the prior fiscal year

during the fiscal year ended september   the company recorded a million loss resulting from the early retirement of debt see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
interest expense increased in the fiscal year ended september  to million from million in the prior fiscal year 
average borrowings  net of invested cash  under the company s debt facilities during the fiscal year ended september  were billion as compared to average borrowings  net of invested cash  of billion in the prior fiscal year 
average borrowing rates under the company s debt facilities decreased to in the current fiscal year from in the prior fiscal year 
the increase in average borrowings  net of invested cash  was primarily a result of additional merchandise inventories on hand during the current fiscal year compared to the prior fiscal year 
the decrease in average borrowing rates resulted from lower percentages of fixed rate debt outstanding to total debt outstanding in the current fiscal year compared to the prior fiscal year  as well as lower market interest rates on variable rate debt 
income tax expense of million in the fiscal year ended september  reflects an effective tax rate of  versus in the prior fiscal year 
the company has been able to lower its effective tax rate during the current fiscal year by implementing tax planning strategies 
net income of million for the fiscal year ended september  reflects an increase of from million in the prior fiscal year 
diluted earnings per share of in the fiscal year ended september  reflects a increase as compared to per share in the prior fiscal year 
special items and the loss on early retirement of debt had the effect of decreasing net income by million and reducing diluted earnings per share by for the fiscal year ended september  special items had the effect of decreasing net income by million and reducing diluted earnings per share by for the fiscal year ended september  the growth in earnings per share was smaller than the growth in net income for the fiscal year ended september  due to the issuance of company common stock in connection with the acquisitions described in note to the company s consolidated financial statements and in connection with the exercise of stock options 
segment information pharmaceutical distribution segment pharmaceutical distribution operating revenue of billion for the fiscal year ended september  reflects an increase of from billion in the prior fiscal year 
the company s recent acquisitions contributed less than of the segment s operating revenue growth for the fiscal year ended september  during the fiscal year ended september   of operating revenue was from sales to institutional customers and was from retail customers  this compares to a customer mix in the prior fiscal year of institutional and retail 
in comparison with the prior year results  sales to institutional customers increased primarily due to i the previously mentioned conversion of bulk delivery and other direct business with the company s primary bulk delivery customer to business serviced through the company s various warehouses  which contributed of the total operating revenue growth  ii above market rate growth of the absg specialty pharmaceutical business  and iii higher revenues from customers engaged in the mail order sale of pharmaceuticals 
sales to retail customers increased by in comparison to the prior fiscal year 
the growth rate of sales to retail customers has declined during fiscal compared to the fiscal growth primarily due to lower growth trends in the retail market and the below market growth of certain of the company s large regional chain customers 
additionally  retail sales in the second half of fiscal were adversely impacted by the loss of a large customer 
this segment s growth largely reflects us pharmaceutical industry conditions  including increases in prescription drug utilization and higher pharmaceutical prices offset  in part  by the increased use of lower priced generics 
the segment s growth has also been impacted by industry competition and changes in customer mix 
industry growth rates  as estimated by industry data firm ims healthcare  inc  are expected to be between and over the next four years 
future operating revenue growth will continue to be driven by industry growth trends  competition within the industry and customer consolidation 
pharmaceutical distribution gross profit of  million in the fiscal year ended september  reflects an increase of from  million in the prior fiscal year 
as a percentage of operating revenue  gross profit in the fiscal year ended september  was  as compared to in the prior fiscal year 
the slight decline in gross profit as a percentage of operating revenue was the net result of the negative impact of a change in customer mix to a higher percentage of large institutional  mail order and chain accounts  and the continuing competitive pricing environment  offset primarily by the positive aggregate impact of recently acquired companies  which amounted to basis points in the fiscal year ended september  downward pressures on sell side gross profit margin are expected to continue and there can be no assurance that the inclusion of additional businesses that generate higher margins or that increases in the buy side component of the gross margin  including increases derived from manufacturer price increases  negotiated deals and secondary market opportunities  will be available in the future to fully or partially offset the anticipated decline of the sell side margin 
the company expects that buy side opportunities may decrease in the future as pharmaceutical manufacturers increasingly seek to control the supply channel through product allocations that limit the inventory the company can purchase and through the imposition of inventory management and other agreements that prohibit or severely restrict the company s right to purchase inventory from secondary source suppliers 
although the company seeks in any such agreements to obtain appropriate compensation from pharmaceutical manufacturers for foregoing buy side opportunities  there can be no assurance that the agreements will function as intended and replace any or all lost profit opportunities 
the company s cost of goods sold includes a last in  first out lifo provision that is affected by changes in inventory quantities  product mix  and manufacturer pricing practices  which may be impacted by market and other external influences 
pharmaceutical distribution operating expenses of million in the fiscal year ended september  reflects an increase of from million in the prior fiscal year 
as a percentage of operating revenue  operating expenses in the fiscal year ended september  were  as compared to in the prior fiscal year 
the decrease in the expense percentage reflects the changing customer mix described above  efficiencies of scale  the elimination of redundant costs through the merger integration process  the continued emphasis on productivity throughout the company s distribution network and a reduction of bad debt expense  offset  in part  by higher expense ratios associated with the company s recent acquisitions 
pharmaceutical distribution operating income of million in the fiscal year ended september  reflects an increase of from million in the prior fiscal year 
as a percentage of operating revenue  operating income in the fiscal year ended september  was  as compared to in the prior fiscal year 
the improvement over the prior year percentage was due to a reduction in the operating expense ratio in excess of the decline in gross margin  which was partially the result of the company s ability to capture synergy cost savings from the merger 
while management historically has been able to lower expense ratios and expects to continue to do so  there can be no assurance that reductions will occur in the future  or that expense ratio reductions will exceed possible declines in gross margins 
additionally  there can be no assurance that merger integration efforts will proceed as planned or result in the desired cost savings 
pharmerica segment pharmerica s operating revenue increased for the fiscal year ended september  to  million compared to  million in the prior fiscal year 
this increase is principally attributable to the growth in pharmerica s workers compensation business  which has grown at a faster rate than its long term care business 
during the second half of fiscal  the growth rate of the workers compensation business began to slow down  partially due to the loss of a significant customer 
the slow down in the workers compensation business is expected to continue in fiscal and as a result  the operating revenue growth rate in fiscal for the pharmerica segment is expected to be in the mid single digits 
the future operating revenue growth rate will be impacted by competitive pressures  changes in the regulatory environment and the pharmaceutical inflation rate 
pharmerica s gross profit of million for the fiscal year ended september  increased from gross profit of million in the prior fiscal year 
pharmerica s gross profit margin declined slightly to for the fiscal year ended september  from in the prior fiscal year 
this decrease is primarily the result of a change in the sales mix  with a greater proportion of pharmerica s current year revenues coming from its workers compensation business  which has lower gross profit margins and lower operating expenses than its long term care business 
in addition  industry competitive pressures continue to adversely affect gross profit margins 
pharmerica s operating expenses of million for the fiscal year ended september  increased from million in the prior fiscal year 
as a percentage of operating revenue  operating expenses were reduced to in the fiscal year ended september  from in the prior fiscal year 
the percentage reduction was primarily due to the continued improvements in operating practices  the aforementioned shift in customer mix towards the workers compensation business and a reduction in bad debt expense 
pharmerica s operating income of million for the fiscal year ended september  increased by from million in the prior fiscal year 
as a percentage of operating revenue  operating income in the fiscal year ended september  was  as compared to in the prior fiscal year 
the improvement was due to the aforementioned reduction in the operating expense ratio  which was greater than the reduction in gross profit margin 
while management historically has been able to lower expense ratios and expects to continue to do so  there can be no assurance that reductions will occur in the future  or that expense ratio reductions will exceed possible further declines in gross margins

however  revenue from bulk deliveries has a positive impact to the company s cash flows due to favorable timing between the customer payments to us and the payments by us to our suppliers 
gross profit of  million in the fiscal year ended september  reflects an increase of from million in the prior fiscal year on a historical basis and an increase of from  million in the prior fiscal year on a pro forma combined basis 
as a percentage of operating revenue  gross profit in the fiscal year ended september  was  as compared to prior year percentages of on a historical basis and on a pro forma combined basis

pharmerica  due to the nature of its prescription fulfillment business  has significantly higher gross margins and operating expense ratios than the company s pharmaceutical distribution segment 
the decrease in gross profit percentage in comparison with the prior fiscal year pro forma combined percentage reflects declines in both the pharmaceutical distribution and pharmerica segments due to changes in customer mix and competitive selling price pressures

during the fiscal year ended september   of operating revenue was from sales to institutional customers and was from retail customers  this compares to a customer mix in the prior fiscal year of institutional and retail on a historical basis and institutional and retail on a pro forma combined basis 
in comparison with prior fiscal year pro forma combined results  sales to institutional customers increased by primarily due to higher revenues from mail order facilities  absg s specialty pharmaceutical business and alternate site facilities 
sales to retail customers increased over the prior fiscal year on a pro forma combined basis  principally due to higher revenues from regional drug store chains  including the pharmacy departments of supermarkets 
this segment s growth largely reflects national industry economic conditions  including increases in prescription drug usage and higher pharmaceutical prices

pharmerica segment the pharmerica segment was acquired in connection with the merger and the historical amounts for the fiscal year ended september  are comprised of only one month of pharmerica s operating results 
accordingly  the discussion below focuses all comparisons with the prior year on a pro forma combined basis 
pharmerica s operating revenue increased for the fiscal year ended september  to billion compared to billion in the prior fiscal year 
this increase is principally attributable to growth in pharmerica s workers compensation business  which has grown at a faster rate than its long term care business 
pharmerica s gross profit of million for the fiscal year ended september  increased from gross profit of million in the prior fiscal year 
pharmerica s gross profit margin declined to for the fiscal year ended september  from in the prior fiscal year

critical accounting policies critical accounting policies are those accounting policies that can have a significant impact on the company s financial position and results of operations that require the use of complex and subjective estimates based upon past experience and management s judgment 
because of the uncertainty inherent in such estimates  actual results may differ from these estimates 
below are those policies applied in preparing the company s financial statements that management believes are the most dependent on the application of estimates and assumptions 
for additional accounting policies  see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
allowance for doubtful accounts trade receivables are primarily comprised of amounts owed to the company through its pharmaceutical service activities and are presented net of an allowance for doubtful accounts 
in determining the appropriate allowance  the company considers a combination of factors  such as industry trends  its customers financial strength and credit standing  and payment and default history 
the calculation of the required allowance requires a substantial amount of judgment as to the impact of these and other factors on the ultimate realization of its trade receivables 
merchandise inventories inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market 
cost for approximately and of the company s inventories at september  and  respectively  is determined using the last in  first out lifo method 
if the company had used the first in  first out fifo method of inventory valuation  which approximates current replacement cost  inventories would have been approximately million and million higher than the amounts reported at september  and  respectively 
goodwill and intangible assets the company adopted financial accounting standards board fasb sfas no 
goodwill and other intangible assets as of october  under sfas no 
 goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives are not amortized  rather  they are tested for impairment on at least an annual basis 
accordingly  the company ceased amortization of all goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives as of october  intangible assets with finite lives  primarily customer lists  non compete agreements and software technology  will continue to be amortized over their useful lives 
sfas no 
requires a two step impairment test for goodwill 
the first step is to compare the carrying amount of the reporting unit s assets to the fair value of the reporting unit 
if the fair value exceeds the carrying value  no further work is required and no impairment loss is recognized 
if the carrying amount exceeds the fair value then the second step is required to be completed  which involves allocating the fair value of the reporting unit to each asset and liability  with the excess being implied goodwill 
an impairment loss occurs if the amount of the recorded goodwill exceeds the implied goodwill 
the determination of the fair value of the company s reporting units is based  among other things  on estimates of future operating performance of the reporting unit being valued 
the company is required to complete an impairment test for goodwill and record any resulting impairment losses annually 
changes in market conditions  among other factors  may have an impact on these estimates 
the company completed its required annual impairment tests in the fourth quarters of fiscal and and determined that there was no impairment 
stock options the company has the choice to account for stock options using either accounting principles board opinion no 
apb or sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation 
the company has elected to use the accounting method under apb and the related interpretations to account for its stock options 
under apb  generally  when the exercise price of the company s stock options equals the market price of the underlying stock on the date of grant  no compensation expense is recognized 
had the company elected to use sfas no 
to account for its stock options under the fair value method  it would have been required to record compensation expense and as a result  diluted earnings per share for the fiscal years ended september   and would have been lower by  and  respectively
