ens fiscal year ended september  as compared to fiscal year ended september  services revenue services revenue decreased from  for the fiscal year ended september  to  for the fiscal year ended september  or approximately  primarily reflecting ens reduced volumes of paper processing on all of its major contracts due primarily to the shift of providers from submitting paper claims to electronic submissions  and without substantial effect from the loss of lifeguard as a customer 
shifting claims from paper to e commerce reduces overall revenue as the revenue per claim for e commerce is less than paper  however  the shift from paper claims increases efficiency for both payers and providers and  for ens  generates significantly higher gross profit per claim 
while two large customers reduced the amount of paper claims submitted  ens has increased its number of direct e commerce connections with payers and increased its number of direct provider connections by since september  we expect to replace the lifeguard revenue stream  which will end in fiscal  with growth from existing customers and new customers 
cost of services cost of services decreased from  in the fiscal year ended september  to  in the fiscal year ended september  or approximately  as a result of cost containment measures  increased electronic claim processing and reduced ads paper claims operations

we believe ens will continue to generate positive income from operations through interest expense interest expense  exclusive of interest payable to nwh  decreased from  in the fiscal year ended september  to  or approximately in the fiscal year ended september   primarily due to a decrease in the average amount of debt outstanding at ens during the period

liquidity and capital resources as of october   we had approximately million in cash and marketable securities  as well as our interest in ens and other investments 
our assets have been used for  and are currently reserved to fund acquisitions of healthcare e commerce investments  telecommunications assets  media businesses  development of our other businesses and development and acquisition of new technologies and businesses in other areas 
such amount  with earnings thereon including proceeds from sale of bellsouth common stock and related derivatives  is expected to be sufficient to implement this business plan through october  or for a shorter period if we determine to invest a substantial portion of our assets in major acquisitions  equity investments or stock repurchases 
we actively seek to acquire or invest in healthcare e commerce  other businesses in telecommunications  media or in unrelated areas 
we may also dispose of assets from time to time 
we have no specific arrangements with respect to any such acquisitions  dispositions or investments at the present time 
there can be no assurance that any such acquisitions  dispositions or investments will be made 
our board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to of our common stock because we believe  under current market conditions  the repurchase is a favorable investment 
the repurchased shares will also be available for issuance upon exercise of outstanding options 
as of october   we repurchased  shares for an aggregate cost of during the fiscal year ended october   we settled part of our option liabilities on bellsouth common stock 
while we continue to review our holdings of bellsouth common stock and from time to time have sold and purchased shares and options of these holdings  we have not yet determined whether we will sell or hedge our remaining bellsouth securities in the near future or how we will invest the proceeds of any such transaction 
in the fiscal year ended october   interest receivable by the company from ens increased by  to  at october   for a total outstanding loan to the company of  including accrued interest 
the outstanding balance under this loan agreement including interest has been eliminated from the consolidated financial statements 
during fiscal year  the company spent  on fixed assets  including  for internally developed software and  for computer equipment required for increased claims processing and the development of xpedite  our provider targeting and tracking system 
we purchased additional shares of ens from former officers in december for  cash and a  contingent note  and in june for  in cash 
we currently own of the diluted common stock of ens 
operating overhead costs of ens have decreased as a result of cost cutting measures and production efficiencies gained 
we anticipate increased revenues in the near future 
the combination of these factors going forward will improve overall profitability  allowing ens to sustain itself on cash flows from its operations without further investment from nwh 
ens liquidity and capital resources ens losses have been financed principally through equity investments by the company and loans from the company  which loans aggregated  through september  including accrued interest of 
ens plans additional investment in its technology enhancements  including further development and implementation of xpedite  its full contact management operating system  its internet claims processing system  web enrollment  a remote internet based technology to enroll customers at time of sale  ect  an internet based full claims tracking system  additional payer connectivity  and enhancements to broaden the transactions processing infrastructure 
although we believe that ens may need to obtain additional financing to accelerate its strategic business plan based upon existing contracts with physicians  other providers  payers and management companies and current expense levels  management expects ens to continue profitable operations  established in the third quarter of fiscal  through fiscal inflation in the opinion of management  inflation has not had a material effect on the operations of the company 
recently issued accounting pronouncements in october   the financial accounting standards board issued sfas no 
accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
this statement defines the accounting for long lived assets to be held and used  assets held for sale and assets to be disposed of by other than sale and is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  the company does not expect the adoption of this pronouncement to have a material effect on the earnings or financial position of the company 
in june  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities 
the standard requires companies to recognize costs associated with exit or disposal activities when they are incurred rather than at the date of a commitment to an exit or disposal plan 
previous accounting guidance was provided by eitf issue no

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the primary objective of our investment activities  other than activities relating to ens and potential acquisitions  is to preserve principal and maintain liquidity  while at the same time maximizing the yield we receive from our investment portfolio 
we also utilize options and short sales to protect our position in bellsouth common stock  preserve its tax basis and reduce equity price risk 
changes in prevailing interest rates and stock price of bellsouth will cause the yield on our investments and the costs of shorts and options to fluctuate 
to minimize this risk  we maintain our portfolio of cash equivalents  short term investments and marketable securities other than bellsouth common stock and related shorts and options in commercial paper  non government debt securities  money market funds  highly liquid us treasury notes and federal agency notes and other low risk investments 
we view these high grade securities within our portfolio as having similar market risk characteristics 
the weighted average interest rate of the portfolio was at october  currently almost all our revenues and expenses are denominated in us dollars and  as a result  we have experienced no significant foreign exchange gains and losses to date 
we conduct only limited transactions in foreign currencies  and we do not anticipate that foreign exchange gains or losses will be significant in the foreseeable future 
we have not engaged in foreign currency hedging activities to date
