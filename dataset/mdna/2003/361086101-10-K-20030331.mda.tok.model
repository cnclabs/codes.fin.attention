critical accounting policies the preparation of the company s financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
significant policies are presented in the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
critical accounting policies are those that are most important to the portrayal to our financial position and results of operations 
these policies require management s most difficult  subjective or complex judgments  often employing the use of estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
our most critical accounting policies pertain to revenue recognition  the impairment of excess of cost over fair value of net assets of acquired businesses and income taxes 
the company s information technology services segment includes revenue recognized under multiple element arrangements with its customers  which requires the use of significant judgments and estimates by management 
the accounting policies for revenue recognition in the information technology services segment comply with aicpa statement of position no 
software revenue recognition sop no 

sop no 
requires revenue to be recognized only after software is delivered  all significant obligations of the company are fulfilled  and all significant uncertainties regarding customer acceptance have expired 
sop no 
also requires the unbundling of multiple elements and the allocation of pricing to each element based upon vendor specific objective evidence of fair value 
in addition  the information technology services segment s revenues under long term service contracts are accounted for using a proportional performance method or on a straight line basis in accordance with the securities and exchange commission s staff accounting bulletin no 
revenue recognition in financial statements 
effective january   the company adopted sfas no 
 which eliminates the amortization for goodwill excess of cost over fair value of net assets of acquired businesses and other intangible assets with indefinite lives 
under sfas no 
 intangible assets with lives restricted by contractual  legal  or other means will continue to be amortized over their useful lives 
as of december   the company had no intangible assets subject to amortization under sfas no 
goodwill and other intangible assets not subject to amortization are tested for impairment annually or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the assets might be impaired 
sfas no 
requires a two step process for testing impairment 
first  the fair value of each reporting unit is compared to its carrying value to determine whether an indication of impairment exists 
if an impairment is indicated  then second  the implied fair value of the reporting unit s goodwill is determined by allocating the unit s fair value to its assets and liabilities including any unrecognized intangible assets as if the reporting unit had been acquired in a business combination 
the amount of impairment for goodwill and other intangible assets is measured as the excess of its carrying value over its implied fair value 
based on valuations and analysis performed by independent valuation consultants and the company in the first quarter of  the company determined that the carrying value of its goodwill exceeded implied fair value  and therefore  the company recorded a non cash charge  after income taxes  of million as the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle 
no impairment charge was appropriate under the previous goodwill impairment standard sfas no 
 which was based on undiscounted cash flows 
based on valuations and analysis performed by the company at december   no additional impairment charge was required 
future evaluations of the fair value of goodwill and other intangible assets are dependent on many factors  several of which are out of the company s control  including the demand for services provided 
to the extent that such factors or conditions change  it is possible that future impairments could occur  which could have a material effect on the results of operations of the company 
at december   the company had a significant amount of net deferred tax assets  which consisted principally of net operating loss and alternative minimum tax credit carryforwards and temporary differences resulting from differences in the tax and book basis of certain assets and liabilities 
the net operating loss carryforwards expire  if unused  in varying amounts and dates from to and the alternative minimum tax credit carryforwards have no expiration date see note to the company s consolidated financial statements 
under sfas no 
 the company periodically evaluates the realizability of its deferred tax assets from future operations 
such evaluations must consider various factors  including estimates of future taxable income growth and the expiration periods of net operating loss carryforwards  and conclude that it is more likely than not that the company will realize the benefit of its net deferred tax assets 
additionally  the utilization of net operating loss carryforwards could be subject to limitation in the event of a change in ownership  as defined in the tax laws 
to the extent that factors or conditions change  it is possible that a valuation allowance against the net deferred tax asset might be required  which could have a material effect on the results of operations of the company
