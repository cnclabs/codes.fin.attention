item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
the following discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are based upon the company s consolidated financial statements and should be read in conjunction with these statements and notes thereto 
critical accounting policies the consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states  which require the company to make estimates and assumptions that may affect the reported financial condition and results of operations should actual results differ 
the company bases its estimates and assumptions on the best available information and believes them to be reasonable for the circumstances 
the company believes that of its significant accounting policies  the following may involve a higher degree of judgement and complexity 
see also note of the consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition 
the company principally records revenue upon the purchase of merchandise by customers 
revenue is not recorded on the purchase of stored value cards and gift certificates by customers 
a current liability is recorded upon purchase and revenue is recognized when the card is redeemed for merchandise 
revenue is recorded net of sales returns 
a sales returns reserve is provided on gross sales for projected merchandise returns based on historical average return percentages 
revenue is not recorded on the sell off of end of season  overstock and irregular merchandise to off price retailers 
these sell offs are typically sold below cost and the proceeds are reflected in cost of sales 
asset impairment 
the company is required to test for asset impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset might not be recoverable 
the company applies sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  in order to determine whether or not an asset is impaired 
management evaluates the ongoing value of assets associated with retail stores that have been open longer than one year 
when undiscounted cash flows estimated to be generated by those assets are less than the carrying value of those assets  impairment losses are recorded 
when events such as these occur  the impaired assets are adjusted to estimated fair value and an impairment loss is recorded in selling  general and administrative expenses 
should actual results or market conditions differ from those anticipated  additional losses may be recorded 
goodwill 
the company adopted sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  on february   the beginning of fiscal in accordance with sfas no 
 management evaluates goodwill quarterly for impairment by comparing the fair value of the reporting unit to the book value 
the book value of goodwill has been assigned to the company s two reporting units  american eagle and bluenotes 
approximately million and million in goodwill was assigned to american eagle and bluenotes  respectively 
the fair value of the company s reporting units is estimated using discounted cash flow methodologies and market comparable information 
based on the analysis  if the implied fair value of each reporting unit exceeds the book value of the goodwill  no impairment loss is recognized 
in the fourth quarter of fiscal  the company performed the required annual impairment test and determined that no goodwill impairment existed 
the company s prospective determination will depend on the ongoing operations and performance of its defined reportable units 
bluenotes future earnings growth depends  in part  upon the company s ability to successfully reposition the brand 
the company has made management changes in the bluenotes division and is in the process of implementing new merchandising and operating strategies 
however  there can be no assurance that the merchandising and operating strategies implemented by the company s new management team will result in improved results of operations 
additionally  management s assumptions about discount rates  inflation rates and other internal and external economic conditions  such as the expected growth rate and terminal value of its reportable units  requires significant judgement based on fluctuating rates  anticipated future revenues  and the prospective financial markets 
inventory 
merchandise inventory is valued at the lower of average cost or market  utilizing the retail method 
average cost includes merchandise design and sourcing costs and related expenses 
the company reviews its inventory levels in order to identify slow moving merchandise and generally uses markdowns to clear merchandise 
if inventory exceeds customer demand for reasons of style  seasonal adaptation  changes in customer preference  lack of consumer acceptance of fashion items  competition  or if it is determined that the inventory in stock will not sell at its currently ticketed price  additional markdowns may be necessary 
these markdowns have an adverse impact on earnings  which may or may not be material  depending on the extent and amount of inventory affected 
the company also estimates a shrinkage reserve for the period between the last physical count and the balance sheet date 
the estimate for the shrinkage reserve can be affected by changes in merchandise mix and changes in actual shrinkage trends 
income taxes 
the company calculates income taxes in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes  which requires the use of the asset and liability method 
under this method  deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized based on the difference between the consolidated financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using the tax rates in effect in the years when those temporary differences are expected to reverse 
no valuation allowance has been provided for the deferred tax assets 
the company anticipates that future taxable income will be able to recover the full amount of the net deferred tax assets  including the portion attributed to the foreign tax loss carryforward 
additionally  a portion of the deferred tax asset resulted from a capital loss carryforward 
the use of the capital loss carryforward is dependent on the company s ability to generate capital gains 
management believes that the company will generate sufficient capital gains prior to the expiration of the capital loss

seasonality historically  our operations have been seasonal  with a significant amount of net sales and net income occurring in the fourth fiscal quarter  reflecting increased demand during the year end holiday selling season and  to a lesser extent  the third quarter  reflecting increased demand during the back to school selling season 
during fiscal  these periods accounted for approximately of our sales 
as a result of this seasonality  any factors negatively affecting us during the third and fourth fiscal quarters of any year  including adverse weather or unfavorable economic conditions  could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations for the entire year 
our quarterly results of operations also may fluctuate based upon such factors as the timing of certain holiday seasons  the number and timing of new store openings  the amount of net sales contributed by new and existing stores  the timing and level of markdowns  store closings  refurbishments and relocations  competitive factors  weather and general economic conditions 
income taxes as of february   we had deferred tax assets of million associated with foreign tax loss carryforwards 
we anticipate that future taxable income in canada will be able to utilize the full amount of the deferred tax assets 
assuming a effective tax rate  we will need to recognize pretax net income of approximately million in future periods to recover existing deferred tax amounts 
see note of the consolidated financial statements 
impact of inflation deflation we do not believe that inflation has had a significant effect on our net sales or our profitability 
substantial increases in cost  however  could have a significant impact on our business and the industry in the future 
additionally  while deflation could positively impact our merchandise costs  it could have an adverse effect on our average unit retail price  resulting in lower sales and profitability 
safe harbor statement and risk factors this report contains various forward looking statements within the meaning of section a of the securities act of  as amended  and section e of the securities exchange act of  as amended  which represent our expectations or beliefs concerning future events  including the following the planned opening of roughly american eagle stores in the united states and canada in fiscal  the selection of approximately to stores in the united states for remodeling  the sufficiency of existing cash and investment balances  cash flows and line of credit facilities to meet fiscal cash requirements  and the possibility of growth through acquisitions and or internally developing new brands 
we caution that these statements are further qualified by factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from those in the forward looking statements  including without limitation  the following our ability to anticipate and respond to changing consumer preferences and fashion trends in a timely manner the company s future success depends  in part  upon its ability to anticipate and respond to fashion trends in a timely manner 
the specialty retail apparel business fluctuates according to changes in the economy and customer preferences  dictated by fashion and season 
these fluctuations especially affect the inventory owned by apparel retailers  since merchandise typically must be ordered well in advance of the selling season 
while we endeavor to test many merchandise items before ordering large quantities  we are still susceptible to changing fashion trends and fluctuations in customer demands 
in addition  the cyclical nature of the retail business requires that we carry a significant amount of inventory  especially prior to peak selling seasons  when we build up our inventory levels 
we enter into agreements for the manufacture and purchase of our private label apparel well in advance of the applicable selling season 
as a result  we are vulnerable to changes in consumer demand  pricing shifts  and the timing and selection of merchandise purchases 
changes in fashion trends  if unsuccessfully identified  forecasted or responded to by the company  could  among other things  lead to lower sales  excess inventories and higher markdowns  which in turn could have a material adverse effect on the company s results of operations and financial condition 
the effect of competitive pressures from other retailers and other business factors the specialty retail industry is highly competitive 
the company competes primarily on the basis of quality  fashion  service  selection and price 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to successfully compete in the future 
the success of the company s operations also depends to a significant extent upon a number of factors relating to discretionary consumer spending  including economic conditions affecting disposable consumer income such as employment  consumer debt  interest rates  and consumer confidence 
there can be no assurance that consumer spending will not be negatively affected by general or local economic conditions  thereby adversely impacting the company s continued growth and results of operations 
our ability to expand through new store growth the company s continued growth and success will depend in part on its ability to open and operate new stores on a timely and profitable basis 
during fiscal  the company plans to open roughly new american eagle stores in the united states and canada 
accomplishing the company s new store expansion goals will depend upon a number of factors  including the ability to obtain suitable sites for new stores at acceptable costs  the hiring and training of qualified personnel  particularly at the store management level  the integration of new stores into existing operations  the expansion of the company s buying and inventory capabilities and the availability of capital 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to achieve its store expansion goals  manage its growth effectively  successfully integrate the planned new stores into the company s operations or operate its new stores profitably 
our ability to successfully reposition the bluenotes brand the company s future earnings depend  in part  upon its ability to successfully reposition the bluenotes brand 
the bluenotes business incurred operating losses during fiscal due to a combination of factors  including i an abrupt change to the target customer and merchandising strategy  ii adjusting the merchandise fit to a smaller size  iii a merchandise product assortment that was skewed too high in price points and not consistent with the brand strategy  iv a marketing approach that was too narrow in scope  v a lack of sourcing efficiencies and vi increased competitive pressure 
in addition  adverse economic conditions in general during the year had a negative impact on the operations of many canadian retailers  including those of bluenotes 
the company has made management changes in the bluenotes division and is in the process of implementing new merchandising and operating strategies 
however  there can be no assurance that the merchandising and operating strategies implemented by the company s new management team will result in improved results of operations 
if the company is not successful in repositioning the bluenotes brand  the carrying value of certain assets assigned to the reporting unit  including but not limited to inventory  property  plant and equipment  and goodwill  including the related deferred tax asset  may exceed the fair value of those assets and result in an impairment loss 
additionally  a portion of the company s deferred tax asset is attributed to a foreign tax loss carryforward 
if bluenotes does not generate future taxable income sufficient to recover the full amount of the respective deferred tax asset  we may be required to record additional tax provisions  which would have an adverse effect on the company s future earnings 
the interruption of the flow of merchandise from key vendors the company purchases merchandise from domestic and foreign suppliers 
during fiscal  the majority of the company s merchandise was purchased from foreign suppliers 
since we rely on a small number of overseas sources for a significant portion of our purchases  any event causing the disruption of imports including the insolvency of a significant supplier  the occurrence of a dock strike  the imposition of additional import restrictions  such as increased duties  tariffs or quotas  or political or economic disruptions could have an adverse effect on our operations 
we do not maintain any long term or exclusive commitments or arrangements to purchase from any single supplier 
other risk factors additionally  factors such as our ability to successfully acquire and integrate other businesses  an interruption of key business systems  any disaster or casualty resulting in the interruption of service from our distribution centers  changes in weather patterns  the change in currency  exchange rates and interest rates and international and domestic acts of terror could affect our financial performance 
the impact of the aforementioned factors  some of which are beyond our control  may cause our actual results to differ materially from expected results in these statements and other forward looking statements we may make from time to time
