item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations you should read this discussion together with our consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes and selected financial data included elsewhere in this form k 
overview we are the largest non urban provider of general hospital healthcare services in the united states in terms of number of facilities and the second largest in terms of revenues 
as of december   we owned  leased or operated hospitals  geographically diversified across states  with an aggregate of  licensed beds 
in over of our markets  we are the sole provider of general hospital healthcare services 
in all but one of our other markets  we are one of two providers of general hospital healthcare services 
for the fiscal year ended december   we generated billion in net operating revenues and million in ebitda 
we achieved revenue growth of in and in we also achieved growth in ebitda of in and in ebitda consists of income before extraordinary items  interest  income taxes  depreciation and amortization  amortization of goodwill  and minority interest in earnings 
ebitda should not be considered a measure of financial performance under generally accepted accounting principles 
items excluded from ebitda are significant components in understanding and assessing financial performance 
ebitda is a key measure used by management to evaluate our operations and provide useful information to investors 
ebitda should not be considered in isolation or as alternatives to net income  cash flows generated by operations  investing or financing activities  or other financial statement data presented in the consolidated financial statements as indicators of financial performance or liquidity 
because ebitda is not a measurement determined in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and is thus susceptible to varying calculations  ebitda as presented may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other companies 
we believe that income from operations is the financial measure calculated and presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles that is most directly comparable to ebitda as defined 
the following table reconciles ebitda  as defined  with our income from operations as derived directly from our audited financial statements for the years ended december   and income from operations    depreciation and amortization    amortization of goodwill   minority interest in earnings  ebitda    acquisitions during  we acquired  through six purchase transactions  most of the assets  including working capital  of six hospitals 
the consideration for the six hospitals totaled approximately million 
this consideration consisted of million in cash  and assumed liabilities of approximately million 
since december   we have acquired through a single purchase transaction  most of the assets  including working capital  of seven hospitals 
the consideration for these seven hospitals totaled approximately million 
this consideration consisted of million in cash and assumed liabilities of approximately million 
during  we acquired  through five purchase transactions  most of the assets  including working capital  of five hospitals 
the consideration for the five hospitals totaled approximately million 
this consideration consisted of million in cash  which we borrowed under our acquisition loan facilities  and assumed liabilities of approximately million 
during  we acquired  through five purchases and two capital lease transactions  most of the assets  including working capital  of seven hospitals 
these acquisitions include the purchase of assets of a hospital which we were managing under an operating agreement 
we had purchased the working capital accounts of that hospital in the consideration for the seven hospitals totaled approximately million 
this consideration consisted of million in cash  which we borrowed under our acquisition loan facilities  and assumed liabilities of million 
we prepaid the lease obligation relating to each lease transaction 
we included the prepayment as part of the cash consideration 
goodwill  net of accumulated amortization  from the acquisition of our predecessor company in was million and from subsequent hospital acquisitions was million as of december  beginning in july  we adopted the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
which established new guidelines for accounting for goodwill and other intangible assets 
in accordance with sfas no 
 goodwill associated with acquisitions consummated after june   is not amortized 
based on management s assessment of the goodwill s estimated useful life  we generally amortized our goodwill over to years for acquisitions consummated prior to june we implemented the remaining provisions of sfas no 
on january  since adoption  existing goodwill is no longer amortized but instead is assessed for impairment at least annually 
impairments to the carrying amount of such goodwill would result in a non cash charge which would reduce operating income 
the resulting reduction in goodwill amortization expense for  using weighted average shares outstanding excluding the assumed conversion of convertible notes  is approximately per share  after tax 
no impairment write down resulted from the adoption of sfas no 
goodwill represented of our shareholders equity as of december  in january  we completed the purchase of seven hospitals 
in addition  we anticipate purchasing two to three more hospitals in in future years  we intend to acquire  on a selective basis  two to four hospitals in our target markets annually 
because of the financial impact of acquisitions  it is difficult to make meaningful comparisons between our financial statements for the periods presented 
because ebitda margins at hospitals we acquire are  at the time of acquisition  lower than those of our existing hospitals  acquisitions can negatively affect our ebitda margins on a consolidated basis 
sources of revenue net operating revenues include amounts estimated by management to be reimbursable by medicare and medicaid under prospective payment systems and provisions of cost reimbursement and other payment methods 
approximately of net operating revenues for the year ended december   for the year ended december   and for the year ended december   are related to services rendered to patients covered by the medicare and medicaid programs 
included in the amounts received from medicare  approximately of net operating revenues for  for  and for  relates to medicare outlier payments  which compensate hospitals for treating especially complicated cases 
in addition  we are reimbursed by non governmental payors using a variety of payment methodologies 
amounts we receive for treatment of patients covered by these programs are generally less than the standard billing rates 
we account for the differences between the estimated program reimbursement rates and the standard billing rates as contractual adjustments  which we deduct from gross revenues to arrive at net operating revenues 
final settlements under some of these programs are subject to adjustment based on administrative review and audit by third parties 
we account for adjustments to previous program reimbursement estimates as contractual adjustments and report them in the periods that such adjustments become known 
adjustments related to final settlements or appeals that affected revenue were insignificant in each of the years ended december   and we expect our net revenues received from the medicare program to increase due to the general aging of the population and the restoration of some payments under the balanced budget refinement act of and benefit and improvement protection act of the payment rates under the medicare program for inpatients are based on a prospective payment system  based upon the diagnosis of a patient 
while these rates are indexed annually for inflation  the increases have historically been less than actual inflation 
reductions in the rate of increase in medicare reimbursement may have an adverse impact on our net operating revenue growth 
effective april   centers for medicare and medicaid services implemented changes to the medicare outpatient prospective payment system 
although these changes have resulted in reductions to medicare outpatient payments  these reductions  as well as changes to the medicare system caused by the benefit improvement and protection act of  should not materially effect our net operating revenue growth 
in addition  certain managed care programs  insurance companies  and employers are actively negotiating the amounts paid to hospitals as opposed to hospitals standard rates 
the trend toward increased enrollment in managed care may adversely affect our net operating revenue growth 
results of operations our hospitals offer a variety of services involving a broad range of inpatient and outpatient medical and surgical services 
these include orthopedics  cardiology  ob gyn  occupational medicine  diagnostic services  emergency services  rehabilitation treatment  home health  and skilled nursing 
the strongest demand for hospital services generally occurs during january through april and the weakest demand for these services occurs during the summer months 
accordingly  eliminating the effect of new acquisitions  our net operating revenues and earnings are generally highest during the first quarter and lowest during the third quarter 
the following tables summarize  for the periods indicated  selected operating data 
years ended december  expressed as a percentage of net operating revenues net operating revenues operating expenses ebitda depreciation and amortization amortization of goodwill income from operations interest  net minority interest in earnings income before extraordinary item and income taxes provision for income taxes income before extraordinary item years ended december  percentage change from prior period net operating revenues admissions adjusted admissions average length of stay ebitda same hospitals percentage change from prior period net operating revenues admissions adjusted admissions ebitda operating expenses include salaries and benefits  provision for bad debts  supplies  rent  and other operating expenses  and exclude the items that are excluded for purposes of determining ebitda as discussed in footnote below 
ebitda consists of income before extraordinary items  interest  income taxes  depreciation and amortization  amortization of goodwill and minority interest earnings 
ebitda should not be considered a measure of financial performance under generally accepted accounting principles 
items excluded from ebitda are significant components in understanding and assessing financial performance 
ebitda is a key measure used by management to evaluate our operations and provide useful information to investors 
ebitda should not be considered in isolation or as an alternative to net income  cash flows generated by operations  investing or financing activities  or other financial statement data presented in the consolidated financial statements as indicators of financial performance or liquidity 
because ebitda is not a measurement determined in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and is thus susceptible to varying calculations  ebitda as presented may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other companies 
adjusted admissions is a general measure of combined inpatient and outpatient volume 
we computed adjusted admissions by multiplying admissions by gross patient revenues and then dividing that number by gross inpatient revenues 
includes acquired hospitals to the extent we operated them during comparable periods in both years 
year ended december  compared to year ended december  net operating revenues increased by to billion in from billion in of the million increase in net operating revenues  the hospitals we acquired in and  prior to being included in same store revenues  contributed million and hospitals we owned throughout both periods contributed million or 
of this increase  approximately was attributable to volume increases and was attributed to increased rates and intensity of care from government programs  managed care and other payors 
inpatient admissions increased by 
adjusted admissions increased by 
average length of stay increased from days in to days at in on a same hospitals basis  inpatient admissions increased by and adjusted admissions increased by 
the increase in same hospitals inpatient admissions and adjusted admissions was due primarily to an increase in services offered  supported by physician relationship development efforts  and the addition of physicians through our focused recruitment program 
on a same hospitals basis  net inpatient revenues increased by and net outpatient operating revenues increased 
both inpatient and outpatient growth reflects increased volume as well as rate increases 
operating expenses  as a percentage of net operating revenues  increased from in  to in salaries and benefits  as a percentage of net operating revenues  increased from in to in primarily as a result of the three hospitals acquired in the fourth quarter of and the six hospitals acquired in having higher salaries and benefits as a percentage of net operating revenues  than our existing hospitals  for which savings have not yet been fully realized  offset by improvements at hospitals owned throughout both periods 
provision for bad debts  as a percentage of net revenues  decreased to in from in  primarily through better collections 
supplies  as a percentage of net operating revenues  remained unchanged in at reflecting an increase in supplies expense as a percentage of net operating revenues at recently acquired hospitals  offset by improvements at hospitals owned throughout both periods 
rent and other operating expenses  as a percentage of net operating revenues  increased from in to in  primarily due to an increase in rent expense of of net operating revenue  an increase in the use of contract labor of of net operating revenue and the increased cost of malpractice insurance of of net operating revenue 
these fluctuations  largely resulting from acquisitions having lower margins than our existing hospitals  led to ebitda margins decreasing from in to in on a same hospitals basis  operating expenses as a percentage of net operating revenues decreased from in to in and ebitda margin increased from in to in we achieved this improvement through efficiency and productivity gains in payroll expense and reductions in supplies expense  offset by increases in contract labor and malpractice expense 
depreciation and amortization increased by million from million in to million in the eleven hospitals acquired in and  prior to being included in same store results  accounted for million of the increase  replacement hospital construction  hospital renovations  purchases of equipment  and information system upgrades accounted for million of the increase and other deferred items  primarily the amortization of physician recruitment costs and purchased software  accounted for the remaining million of the increase 
amortization of goodwill decreased by million from million in to in this decrease is due to the adoption of sfas no 
on january  see critical accounting policies goodwill and other intangibles 
interest  net decreased by million from million in to million in the decrease in interest expense was primarily a result of a decrease in average interest rates of million and a savings of million due to a decrease in average outstanding borrowings 
identified activities leading to these results include interest savings of million from financings  including the october payoff of million of subordinated debt  concurrent with convertible debt and equity offerings  the july bank debt refinancing  million from declining libor rates  and million from the net effect of operating cash flows offset by capital expenditures 
interest expense increased by million as a result of the eleven hospitals acquired in and  and million in interest expense related to payments on interest rate swap contracts 
income before extraordinary item and income taxes for was million compared to million in  primarily as a result of the continuing execution of our operating strategy and increased volume at hospitals owned during both periods  elimination of goodwill amortization of million and a decrease in interest expense of million 
during the third quarter of  we refinanced our then existing billion credit agreement and repaid certain indebtedness 
in connection with repayment of that credit agreement  we recognized an extraordinary loss of million  net of tax benefit of million  on early extinguishment of debt as a result of writing off deferred financing costs associated with the refinanced credit agreement 
the provision for income taxes in was million compared to million in the decrease in the effective tax rate from in to in is primarily due to goodwill  for which the amortization of certain components was not deductible for tax purposes  and is no longer being amortized for financial reporting purposes in accordance with sfas no 
net income for was million as compared to million in year ended december  compared to year ended december  net operating revenues increased by to billion in from billion in of the million increase in net operating revenues  the hospitals we acquired in and  prior to being included in same store revenues  contributed million and hospitals we owned throughout both periods contributed million 
the million  or  increase from hospitals owned throughout both periods was attributable primarily to inpatient and outpatient volume increases  rate increases and an increase in government reimbursement 
these increases were offset by having one fewer day as compared to  as was a leap year 
inpatient admissions increased by 
adjusted admissions increased by 
average length of stay remained unchanged 
on a same hospitals basis  inpatient admissions increased by and adjusted admissions increased by 
the increase in same hospitals inpatient admissions and adjusted admissions was due primarily to an increase in services offered  physician relationship development efforts  and the addition of physicians through our focused recruitment program 
on a same hospitals basis  net inpatient revenues increased by and net outpatient operating revenues increased 
both inpatient and outpatient growth reflects increased volume as well as rate increases 
outpatient growth reflects the continued trend toward a preference for outpatient procedures  where appropriate  by patients  physicians  and payors 
operating expenses  as a percentage of net operating revenues  increased from in  to in salaries and benefits  as a percentage of net operating revenues  increased from in to in primarily as a result of the acquisitions in having higher salaries and benefits as a percentage of net operating revenues for which savings have not yet been realized  offset by improvements at hospitals owned throughout both periods 
provision for bad debts  as a percentage of net revenues increased to in from in supplies  as a percentage of net operating revenues  increased to in from in primarily as a result of additional purchasing for recent acquisitions  offset by improvements at hospitals owned throughout both periods 
rent and other operating expenses  as a percentage of net operating revenues  decreased from in to in as a result of increases in rent expense being offset by a reduction in other operating expenses 
these fluctuations have led to ebitda margins decreasing from in to in on a same hospitals basis  operating expenses as a percentage of net operating revenues decreased from in to in and ebitda margin increased from in to in these efficiency and productivity gains resulted from the achievement of target staffing ratios  physician recruiting efforts  and improved compliance with national purchasing contracts 
operating expenses improved as a percentage of net operating revenues in the key categories of salaries and benefits and supplies 
depreciation and amortization increased by million from million in to million in the twelve hospitals acquired  including one constructed  in and accounted for million of the increase  hospital renovations and purchases of equipment  information system upgrades  and the inclusion of a hospital previously held for divestiture accounted for million of the increase and other deferred items  primarily the amortization of physician recruitment costs  accounted for the remaining million of the increase 
amortization of goodwill increased by million from million in to million in this increase primarily related to the seven hospitals acquired in and one hospital acquired in prior to the adoption of provisions of sfas no 
 whereby goodwill for acquisitions occurring after june  is not amortized 
interest  net decreased by million from million in to million in the decrease in interest expense can be primarily attributed to both savings from a decrease in average interest rates of million and savings of million due to a decrease in average outstanding borrowings 
the twelve hospitals acquired  including one constructed  in and accounted for an interest expense increase of approximately million 
reduction of debt from repayments during and a full year of savings from repayments in resulted in savings of million  including savings of approximately million  offset by interest of million from the repayment of debt and issuance of convertible debt from our concurrent convertible debt and equity offerings in savings from a reduction in interest rates were approximately million 
income before extraordinary item and income taxes for was million compared to million in this improvement is primarily the result of revenue growth from both acquisitions and same store hospitals  management s ability to control expenses and a decrease of interest expense 
in october  we received the net proceeds from our concurrent equity and convertible debt offerings and used these proceeds to repay a portion of our long term debt 
in connection with the repayments  we recognized a million after tax extraordinary loss on the early extinguishment of debt related to the write off of deferred financing costs associated with the repayment of the million of subordinated debentures 
the provision for income taxes in was million compared to million in due to the non deductible nature of certain goodwill amortization  the resulting effective tax rate is in excess of the statutory rate 
net income for was million as compared to million in liquidity and capital resources compared to net cash provided by operating activities increased by million  from million during to million during this increase was due primarily to an increase in net income of million  an increase in the utilization of net operating loss carry forwards of million to offset the amount of taxes paid  an increase in amounts owed to third party payors of million  an increase in our medical malpractice liability of million and improvements made in the management of working capital 
the use of cash in investing activities increased million from million in to million in the increase was due primarily to an increase in cash used to purchase property and equipment of million during net cash provided by financing activities increased million from million in to million in in july   we completed a refinancing of our previous credit facility with a billion senior secured credit facility 
the facility consists of an million term loan that matures in as opposed to under the previous facility and a million revolving credit facility that matures in as opposed to under the previous facility 
the facility has a feature that allows for an additional million of future funded term loans 
as described more fully in notes  and of the notes to consolidated financial statements  at december   the company had certain cash obligations  which are due as follows in thousands total and after long term debt      convertible notes   capital leases      total long term debt     operating leases      replacement facilities    total      also  as more fully described in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements at december   we had issued letters of credit primarily in support of certain outstanding bonds of approximately million 
in addition  at december   we had million in available borrowings from the revolving line of credit exclusive of letters of credit and million in available borrowings from a term loan 
compared to net cash provided by operating activities increased by million  from million during to million during this increase was due primarily to an increase in net income of million  an increase in non cash depreciation and amortization of million  use of deferred tax assets of million during  as compared to use of deferred tax assets of million in  the absence of the million compliance settlement payment made during and improvements made in the management of working capital 
the use of cash in investing activities increased million from million in to million in the increase was due primarily to an increase in cash used to purchase property and equipment of million during net cash provided by financing activities decreased million from million in to million in we raised million in proceeds  net of expenses from our concurrent convertible debt and equity offerings completed in  which were used to repay long term debt  including million to repay subordinated debentures held by the limited partners of an affiliate of forstmann little co 
our additional borrowings during were million and  excluding repayments using proceeds from convertible debt and equity offerings  repayments of long term debt were million 
this represents a million decrease in borrowings as compared to million of borrowings in and an increase in repayments of million as compared to repayments of million in capital expenditures cash expenditures for purchases of facilities was million in  million in and million in these expenditures include million for the six hospitals acquired and million for information systems and other equipment to integrate the newly acquired hospitals in  million for the five hospitals acquired  million for information systems and other equipment to integrate the newly acquired hospitals and million for the purchases of other clinics and working capital at a managed facility in  and million for the seven hospitals acquired  million for information systems and other equipment to integrate the newly acquired hospitals and million for working capital at a managed facility in excluding the cost to construct replacement hospitals  our capital expenditures for totaled million compared to million in and million in costs to construct replacement hospitals totaled million  including million of capital leases related to the construction projects in  million  including million of capital leases in  and million in the reduction of capital lease liabilities is included in financing activities in our statements of cash flows 
pursuant to hospital purchase agreements in effect as of december   we are required to construct two replacement hospitals through with an aggregate estimated construction cost  including equipment  of approximately million 
of this amount  a cumulative total of approximately million has been expended through december  we expect total capital expenditures of approximately to million in  including approximately to million for renovation and equipment purchases which includes amounts which are required to be expended pursuant to the terms of the hospital purchase agreements and approximately to million for construction of replacement hospitals 
capital resources net working capital was million at december  compared to million at december  the million increase was attributable primarily to excess cash borrowed under our credit agreement to be used for future acquisitions  an increase in accounts receivable due to a combination of growth in same hospitals revenues during  the addition of six hospitals in  and a decrease in current maturities of long term debt  offset by increases in accounts payable  employee compensation accruals and other accrued liabilities 
the aggregate working capital of the six hospitals acquired in  as of their respective dates of acquisition  was approximately million 
on july   we entered into a billion senior secured credit facility with a consortium of lenders 
the facility replaced our previous credit facility and consists of an million term loan that matures in as opposed to under the previous facility and a six year million revolving credit facility that matures in as opposed to under the previous facility 
we may elect from time to time an interest rate per annum for the borrowings under the term loan and revolving credit facility equal to a an annual benchmark rate  which will be equal to the greatest of i the prime rate  ii the base cd rate plus basis points or iii the federal funds effective rate plus basis points the abr  plus basis points for the term loan and the applicable margin for revolving credit loans or b the eurodollar rate plus basis points for the term loan and the eurodollar applicable margin for revolving credit loans 
we also pay a commitment fee for the daily average unused commitments under the revolving credit facility 
the commitment fee is based on a pricing grid depending on the eurodollar applicable margin for revolving credit loans and ranges from to 
the commitment fee is payable quarterly in arrears and on the revolving credit termination date with respect to the available revolving credit commitments 
in addition  we will pay fees for each letter of credit issued under the credit facility 
the facility has a feature that allows for an additional million of future funded term loans 
the purpose of the facility was to refinance the company s previous credit agreement  repay certain other indebtedness  and fund general corporate purposes including acquisitions 
as of december   our availability for additional borrowings under our revolving credit facility was million and under our term loan was approximately million 
as of december   our weighted average interest rate under our credit agreement was 
the terms of the credit agreement include various restrictive covenants 
these covenants include restrictions on additional indebtedness  investments  asset sales  capital expenditures  sale and leasebacks  contingent obligations  transactions with affiliates  and fundamental changes 
we would be required to amend the existing credit agreement in order to pay dividends to our shareholders 
the covenants also require maintenance of various ratios regarding consolidated total indebtedness  consolidated interest  and fixed charges 
the level of these covenants are similar to or more favorable than the credit facility we refinanced 
we have entered into four separate interest swap agreements to limit the effect of changes in interest rates on a portion of its long term borrowings 
under three agreements  entered into on november   the company pays interest at fixed rates of  and  respectively 
each of the three agreements has a million notional amount of indebtedness 
under the fourth agreement  dated november   we pay interest at a fixed rate of on million notional amount of indebtedness 
we receive a variable rate of interest on each of these swaps based on the three month london inter bank offer libor  excluding the margin paid under the credit facility on a quarterly basis 
the swaps expire as follows million in november  million in november  million in november and million in november we believe that internally generated cash flows and borrowings under our new credit agreement will be sufficient to finance acquisitions  capital expenditures and working capital requirements through the next months 
if funds required for future acquisitions exceed existing sources of capital  we believe that favorable terms could be obtained if we were to increase or refinance our credit facilities or obtain additional capital by other means 
joint ventures we have from time to time sold minority interests in certain of our subsidiaries 
the amount of minority interest in equity is included in other long term liabilities and the minority interest in income or loss is recorded in other operating expense 
we do not believe these minority ownerships are material to our financial position or operating results 
as of and for the year ended december   the balance of minority interests included in long term liabilities was million and the amount of minority interest expense was million 
reimbursement  legislative and regulatory changes legislative and regulatory action has resulted in continuing change in the medicare and medicaid reimbursement programs which will continue to limit payment increases under these programs and in some cases implement payment decreases 
within the statutory framework of the medicare and medicaid programs  there are substantial areas subject to administrative rulings  interpretations  and discretion which may further affect payments made under those programs  and the federal and state governments might  in the future  reduce the funds available under those programs or require more stringent utilization and quality reviews of hospital facilities 
additionally  there may be a continued rise in managed care programs and future restructuring of the financing and delivery of healthcare in the united states 
these events could have an adverse effect on our future financial results 
inflation the healthcare industry is labor intensive 
wages and other expenses increase during periods of inflation and when labor shortages occur in the marketplace 
in addition  our suppliers pass along rising costs to us in the form of higher prices 
we have implemented cost control measures  including our case and resource management program  to curb increases in operating costs and expenses 
we have  to date  offset increases in operating costs by increasing reimbursement for services  expanding services and reducing costs in other areas 
however  we cannot predict our ability to cover or offset future cost increases 
critical accounting policies the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgements that affect the reported amount of assets and liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of our financial statements 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
critical accounting policies are defined as those that are reflective of significant judgements and uncertainties  and potentially result in materially different results under different assumptions and conditions 
we believe that our critical accounting policies are limited to those described below 
for a detailed discussion on the application of these and other accounting policies  see note in the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
third party reimbursement net operating revenues include amounts estimated by management to be reimbursable by medicare and medicaid under prospective payment systems and provisions of cost reimbursement and other payment methods 
in addition  we are reimbursed by non governmental payors using a variety of payment methodologies 
amounts we receive for treatment of patients covered by these programs are generally less than the standard billing rates 
we account for the differences between the estimated program reimbursement rates and the standard billing rates as contractual adjustments  which we deduct from gross revenues to arrive at net operating revenues 
final settlements under some of these programs are subject to adjustment based on administrative review and audit by third parties 
we record adjustments to the estimated billings in the periods that such adjustments become known 
we account for adjustments to previous program reimbursement estimates as contractual adjustments and report them in future periods as final settlements are determined 
allowance for doubtful accounts accounts receivable are reduced by an allowance for amounts that could become uncollectable in the future 
substantially all of our receivables are related to providing healthcare services to our hospitals patients 
our estimate for its allowance for doubtful accounts is based primarily on our historical collection experience for each type of payor 
the allowance amount is computed by applying allowance percentages to amounts included in specific payor and aging categories of patient accounts receivable 
goodwill and other intangibles goodwill represents the excess of cost over the fair value of net assets acquired 
prior to the adoption of statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 goodwill arising from business combinations completed prior to july  was amortized on a straight line basis over a period ranging from to years 
currently  goodwill arising from business combinations whether or not completed prior to july  is accounted for under the provisions of sfas no 
and sfas no 
and is not amortized 
sfas no 
requires goodwill to be evaluated for impairment at the same time every year and when an event occurs or circumstances change such that it is reasonably possible that an impairment may exist 
we selected september th as our annual testing date 
the sfas no 
goodwill impairment model requires a comparison of the book value of net assets to the fair value of the related operations that have goodwill assigned to them 
if the fair value is determined to be less than book value  a second step is performed to compute the amount of the impairment 
we estimated the fair values of the related operations using both a debt free discounted cash flow model as well as an ebitda multiple model 
these models are both based on our best estimate of future revenues and operating costs  based primarily on historical performance and general market conditions  and are subject to review and approval by senior management and the board of directors 
the cash flow forecasts are adjusted by an appropriate discount rate based on our weighted average cost of capital 
we performed our initial evaluation  as required by sfas no 
 during the first quarter of and the annual evaluation as of september  no impairment was indicated by either evaluation 
professional liability insurance claims we accrue for estimated losses resulting from professional liability claims to the extent they are not covered by insurance 
the accrual  which includes an estimate for incurred but not reported claims  is based on historical loss patterns and actuarially determined projections and is discounted to its net present value using a weighted average risk free discount rate of and in and  respectively 
to the extent that subsequent claims information varies from management s estimates  the liability is adjusted currently 
our insurance is underwritten on a claims made basis and substantially all of our professional and general liability risks are subject to a million per occurrence deductible  these deductibles were million per occurrence for claims reported prior to june  and million per occurrence for claims reported june  and thereafter 
we are a minority investor in a captive insurance company through which we purchase coverage from million to million per claim

 accounting for asset retirement obligations  was issued in june by the financial accounting standards board and is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after june  earlier application is encouraged 
sfas no 
establishes accounting standards for recognition and measurement of a liability for an asset retirement obligation and the associated retirement costs 
this statement applies to all entities and to legal obligations associated with the retirement of long lived assets that result from the acquisition  construction  development and or the normal operation of a long lived asset  except for certain obligations of lessees 
we do not expect the implementation of sfas no 
to have a material effect on our consolidated financial position or consolidated results of operations 
on august   the financial accounting standards board issued sfas no 
accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
this statement addresses financial accounting and reporting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets and supercedes sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of  and the accounting and reporting provisions of apb opinion no 
 reporting the results of operations reporting the effects of disposal of a segment of a business  and extraordinary  unusual and infrequently occurring events and transactions  for the disposal of a segment of a business 
this statement also amends arb no 
consolidated financial statements  to eliminate the exception to consolidation for a subsidiary for which control is likely to be temporary 
the provisions of this statement are effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after december  the provisions are generally to be applied prospectively 
there was no impact on our results of operations from the adoption of this standard 
in april  the fasb issued sfas no 
 rescission of fasb statements no 
 and  amendment of fasb statement no 
 and technical corrections 
this statement rescinds sfas no 
 reporting gains and losses from extinguishment of debt  and an amendment of that statement  sfas no

this statement also rescinds sfas no 
 accounting for intangible assets of motor carriers 
this statement amends sfas no 
 accounting for leases  to eliminate an inconsistency between the required accounting for sale leaseback transactions and the required accounting for certain lease modifications that have economic effects that are similar to sale leaseback transactions 
this statement also amends other existing authoritative pronouncements to make various technical corrections  clarify meanings  or describe their applicability under changed conditions 
the provisions of this statement related to the rescission of sfas no 
are effective for fiscal years beginning after may  upon adoption  the extraordinary losses recognized in the year ended december  and the year ended december  will be reclassified within income from operations to conform to the provisions of sfas no 
the provisions of this statement related to sfas no 
are effective for transactions occurring after may  all other provisions of this statement are effective for financial statements issued on or after may  the implementation of these remaining provisions did not have a material effect on our consolidated financial position or consolidated results of operations 
in july  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities 
the statement requires companies to recognize costs associated with exit or disposal activities when they are incurred rather than at the date of a commitment to an exit or disposal plan 
examples of costs covered by the statement include lease termination costs and certain employee severance costs that are associated with a restructuring  discontinued operation  plant closing  or other exit or disposal activity 
the provisions of this statement are effective for exit or disposal activities initiated after december  in november  the fasb issued interpretation no 
 guarantor s accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees  including indirect guarantees of indebtedness of others  an interpretation of fasb statements no 
  and and rescission of fasb interpretation no 
fin no 

the interpretation requires that upon issuance of a guarantee  the entity must recognize a liability for the fair value of the obligation it assumes under that obligation
