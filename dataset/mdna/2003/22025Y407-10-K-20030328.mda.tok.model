this discussion contains forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
our actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward looking statements as a result of certain factors  including  but not limited to  those described under risk factors and included in other portions of this report 
overview the company we are the nation s largest owner and operator of privatized correctional and detention facilities and one of the largest prison operators in the united states  behind only the federal government and four states 
as of december   we owned correctional  detention and juvenile facilities  three of which we lease to other operators  and one additional facility which is not yet in operation 
as of december   we operated facilities including facilities that we owned  with a total design capacity of approximately  beds in states and the district of columbia 
we specialize in owning  operating and managing prisons and other correctional facilities and providing inmate residential and prisoner transportation services for governmental agencies 
in addition to providing the fundamental residential services relating to inmates  our facilities offer a variety of rehabilitation and education programs  including basic education  religious services  life skills and employment training and substance abuse treatment 
these services are intended to reduce recidivism and to prepare inmates for their successful re entry into society upon their release 
we also provide health care including medical  dental and psychiatric services  food services and work and recreational programs

critical accounting policies the consolidated financial statements are prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
as such  we are required to make certain estimates  judgments and assumptions that we believe are reasonable based upon the information available 
these estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period 
a summary of our significant accounting policies is described in note to our financial statements 
the significant accounting policies and estimates which we believe are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our reported financial results include the following accounts receivable 
as of december   accounts receivable included million due from the commonwealth of puerto rico  classified as current assets of discontinued operations due to the termination of our contracts to manage three facilities in the commonwealth of puerto rico during the second and third quarters of in february  we entered into an agreement with the commonwealth of puerto rico regarding the payment and resolution of the balance of the receivable 
the agreement specifies payment dates for million  of which million has been 
table of contents collected  with the balance to be paid upon reconciliation of invoices presented 
we currently expect to collect the balance of the receivable and  therefore  no allowance for doubtful accounts has been established for the accounts receivable balance 
however  no assurance can be given as to the timing and ultimate collectibility of the remaining amounts due 
asset impairments 
as of december   we had approximately billion in long lived assets 
we evaluate the recoverability of the carrying values of our long lived assets  other than intangibles  when events suggest that an impairment may have occurred 
in these circumstances  we utilize estimates of undiscounted cash flows to determine if an impairment exists 
if an impairment exists  it is measured as the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the estimated fair value of the asset 
goodwill impairments 
effective january   we adopted statement of financial accounting standards no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  or sfas  which established new accounting and reporting requirements for goodwill and other intangible assets 
under sfas  all goodwill amortization ceased effective january  and goodwill attributable to each of our reporting units was tested for impairment by comparing the fair value of each reporting unit with its carrying value 
fair value was determined using a collaboration of various common valuation techniques  including market multiples  discounted cash flows  and replacement cost methods 
these impairment tests are required to be performed at adoption of sfas and at least annually thereafter 
on an ongoing basis absent any impairment indicators  we expect to continue to perform our impairment tests during the fourth quarter  in connection with our annual budgeting process 
based on our initial impairment tests  we recognized an impairment of million to write off the carrying value of goodwill associated with our locations included in the owned and managed reporting segment during the first quarter of this goodwill was established in connection with the acquisition of correctional management services corporation  referred to herein as operating company 
the remaining goodwill  which is associated with the facilities we manage but do not own  was deemed to be not impaired  and remains recorded on the balance sheet 
this remaining goodwill was established in connection with the acquisitions of prison management services  inc  or pmsi  and juvenile and jail facility management services  inc  or jjfmsi  both of which were privately held service companies  referred to herein as the service companies  that managed certain government owned adult and juvenile prison and jail facilities 
the implied fair value of goodwill of the locations included in the owned and managed reporting segment did not support the carrying value of any goodwill  primarily due to the highly leveraged capital structure 
no impairment of goodwill allocated to the locations included in the managed only reporting segment was deemed necessary  primarily because of the relatively minimal capital expenditure requirements  and therefore indebtedness  in connection with obtaining such management contracts 
under sfas  the impairment recognized at adoption of the new rules was reflected as a cumulative effect of accounting change in our statement of operations for the first quarter of impairment adjustments recognized after adoption  if any  are required to be recognized as operating expenses 
income taxes 
as of december   we had approximately million in gross deferred tax assets 
deferred income taxes reflect the net tax effect of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for income tax purposes 
realization of the future tax benefits related to deferred tax assets is dependent on many factors  including our ability to generate taxable income within the net operating loss carryforward period 
since the change in tax status in connection with the restructuring in  and as of december   we have provided a valuation allowance to substantially reserve the deferred tax 
table of contents assets in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for income taxes  or sfas the valuation allowance is recognized based on the weight of available evidence indicating that it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
this evidence primarily consists of  but is not limited to  recurring operating losses for federal tax purposes 
our assessment of the valuation allowance could change in the future based upon our actual and projected taxable income 
removal of the valuation allowance in whole or in part would result in a non cash reduction in income tax expense during the period of removal 
in addition  because a portion of the valuation allowance as of december  was established to reserve certain deferred tax assets upon the acquisitions of pmsi and jjfmsi  in accordance with sfas  removal of the valuation allowance would result in a reduction to any remaining goodwill recorded in connection with such acquisitions to the extent the reversal relates to the valuation allowance applied to deferred tax assets existing at the date pmsi and jjfmsi were acquired 
if the valuation allowance as of december  were to be removed in its entirety  the reduction to goodwill would amount to approximately million 
to the extent no valuation allowance is established for our deferred tax assets  future financial statements would reflect a provision for income taxes at the applicable federal and state tax rates on income before taxes 
on october   we entered into a definitive settlement with the internal revenue service  or the irs  in connection with the irs s audit of our predecessor s federal income tax return 
under the terms of the settlement  in consideration for the irs s final determinations with respect to the tax year  in december we paid approximately million in cash to satisfy federal and state taxes and interest 
pursuant to the terms of the settlement  the audit adjustments agreed to for the tax year did not trigger any additional distribution requirements by us in order to preserve our status as a real estate investment trust for federal income tax purposes for the adjustments will  however  serve to increase our accumulated earnings and profits in and therefore will affect the taxability of dividends paid on our series a and series b preferred stock in and later years 
in addition  due to a change in tax law created by the job creation and worker assistance act of  which was signed into law in march  the settlement created an opportunity to utilize any tax losses to claim a refund of a portion of the taxes paid 
we experienced tax losses during primarily resulting from a cumulative effect of accounting change in depreciable lives for tax purposes 
under terms of the new law  we utilized our net operating losses to offset taxable income generated in  which was increased substantially in connection with the settlement with the irs 
as a result of the tax law change in  combined with the adoption of an accounting change in the depreciable lives of certain tax assets  we will be due an income tax refund of approximately million 
while we do not currently expect the irs to challenge the deduction associated with the change in depreciable lives of certain tax assets  the disallowance of all or a substantial portion of this deduction by the irs would have a material adverse impact on our results of operations and expected cash flows 
the cumulative effect of accounting change in tax depreciation resulted in the establishment of a significant deferred tax liability for the tax effect of the book over tax basis of certain assets 
the creation of such a deferred tax liability  and the significant improvement in our tax position since the original valuation allowance was established to reserve our deferred tax assets  resulted in the reduction of the valuation allowance  generating an income tax benefit of approximately million during the fourth quarter of  as we determined that substantially all of these deferred tax liabilities will be utilized to offset the reversal of deferred tax assets during the net operating loss 
table of contents carryforward periods 
we continue to evaluate additional tax strategies to maximize the opportunities created by the new law  which could result in an additional income tax refund and income tax benefits  although we can provide no assurance that any such tax strategies will come to fruition 
the irs has recently completed auditing our federal tax return for the taxable year ended december  the irs has proposed the disallowance of a loss we claimed as the result of our forgiveness in september of certain indebtedness of operating company 
this finding is currently being protested with the appeals office of the irs 
in the event that  after we seek all available remedies  the irs prevails  we would be required to pay the irs in excess of million in cash plus penalties and interest 
this adjustment would also substantially eliminate our net operating loss carryforward 
we believe that we have meritorious defenses of our positions 
we have not established a reserve for this matter 
however  no assurance can be given that the irs will not make such an assessment and prevail in any such claim against us 
self funded insurance reserves 
as of december   we had approximately million in accrued liabilities for employee health  workers compensation  and automobile insurance 
we are significantly self insured for employee health  workers compensation  and automobile liability insurance 
as such  our insurance expense is largely dependent on claims experience and our ability to control our claims 
we have consistently accrued the estimated liability for employee health insurance based on our history of claims experience and time lag between the incident date and the date the cost is paid by us 
we have accrued the estimated liability for workers compensation and automobile insurance based on a third party actuarial valuation of the outstanding liabilities 
these estimates could change in the future 
legal reserves 
as of december   we had approximately million in accrued liabilities for litigation for certain legal proceedings in which we are involved 
we have accrued our estimate of the probable costs for the resolution of these claims based on a range of potential outcomes 
in addition  we are subject to current and potential future legal proceedings for which little or no accrual has been reflected because our current assessment of the potential exposure is nominal 
these estimates have been developed in consultation with our general counsel s office and  as appropriate  outside counsel handling these matters  and are based upon an analysis of potential results  assuming a combination of litigation and settlement strategies 
it is possible  however  that future cash flows and results of operations could be materially affected by changes in our assumptions  new developments  or by the effectiveness of our strategies 
liquidity and capital resources our principal capital requirements are for working capital  capital expenditures and debt service payments 
capital requirements may also include cash expenditures associated with our outstanding commitments and contingencies  as further described in the notes to our financial statements 
in addition  we may incur capital expenditures to expand the design capacity of our facilities in order to retain management contracts  or when the economics of an expansion are compelling 
in addition  with lender consent  we may acquire additional correctional facilities that we believe have favorable investment returns and increase value to our stockholders 
we have financed  and intend to continue to finance  the working capital and capital expenditure requirements with existing cash balances and net cash provided by operations  although we may also utilize our senior bank credit facility  as further described below 
we may also sell non strategic assets and apply the net proceeds to pay down our outstanding indebtedness 

table of contents as of december   our liquidity was provided by cash on hand of approximately million and million available under the million revolving portion of our senior bank credit facility 
during the year ended december   we generated million in cash through operating activities  and as of december   we had net working capital of million  including an income tax refund receivable of million  which we expect to receive during the second quarter of we currently expect to be able to meet our cash expenditure requirements for the next year 
during the fourth quarter of  as a result of our financial condition existing at that time  including i the pending maturity of the loans under the then existing senior secured bank credit facility  referred to herein as the old senior bank credit facility  ii our negative working capital position  and iii our highly leveraged capital structure  our new management conducted strategic assessments  developed revised financial projections  evaluated the utilization of existing facilities  projects under development and excess land parcels  identified certain of these non strategic assets for sale  and identified various potential transactions that could improve our financial position 
during  we were successful in repositioning our capital structure for a comprehensive refinancing of our senior indebtedness  including primarily the old senior bank credit facility 
we paid down million in total debt through a combination of million in cash generated from asset sales and internally generated cash 
we improved operating margins  increased occupancy rates  and settled a number of significant outstanding legal matters on terms we believe were favorable 
in may  we completed a one for ten reverse stock split of our common stock  which satisfied a condition of continued listing of our common stock on the new york stock exchange  or nyse 
during december  we completed an amendment and restatement of our old senior bank credit facility 
as part of the december amendment and restatement  the existing million revolving portion of the old senior bank credit facility  which was to mature on january   was replaced with a term loan of the same amount maturing on december   to coincide with the maturity of the other loans under the old senior bank credit facility 
pursuant to terms of the december amendment and restatement  all loans under the old senior bank credit facility accrued interest at a variable rate of over libor  or over the base rate  at our option 
as a result of the december amendment and restatement  certain financial and non financial covenants of the old senior bank credit facility were amended  including the removal of prior restrictions on our ability to pay cash dividends on shares of our series a preferred stock 
under the terms of the december amendment and restatement  we were permitted to pay quarterly dividends  when declared by the board of directors  on the shares of series a preferred stock  including all dividends in arrears 
on december   our board of directors declared a cash dividend on the shares of series a preferred stock for the fourth quarter of  and for all five quarters then unpaid and in arrears  payable on january  to the holders of record of series a preferred stock on december  as a result of the board s declaration  we paid an aggregate of million to holders of the series a preferred stock in january we believed  and continue to believe  that a short term extension of the revolving portion of our old senior bank credit facility was in our best interest for a longer term financing strategy  particularly due to difficult market conditions for the issuance of debt securities following the terrorist attacks on september   and during the fourth quarter of additionally  we believed that certain terms of the december amendment and restatement  including primarily the removal of prior restrictions to pay cash dividends on our shares of series a preferred stock  including all dividends 
table of contents in arrears  would result in an improvement to our credit ratings  thereby enhancing the terms of a more comprehensive refinancing 
after completing the amendment and restatement of the old senior bank credit facility in december  moody s investors service upgraded the rating on our senior secured debt to b from b  our senior unsecured debt to b from caa  and our preferred stock to caa from ca 
on may   we completed a comprehensive refinancing of our senior indebtedness through the refinancing of our old senior bank credit facility and the sale and issuance of million aggregate principal amount of unsecured senior notes due  referred to herein as the senior notes 
the proceeds from the sale of the senior notes were used to repay a portion of amounts outstanding under the old senior bank credit facility  to redeem approximately million of our existing million unsecured senior notes due  referred to herein as the senior notes  pursuant to a tender offer and consent solicitation  and to pay related fees and expenses 
upon the completion of the refinancing  moody s investors service upgraded its rating of our senior secured debt to b from b  our senior unsecured debt to b from b  and our preferred stock to caa from caa  and standard poor s upgraded our corporate credit rating and its rating of our senior secured debt to b from b and our senior unsecured debt to b from ccc 
interest on the senior notes accrues at the stated rate  and is payable semi annually in arrears on may and november of each year 
the senior notes mature on may  at any time before may   we may redeem up to of the notes with the net proceeds of certain equity offerings  as long as of the aggregate principal amount of the notes remains outstanding after the redemption 
we may redeem all or a portion of the senior notes on or after may  redemption prices are set forth in the indenture governing the senior notes 
the senior notes are guaranteed on an unsecured basis by all of our domestic subsidiaries other than our puerto rican subsidiary 
the indenture governing the senior notes contains certain customary covenants that  subject to certain exceptions and qualifications  restrict our ability to  among other things make restricted payments  incur additional debt or issue certain types of preferred stock  create or permit to exist certain liens  consolidate  merge or transfer all or substantially all of our assets  and enter into transactions with affiliates 
in addition  if we sell certain assets and generally do not use the proceeds of such sales for certain specified purposes or experience specific kinds of changes in control  we must offer to repurchase all or a portion of the senior notes 
the offer price for the senior notes in connection with an asset sale would be equal to of the aggregate principal amount of the notes repurchased plus accrued and unpaid interest and liquidated damages  if any  on the notes repurchased to the date of purchase 
the offer price for the senior notes in connection with a change in control would be of the aggregate principal amount of the notes repurchased plus accrued and unpaid interest and liquidated damages  if any  on the notes repurchased to the date of purchase 
the senior notes are also subject to certain cross default provisions with the terms of our other indebtedness 
as part of the refinancing  we obtained a new million senior secured bank credit facility  referred to herein as the new senior bank credit facility  which replaced the old senior bank credit facility 
lehman commercial paper inc serves as administrative agent under the new facility  which is comprised of a million revolving loan with a term of approximately four years  referred to herein as the revolving loan  a million term loan with a term of approximately four years  referred to herein as the term loan a facility  and a million term loan with a term of 
table of contents approximately six years  referred to herein as the term loan b facility 
all borrowings under the new senior bank credit facility initially bear interest at a base rate plus  or libor plus  at our option 
the applicable margin for the revolving loan and the term loan a facility is subject to adjustment based on our leverage ratio 
we are also required to pay a commitment fee on the difference between committed amounts and amounts actually utilized under the revolving loan equal to per year subject to adjustment based on our leverage ratio 
the term loan a facility is repayable in quarterly installments  which commenced on june   in an aggregate principal amount for each year as follows million in year one  million in year two  million in year three  and million in year four 
the term loan b facility is repayable in nominal quarterly installments of approximately million  which commenced on june   for the first five years and in substantial quarterly installments during the final year 
on january   after obtaining consent of the lenders under the new senior bank credit facility  we purchased the crowley county correctional facility  a  bed medium security adult male prison facility located in olney springs  colorado  for a purchase price of approximately million 
we financed the purchase price through million in borrowings under the new senior bank credit facility pursuant to an expansion of the term loan b facility  with the balance of the purchase price satisfied with cash on hand 
as a result of the expansion of the term loan b facility  the quarterly principal installments required under its terms were increased by  with the remaining balance due in the final year 
prepayments of loans outstanding under the new senior bank credit facility are permitted at any time without premium or penalty  upon the giving of proper notice 
in addition  we are required to prepay amounts outstanding under the new senior bank credit facility in an amount equal to i of the net cash proceeds from any sale or issuance of our equity securities or any equity securities of our subsidiaries  subject to certain exceptions  ii of the net cash proceeds from any incurrence of additional indebtedness excluding certain permitted debt  subject to certain exceptions  iii of the net cash proceeds from any sale or other disposition by us  or any of our subsidiaries  of any assets  subject to certain exclusions and reinvestment provisions and excluding certain dispositions in the ordinary course of business  and iv of our excess cash flow as such term is defined in the new senior bank credit facility for each fiscal year 
the credit agreement governing the new senior bank credit facility requires us to meet certain financial covenants  including  without limitation  a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio  a maximum leverage ratio and a minimum interest coverage ratio 
in addition  the new senior bank credit facility contains certain covenants which  among other things  limit the incurrence of additional indebtedness  investments  payment of dividends  transactions with affiliates  asset sales  acquisitions  capital expenditures  mergers and consolidations  prepayments and modifications of other indebtedness  liens and encumbrances and other matters customarily restricted in such agreements 
in addition  the new senior bank credit facility contains cross default provisions with our other indebtedness 
the loans and other obligations under the new senior bank credit facility are guaranteed by each of our domestic subsidiaries 
our obligations under the new senior bank credit facility and the guarantees are secured by i a perfected first priority security interest in substantially all of our tangible and intangible assets and substantially all of the tangible and intangible assets of our subsidiaries  and ii a pledge of all of the capital stock of our domestic subsidiaries and of the capital stock of certain of our foreign subsidiaries 

table of contents pursuant to the terms of the aforementioned tender offer and consent solicitation which expired on may   in connection with the refinancing  in may  we redeemed approximately million in aggregate principal amount of our senior notes with proceeds from the issuance of the senior notes 
the notes were redeemed at a price of of par  which included a consent payment  plus accrued and unpaid interest to the payment date 
in connection with the tender offer and consent solicitation  we received sufficient consents and amended the indenture governing the senior notes to delete substantially all of the restrictive covenants and events of default contained therein 
we are required to pay interest and principal upon maturity on the remaining senior notes outstanding  in accordance with the original terms of such notes 
in connection with the refinancing  we also terminated an interest rate swap agreement at a price of approximately million 
the swap agreement  which fixed libor at on outstanding balances of million through its expiration on december   had been entered into in order to satisfy a requirement of the old senior bank credit facility 
in addition  in order to satisfy a requirement of the new senior bank credit facility  we purchased an interest rate cap agreement  capping libor at on outstanding balances of million through the expiration of the cap agreement on may   for a price of million 
the termination of the swap agreement and the purchase of the cap agreement were funded with cash on hand 
as a result of the early extinguishment of the old senior bank credit facility and the redemption of substantially all of our senior notes  we recorded an extraordinary loss of approximately million during the second quarter of  which included the write off of existing deferred loan costs  certain bank fees paid  premiums paid to redeem the senior notes  and certain other costs associated with the refinancing 
operating activities our net cash provided by operating activities for the year ended december   was million  compared with million for the same period in the prior year 
as further discussed under results of operations below  we do not believe the cash flows for the year ended december   are comparable to the cash flows for the years ended december  or cash provided by operating activities represents the year to date net income or loss plus depreciation and amortization  changes in various components of working capital  adjustments for various non cash charges  including primarily the cumulative effect of accounting change in and the change in fair value of the interest rate swap agreement  and the extraordinary charge related to the comprehensive refinancing completed on may  income tax refunds of million during the first quarter of and million during the second quarter of contributed to the cash generated from operating activities in both years 
as previously described herein  we also expect to receive an additional income tax refund of approximately million during the second quarter of the increase in cash provided by operating activities was also due to a significant reduction in interest  primarily resulting from the pay down of debt balances  the successful refinancing completed in may  and due to lower market interest rates 
these increases in cash provided by operating activities were partially offset by the payment of million during the fourth quarter of in full satisfaction of the aforementioned settlement with the irs with respect to our predecessor s federal income tax return 

table of contents investing activities our cash flow used in investing activities was million for the year ended december   and was primarily attributable to capital expenditures during the period of million  net of proceeds received from the sale of our interest in a juvenile facility located in dallas  texas  on june   for million 
capital expenditures during included million for development and redevelopment activities  including primarily expenditures for our mcrae correctional facility to meet specifications required by the federal bureau of prisons  or bop  in connection with a new contract award  and million for maintenance capital expenditures incurred for the betterment  renewal or significant repairs that extended the useful life of our correctional facilities  or for new furniture  fixtures and equipment 
in addition  we received refunds of restricted cash totaling approximately million primarily used as collateral for workers compensation claims 
we elected to post letters of credit from the sub facility under the revolving portion of our new senior bank credit facility to replace the cash collateral on such claims 
our cash flow provided by investing activities was million for the year ended december   and was primarily attributable to the proceeds received from the sales of our mountain view correctional facility  located in spruce pine  north carolina  on march   our agecroft facility  located in salford  england  on april   our pamlico correctional facility  located in bayboro  north carolina  on june   and our southern nevada women s correctional center  located in las vegas  nevada  on october  financing activities our cash flow used in financing activities was million for the year ended december   compared with million for the same period in the prior year 
proceeds from the issuance on may  of the senior notes and the new senior bank credit facility were largely offset by the repayment of the old senior bank credit facility and the redemption of substantially all of the senior notes 
however  we also paid debt issuance costs of million in connection with this comprehensive refinancing  and an additional million to terminate the interest rate swap agreement 
further  during the first quarter of  we paid cash dividends of million on our series a preferred stock for the fourth quarter of and for all five quarters then in arrears  as permitted under the terms of an amendment to our old senior bank credit facility obtained in december additionally  we paid million in cash dividends on our series a preferred stock during each of the second  third and fourth quarters of net payments on debt during totaled million and primarily consisted of the net cash proceeds received from the sale of the mountain view correctional facility  the agecroft facility  the pamlico correctional facility  and the southern nevada women s correctional center that were immediately applied to amounts outstanding under the old senior bank credit facility 
net payments on debt also included a lump sum payment of million on the old senior bank credit facility with cash on hand 
contractual obligations the following schedule summarizes our contractual cash obligations by the indicated period as of december  in thousands 
table of contents payments due by year ended december  thereafter total long term debt contingent interest operating leases total contractual cash obligations as the result of a default during under the terms of our million convertible subordinated notes  we are required to pay the holders of the notes contingent interest sufficient to permit the holders to receive a rate of return on such notes  retroactive to the date of issuance of the notes 
the contingent interest is payable upon each of december  and upon repayment of the notes  unless the holders of the notes elect to convert the notes into common stock under the terms of the note purchase agreement or unless the price of our common stock meets or exceeds a target price as defined in the note purchase agreement 
we had million of letters of credit outstanding at december  primarily to support our requirement to repay fees under our workers compensation plan in the event we do not repay the fees due in accordance with the terms of the plan 
the letters of credit are renewable annually 
the company did not have any draws under any outstanding letters of credit during  or results of operations we do not believe the comparison between our results of operations or cash flows for the years ended december  and with the year ended december  is meaningful because the results of operations and cash flows reflect real estate activities between operating company and us for the period from january  through september  during a period of severe liquidity problems  and as of october   our financial condition  results of operations and cash flows include the operations of the correctional and detention facilities previously leased to and managed by operating company 
in addition  our financial condition  results of operations and cash flows as of and for the year ended december  also include the operations of the service companies as of december  acquisition date on a consolidated basis 
for the period january  through august   the investments in the service companies were accounted for and were presented under the equity method of accounting 
for the period from september  through november   the investments in the service companies were accounted for on a combined basis due to the repurchase by the wholly owned subsidiaries of the service companies of the non management  outside stockholders equity interest in the service companies during september the resulting increase in our assets and liabilities as of september  as a result of combining the balance sheets of pmsi and jjfmsi has been treated as a non cash transaction in the combined statement of cash flows for the year ended december   with the september  combined cash balances of pmsi and jjfmsi million included in cash and cash equivalents  beginning of year 
the economic interests in each of pmsi and jjfmsi are presented under the equity method for all periods prior to september  for the entire years ended december  and  our consolidated results of operations and cash flows reflect our results as a business specializing in owning  operating and managing prisons and other correctional facilities and providing prisoner transportation services for governmental agencies 
our and results of operations were impacted by  and the following table sets forth for the years ended december  and  the number of facilities we owned and managed  the 
table of contents number of facilities we managed but did not own  the number of facilities we leased to other operators  and the facilities we owned that were not yet in operation 
owned and managed managed only leased incomplete total facilities as of december  sale of the mountain view correctional facility sale of agecroft properties  inc  which owned an interest in the agecroft facility located in salford  england 
sale of the pamlico correctional facility termination of the management contract for the brownfield intermediate sanction facility sale of the southern nevada women s correctional center  and due to the amendment of the previous contract terms  continued management of the facility facilities as of december  termination of the management contract for the southwest indiana regional youth village termination of the management contracts for facilities in puerto rico management contract award by the federal bureau of prisons for the mcrae correctional facility sale of interest in a juvenile facility termination of the management contract for the delta correctional facility facilities as of december  year ended december  compared to year ended december  we incurred a net loss available to common stockholders of million  or per diluted share  for the year ended december   compared with net income available to common stockholders of million  or per diluted share  for the year ended december  the net loss in resulted from the combined effects of a non cash charge for the cumulative effect of accounting change for goodwill of million  or per diluted share  related to the adoption of sfas during the first quarter of and the extraordinary charge of million  or per diluted share  incurred in connection with the comprehensive refinancing completed during the second quarter of offsetting these charges in was an aggregate income tax benefit of million  which included a cash income tax benefit of million recognized during the first quarter of related to a change in tax law that became effective in march  which enabled us to utilize certain of our net operating losses to offset taxable income generated in and in addition  approximately million of the income tax benefit in was due to the reduction of the tax valuation allowance applied to certain deferred tax assets arising primarily as a result of tax deductions based on a cumulative effect of accounting change for tax depreciation to be reported on our federal income tax return 
additionally  net interest expense decreased approximately million during compared with due to the comprehensive refinancing completed in may of  as well as the reduction of debt balances outstanding through the sale of fixed assets and internally generated cash  and lower market interest rates 

table of contents the net income available to common stockholders during included a loss from continuing operations after preferred stock distributions of million  or per diluted share  while income from discontinued operations was million  or per diluted share 
contributing to the net income attributable to common stockholders during was a non cash gain of million related to the extinguishment of a million promissory note issued in connection with our federal stockholder litigation settlement  as further discussed below under the caption change in fair value of derivative instruments 
results for also included the non cash effect of an million charge associated with the accounting for an interest rate swap agreement required under prior terms of the old senior bank credit facility 
facility operations a key performance indicator we use to measure the revenue and expenses associated with the operation of the facilities we own or manage is expressed in terms of a compensated man day  and represents the revenue we generate and expenses we incur for one inmate for one calendar day 
revenue and expenses per compensated man day are computed by dividing facility revenue and expenses by the total number of compensated man days during the period 
a compensated man day represents a calendar day for which we are paid for the occupancy of an inmate 
we believe the measurement is useful because we are compensated for operating and managing facilities at an inmate per diem rate based upon actual or minimum guaranteed occupancy levels 
we also measure our ability to contain costs on a per compensated man day basis  which is largely dependent upon the number of inmates we accommodate 
further  per man day measurements are also used to estimate our potential profitability based on certain occupancy levels relative to design capacity 
revenue and expenses per compensated man day for all of the facilities we owned or managed  exclusive of those discontinued see further discussion below regarding discontinued operations  were as follows for the years ended december  and for the years ended december  revenue per compensated man day operating expenses per compensated man day fixed expense variable expense total operating margin per compensated man day operating margin average compensated occupancy management and other revenue consists of revenue earned from the operation and management of adult and juvenile correctional and detention facilities we own or manage and from our inmate transportation subsidiary  which  for the years ended december  and  totaled million and million  respectively 
business from our federal customers  including the federal bureau of prisons  or the bop  the united states marshals service  or the usms  and the immigration and naturalization service  or the ins  remains strong  while many of our state customers are currently experiencing budget difficulties 
our federal customers generated approximately of our total management revenue during  compared with approximately during while the budget difficulties experienced by our state customers present short term challenges with respect to our per diem rates resulting in pressure on our management revenue in future quarters  these governmental entities are also constrained with respect to funds available for 
table of contents prison construction 
as a result  because we believe inmate populations will continue to rise  we currently expect the lack of new bed supply to lead to higher occupancies in the long term 
in addition  where customers have requested a reduction in per diem rates  we have been somewhat successful in mitigating the reduction in revenue by obtaining the flexibility to reduce our operating expenses  such as through the reduction in the use of our various program services or through the consolidation of inmates into fewer facilities 
operating expenses totaled million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
operating expenses consist of those expenses incurred in the operation and management of adult and juvenile correctional and detention facilities  and for our inmate transportation subsidiary 
salaries and benefits represent the most significant component of fixed operating expenses and was the primary cause of the increase in fixed expenses per compensated man day 
during and  we have incurred wage increases due to tight labor markets for correctional officers and benefit increases due to surging healthcare costs 
the increase in salaries and benefits contributed approximately per compensated man day to the increase in fixed expenses per compensated man day from during to during further  the turnover rate for correctional officers for our company  and for the corrections industry in general  also remains high 
we are developing strategies to reduce our turnover rate  but we can provide no assurance that these strategies will be successful 
in addition  ten of our facilities currently have contracts with the federal government requiring that our wage and benefit rates comply with wage determination rates set forth  and as adjusted from time to time  under the service contract act of the us department of labor 
our contracts generally provide for reimbursement of a portion of the increased costs resulting from wage determinations in the form of increased per diems  thereby mitigating the effect of increased salaries and benefits expenses at those facilities 
we may also be subject to adverse claims  or government audits  relating to alleged violations of wage and hour laws applicable to us  which may result in adjustments to amounts previously paid as wages and  potentially interest and or monetary penalties 
we also experienced a trend of increasing insurance expense during compared with because we are significantly self insured for employee health  workers compensation  and automobile liability insurance  our insurance expense is dependent on claims experience and our ability to control our claims 
our insurance policies contain various deductibles and stop loss amounts intended to limit our exposure for individually significant occurrences 
however  the nature of our self insurance provides little protection for a deterioration in claims experience or increasing employee medical costs in general 
we continue to incur increasing insurance expense due to adverse claims experience primarily resulting from rising healthcare costs throughout the country 
we continue to develop new strategies to improve the management of our future loss claims  but can provide no assurance that these strategies will be successful 
additionally  general liability insurance costs have risen substantially since the terrorist attacks on september   and other types of insurance  such as directors and officers liability insurance  are currently expected to increase due to several recent high profile business failures and concerns about corporate governance and accounting in the marketplace 
unanticipated additional insurance expenses resulting from adverse claims experience or a continued increasing cost environment for general liability and other types of insurance could result in increasing expenses in the future 
during the first quarter of  we hired a general counsel to manage our existing legal matters and to develop procedures to minimize the incidence of litigation in the future 
we have been able to settle numerous cases on terms we believe are favorable 
however  variable operating expenses included million during  compared with million during  for an overall increase 
table of contents in potential exposure for certain legal proceedings  none of which was individually significant 
this increase of million contributed approximately per compensated man day to the increase in variable expenses per compensated man day from during to during further  it is possible that future cash flows and results of operations could be materially affected by changes in our assumptions  new developments  or by the effectiveness of our litigation and settlement strategies 
the operation of the facilities we own carries a higher degree of risk associated with a management contract than the operation of the facilities we manage but do not own because we incur significant capital expenditures to construct or acquire facilities we own 
additionally  correctional and detention facilities have a limited or no alternative use 
therefore  if a management contract is terminated with respect to a facility we own  we continue to incur certain operating expenses  such as real estate taxes  utilities  and insurance  that we would not incur if a management contract was terminated for a managed only facility 
as a result  revenue per compensated man day is typically higher for facilities we own and manage than for managed only facilities 
because we incur higher expenses  such as repairs and maintenance  real estate taxes  and insurance  with respect to the facilities we own and manage  our cost structure for facilities we own and manage is also higher than the cost structure for the managed only facilities 
the following tables display the revenue and expenses per compensated man day for the facilities we own and manage and for the facilities we manage but do not own for the year ended december  owned and managed facilities revenue per compensated man day operating expenses per compensated man day fixed expense variable expense total operating margin per compensated man day operating margin average compensated occupancy managed only facilities revenue per compensated man day operating expenses per compensated man day fixed expense variable expense total operating margin per compensated man day operating margin average compensated occupancy owned and managed facilities on may   we were awarded a contract by the bop to house  federal detainees at our mcrae correctional facility located in mcrae  georgia 
the three year contract  awarded as part of the criminal alien requirement phase ii solicitation  or car ii  also provides for seven one year renewals 
the contract with the bop guarantees at least occupancy on a take or pay basis  and commenced full operations in december of  resulting in an increase in management and other 
table of contents revenue upon commencement 
however  start up expenses were incurred prior to the commencement of the contract  including but not limited to  salaries  utilities  medical and food supplies and clothing  which resulted in additional operating expenses before any revenue was generated  resulting in a reduction in net income during the third and fourth quarters of during  we provided correctional services for the state of wisconsin at four of our facilities 
during the fourth quarter of  due to a short term decline in the state of wisconsin s inmate population  the state transferred approximately inmates out of our  bed whiteville correctional facility  located in whiteville  tennessee  to the state s correctional system  reducing the population of wisconsin inmates in our facilities to approximately  although the state of wisconsin continued transferring inmates out of our facilities during the first quarter of  our population of wisconsin inmates has gradually increased  primarily at our  bed prairie correctional facility  located in appleton  minnesota 
total management and other revenue at the whiteville facility decreased million  or  during compared with during september  we announced a contract award from the state of wisconsin to house up to a total of  medium security wisconsin inmates 
the new contract replaced the existing contract with the state of wisconsin on december  as of december   we managed approximately  wisconsin inmates under the contract 
during october  we entered into a new agreement with hardeman county  tennessee  with respect to the management of up to  medium security inmates from the state of tennessee in the whiteville correctional facility 
we have begun to receive tennessee inmates at the facility  and expect to continue receiving inmates under this contract through the first quarter of we expect this contract to contribute to an increase in management revenue during due to an increase in population at our  bed central arizona detention center  located in florence  arizona  and at our bed torrance county detention facility  located in estancia  new mexico  primarily from the usms and the ins  management and other revenue increased million and million  respectively  at these facilities during compared with the aforementioned acquisition in january of the crowley county correctional facility  located in olney springs  colorado  is expected to provide favorable investment returns contributing to an increase in our management revenue during  while adding capacity in a state where projections call for significant inmate growth over the next several years 
during the second quarter of  we were informed that our contract with the district of columbia to house its inmates in our northeast ohio correctional center  which expired september   would not be renewed due to a new law that mandated that the bop assume jurisdiction of all district of columbia offenders by the end of the northeast ohio correctional center is a  bed medium security prison 
the district of columbia began transferring inmates out of the facility during the second quarter of and completed the process in july total management and other revenue at this facility was approximately million during the year ended december  the related operating expenses at this facility were million during the year ended december  while no revenue was generated from this facility during  we incurred approximately million of operating expenses during the year ended december  for real estate taxes  utilities  insurance and other necessary expenses associated with owning the facility 
overall  our occupancy decreased by approximately  inmates at our facilities as a result of this mandate 
we have engaged in discussions with the bop regarding a sale of the northeast ohio correctional center to the bop  and are also continually exploring opportunities to 
table of contents reopen the facility  however  there can be no assurance that we will be able to reach agreements on a sale or to reopen this facility 
managed only facilities during the fourth quarter of  we committed to a plan to terminate our management contract at the southwest indiana regional youth village  a bed juvenile facility located in vincennes  indiana 
during the first quarter of  we entered into a mutual agreement with children and family services corporation  or cfsc  to terminate our management contract at the facility  effective april   prior to the contract s expiration date in in connection with the mutual agreement to terminate the management contract  cfsc also paid in full an outstanding note receivable totaling approximately million  which was previously considered uncollectible and was fully reserved 
the termination of this management contract has not had a material impact on our financial statements 
because management committed to the termination of this management contract prior to the effective date of statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  or sfas  the results of operations were not reported in discontinued operations 
on june   we received notice from the mississippi department of corrections terminating our contract to manage the  bed delta correctional facility located in greenwood  mississippi  due to the non appropriation of funds 
we ceased operations of the facility in october however  the state of mississippi agreed to expand the management contract at the wilkinson county correctional facility located in woodville  mississippi to accommodate an additional inmates 
as a result  the results of operations of the delta correctional facility are not reported in discontinued operations 
these events are not expected to have a material impact on our financial statements 
during july  we renewed our contract with tulsa county  oklahoma  for the management of inmates at the david l 
moss criminal justice center 
the contract renewal included an increase in the per diem rate  and also shifted to tulsa county  the burden of certain utility expenses  resulting in a modest improvement in profitability for the management of this facility during  compared with during the fourth quarter of  we were informed by the state of florida of its intention to terminate our contract to manage the bed okeechobee juvenile offender correctional center located in okeechobee  florida  upon the expiration of a short term extension to the existing management contract  which expired in december this termination  which occurred february   is not expected to have a material effect on the company s financial statements 
during  this facility generated total revenue and total operating expenses of million and million  respectively 
on march   we were notified by the department of corrections of the commonwealth of virginia of its intention to terminate our contract to manage the  bed lawrenceville correctional center located in lawrenceville  virginia  upon the expiration of the contract on march  this termination  which occurred on march   is not expected to have a material effect on our financial statements 
during  this facility generated total revenue and total operating expenses of million and million  respectively 

table of contents rental revenue rental revenue was million for the year ended december   compared with million during the year ended december  rental revenue was generated from leasing correctional and detention facilities to governmental agencies and other private operators 
on march   we sold the mountain view correctional facility  and on june   we sold the pamlico correctional facility  two facilities that had been leased to governmental agencies 
therefore  no further rental revenue has been received for these facilities during the year ended december  for the year ended december   rental revenue for these facilities totaled million 
general and administrative expense for the years ended december  and  general and administrative expenses totaled million and million  respectively 
general and administrative expenses consist primarily of corporate management salaries and benefits  professional fees and other administrative expenses  and increased from primarily due to an increase in professional fees incurred in connection with the implementation of tax strategies to maximize opportunities created by a change in tax law in march and the aforementioned settlement with the irs with respect to our predecessor s federal income tax return 
this increase was partially offset by a reduction in salaries and benefits  including incentive compensation 
depreciation and amortization for the years ended december  and  depreciation and amortization expense totaled million and million  respectively 
amortization expense for the year ended december  included approximately million for goodwill and million for amortization of workforce values  both of which were established in connection with acquisitions occurring in workforce values were classified into goodwill  and goodwill was no longer subject to amortization effective january   in accordance with a new accounting pronouncement  as further discussed under recent accounting pronouncements herein 
amortization expense during the year ended december  is also net of a reduction to amortization expense of million for the amortization of a liability relating to contract values established in connection with the mergers completed in due to certain of these liabilities becoming fully amortized during  the reduction to amortization expense during the year ended december  was million  resulting in a net increase in depreciation and amortization expense of million from to interest expense  net interest expense  net  is reported net of interest income for the years ended december  and gross interest expense was million and million  respectively  for the years ended december  and gross interest expense is based on outstanding convertible subordinated notes payable balances  borrowings under the new senior bank credit facility  the old senior bank credit facility  the senior notes  the senior notes  net settlements on an interest rate swap  and amortization of loan costs and unused facility fees 
the decrease in gross interest expense from the prior year is primarily attributable to lower average outstanding indebtedness  the comprehensive refinancing completed on may   which decreased the interest rate spread on the new senior bank credit facility  the termination of the interest rate swap agreement  lower amortization of loan costs  and a lower interest rate environment 
during  we paid down million in total debt through a combination of million in cash generated from asset sales and internally generated cash 

table of contents gross interest income was million and million  respectively  for years ended december  and gross interest income is earned on cash collateral requirements  direct financing leases  notes receivable and investments of cash and cash equivalents 
on october   we sold our southern nevada women s correctional facility  which had been accounted for as a direct financing lease 
therefore  no interest income was received on this lease during for the year ended december   interest income for this lease totaled million 
subsequent to the sale  we continue to manage the facility pursuant to a contract with the state of nevada 
change in fair value of derivative instruments in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  or sfas  as amended  we have reflected in earnings the change in the estimated fair value of our interest rate swap agreement during the years ended december  and we estimated the fair value of the interest rate swap agreement using option pricing models that value the potential for the interest rate swap agreement to become in the money through changes in interest rates during the remaining term of the agreement 
a negative fair value represented the estimated amount we would have to pay to cancel the contract or transfer it to other parties 
our swap agreement fixed libor at prior to the applicable spread on outstanding balances of at least million through its expiration on december  in accordance with sfas  we recorded a million non cash gain and an million non cash charge  respectively  for the change in fair value of the swap agreement for the years ended december  and these amounts included million for amortization of the transition adjustment  or the cumulative reduction in the fair value of the swap from its inception to the date we adopted sfas on january   during each year 
we were no longer required to maintain the existing interest rate swap agreement due to the early extinguishment of the old senior bank credit facility 
during may  we terminated the swap agreement prior to its expiration at a price of approximately million 
in accordance with sfas  we continued to amortize the unamortized portion of the transition adjustment as a non cash expense through december  the new senior bank credit facility required us to hedge at least million of the term loan portions of the facility within days following the closing of the loan 
in may  we entered into an interest rate cap agreement to fulfill this requirement  capping libor at prior to the applicable spread on outstanding balances of million through the expiration of the cap agreement on may  we paid a premium of million to enter into the interest rate cap agreement 
we expect to amortize this premium as the estimated fair values assigned to each of the hedged interest payments expire throughout the term of the cap agreement  amounting to million in and million in we have met the hedge accounting criteria under sfas and related interpretations in accounting for the interest rate cap agreement 
as a result  the estimated fair value of the interest rate cap agreement of  as of december  was included in other assets in the consolidated balance sheet  and the change in the fair value of the interest rate cap agreement of  during the year ended december  was reported through other comprehensive income in the statement of stockholders equity 
there can be no assurance that the interest rate cap agreement will be effective in mitigating our exposure to interest rate risk in the future  or that we will be able to continue to meet the hedge accounting criteria under sfas on december   we issued approximately million shares of common stock  along with a million subordinated promissory note  in conjunction with the final settlement of the federal court portion of our stockholder litigation settlement 
under the terms of the promissory note  the 
table of contents note and accrued interest became extinguished in january once the average closing price of the common stock exceeded a termination price equal to per share for fifteen consecutive trading days following the issuance of such note 
the terms of the note  which allowed the principal balance to fluctuate dependent on the trading price of our common stock  created a derivative instrument that was valued and accounted for under the provisions of sfas as a result of the extinguishment  we estimated the fair value of this derivative to approximate the face amount of the note  resulting in an asset being recorded during the fourth quarter of the derivative asset offsets the face amount of the note in the consolidated balance sheet as of december  since the estimated fair value of the derivative asset was equal to the face amount of the note as of december   the extinguishment had no financial statement impact in while the state court portion of the stockholder litigation settlement has also been settled  the payment of the settlement proceeds to the state court plaintiffs has not yet been completed  however  the settlement payment is expected to result in the issuance of approximately million additional shares of common stock and a million subordinated promissory note  which may also be extinguished if the average closing price of our common stock meets or exceeds per share for fifteen consecutive trading days following the note s issuance and prior to its maturity in additionally  to the extent our common stock price does not meet the termination price  the note will be reduced by the amount that the shares of common stock issued to the plaintiffs appreciate in value in excess of per share  based on the average trading price of the stock following the date of the note s issuance and prior to the maturity of the note 
if the remaining promissory note is issued under the current terms  in accordance with sfas  as amended  we will reflect in earnings the change in the estimated fair value of the written option embedded in the promissory note from quarter to quarter 
since we have reflected the maximum obligation of the contingency associated with the state court portion of the stockholder litigation in the consolidated balance sheet as of december   the issuance of the note is currently expected to have a favorable impact on our consolidated financial position and results of operations initially  thereafter  the financial statement impact will fluctuate based on changes in our stock price 
however  the impact cannot be determined until the promissory note is issued and an estimated fair value of the derivative included in the promissory note is determined 
the note is currently expected to be issued during income tax benefit we generated income tax benefits of approximately million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the increase in the income tax benefit during the year ended december   primarily resulted from the job creation and worker assistance act of which was signed into law on march  among other changes  the tax law extends the net operating loss carryback period to five years from two years for net operating losses arising in tax years ending in and  and allows use of net operating loss carrybacks and carryforwards to offset of the alternative minimum taxable income 
we experienced net operating losses during resulting primarily from the sale of assets at prices below the tax basis of such assets 
under terms of the new law  we utilized certain of our net operating losses to offset taxable income generated in and as a result of this tax law change in  we reported an income tax benefit and claimed a refund of approximately million during the first quarter of  which was received in april on october   we entered into a definitive settlement with the irs in connection with the irs s audit of our predecessor s federal income tax return 
under the terms of the settlement  in consideration for the irs s final determinations with respect to the tax year  in december we paid approximately million in cash to satisfy federal and state taxes and interest 

table of contents due to the change in tax law in march  the settlement created an opportunity to utilize any tax losses to claim a refund of a portion of the taxes paid 
we experienced tax losses during primarily resulting from a cumulative effect of accounting change in depreciable lives for tax purposes 
under terms of the new law  we utilized our net operating losses to offset taxable income generated in  which was increased substantially in connection with the settlement with the irs 
as a result of the tax law change in  combined with the adoption of an accounting change in the depreciable lives of certain tax assets  we will be due an income tax refund of approximately million 
the cumulative effect of accounting change in tax depreciation resulted in the establishment of a significant deferred tax liability for the tax effect of the book over tax basis of certain assets 
the creation of such a deferred tax liability  and the significant improvement in our tax position since the original valuation allowance was established to reserve our deferred tax assets  resulted in the reduction of the valuation allowance  generating an income tax benefit of approximately million during the fourth quarter of  as we determined that substantially all of these deferred tax liabilities will be utilized to offset the reversal of deferred tax assets during the net operating loss carryforward periods 
we continue to evaluate additional tax strategies to maximize the opportunities created by the new law  which could result in an additional income tax refund and income tax benefits  although we can provide no assurance that any such tax strategies will come to fruition 
as of december   our gross deferred tax assets totaled approximately million 
deferred income taxes reflect the net tax effect of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for income tax purposes 
realization of the future tax benefits related to deferred tax assets is dependent on many factors  including our ability to generate taxable income within the net operating loss carryforward period 
since the change in tax status in connection with the restructuring in  and as of december   we have provided a valuation allowance to substantially reserve the deferred tax assets in accordance with sfas the valuation allowance is recognized based on the weight of available evidence indicating that it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
this evidence primarily consists of  but is not limited to  recurring operating losses for federal tax purposes 
our assessment of the valuation allowance could change in the future based upon our actual and projected taxable income 
removal of the valuation allowance in whole or in part would result in a non cash reduction in income tax expense during the period of removal 
in addition  because a portion of the valuation allowance as of december  was established to reserve certain deferred tax assets upon the acquisitions of pmsi and jjfmsi  in accordance with sfas  removal of the valuation allowance would result in a reduction to any remaining goodwill recorded in connection with such acquisitions to the extent the reversal relates to the valuation allowance applied to deferred tax assets existing at the date pmsi and jjfmsi were acquired 
if the valuation allowance as of december  were to be removed in its entirety  the reduction to goodwill would amount to approximately million 
to the extent no valuation allowance is established for our deferred tax assets  future financial statements would reflect a provision for income taxes at the applicable federal and state tax rates on income before taxes

 accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and long lived assets to be disposed of  or sfas  required impairment losses to be recognized for long lived assets used in operations when indications of impairment were present and the estimate of undiscounted future cash flows was not sufficient to recover asset carrying amounts 
following the completion of the operating company merger and the acquisitions of pmsi and jjfmsi  during the fourth quarter of  after considering our financial condition  our new management developed a strategic operating plan to improve our financial position  and developed revised projections to evaluate various potential transactions 
management also conducted strategic assessments and evaluated our assets for impairment

loss on disposals of assets we incurred a loss on sales of assets during of approximately million 
during the fourth quarter of  jjfmsi sold its interest in cca australia resulting in a million loss 
this loss was offset by a gain of million resulting from the sale of a correctional facility located in kentucky  a gain of million on the sale of jjfmsi s interest in uk detention services limited and a loss of million resulting from the abandonment of a project under development 
unrealized foreign currency transaction loss in connection with the construction and development of the agecroft facility  located in salford  england  we extended a working capital loan to the operator of the facility 
this loan  along with various other short term receivables  are denominated in british pounds  consequently  we adjust these receivables to the current exchange rate at each balance sheet date  and recognize the currency gain or loss in current period earnings 
due to negative fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates between the british pound and the us dollar  we recognized net unrealized foreign currency transaction losses of million for the year ended december  
table of contents stockholder litigation settlement in february  we received court approval of the revised terms of the definitive settlement agreements regarding the settlement of all outstanding stockholder litigation against us and certain of our existing and former directors and executive officers 
pursuant to the terms of the settlement  we agreed to issue to the plaintiffs an aggregate of million shares of common stock and a subordinated promissory note in the aggregate principal amount of million 
as of december   we had accrued the estimated obligation of the contingency associated with the stockholder litigation  amounting to approximately million 
income taxes in connection with the corporate restructuring in  on september   our stockholders approved an amendment to our charter to remove provisions that required us to elect to qualify and be taxed as a real estate investment trust for federal income tax purposes effective january  as a result of the amendment to our charter  we have been taxed as a taxable subchapter c corporation beginning with our taxable year ended december  in accordance with the provisions of sfas  we were required to establish current and deferred tax assets and liabilities in our financial statements in the period in which a change of tax status occurred 
as such  our benefit for income taxes for the year ended december  included the provision associated with establishing the deferred tax assets and liabilities in connection with the change in tax status during the third quarter of  net of a valuation allowance applied to certain deferred tax assets 
recent accounting pronouncements effective january   we adopted sfas  which establishes new accounting and reporting requirements for goodwill and other intangible assets 
under sfas  all goodwill amortization ceased effective january  and goodwill attributable to each of our reporting units was tested for impairment by comparing the fair value of each reporting unit with its carrying value 
fair value was determined using a collaboration of various common valuation techniques  including market multiples  discounted cash flows  and replacement cost methods 
these impairment tests are required to be performed at adoption of sfas and at least annually thereafter 
on an ongoing basis absent any impairment indicators  we expect to perform our impairment tests during our fourth quarter  in connection with our annual budgeting process 
based on our initial impairment tests  we recognized an impairment of million to write off the carrying value of goodwill associated with our locations included in the owned and managed facilities during the first quarter of this goodwill was established in connection with the acquisition of operating company 
the remaining goodwill  which is associated with the facilities we manage but do not own  was deemed to be not impaired  and remains recorded on the balance sheet 
this remaining goodwill was established in connection with the acquisitions of pmsi and jjfmsi 
the implied fair value of goodwill of the locations included in the owned and managed reporting segment did not support the carrying value of any goodwill  primarily due to the highly leveraged capital structure 
no impairment of goodwill allocated to the locations included in the managed only reporting segment was deemed necessary  primarily because of the relatively minimal capital expenditure requirements  and therefore indebtedness  in connection with obtaining such management contracts 
under sfas  the impairment recognized at adoption of the new rules was reflected as a cumulative effect of accounting change in our statement of operations for the first 
table of contents quarter of impairment adjustments recognized after adoption  if any  are required to be recognized as operating expenses 
in august  the financial accounting standards board  or fasb  issued sfas sfas addresses financial accounting and reporting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets and supersedes sfas  and the accounting and reporting provisions of accounting principles board opinion no 
 reporting the results of operations reporting the effects of disposal of a segment of a business  and extraordinary  unusual  and infrequently occurring events and transactions  or apb  for the disposal of a segment of a business as previously defined in that opinion 
sfas retains the fundamental provisions of sfas for recognizing and measuring impairment losses on long lived assets held for use and long lived assets to be disposed of by sale  while also resolving significant implementation issues associated with sfas unlike sfas  however  an impairment assessment under sfas will never result in a write down of goodwill 
rather  goodwill is evaluated for impairment under sfas sfas also broadens the scope of defining discontinued operations 
the provisions of sfas are effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after december   and interim periods within those fiscal years 
under the provisions of sfas  the identification and classification of a facility as held for sale  or the termination of any of our management contracts for a managed only facility  by expiration or otherwise  would result in the classification of the operating results of such facility  net of taxes  as a discontinued operation  so long as the financial results can be clearly identified  and so long as we do not have any significant continuing involvement in the operations of the component after the disposal or termination transaction 
we adopted sfas on january  due to the sale of our interest in a juvenile facility during the second quarter of  as well as the termination of our management contracts during the second quarter of for the ponce young adult correctional facility and the ponce adult correctional facility and the termination of our management contract during the third quarter of for the guayama correctional center  in accordance with sfas  the operations of these facilities  net of taxes  have been reported as discontinued operations on our statements of operations for the years ended december  and the reclassification was not made to the statement of operations for the year ended december   as the discontinued operations are not material in that year  and because the financial statements are not comparable to the and financial statements  as previously discussed under results of operations herein 
in april  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 rescission of fasb statements no 
  and  amendment of fasb statement no 
 and technical corrections  or sfas sfas rescinds statement of financial accounting standards no 
 reporting gains and losses from extinguishment of debt  which required all gains and losses from extinguishment of debt to be aggregated and  if material  classified as an extraordinary item  net of the related income tax effect 
as a result  the criteria in apb will now be used to classify those gains and losses 
sfas amends statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for leases  to require that certain lease modifications that have economic effects similar to sale leaseback transactions be accounted for in the same manner as sale leaseback transactions 
sfas also makes technical corrections to existing pronouncements 
while those corrections are not substantive in nature  in some instances  they may change accounting practice 
the provisions of sfas are effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after may   and interim periods within those fiscal years 
during the second quarter of  prior to the required adoption of sfas  we reported an extraordinary charge of approximately million associated with the refinancing of our senior debt in may under sfas  any gain or loss on extinguishment of debt that was classified 
table of contents as an extraordinary item in prior periods that does not meet the criteria in apb for classification as an extraordinary item shall be reclassified 
we plan to adopt sfas on january  accordingly  in financial reporting periods after adoption  the extraordinary charge reported in the second quarter of will be reclassified 
in june  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities  or sfas sfas addresses financial accounting and reporting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities and nullifies emerging issues task force issue no 
 liability recognition for certain employee termination benefits and other costs to exit an activity including certain costs incurred in a restructuring  or issue sfas requires that a liability for a cost associated with an exit or disposal activity be recognized when the liability is incurred 
under issue  a liability for an exit cost as generally defined in issue was recognized at the date of an entity s commitment to an exit plan 
the provisions of sfas are effective for exit or disposal activities that are initiated after december   with early application encouraged 
adoption of sfas is not expected to have a material impact on our financial statements 
in november  the fasb issued fasb interpretation no 
 guarantor s accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees  including indirect guarantees of indebtedness of others  or fin fin requires that the guarantor recognize  at the inception of certain guarantees  a liability for the fair value of the obligation undertaken in issuing such guarantees 
fin also requires additional disclosure requirements about the guarantor s obligations under certain guarantees that it has issued 
the initial recognition and measurement provisions of this interpretation are applicable on a prospective basis to guarantees issued or modified after december  and the disclosure requirements are effective for financial statement periods ending after december  through december   adoption of fin has not had a material effect on our financial statements 
the future effect of fin on our financial statements will depend on whether we enter into new or modify existing guarantees 
on december   the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure  or sfas sfas amends fasb statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  or sfas  to provide alternative methods of transition to sfas s fair value method of accounting for stock based employee compensation 
sfas also amends the disclosure provisions of sfas and accounting principles board  or apb  opinion no 
 interim financial reporting  to require disclosure in the summary of significant accounting policies of the effects of an entity s accounting policy with respect to stock based employee compensation on reported net income and earnings per share in annual and interim financial statements 
while sfas does not amend sfas to require companies to account for employee stock options using the fair value method  the disclosure provisions of sfas are applicable to all companies with stock based employee compensation  regardless of whether they account for that compensation using the fair value method of sfas or the intrinsic value method of apb no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees 
inflation we do not believe that inflation has had or will have a direct adverse effect on our operations 
many of our management contracts include provisions for inflationary indexing  which mitigates an adverse impact of inflation on net income 
however  a substantial increase in personnel costs  workers compensation or food and medical expenses could have an adverse impact on our results of operations in the future to the extent that these expenses increase at a faster pace than the per diem or fixed rates we receive for our management services 

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our primary market risk exposure is to changes in us interest rates and fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates between the us dollar and the british pound 
we are exposed to market risk related to our new senior bank credit facility and certain other indebtedness 
the interest on the new senior bank credit facility and such other indebtedness is subject to fluctuations in the market 
we were also exposed to market risk related to our old senior bank credit facility prior to its refinancing in may if the interest rate for our outstanding indebtedness under the old senior bank credit facility and the new senior bank credit facility was basis points higher or lower during the years ended december   and  our interest expense  net of amounts capitalized  would have been increased or decreased by approximately million  million and million  respectively  including the effects of our interest rate swap arrangements discussed below 
as of december   we had outstanding million of senior notes with a fixed interest rate of  million of senior notes with a fixed interest rate of  million of convertible subordinated notes with a fixed interest rate of  million of convertible subordinated notes with a fixed interest rate of  million of series a preferred stock with a fixed dividend rate of and million of series b preferred stock with a fixed dividend rate of 
because the interest and dividend rates with respect to these instruments are fixed  a hypothetical increase or decrease in market interest rates would not have a material impact on our financial statements 
the old senior bank credit facility required us to hedge million of our floating rate debt 
we entered into certain swap arrangements fixing libor at prior to the applicable spread on outstanding balances of at least million through december  the difference between the floating rate and the swap rate was recognized in interest expense each period 
effective january   the change in the fair value of the swap agreement from period to period was reflected in earnings and was largely due to changing interest rates and the reduction in the remaining life of the swap during the reporting period 
in may  we terminated the interest rate swap agreement at a price of approximately million 
in addition  in order to satisfy a requirement of the new senior bank credit facility we purchased an interest rate cap agreement  capping libor at prior to the applicable spread on outstanding balances of million through the expiration of the cap agreement on may   for a price of million 
we may  from time to time  invest our cash in a variety of short term financial instruments 
these instruments generally consist of highly liquid investments with original maturities at the date of purchase between three and twelve months 
while these investments are subject to interest rate risk and will decline in value if market interest rates increase  a hypothetical increase or decrease in market interest rates would not materially affect the value of these investments 
our exposure to foreign currency exchange rate risk relates to our construction  development and leasing of our agecroft facility located in salford  england  which was sold in april we extended a working capital loan to the operator of this facility 
such payments to us are denominated in british pounds rather than the us dollar 
as a result  we bear the risk of fluctuations in the relative exchange rate between the british pound and the us dollar 
at december   the receivables due us and denominated in british pounds totaled million british pounds 
a 
table of contents hypothetical increase in the relative exchange rate would have resulted in an increase of million in the value of these receivables and a corresponding unrealized foreign currency transaction gain  and a hypothetical decrease in the relative exchange rate would have resulted in a decrease of million in the value of these receivables and a corresponding unrealized foreign currency transaction loss
