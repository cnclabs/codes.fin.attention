item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
the following discussion will assist you in understanding our financial position  liquidity  and results of operations 
the information below should be read in conjunction with the financial statements  and the related notes to financial statements 
our discussion contains both historical and forward looking information 
we assess the risks and uncertainties about our business  long term strategy  and financial condition before we make any forward looking statements  but we cannot guarantee that our assessment is accurate or that our goals and projections can or will be met 
statements concerning results of future exploration  exploitation  development  and acquisition expenditures as well as expense and reserve levels are forward looking statements 
we make assumptions about commodity prices  drilling results  production costs  administrative expenses  and interest costs that we believe are reasonable based on currently available information 
long term strategy and business developments our long term strategy is to increase our oil and gas production and reserves while keeping our operating costs and our finding and development costs competitive with our industry peers 
over the last three years  we have invested million in oil and gas properties  found bcfe of proved reserves and replaced of our production at an average finding and development cost of per mcfe 
the following table reflects our results during the last three years 
increase increase decrease decrease production oil mbbls    gas mmcf    total mmcfe    proved reserves oil mbbls    gas mmcf    total mmcfe    operating costs per mcfe finding costs per mcfe percentage of production replaced barrels of oil are converted to mcf equivalents mcfe at the ratio of barrel of oil equals mcf of gas 
finding costs include acquisition  development and exploration costs including exploration costs such as seismic acquisition costs 
reserves sold bcfe in and bcfe in are excluded from this calculation 
critical accounting policies we prepare our consolidated financial statements for inclusion in this report using accounting principles that are generally accepted in the united states gaap 
our notes to consolidated financial statements included on pages through in this report have a more comprehensive discussion of our significant accounting policies 
gaap represents a comprehensive set of accounting and disclosure rules and requirements 
we must make judgments  estimates  and in certain circumstances  choices between acceptable gaap alternatives as we apply these rules and requirements 
successful efforts method of accounting oil and gas exploration and production companies choose one of two acceptable accounting methods  successful efforts or full cost 
the most significant difference between the two methods relates to the accounting treatment of drilling costs for unsuccessful exploration wells dry holes and exploration costs 
under the successful efforts method  we recognize exploration costs and dry hole costs as an expense on the income statement when incurred and capitalize the costs of successful exploration wells as oil and gas properties 
entities that follow the full cost method capitalize all drilling and exploration costs including dry hole costs into one pool of total oil and gas property costs 
we use the successful efforts method because we believe that it more conservatively reflects on our balance sheet historical costs that have future value 
however  using successful efforts often causes our income statement to fluctuate significantly between reporting periods based on our drilling success or failure during the periods 
it is typical for companies that drill a significant number of exploration wells  as we do  to incur dry hole costs 
during the last three years we have drilled exploration wells  of which were considered dry holes 
our dry hole costs charged to expense during this period totaled million out of total exploratory drilling costs of million 
it is impossible to predict future dry holes  however we estimate that between and of our exploration wells and exploration drilling costs will be dry holes  based on past experience 
proved reserve estimates independent reserve engineers prepare our oil and gas reserve estimates using guidelines put forth under gaap and by the securities and exchange commission 
the quality and quantity of data  the interpretation of the data  and the accuracy of mandated economic assumptions combined with the judgment exercised by the reserve engineers affect the accuracy of the estimated reserves 
in addition  drilling or production results after the date of the estimate may cause material revisions to the reserve estimates 
you should not assume that the present value of the future net cash flow disclosed in this report reflects the current market value of the oil and gas reserves 
in accordance with the securities and exchange commission s guidelines  we use prices and costs determined on the date of the estimate and a discount rate to determine the present value of future net cash flow 
actual prices and costs may vary significantly  and the discount rate may or may not be appropriate based on outside economic conditions 
in our year end reserve report we used december   west texas intermediate posted price of per barrel and a gulf coast spot market price of per mmbtu adjusted by property for energy content  quality  transportation fees  and regional price differentials 
we estimated the costs based on the prior year costs incurred for individual properties or similar properties if a particular property did not have production during the prior year 
while we believe that future costs can be reasonably estimated  future prices are difficult to estimate since the market prices are influenced by events beyond our control 
current world political events have caused oil prices to increase significantly since december  future global economic and political events will most likely result in significant fluctuations in future oil prices 
in addition  cold weather during the first quarter of in the united states has resulted in significant fluctuations in natural gas prices 
depletion  depreciation  and amortization of oil and gas properties we calculate depletion  depreciation  and amortization expense dd a using the estimates of proved oil and gas reserves 
we segregate the costs for individual or contiguous properties or projects and record dd a of these property costs separately using the units of production method 
material downward revisions in reserves increase the dd a per unit and reduce our net income  likewise  material upward revisions lower the dd a per unit and increase our net income 
impairment of oil and gas properties because we account for our proved oil and gas properties separately  we assess our assets for impairment property by property rather than in one pool of total oil and gas property costs 
this method of assessment is another feature of successful efforts method of accounting 
certain unforeseeable events such as significantly decreased long term oil or gas prices  failure of a well or wells to perform as projected  insufficient data on reservoir performance  and or unexpected or increased costs may cause us to record an impairment expense on a particular property 
we base our assessment of possible impairment using our best estimate of future prices  costs and expected net cash flow generated by a property 
we estimate future prices based on nymex month strips  adjusted for basis differential and escalate both the prices and the costs for inflation if appropriate 
if these estimates indicate an impairment  we measure the impairment expense as the difference between the net book value of the asset and its estimated fair value measured by discounting the future net cash flow from the property at an appropriate rate 
actual prices  costs  discount rates  and net cash flow may vary from our estimates 
in  we adopted statement of financial accounting sfas standards no 
accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  which superseded sfas no 
accounting for impairment of long lived assets 
the statement addresses financial accounting and reporting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
the adoption of this statement did not have a material effect on our balance sheet or income statement in we recognized impairment expenses during the last three years as follows for the years ended december  in thousands unproved properties  proved properties   total impairment expense   through december   we assessed the capitalized costs of unproved properties periodically to estimate whether their value has been impaired below the capitalized costs  recognizing a loss to the extent such impairment was indicated 
in making these estimations  we considered factors such as exploratory drilling results  future drilling plans and lease expiration terms 
effective january   we estimate the amount of individually insignificant unproved properties which will prove unproductive by amortizing the balance of our individually immaterial unproved property costs adjusted by an anticipated rate of future successful development over an average lease term 
the effect of this change in estimate was not material to our results of operations 
individually significant properties will continue to be evaluated periodically on a separate basis for impairment 
we will transfer the original cost of an unproved property to proved properties when we find commercial oil and gas reserves sufficient to justify full development of the property 
the impairment of unproved properties for the prior two years primarily resulted from the actual due to unsuccessful exploration results or impending forfeiture of leaseholds 
we impaired proved properties for and because of insufficient future net cash flows based on the proved developed reserves as determined by our independent reserve engineers 
the properties impaired in  included two properties in the gulf of mexico which totaled million and two in the onshore gulf coast which totaled million 
during  we impaired three proved properties in the offshore gulf of mexico that accounted for million and one proved property in south texas that accounted for million of the total million 
the impairment expense on proved properties for resulted form insufficient oil and gas reserves on a small property in alabama 
under the above critical accounting policies our net income can vary significantly from period to period because events or circumstances which trigger recognition as an expense for unsuccessful wells or impaired properties cannot be accurately forecast 
in addition  selling prices for our oil and gas fluctuate significantly 
therefore we focus more on cash flow from operations and on controlling our finding and development  operating  administration  and financing costs 
accounting for stock based compensation in june  the board of directors approved contingent stock grants to our employees and directors 
in order for the grants to become effective  the price of our stock had to increase from per share to a trigger price of per share and close at or above per share for consecutive trading days 
further  the trigger price had to be achieved within years of the grant date 
this increase from per share to per share represented a compound annual rate of return of for years 
on the grant date we did not record any amounts for expense  liability  or equity because the measurement date for determining the compensation cost depended on the occurrence of an event after the date of grant 
therefore  we could not be sure that we would incur any expense as a result of the grants  and we could not reasonably estimate the amount of possible expense 
january   became the measurement date when the stock price closed above the trigger price for the twentieth consecutive trading day 
on that date  we measured the total compensation cost at million which was the total number of shares granted multiplied by the market price on that date 
we recorded million as restricted common stock  million as unearned compensation reported as a separate reduction in stockholders equity on the balance sheet  and million as stock based compensation expense 
the million stock based compensation expense recorded in the first quarter of included a catch up amortization from the date of the grant to the measurement date of the total compensation cost because the cost should be recognized over the time period in which the stock grant vested to the employees or directors 
we recorded million in and million in as stock based compensation expense related to the grants 
at december   million of the unearned compensation remained unamortized and will be amortized as the shares vest during the next three years 
the vesting period could accelerate in the event of a change in control of the company or the death or permanent disability of an employee 
a shorter vesting period would accelerate the amortization period 
except as noted above  the shares will be issued only to the extent the employees and directors remain with the company through the vesting dates 
in accounting for stock options granted to employees and directors  we have chosen to continue to apply the accounting method promulgated by accounting principles board opinion apb no 
rather than apply an alternative method permitted by sfas no 
under apb no 
 at the time of grant we do not record compensation expense on our income statement for stock options granted to employees or directors 
if we applied an alternative method permitted by sfas no 
 our net income would be lower than actually reported 
we disclose in our notes to consolidated financial statements the pro forma effect on our income statement if we were to record the estimated fair value of stock options on the date granted and amortize the expense over the expected vesting of the grant 
we chose the apb no 
method because we believe that the true cost of options is reflected under this method 
if and when the market price of the stock exceeds the option exercise price  the potential dilution is reflected in diluted earnings per share 
we believe this dilution is the only true cost of the option 
further  we believe that also including a theoretical or estimated dollar expense in the income statement amounts to double counting in calculating diluted income per share subtracting an amount from the numerator and adding an amount to the denominator to reflect the same non cash item 
defined benefit pension plan total assets at fair market value public market prices for equity and fixed income mutual funds for our two defined benefit pension plans were million which exceeded the total accumulated benefit obligation as of december  we recorded  in pension expense and contributed million to the plans during we have consistently used an estimate for our long term rate of return on plan assets and believe that this remains appropriate based on our plans historical rates of return and on long term historical rates of return for indices similar to our current plan asset allocation of equities and fixed income securities 
if however  we reduced the assumed rate of return by basis points  our projected pension plan expense would increase by approximately  and our net income would decrease by approximately  the discount rate is another critical assumption in determining pension liabilities and expenses 
we are required to use a rate that approximates the market rate for high quality  long term fixed income investments 
accordingly  we reduced our discount rate assumption from in to in a lower discount rate increases the calculated present value of benefit obligations and increases pension expense 
if the discount rate decreases by basis points  our projected pension expense would increase by approximately  and our net income would decrease by approximately  liquidity and capital resources the following table summarizes our contractual obligations and commercial commitments as of december  payments due by period total less than year years years after years in thousands contractual obligations bank debt   other long term payables    office lease  total    on december   our current assets exceeded our current liabilities by million 
our current ratio was to 
cash flow provided by operations before changes in working capital accounts for the year ended december   increased by million  or  compared to the prior year 
we expect that our cash flow provided by operations before changes in working capital accounts for to increase because of higher projected oil and gas prices  increased production from new properties  and consistent operating  general and administrative and interest and financing costs per mcf equivalent mcfe 
the table below reflects our revenue and cost structure on an mcfe basis for the primary components of our cash flow provided by operations before changes in working capital for the past three years 
years ending december  production mmcfe    operating revenue oil and gas sales other income excluding gains from sale of properties 
total operating revenue costs and expenses operating costs 
exploration costs excluding dry hole costs 
general and administrative 
interest and financing expense 
total recurring costs net cash provided by operations before changes in working capital our cash flow from operations before changes in working capital fluctuates primarily because of our oil and gas sales  excluding the effects of significant unforeseen expenses or other income 
our oil and gas production will vary based on actual well performance or may be curtailed due to factors beyond our control 
hurricanes in the gulf of mexico will shut down our production for the duration of the storm  or as in the case of hurricane lili in  damage production facilities so that we cannot produce a particular property for an extended amount of time 
in addition  downstream activities on major pipelines in the gulf of mexico can also cause us to shut in production for various lengths of time 
oil and gas prices will also vary significantly due to world political events  supply and demand of products  or weather patterns in the geographical united states 
we sell the vast majority of our production at spot market prices 
accordingly  product price volatility can significantly affect our cash flow 
to mitigate affects of this volatility  we sometimes lock in prices for some portion of our production usually less than through the use of forward sale agreements 
see additional discussion under commodity price risk in item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk significant changes in our working capital accounts from to include an increase in our accounts receivable a decrease in our cash flow provided by operations due to higher oil and gas prices  increased production and increased balances due from our joint interest participants due to an increase in operating activities drilling wells and facilities construction at year end 
cash flow provided by operations decreased due to an increase in prepaid expenses and other current assets because of an increase in prepaid drilling costs on non operated properties and increased pension plan contributions 
in addition  due to the increase in operating activities our accounts payable increased by million 
we incurred capital and exploration expenditures totaling million during the capital expenditures included million for leasehold acquisition  million for exploration costs  million for development costs including platform and facilities construction 
during the year  we built and installed  or will install in  offshore platforms and facilities 
in addition  in we drilled exploration wells and development wells 
we expect to continue to make significant capital expenditures over the next several years as part of our long term growth strategy 
we have budgeted million for capital expenditures in our capital and exploration budget includes million for exploratory wells 
we project that we will spend million on wells in the gulf of mexico and million on onshore wells in south texas and mississippi 
the budget also includes million for platforms and development drilling on operated discoveries at south marsh island block  west cameron blocks  and  east cameron block  and eugene island blocks  and the remaining million will be allocated to leasehold acquisitions  seismic acquisitions  and workovers 
we expect that our cash  estimated future cash flow from operations  and available bank line of credit will be adequate to fund these expenditures for the remainder of if our exploratory drilling results in significant new discoveries  we will have to acquire additional capital in order to finance the completion  development  and potential additional opportunities generated by our success 
we believe that  because of the additional reserves resulting from the exploratory success and our record of reserve growth in recent years  we will be able to acquire sufficient additional capital through additional bank financing and or offerings of debt or equity securities 
in march we issued million shares of common stock at per share 
net proceeds from the offering totaled approximately million 
we used million of the net proceeds to reduce outstanding bank debt from million to million  and we used the remainder for working capital 
as of december   our amended credit facility has a borrowing base of million 
as of march   we had million borrowed under the facility 
the banks review the borrowing base semi annually and may increase or decrease the borrowing base at their discretion relative to the new estimate of proved oil and gas reserves 
the banks will reevaluate the borrowing base in april our oil and gas properties are pledged as collateral for the line of credit 
additionally  we have agreed not to pay dividends 
unless renewed or extended  the line of credit expires on may   when all principal becomes due 
the most significant financial covenants in the line of credit include maintaining a minimum current ratio as defined in the agreement of to  a minimum tangible net worth of million plus of net income accumulated from the inception of the agreement and of any non redeemable preferred or common stock offerings  and interest coverage of to we are currently in compliance with these financial covenants in all material respects 
if we don t comply with these covenants  the lenders have the right to refuse to advance additional funds under the facility and or declare all principal and interest immediately due and payable 
results of operations in  we recorded net income totaling million or basic income per share  and diluted income per share  compared to a net income of million or basic income per share and diluted income per share in the increase in net income resulted primarily from lower total costs and expenses  primarily the million settlement expense for phillips petroleum recorded in in addition  total revenues decreased by primarily because of lower gas prices 
the following table discloses the net oil and gas production volumes  sales  and sales prices for each of the three years ended december    and the table is an integral part of the following discussion of results of operations for the periods compared to and compared to increase increase decrease decrease oil production volume mbbls    oil sales revenue    price per bbl increase decrease in oil sales revenue due to change in prices   change in production volume  total increase decrease in oil sales revenue   gas production volume mmcf    gas sales revenue    price per mcf increase decrease in gas sales revenue due to change in prices  change in production volume   total increase decrease in gas sales revenue   compared to oil sales revenue increased by million  or  because oil production increased by  barrels  or  and average oil prices increased by or 
oil production from offshore gulf of mexico increased by  barrels  or  because of production from new properties 
oil production from onshore gulf coast properties decreased by  barrels  or  because of natural depletion of the existing producing properties and the sale of certain properties in south texas in april average prices increased from in to in  which increased oil revenues by million 
gas sales revenue decreased by million  or because of lower average gas prices and lower production 
average gas prices decreased from per mcf in to per mcf  or  in  causing gas sales revenues to decrease by million 
production decreased by bcf  or  primarily because of lower gas production from the offshore gulf of mexico 
during the fourth quarter of we lost production from a well on east cameron block the production from this property during was bcf compared to bcf during the decrease from this property was partially offset by increased gas production from new offshore properties 
other income increased primarily because of a million gain on the sale of certain immaterial south texas properties in april total operating costs remained unchanged 
however  operating costs per mcfe increased from to  or primarily because of new operated properties in the gulf of mexico and fixed platform costs on certain properties with decreased production due to natural depletion and hurricanes during september and october of partially offset by lower workover costs during compared to the prior year 
impairment expense for included a million charge for impaired proved property costs and million for amortization of unproved property costs 
during  we recorded million for impairment charges of proved property costs and  for impairment of unproved property costs 
exploration expenses increased by million  or  because of increased dry hole costs during partially offset by a million decrease in seismic expenses in compared to depreciation  depletion and amortization expense increased by  or less than for the year ended december   compared to the prior year 
during  depreciation  depletion and amortization increased to per mcfe from per mcfe in general and administrative expenses decreased by  or  due primarily to lower legal fees 
stock based compensation expense decreased by million or because in we included a catch up provision related to the contingent stock grants 
the catch up included the period june the date of the grant to january the date of measurement 
the grant became effective in january when the requirements for the triggering of the stock grants were achieved 
during the second quarter of  we settled the phillips litigation and charged million to settlement expense 
interest and financing expense decreased because of lower interest rates and lower outstanding debt 
income taxes increased by million as a result of increased income before taxes 
compared to oil production increased by in compared to the prior year because of a increase in offshore gulf of mexico production partially offset by lower oil production from mississippi and south texas 
oil production from the gulf of mexico increased because of new wells that began producing in average oil prices decreased during which in turn caused oil sales revenues to be million lower 
gas sales revenue increased by million or because of a increase in production compared to production from the offshore gulf of mexico increased by bcf  or  while gas production from south texas decreased by bcf  or 
five offshore properties began to produce for the first time during and three additional offshore properties increased their production significantly either from new wells drilled and completed or because was their first full year of production 
we expected the decrease in production from south texas after we sold certain properties in the change in average prices did not affect total gas revenues significantly 
interest income decreased by  or because of lower rates earned on our short term investments and because we used the million of restricted cash previously set aside for the phillips petroleum judgment in the settlement of that litigation in may other income decreased because we had a non recurring million gain from the sale of south texas properties in operating costs and expenses increased by million  or  because of new producing properties 
however  operating expenses per mcfe increased to from  or less than 
exploration expenses increased by million  or  because of increased dry hole costs for two offshore and one onshore well compared to six onshore wells in offshore wells typically are significantly more costly than the onshore wells 
the impairment expense for primarily resulted from insufficient future net cash flow for three offshore gulf of mexico properties  which accounted for million  one south texas property  which accounted for million  and one unproved offshore gulf of mexico property lease that was forfeited in which accounted for  depreciation  depletion and amortization expense increased by million because of production from new properties 
general and administrative expenses have remained substantially level with prior year amounts 
stock based compensation expense includes million for amortization of compensation costs related to the contingent stock grant and  for stock based directors fees 
on may   we settled the litigation with phillips petroleum company 
of the total million settlement  we had previously recorded million as an accrued liability 
we recorded million of the remaining million as additional settlement expense and capitalized million as the cost for our purchase of the net profits interest 
in addition  we charged the remaining million deferred net profits expense related to a royalty settlement in to the settlement expense 
during  we reached two separate agreements with the minerals management service concerning the royalties due on offshore gulf of mexico properties 
because of the agreements  we recorded expenses of million during interest and financing costs decreased because of lower interest rates applicable to our outstanding debt and because we are no longer accruing interest on the phillips judgment 
during  we recorded income tax expense totaling million  all of which is deferred 
we fully utilized our net deferred income tax benefit during and the first quarter of new accounting pronouncements sfas no 
accounting for asset retirement obligations will be effective for years beginning after june  the statement requires that we estimate the fair value for our asset retirement obligations dismantlement and abandonment of oil and gas wells and offshore platforms in the periods the assets are first placed in service 
currently we accrue the estimated liability for dismantlement and abandonment over the life of the property using a unit of production method 
because of this new standard  effective january   we must increase both our recorded assets and liabilities by the estimated cost of the ultimate asset retirement obligation 
we will then increase the estimated obligation amount by contingency and inflation factors  and then discount the total amount to present value 
further  on a periodic basis we will record the accretion of the discount 
for properties owned at december   we estimate the undiscounted asset retirement obligation to be approximately million 
we will also amortize the cost into depletion  depreciation  and amortization expense 
the charges to the income statement will not be materially different under this standard as compared to our present method 
in december  the financial accounting standards board issued sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure 
sfas no 
amends sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  to provide alternative methods of transition to sfas no 
s fair value method of accounting for stock based employee compensation 
sfas no 
also amends the disclosure provisions of sfas no 
and apb no 
 interim financial reporting  to require disclosure in the summary of significant accounting policies of the effects of an entity s accounting policy with respect to stock based employee compensation on reported net income and earnings per share in annual and interim financial statements 
while sfas no 
does not amend sfas no 
to require companies to account for employee stock options using the fair value method  the disclosure provisions of sfas no 
are applicable to all companies with stock based employee compensation  regardless of whether they account for that compensation using the fair value method of sfas no 
or the intrinsic value method of apb no 
we disclose in our notes to consolidated financial statements the pro forma effect on our income statement if we were to record the estimated fair value of stock options on the date granted and amortize the expense over the expected vesting of the grant 
in june  the financial accounting standards board issued sfas no 
 accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities 
sfas no 
addresses accounting and financial reporting for costs associated with certain exit or disposal activities 
we do not anticipate initiating any activities that are subject to this standard 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk our revolving bank line of credit is sensitive to changes in interest rates 
at december   the unpaid principal balance under the line was million which approximates its fair value 
the interest rate on this debt is based on a premium of to basis points over the london interbank offered rate libor 
the rate is reset periodically  usually every three months 
if on december   libor changed by one full percentage point basis points the fair value of our revolving debt would change by approximately  we have not entered into any interest rate hedging contracts 
commodity price risk a vast majority of our production is sold on the spot markets 
accordingly  we are at risk for the volatility in the commodity prices inherent in the oil and gas industry 
occasionally we sell forward portions of our production under physical delivery contracts that by their terms cannot be settled in cash or other financial instruments 
such contracts are not subject to the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards no 
accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
accordingly we do not provide sensitivity analysis for such contracts 
for the period january   through march   we did not have any forward sales contracts in place 
for the period april   through december   we have physical delivery contracts in place to sell  mmbtu of gas per day and  barrels of oil per day at the following prices price per period barrel mmbtu april  through june  july  through september  october  through december
