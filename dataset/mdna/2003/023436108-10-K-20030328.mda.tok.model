these judgements and estimates are based on  among other things  historical experience and information available from outside sources 
the critical accounting policies presented below have been discussed with the audit committee as to the development and selection of the accounting estimates used as well as the disclosures provided herein 
actual results could differ materially from these estimates 
revenue recognition the company has agreements with third party payors that provide for payments to the company at amounts different from its established rates 
gross revenue is recorded on an accrual basis based upon the date of service at amounts equal to the company s established rates or estimated reimbursement rates  as applicable 
allowances and contractual adjustments are recorded for the difference between the established rates and the amounts estimated to be payable by third parties and are deducted from gross revenues to determine net service revenues 
net service revenues are the estimated net amounts realizable from patients  third party payors and others for services rendered  including estimated retroactive adjustments under reimbursement agreements 
prior to the implementation of the medicare prospective payment system pps on october   reimbursement for home health care services to patients covered by the medicare program was based on reimbursement of allowable costs subject to certain limits 
final reimbursement was determined after submission of annual cost reports and audits thereof by the fiscal intermediaries 
retroactive adjustments have been accrued on an estimated basis in the period the related services were rendered and will be adjusted in future periods as final settlements are determined 
estimated settlements for cost report years ended and subsequent years  which are still subject to audit by the intermediary and the department of health and human services  are recorded in short term and long term medicare liabilities 
under the new pps rules  annual cost reports are still required as a condition of participation in the medicare program 
however  there are no final settlements or retroactive adjustments 
under pps  the company is paid by medicare based on episodes of care 
an episode of care is defined as a length of care up to sixty days with multiple continuous episodes allowed 
a base episode payment is established by the medicare program through federal legislation for all episodes of care ended on or after the applicable time periods detailed below period base episode payment beginning october  through march   per episode april  through september   per episode october  through september   per episode october  through september   per episode 
table of contents with respect to medicare reimbursement changes  the applicability of the reimbursement change is dependent upon the completion date of the episode  therefore  changes in reimbursement  both positive and negative  will impact the financial results of the company up to sixty days in advance of the effective date 
the base episode payment is adjusted by applicable regulations including  but not limited to  the following a case mix adjuster consisting of eighty home health resource groups hhrg  the applicable geographic wage index  low utilization  intervening events and other factors 
the episode payment will be made to providers regardless of the cost to provide care 
the services covered by the episode payment include all disciplines of care  in addition to medical supplies  within the scope of the home health benefit 
revenue is recognized as services are provided based on the number of patient visits performed during the reporting period and a historical weighted average revenue per visit rate 
this rate is based on the historical average final episode payment divided by the historical average number of visits per episode 
episodes in progress at the end of the reporting period are reviewed on a percentage of completion basis using the historical average total number of visits per episode 
the company further refined its medicare revenue recognition process during the year ended december  through an analysis of all episodes completed from october  through december  with respect to the historical average calculations referred to above 
no material modifications resulted from this process and the company intends to continue this analysis on an ongoing basis 
collectibility of accounts receivable the process for estimating the ultimate collectibility of accounts receivable involves judgement  with the greatest subjectivity relating to non medicare accounts receivable 
the company currently records an allowance for uncollectible accounts on a percentage of revenues basis unless a specific issue is noted  at which time an additional allowance may be recorded 
in the fourth quarter of  the company terminated a number of contracts with non medicare payors and recorded an additional allowance of  given the uncertain nature of collectibility in relation to these contracts
