item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
significant accounting policies valuation of investments portfolio investments are carried at fair value with the net change in unrealized appreciation or depreciation included in the determination of net assets 
valuations of portfolio securities are performed in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states and the financial reporting policies of the securities and exchange commission sec 
the applicable methods prescribed by such principles and policies are described below publicly traded portfolio securities investments in companies whose securities are publicly traded are valued at their quoted market price at the close of business on the valuation date  less a discount to reflect the estimated effects of restrictions on the sale of such securities valuation discount  if applicable 
privately held portfolio securities the fair value of investments for which no market exists of the investments held by the fund at december  is determined on the basis of procedures established in good faith by the board of directors of the fund 
as a general principle  the current fair value of an investment would be the amount the fund might reasonably expect to receive for it upon its current sale  in an orderly manner 
appraisal valuations are necessarily subjective and the management company s estimate of values may differ materially from amounts actually received upon the disposition of portfolio securities 
generally  cost is the primary factor used to determine fair value until significant developments affecting the portfolio company such as results of operations or changes in general market conditions provide a basis for use of an appraisal valuation 
thereafter  portfolio investments are carried at appraised values as determined quarterly by the management company  subject to the approval of the board of directors 
appraisal valuations are based upon such factors as a portfolio company s earnings  cash flow and net worth  the market prices for similar securities of comparable companies  an assessment of the company s current and future financial prospects and various other factors and assumptions 
in the case of unsuccessful operations  the appraisal may be based upon liquidation value 
most of the fund s common equity investments are appraised at a multiple of free cash flow generated by the portfolio company in its most recent fiscal year  less outstanding funded indebtedness and other senior securities such as preferred stock 
projections of current year free cash flow may be utilized and adjustments for non recurring items are considered 
multiples utilized are estimated based on the management company s experience in the private company marketplace  and are necessarily subjective in nature 
most of the portfolio companies utilize a high degree of leverage 
the banking environment currently has resulted in pressure on several of these portfolio companies to reduce the amount of leverage in order to maintain such financing 
from time to time  portfolio companies are in default of certain covenants in their loan agreements 
when the management company has a reasonable belief that the portfolio company will be able to restructure the loan agreements to adjust for any defaults  the portfolio company s securities continue to be valued assuming that the company is a going concern 
in the event a portfolio company cannot generate adequate cash flow to meet the principal and interest payments on such indebtedness or is not successful in refinancing the debt upon its maturity  the value of the fund s investment could be reduced or eliminated through foreclosure on the portfolio company s assets or the portfolio company s reorganization or bankruptcy 
the fund may also use  when available  third party transactions in a portfolio company s securities as the basis of valuation the private market method 
the private market method will be used only with respect to completed transactions or firm offers made by sophisticated  independent investors 
the fair values of debt securities  which are generally held to maturity  are determined on the basis of the terms of the debt securities and the financial conditions of the issuer 
certificates of deposit purchased by the fund generally will be valued at their face value  plus interest accrued to the date of valuation 
because of the inherent uncertainty of the valuation of portfolio securities which do not have readily ascertainable market values  the fund s estimate of fair value may significantly differ from the value that would have been used had a ready market existed for the securities 
on a daily basis  the fund adjusts its net asset value for the changes in the value of its publicly held securities and material changes in the value of its private securities and reports those amounts to lipper analytical services  inc weekly and daily net asset values appear in various publications  including barron s and the wall street journal 
federal income taxes the fund intends to comply with the requirements of the internal revenue code necessary to qualify as a regulated investment company and  as such  will not be subject to federal income taxes on otherwise taxable income including net realized capital gains which is distributed to shareholders 
therefore  no provision for federal income taxes is recorded in the financial statements 
as of december   the fund has a capital loss carryforward of  which may be used to offset future taxable capital gains 
the fund borrows money from time to time to maintain its tax status under the internal revenue code as a regulated investment company ric 
see borrowings and loss of conduit tax treatment for further discussions of the fund s borrowings 
liquidity and capital resources at december   the fund had  of its assets invested in portfolio securities of companies and two venture capital funds 
the fund had a  revolving line of credit with bank of america  na that expired on december  the line of credit was subsequently extended until june   and amended to provide for maximum borrowings of  the fund uses its revolving line of credit for liquidity to pay operating expenses of the fund and for new and follow on investments in portfolio securities 
the fund had  outstanding under this line of credit at december   which is collateralized by the fund s investments in portfolio securities 
in addition  the fund had irrevocable letters of credit in the amount of  outstanding at year end  which reduces the amount of additional borrowings available under the line of credit 
the letters of credit expired subsequent to year end 
as of april   the fund s availability under the revolving line of credit is approximately  the line of credit  as amended  provides that any proceeds received from the sale of portfolio securities or from repayments by portfolio companies of the principal amount of loans must be used to pay down the line of credit 
as such payments are made  the fund s availability under the facility will be reduced by a corresponding amount 
the line of credit also restricts the fund s ability to incur additional indebtedness  pay dividends  merge with another entity  dispose of assets outside the ordinary course of business and engage in certain transactions with affiliates 
the lender has asked the fund to take steps to pay off the line of credit 
accordingly  the fund is currently in discussions with several interested parties regarding the sale of certain portfolio securities at values that could enable the fund to repay the line of credit 
the fund is also pursuing arrangements to refinance the line of credit with another lender and may approach the current lender for another extension of the due date 
there can be no assurance that the fund can sell securities sufficient to pay off the line of credit  extend the existing line of credit or obtain a replacement facility by june  should the fund be unable to repay the line of credit  extend it or refinance it with another lender  portfolio securities may be required to be sold and such sales may be at values that are materially less than management s estimates of fair value 
under certain circumstances  the fund may be called on to make follow on investments in certain portfolio companies 
the fund has guaranteed obligations to financial institutions on behalf of reliant window holdings  llc rwh and equicom  inc equicom in the respective amounts of  and  rwh is currently servicing its obligations to the financial institution  and management does not expect the fund to have to pay anything in relation to this guarantee 
the fund has made loans to equicom from time to time to enable the company to service its debt  but management does not expect the fund to advance more than  in for such purpose 
in addition  the fund has committed to invest up to  in the two venture capital funds in its portfolio 
at december    of such amount had been funded  and an additional  was funded on march  management does not expect the fund to advance more than  of its remaining commitments to the venture capital funds in if the fund does not have sufficient funds to make follow on investments  the portfolio company in need of the investment may be negatively impacted 
also  the fund s equity interest in and its estimated fair value of the portfolio company could be reduced 
net cash used by operating activities was   and  for the three years ended december   and  respectively 
management expects net cash needed for operating activities to remain at comparable levels during management believes that borrowings available under the revolving line of credit  net investment income and proceeds from sales of portfolio securities will be sufficient for the liquidity needs of the fund 
approximately million in estimated value of the fund s investments are in the form of notes receivable from portfolio companies 
at december   three of these notes  with an estimated fair value of  provide that interest is paid in kind or that the original issue discount is accreted over the life of the notes  by adding such amount to the principal of the notes 
because of the nature and size of its portfolio investments  the fund periodically borrowed money under a line of credit promissory note to make qualifying investments to maintain its tax status under the internal revenue code as a ric 
the fund s line of credit promissory note expired on january  management believes the fund will be able to borrow sufficient funds to maintain its ric status in the future by utilizing an established margin account with a securities brokerage firm  supplemented by collateralized loans from banks  if necessary 
however  there are no assurances that such arrangement will be available to the fund in the future 
if the fund is unable to borrow funds to make qualifying investments  the fund may no longer qualify as a ric 
the fund would then be subject to corporate income tax on its net investment income and realized capital gains  and stockholders would be subject to income tax on distributions 
failure to continue to qualify as a ric could be material to the fund s shareholders 
at december   the fund had  of its total assets of  invested in temporary cash investments consisting of money market securities 
this amount includes restricted temporary cash investments of  purchased from borrowings pursuant to a note payable to a bank 
the fund utilized such investments at december  to achieve adequate diversification to maintain its pass through tax status as a regulated investment company 
the note payable to the bank is collateralized by these restricted temporary cash investments  which were used to repay the bank on january  the fund has the ability to borrow funds and issue forms of senior securities representing indebtedness or stock  such as preferred stock  subject to certain restrictions 
net investment income and net realized gains from the sales of portfolio investments are intended to be distributed at least annually  to the extent such amounts are not reserved for payment of expenses and contingencies or to make follow on or new investments 
pursuant to the restrictions in the fund s existing line of credit  the fund is not allowed to incur additional indebtedness unless approved by the lender 
the fund reserves the right to retain net long term capital gains in excess of net short term capital losses for reinvestment or to pay contingencies and expenses 
such retained amounts  if any  will be taxable to the fund as long term capital gains and stockholders will be able to claim their proportionate share of the federal income taxes paid by the fund on such gains as a credit against their own federal income tax liabilities 
stockholders will also be entitled to increase the adjusted tax basis of their fund shares by the difference between their undistributed capital gains and their tax credit 
results of operations investment income and expense net investment income after all expenses amounted to   and  for the years ended december   and  respectively 
with respect to investment income  income from portfolio securities was  in   in and  in the decrease in and compared to is attributable primarily to interest no longer being accrued and accrued interest written off on notes receivable from certain portfolio companies in and  plus the receipt in of previously unaccrued interest from one portfolio company

during  the officers of the fund exercised options to purchase  shares of common stock of the fund 
the exercise price was paid in the form of promissory notes from the officers to the fund 
during  the officers of the fund surrendered their shares in payment of their notes 
under variable plan accounting applicable to these transactions  compensation expense was adjusted to reflect the change in benefit that the officers would have received assuming that their notes were settled with their pledged common stock at the end of each reporting period  based on the net asset value of the fund 
non cash compensation expense benefit under this arrangement was  and  for the years ended december  and  respectively  and was recorded as an adjustment to additional paid in capital 
on november   options to acquire a total of  shares at per share market price on date of grant were issued to officers of the fund

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk the fund is subject to financial market risks  including changes in interest rates with respect to its investments in debt securities and its outstanding debt payable  as well as changes in marketable equity security prices 
the fund does not use derivative financial instruments to mitigate any of these risks 
the return on the fund s investments is generally not affected by foreign currency fluctuations 
the fund s investment in portfolio securities consists of some fixed rate debt securities 
since the debt securities are generally priced at a fixed rate  changes in interest rates do not directly impact interest income 
in addition  changes in market interest rates are not typically a significant factor in the fund s determination of fair value of these debt securities  since the securities are generally held to maturity 
their fair values are determined on the basis of the terms of the debt security and the financial condition of the issuer 
borrowings under the fund s lines of credit expose the fund to certain market risks 
based on the average outstanding borrowings under its lines of credit for the year ended december  and  respectively  of approximately  and  a change of one percent in the interest rate would have caused a change in interest expense of approximately  and  this change would have resulted in a change of in the net asset value per share at december  and the fund did not enter into its credit facility for trading purposes and the line of credit carries interest at a pre agreed upon percentage point spread from the prime rate 
in addition  there were no significant changes to the factors that affect market risk from to the fund s existing line of credit expires on june  see management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations regarding the fund s liquidity and capital resources 
a major portion of the fund s investment portfolio consists of debt and equity investments in private companies 
modest changes in public market equity prices generally do not significantly impact the estimated fair value of these investments 
however  significant changes in market equity prices can have a longer term effect on valuations of private companies  which could affect the carrying value and the amount and timing of gains or losses realized on these investments 
a portion of the fund s investment portfolio also consists of common stocks in publicly traded companies 
these investments are directly exposed to equity price risk  in that a hypothetical ten percent change in these equity prices would result in a similar percentage change in the fair value of these securities
