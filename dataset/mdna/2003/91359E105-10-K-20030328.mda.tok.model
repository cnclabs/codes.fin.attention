item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations forward looking statements and certain risk factors the matters discussed in this report  as well as the news releases issued from time to time by the trust  include certain statements containing the words believes  anticipates  intends  expects and words of similar import  which constitute forward looking statements within the meaning of private securities litigation reform act of such forward looking statements involve known and unknown risks  uncertainties and other factors that may cause the actual results  performance or achievements of the trust s or industry results to be materially different from any future results  performance or achievements expressed or implied by such forward looking statements 
such factors include  among other things  the following a substantial portion of the trust s revenues are dependent on one operator  universal health services  inc  uhs  uhs is advisor to the trust and the trust s officers are all employees of uhs which may create the potential for conflicts of interest  a substantial portion of the trust s leases are involved in the healthcare industry which is undergoing substantial changes and is subject to possible changes in the levels and terms of reimbursement from third party payors and government reimbursement programs  including medicare and medicaid  the trust s ability to finance its growth on favorable terms  including the trust s ability to refinance on acceptable terms  its credit facility which expires in june   liability and other claims asserted against the trust or operators of the trust s facilities  the fact that the trust has majority ownership interests in various llcs in which it holds non controlling equity interests  and other factors referenced in the trust s form k 
a large portion of the trust s non hospital properties consist of medical office buildings which are either directly or indirectly affected by the factors discussed above as well as general real estate factors such as the supply and demand of office space and market rental rates 
additionally  the operators of the trust s facilities  including uhs  are confronted with other issues such as industry capacity  demographic changes  existing laws and government regulations and changes in or failure to comply with laws and governmental regulations  the ability to enter into managed care provider agreements on acceptable terms  competition  the loss of significant customers  technological and pharmaceutical improvements that increase the cost of providing  or reduce the demand for healthcare  the ability to attract and retain qualified personnel  including physicians 
in addition  operators of the trust s facilities  particularly uhs  have experienced a significant increase in property insurance including earthquake insurance in california and general and professional liability insurance 
as a result  certain operators have assumed a greater portion of their liability risk and there can be no assurance that a continuation of these unfavorable trends  or a sharp increase in claims asserted against the operators of the trust s facilities  which are self insured  will not have a material adverse effect on their future results of operations 
in order to qualify as a real estate investment trust reit the trust must comply with certain highly technical and complex requirements 
although the trust intends to remain so qualified  there may be facts and circumstances beyond the trust s control that may affect the trust s ability to qualify as a reit 
failure to qualify as a reit may subject the trust to income tax liabilities  including federal income tax at regular corporate rates 
the additional income tax incurred may significantly reduce the cash flow available for distribution to shareholders and for debt service 
in addition  if disqualified  the trust might be barred from qualification as a reit for four years following disqualification 
although the trust believes it has been qualified as a reit since its inception  there can be no assurance that the trust has been so qualified or will remain qualified in the future 
management of the trust is unable to predict the effect  if any  these factors will have on the operating results of the trust or its lessees  including the facilities leased to subsidiaries of uhs 
given these uncertainties  prospective investors are cautioned not to place undue reliance on such forward looking statements 
management of the trust disclaims any obligation to update any such factors or to publicly announce the result of any revisions to any of the forward looking statements contained herein to reflect future events or developments 
results of operations the trust commenced operations on december  as of december   the trust had investments in forty two facilities located in fifteen states 
the trust invests in healthcare and human service related facilities including acute care hospitals  behavioral healthcare facilities  rehabilitation hospitals  sub acute care facilities  surgery centers  child care centers and medical office buildings

funds from operations ffo  which is a commonly used performance measure for reits  may not be calculated in the same manner for all companies  and accordingly  ffo as presented below may not be comparable to similarly titled measures by other companies 
ffo does not represent cash flows from operations as defined by generally accepted accounting principles and should not be considered as an alternative to net income as an indicator of the trust s operating performance or to cash flows as a measure of liquidity 
in june of  the trust issued million additional shares of beneficial interest at per share generating net proceeds of million to the trust 
these proceeds were used to repay outstanding borrowings under the trust s million revolving credit facility thereby decreasing interest expense and increasing ffo from june  through december  ffo is calculated as follows s net income amortization of interest rate cap loss gain on derivatives depreciation expense consolidated investments unconsolidated affiliates provision for investment loss  net consolidated investments unconsolidated affiliates gain on sale of real property consolidated investments unconsolidated affiliates ffo general since the majority of the trust s income is derived from lease payments on acute care hospitals and medical office buildings  the trust is substantially dependent on such things as healthcare regulations and reimbursement to healthcare facilities since these factors  among other things  affect the lease payments to the trust and the underlying property values 
a significant portion of the revenues from the trust s hospital facilities are derived from the medicare and medicaid programs as well as managed care plans which include health maintenance organizations hmos and preferred provider organizations ppos 
generally  the trust s hospital facilities continue to experience an increase in revenues attributable to managed care payors as pressures to control healthcare costs  as well as a shift away from traditional medicare to medicare managed care plans  have resulted in an increase in the number of patients whose healthcare coverage is provided under managed care plans 
typically  the trust s hospital facilities receive lower payments per patient from managed care payors than from traditional indemnity insurers 
however  during the past two years  many of the trust s acute care hospital facilities secured price increases from many of its commercial payors including managed care companies 
the consequent growth in managed care networks and the resulting impact of these networks on the operating results of the trust s facilities vary among the markets in which the trust s facilities operate 
outpatient treatment and diagnostic facilities  outpatient surgical centers and freestanding ambulatory surgical centers also impact the healthcare marketplace 
many of the trust s hospital facilities continue to experience an increase in outpatient revenues which is primarily the result of advances in medical technologies and pharmaceutical improvements  which allow more services to be provided on an outpatient basis  and increased pressure from medicare  medicaid  hmos  ppos and insurers to reduce hospital stays and provide services  where possible  on a less expensive outpatient basis 
the hospital industry in the united states  as well as the trust s hospital facilities  continue to have significant unused capacity which has created substantial competition for patients 
inpatient utilization continues to be negatively affected by payor required  pre admission authorization and by payor pressure to maximize outpatient and alternative healthcare delivery services for less acutely ill patients 
the trust expects its hospital facilities to continue to experience increased competition and admission constraints 
the federal government makes payments to participating acute care hospitals under its medicare program based on various formulas 
the operators of the trust s general acute care hospitals are subject to a prospective payment system pps 
for inpatient services  pps pays acute care hospitals a predetermined amount per diagnostic related group drg  for which payment amounts are adjusted to account for geographic wage differences 
beginning august  under an outpatient prospective payment system opps mandated by the balanced budget act of bba  general acute care hospitals are paid for outpatient services included in the opps according to ambulatory procedure codes apc which group together services that are comparable both clinically and with respect to the use of resources 
the payment for each item or service is determined by the apc to which it is assigned 
the apc payment rates are calculated on a national basis and adjusted to account for certain geographic wage differences 
the medicare  medicaid and schip balanced budget refinement act of bbra of included transitional corridor payments through fiscal year  which provide some financial relief for any hospital that generally incurs a reduction to its medicare outpatient reimbursement under the new opps 
in addition to the trends described above that continue to have an impact on the operating results of the trust s hospital facilities  there are a number of other more general factors affecting the operators of the trust s acute care hospital facilities 
bba called for the government to trim the growth of federal spending on medicare by billion and on medicaid by billion over the ensuing years 
this enacted legislation also called for reductions in the future rate of increases to payments made to hospitals and reduced the amount of payments for outpatient services  bad debt expense and capital costs 
some of these reductions were temporarily reversed with the passage of the medicare  medicaid and schip benefits improvement and protection act of bipa which  among other things  increased medicare and medicaid payments to healthcare providers by billion over the ensuing years with approximately billion of this amount targeted for hospitals and billion for managed care payors 
however  many of the payment reductions reversed by congress in bipa are expiring 
in addition  without further congressional action  in fiscal year hospitals will receive less than a full market basket inflation adjustment for services paid under the inpatient pps inpatient pps update of the market basket minus percentage points is estimated to equal in fiscal year  although cms estimates that for the same time period  medicare payment rates under opps will increase  for each service  by an average of 
in february   the federal fiscal year omnibus spending federal legislation was signed into law 
this legislation includes approximately million in increased spending for hospitals 
more specifically  million of this amount is targeted for rural and certain urban hospitals effective for the period of april  through september  one of the trust s hospital facilities is eligible for and is expected to receive the increased medicare reimbursement resulting from this legislation  however  the impact is not expected to have a material effect on the future results of operations of the facility 
the trust can provide no assurance that the above mentioned factors will not adversely affect the operators of the trust s facilities 
however  within certain limits  a hospital can manage its costs  and  to the extent this is done effectively  a hospital may benefit from the drg system 
however  many hospital operating costs are incurred in order to satisfy licensing laws  standards of the joint commission on the accreditation of healthcare organizations jcaho and quality of care concerns 
in addition  hospital costs are affected by the level of patient acuity  occupancy rates and local physician practice patterns  including length of stay  judgments and number and type of tests and procedures ordered 
a hospital s ability to control or influence these factors which affect costs is  in many cases  limited 
a large portion of the trust s non hospital properties consist of medical office buildings which are located either close to or on the campuses of hospital facilities 
these properties are either directly or indirectly affected by the factors discussed above as well as general real estate factors such as the supply and demand of office space and market rental rates 
the trust anticipates on investing in additional healthcare related facilities and leasing the facilities to qualified operators  perhaps including uhs and subsidiaries of uhs 
market risks associated with financial instruments the trust s interest expense is sensitive to changes in the general level of domestic interest rates 
to mitigate the impact of fluctuations in domestic interest rates  a portion of the trust s debt is fixed rate accomplished by entering into interest rate swap agreements 
the interest rate swap agreements are contracts that require the trust to pay a fixed rate and receive a floating interest rate over the life of the agreements 
the floating rates are based on libor and the fixed rates are determined upon commencement of the swap agreements 
the trust does not hold or issue derivative instruments for trading purposes and is not a party to any instruments with leverage features 
the trust is exposed to credit losses in the event of non performance by the counterparties to its financial instruments 
the trust has entered into interest rate swap agreements which were designed to reduce the impact of changes in interest rates on its variable rate revolving credit notes 
at december   the trust had three outstanding swap agreements having a total notional principal amount of million which mature from may  through november  these swap agreements effectively fix the interest rate on million of variable rate debt at including the revolver spread of 
the interest rate swap agreements were entered into in anticipation of certain borrowing transactions made by the trust 
additional interest expense income recorded as a result of the trust s hedging activity  which is included in the effective interest rates shown above  was   and  in  and  respectively 
the trust is exposed to credit loss in the event of nonperformance by the counterparties to the interest rate swap agreements 
these counterparties are major financial institutions and the trust does not anticipate nonperformance by the counterparties which are rated a or better by moody s investors service 
termination of the interest rate swaps at december  would have resulted in payments to the counterparties of approximately  the fair value of the interest rate swap agreements at december  reflects the estimated amounts that the trust would pay or receive to terminate the contracts and are based on quotes from the counterparties 
for the years ended december   and  the trust received a weighted average rate of  and  respectively  and paid a weighted average rate on its interest rate swap agreements  including the revolver spread of  of in and in and the table below presents information about the trust s derivative financial instruments and other financial instruments that are sensitive to changes in interest rates  including interest rate swaps as of december  for debt obligations  the table presents principal cash flows and related weighted average interest rates by contractual maturity dates 
for interest rate swap agreements  the table presents notional amounts by expected maturity date and weighted average interest rates based on rates in effect at december  maturity date  year ending december dollars in thousands thereafter total long term debt fixed rate average interest rates variable rate long term debt interest rate swaps pay fixed receive variable notional amounts a average pay rate fair value   average receive rate month libor month libor a the counterparty has the one time option to cancel a million interest rate swap on november  effects of inflation although inflation has not had a material impact on the trust s results of operations over the last three years  the healthcare industry is very labor intensive and salaries and benefits are subject to inflationary pressures as are rising supply costs which tend to escalate as vendors pass on the rising costs through price increases 
operators of the trust s hospital facilities are experiencing the effects of the tight labor market  including a shortage of nurses which has caused and may continue to cause an increase  in excess of the inflation rate  in salaries  wages and benefits expense 
in addition  due to unfavorable pricing and availability trends in the professional and general liability insurance markets  the cost of commercial professional and general liability insurance coverage has risen significantly 
as a result  certain operators of the trust s hospital facilities  including all of the facilities leased to subsidiaries of uhs  assumed a greater portion of the hospital professional and general liability risk 
the trust cannot predict the ability of the operators of its facilities to continue to cover future cost increases 
therefore  there can be no assurance that a continuation of these trends  will not have a material adverse effect on the future results of operations of the operators of the trust s facilities which may affect their ability to make lease payments to the trust 
most of the trust s leases contain provisions designed to mitigate the adverse impact of inflation 
the trust s hospital leases require all building operating expenses  including maintenance  real estate taxes and other costs  to be paid by the lessee 
in addition  certain of the hospital leases contain bonus rental provisions  which require the lessee to pay additional rent to the trust based on increases in the revenues of the facility over a base year amount 
in addition  most of the trust s medical office building leases require the tenant to pay an allocable share of operating expenses  including common area maintenance costs  insurance and real estate taxes over a base year amount 
these provisions may reduce the trust s exposure to increases in operating costs resulting from inflation 
to the extent that some leases do not contain such provisions  the trust s future operating results may be adversely impacted by the effects of inflation 
liquidity and capital resources it is the trust s intention to declare quarterly dividends to the holders of its shares of beneficial interest so as to comply with applicable sections of the internal revenue code governing real estate investment trusts 
covenants relating to the revolving credit facility limit the trust s ability to increase dividends in excess of of cash available for distribution unless additional distributions are required to be made to comply with applicable sections of the internal revenue code and related regulations governing real estate investment trusts

see note to the consolidated financial statements for additional disclosures 
significant accounting policies the trust has determined that the following accounting policies are critical to the understanding of the trust s consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition revenue is recognized on the accrual basis of accounting 
the trust s revenues consist primarily of rentals received from tenants  which are comprised of minimum rent base rentals  bonus rentals and reimbursements from tenants for their pro rata share of expenses such as common area maintenance costs  real estate taxes and utilities 
the minimum rent for all hospital facilities is fixed over the initial term or renewal term of the respective leases 
minimum rent for other material leases is recognized using the straight line method under which contractual rent increases are recognized evenly over the lease term 
bonus rents are recognized based upon increases in each facility s net patient revenue in excess of stipulated amounts 
bonus rentals are determined and paid each quarter based upon a computation that compares the respective facility s current quarter s revenue to the corresponding quarter in the base year 
tenant reimbursements are accrued as revenue in the same period the related expenses are incurred by the trust 
investments in limited liability companies llcs the consolidated financial statements of the trust include the accounts of its controlled investments 
in accordance with the american institute of certified public accountants statement of position accounting for investments in real estate ventures and emerging issues task force issue  investor s accounting for an investee when the investor has a majority of the voting interest but the minority shareholder or shareholders have certain approval or veto rights  the trust accounts for its investments in llcs which it does not control using the equity method of accounting 
these investments  which represent to non controlling ownership interests  are recorded initially at the trust s cost and subsequently adjusted for the trust s net equity in the net income  cash contributions and distributions of the investments 
in january  the fasb issued interpretation no 
 consolidation of variable interest entities  an interpretation of arb no 
this interpretation addresses the consolidation by business enterprises of variable interest entities as defined in the interpretation 
the interpretation applies immediately to variable interests in variable interest entities created after january   and to variable interests in variable interest entities obtained after january  the provisions of this interpretation will be applicable to the trust beginning in the third quarter of upon application of fasb interpretation no 
 consolidation of variable interest entities  the trust believes that certain of its llc investments may meet the criteria of a variable interest entity and it is reasonably possible that the trust will be required to consolidate certain llcs 
the results of operations  and the assets  liabilities and equity of any such llcs would be included in the consolidated financial statements of the trust  with a minority interest reflected for the portion of the llcs held by other members 
as the trust has not yet determined which llcs will meet the criteria of variable interest entities  management is unable to determine the impact on the trust s balance sheet 
if the trust is required to consolidate any of the llcs  there would be no impact on the trust s net income 
federal income taxes no provision has been made for federal income tax purposes since the trust qualifies as a real estate investment trust under sections to of the internal revenue code of  and intends to continue to remain so qualified 
as such  the trust is exempt from federal income taxes and it is required to distribute at least of its real estate investment taxable income to its shareholders 
the trust is subject to a federal excise tax computed on a calendar year basis 
the excise tax equals of the amount by which of the trust s ordinary income plus of any capital gain income for the calendar year exceeds cash distributions during the calendar year  as defined 
no provision for excise tax has been reflected in the financial statements as no tax was due 
earnings and profits  which determine the taxability of dividends to shareholders  will differ from net income reported for financial reporting purposes due to the differences for federal tax purposes in the cost basis of assets and in the estimated useful lives used to compute depreciation and the recording of provision for investment losses
