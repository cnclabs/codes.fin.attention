item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations general we are a worldwide leader in the development  manufacture  marketing and service of process control metrology systems for use in the manufacture of semiconductors 
process control metrology is used to monitor process parameters in order to enable semiconductor manufacturers to maintain high yields on the production lines  reduce feature size  increase wafer size  increase equipment productivity and improve device performance 
our metrology systems are used in all sections of the semiconductor fabrication plant  or fab  to control the wafer fabrication processes 
examples of wafer fab processes  in which our metrology systems supply key information  are photoresist processing to support lithography  deposition of insulator and conductor films  patterned removal  or etching  of insulator and conductor films  ion implantation and chemical mechanical planarization 
we currently sell four product families of process control metrology systems therma probe systems  opti probe systems  opti probe cd systems  and integra integrated metrology systems 
therma probe product family 
therma probe systems utilize our proprietary thermal wave technology and are the predominant non destructive process control metrology systems used to measure the critical ion implantation process on product wafers in the fabrication of semiconductors 
opti probe product family 
opti probe film metrology systems provide the industry s most powerful capability to control and diagnose non opaque films for semiconductor production 
this unsurpassed metrology power is achieved by successfully integrating different measurement technologies  including optical technologies that are proprietary to our company  into each opti probe system 
opti probe cd product family 
opti probe cd systems measure the lateral dimensions  or cd  using a revolutionary  nondestructive technique based on spectroscopic ellipsometry 
these systems are capable of providing cd metrology for the smallest features of the next several generations of ic s 
integra product family 
the integra line of integrated metrology products is a broad based family of compact metrology modules which are installed and function inside an ic process system  such as an etching system or cvd deposition system  to provide metrology on each wafer before it exits the process tool 
we derive our revenues from system sales  which have historically consisted primarily of our therma probe and opti probe systems  sales of replacement and spare parts  and service contracts 
the following table summarizes our revenues in different categories as a percentage of total net revenues for the periods indicated 
fiscal years ended march  net revenues product service and parts total net revenues the fluctuations in these percentages are related primarily to the upturns and downturns of the semiconductor industry 
sales of replacement and spare parts  and service contracts tend to reflect more the installed base of systems previously sold than current system sales  and therefore  the dollars of such sales do not fluctuate as widely as systems sales 
that causes the percentage of replacement and spare parts  and service contracts sales to be higher in downturns and lower in upturns 
international sales accounted for approximately  and of our total revenues for fiscal  and  respectively 
we anticipate that international sales will continue to account for a significant portion of our revenues in the foreseeable future 
a substantial portion of our international sales are denominated in us dollars 
as a result  changes in the values of foreign currencies relative to the value of the us dollar can render our products comparatively more expensive 
although we have not been negatively impacted in the past by foreign currency changes in japan  korea  china  taiwan  singapore  israel and europe  such conditions could negatively impact our international sales in future periods 
critical accounting policies and estimates our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the methods  estimates and judgments we use in applying our accounting policies has a significant impact on the results we report in our financial statements 
on an on going basis  management evaluates its estimates and judgments  including those related to inventories  revenue recognition  in process research and development  or ipr d  goodwill and intangible assets  income taxes and warranty accruals 
management bases its estimates and judgments on historical experience and on various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
management believes the following critical accounting policies affect its more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements revenue recognition 
effective april   we changed our method of accounting for revenue recognition in accordance with securities and exchange commission staff accounting bulletin no 
 or sab  revenue recognition in financial statements 
historically  revenues from systems and spare parts were generally recognized at the time of shipment 
revenues on service contracts are deferred and recognized on a straight line basis over the period of the contract 
estimated contractual warranty obligations are recorded when related sales are recognized 
under sab  equipment sales are accounted for as multiple element arrangement sales that require the deferral of a significant portion of revenues in the amount of the greater of fair market value of installation and a percentage of payment subject to final acceptance 
the total revenues are allocated to each component of the multiple element arrangement 
revenues on each element are recognized when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  the sales price is fixed and determinable  the contractual obligations have been performed  title and risk of loss have passed to the customer  collectibility of the sales price has been reasonably assured and customer final acceptance has been obtained if applicable 
freight terms of all standard product sales are fob shipping point unless otherwise negotiated and agreed in written form between our customers and us 
shipments typically are made in compliance with shipment requirements specified in our customer s purchase order 
revenues on new products are recognized upon customer final acceptance 
where the customer has the right to return the product  the revenues are not recognized until all of the following conditions have been evidenced after the customer s purchase order has been fulfilled the right of return has expired and any potential returns would require authorization by our company under warranty provisions  the price of the sales is fixed or determinable  the payment terms are fixed and enforceable and collectibility is reasonably assured 
we monitor and track the amount of product returns and reduce revenues at the time of shipment for the estimated amount of such future returns  based on historical experience 
while product returns have historically been within our expectations and the provisions established  there is no assurance that we will continue to experience the same return rates that we have in the past 
any significant increase in product return rates could have a material adverse impact on our operating results for the period or periods in which such returns or increased costs materialize 
we make estimates evaluating an allowance for doubtful accounts 
we continuously monitor collections and payments from our customers and maintain a provision for estimated credit losses based upon our historical experience and any specific customer collection issues that we have identified 
while such credit losses have historically been within our expectations and the provisions established  there is no assurance that we will continue to experience the same credit loss rates that we have in the past 
a significant change in the liquidity or financial position of our customers could have a material adverse impact on the collectability of our accounts receivable and our future operating results 
inventory 
we value our inventory at the lower of cost first in  first out method or market 
we regularly review inventory quantities on hand and record a provision to write down excess and obsolete inventories to its estimated net realizable value  if less than cost  based primarily on its product demand forecast 
as demonstrated during fiscal and  demand for our products can fluctuate significantly 
we recorded charges for excess and obsolete inventories of million and million in fiscal and  respectively 
the charges were in addition to our normal inventory reserve and were primarily caused by a significant reduction in demand including reduced demand for our older technology products 
a significant increase in the demand for our product could result in a short term increase of inventory purchases while a significant decrease in demand could result in an increase in the charges for excess inventory quantities on hand 
in addition  our industry is subject to technological change  new product development  and product technological obsolescence that could result in an increase in the amount of obsolete inventory quantities on hand 
therefore  any significant unanticipated changes in demand or technological developments could have a significant impact on the value of our inventory and reported operating results 
when we recorded additional reserve for excess and obsolete inventory  we created a new cost basis for the inventory 
the reserve will be released only when the inventory that the reserve is provided for is sold or scrapped 
in process research and development 
we value tangible and intangible assets acquired through our business acquisitions at fair value including ipr d 
we determine ipr d through established valuation techniques for various projects for the development of new products and technologies and expense ipr d when technological feasibility is not reached 
during fiscal  we expensed approximately million in ipr d charges in connection with the sensys acquisition because the technological feasibility of certain products under development had not been established and no future alternative uses existed 
if we acquire other companies with ipr d in the future  we will value the ipr d through established valuation techniques and incur future ipr d charges if those products under development have not reached technological feasibility 
valuation of long lived and intangible assets and goodwill 
we have fully adopted statement of financial accounting standards no 
 or sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets and sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
we assess the impairment of identifiable intangibles  long lived assets and goodwill whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
factors we consider important which could trigger an impairment review of such assets include the following significant under performance relative to expected historical or projected future operating results  significant changes in the manner of our use of the acquired assets or the strategy for our overall business  and significant negative industry or economic trends 
when we determine that the carrying value of intangibles  long lived assets and related goodwill may not be recoverable based upon the existence of one or more of the above indicators of impairment  we measure any impairment based on a projected discounted cash flow method using a discount rate determined by our management to be commensurate with the risk inherent in our business model 
while we believe that our estimates of future cash flows are reasonable  different assumptions regarding such cash flows could materially affect our evaluations 
in accordance with sfas no 
 we performed a transitional goodwill impairment test during the quarter ended september  with respect to goodwill related to the sensys acquisition 
the impairment test under sfas no 
was based on a two step process involving comparing the estimated fair value of the related reporting unit to its net book value  and comparing the estimated implied fair value of goodwill to its carrying value 
as a result of our transitional impairment analysis  which considered current operating losses  a decrease in market capitalization below tangible book value  the absence of positive cash flows  and uncertainties resulting from the duration and severity of the industry downturn  a goodwill impairment loss of million was recorded in the quarter ended september   which reduced the goodwill balance related to the sensys acquisition to zero 
we have also conducted impairment reviews for other intangible assets under sfas no 
our impairment review process is based on a discounted future cash flow approach that uses our estimates of revenues and estimated costs as well as appropriate discount rates 
as a result of the reviews  we wrote off  for developed technology   for a development contract and  for trade name intangible assets in fiscal income taxes 
we account for income taxes using the asset and liability approach  which requires recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our financial statements  but have not been reflected in our taxable income 
a valuation allowance is established to reduce deferred tax assets to their estimated realizable value 
therefore  we provide a valuation allowance to the extent we cannot conclude  based on available objective evidence  that it is more likely than not we will generate sufficient taxable income in future periods to realize the benefit of our deferred tax assets 
predicting future taxable income is difficult  and requires the use of significant judgment 
at march   we provided a full valuation allowance for net operating loss carry forwards for federal and state income tax purposes of approximately million and million  respectively  as we cannot conclude that it is more likely than not that we will generate sufficient taxable income in future periods to realize the benefit of these assets 
warranty 
we provide warranty coverage for a predetermined amount of time  on systems and parts for material and labor to repair and maintain the equipment 
we record the estimated cost of systems and parts warranty upon recognition of revenues  based on the average historical warranty expense for a specific tool 
should actual costs or material usage differ from our estimates  revisions to the estimated warranty liability may be required 
recently issued accounting pronouncements in may  the financial accounting standard board  or fasb  issued sfas no 
 accounting for certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity 
sfas no 
establishes standards for how companies classify and measure certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity 
it requires companies to classify a financial instrument that is within its scope as a liability or an asset in some circumstances 
sfas no 
is effective beginning the second quarter of fiscal we believe that the adoption of this standard will have no material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
in november  the fasb issued fasb interpretation no 
 or fin  guarantor s accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees  including indirect guarantees of indebtedness of others 
fin requires that a liability be recorded in the guarantor s balance sheet upon issuance of a guarantee 
in addition  fin requires disclosures about the guarantees that an entity has issued  including a reconciliation of changes in the entity s product warranty liabilities 
the initial recognition and initial measurement provisions of fin are applicable on a prospective basis to guarantees issued or modified after december   irrespective of the guarantor s fiscal year end 
the disclosure requirements of fin are effective for financial statements of interim or annual periods ending after december  the adoption of this standard had no material impact on our financial statements 
in january  the fasb issued fasb interpretation no 
 or fin  consolidation of variable interest entities an interpretation of arb no 
fin requires certain variable interest entities to be consolidated by the primary beneficiary of the entity if the equity investors in the entity do not have the characteristics of a controlling financial interest or do not have sufficient equity at risk for the entity to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support from other parties 
fin is effective immediately for all new variable interest entities created or acquired after january  for variable interest entities created or acquired prior to february   the provisions of fin must be applied for the first interim or annual period beginning after june  we believe that the adoption of this standard will have no material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
in november  the emerging issues task force reached a consensus on issue  multiple deliverable revenue arrangements 
eitf addresses how to account for arrangements that may involve the delivery or performance of multiple products  services and or rights to use assets 
the consensus mandates how to identify whether goods or services or both which are to be delivered separately in a bundled sales arrangement should be accounted for separately because they are separate units of accounting 
the guidance can affect the timing of revenue recognition for such arrangements  even though it does not change rules governing the timing or patterns of revenue recognition of individual items accounted for separately 
the final consensus will be applicable to agreements entered into in fiscal years beginning after june  with early adoption permitted 
additionally  companies will be permitted to apply the consensus guidance to all existing arrangements as the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle in accordance with accounting principles board opinion no 
 accounting changes 
we are assessing the potential impact of this guidance  but at this point we do not believe the adoption of eitf will have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations 
results of operations the following table summarizes our historical results of operations as a percentage of net revenues for the periods indicated 
fiscal years ended ma rch  net revenues cost of revenues gross profit loss operating expenses research and development selling  general and administrative in process research and development impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets restructuring  severance and other stock based compensation total operating expenses operating income loss other income expense interest expense interest income other income expense total other income  net income loss before provision benefit for income provision benefit for income taxes income loss before cumulative effect of change in accounting principle cumulative effect of change in accounting principle net income loss fiscal year ended march  compared to fiscal year ended march  net revenues 
net revenues for the fiscal year ended march  and were million and million  respectively 
compared to fiscal  net revenues decreased million or 
the decrease in fiscal revenues was primarily attributable to the capital spending reductions in the semiconductor industry during fiscal  which were primarily related to the cyclical downturn of semiconductor manufacturers and the weakness of the global economy 
compared to fiscal  we sold fewer units of our therma probe and opti probe products in fiscal and the average selling price decreased in fiscal due to increased price competition 
the following table summarizes our revenues in different categories as a percentage of total net revenues for the periods indicated 
fiscal years ended march  net revenues product service and parts total net revenues net revenues attributable to international sales for the fiscal years ended march  and accounted for and of our total revenues for such periods  respectively 
demand for semiconductors and semiconductor equipment experienced a steep cyclical downturn during our fiscal year as a result  we experienced low order booking rates 
fewer orders  combined with rescheduling of delivery and order cancellations  resulted in lower revenues and gross profits that materially adversely impacted our financial position and results of operations 
we expect that the revenues for the first quarter of fiscal year will be essentially same or slightly down from that of the fourth quarter of fiscal we presently expect that both orders and revenues will improve gradually quarter by quarter in fiscal year however  due to the uncertainty of economic conditions and of the market response to our newly introduced products and revenue recognition of our new products  we can give no assurance that we will be able to meet our revenue expectations 
gross profit loss 
gross profit decreased from million profit in fiscal to million loss in fiscal as a percentage of net revenues  gross profit decreased from in fiscal to in fiscal lower gross profit was primarily because of lower revenues and lower average selling price of products due to increased price competition in fiscal during fiscal  as a result of unfavorable economic conditions and diminished demand for semiconductor products  we experienced a decline in sales and recorded an inventory charge of million related to excess and obsolete inventories 
this million charge was offset by the reserve release of million for sales of previously reserved inventory 
this charge has been included in cost of revenues in our consolidated statement of operations 
at march  we had written down inventories on hand by million 
these charges were in addition to our normal inventory reserve and were primarily caused by a significant reduction in demand including reduced demand for our older technology products 
inventory charges recorded in fiscal and have substantially lowered the net value of our mm inventory on hand and will have a significant impact on our gross margin if we are able to sell our excess mm inventory in the future 
we have implemented or are in the process of implementing a number of cost reductions measures to improve our overall financial performance 
these cost reduction measures include  but are not limited to  reduction in workforce in all functional areas  restrictions in discretionary spending  renegotiation of equipment maintenance contracts with vendors and so on 
we expect these cost reduction measures will significantly reduce our costs and improve our gross margin 
research and development  or r d  expenses 
r d expenses were million and million for fiscal years and  respectively 
r d expenses as a percentage of net revenues for fiscal increased to from for fiscal primarily due to the decrease of net revenues in fiscal during fiscal year we continued to reduce contract labor costs and other discretionary expenses but maintained the resources for our critical programs such as our real time critical dimension product  or rt cd 
we believe that technological leadership is essential to strengthen our market position in the next economic upturn and expect to continue to commit significant resources to the development of new products and the continuous improvement of existing products 
however  the high percentages of research and development expenses to net revenues for fiscal years and reflect the sharp reduction in revenues due to a severe industry downturn  not an increase in spending 
we expect r d expenses for fiscal to decrease due to the implementation of our cost reduction measures 
r d expenditures as a percentage of revenues will also decrease significantly in fiscal as industry conditions improve and as spending levels are appropriately adjusted 
selling  general and administrative  or sg a  expenses 
sg a expenses were million and million for fiscal years and  respectively 
compared to fiscal  sg a expenses in fiscal increased million  or 
the increase in fiscal sg a expenses was due primarily to the legal and accounting fees associated with the investigation discussed in item  controls and procedures  and the inclusion of a full year of sg a expense for sensys instruments corporation  which represented million 
in fiscal  two and half months of sg a expenses of sensys were included  which amounted to  the acquisition of sensys is discussed in note of notes to consolidited financial statements 
sg a expenses as a percentage of net revenues increased to in fiscal from in fiscal primarily due to significantly lower revenue levels in fiscal we expect sg a expenses will decrease in fiscal due to the implementation of our cost reduction measures 
sg a expenditures as a percentage of revenues will also decrease significantly as industry conditions improve and as spending levels are appropriately adjusted 
in process research and development 
in january  we acquired sensys in a transaction accounted for as a purchase 
the purchase price was allocated to the assets acquired  including intangible assets  based on their estimated fair values 
the intangible assets include approximately million for acquired in process technology for various projects that did not have future alternative uses 
the value of the purchased in process technology was determined using the income approach  which discounts expected future cash flows from projects under development to their net present value 
each project was analyzed to determine the technological innovations included  the utilization of core technology  the complexity  cost and time to complete development  any alternative future use or current technological feasibility  and the stage of completion 
the cash flows derived from the in process technology projects were discounted at a rate of 
we believe this rate was appropriate given the risks associated with the technologies for which commercial feasibility had not been established 
the percentage of completion for each in process project was determined by identifying the elapsed time invested in the project as a ratio of the total time required to bring the project to technical and commercial feasibility 
at the date of the sensys acquisition  the development of these projects had not yet reached technological feasibility  and the technology in process had no alternative future uses 
accordingly  these costs were expensed in the fourth quarter of fiscal no similar costs were expensed during fiscal impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets in accordance with sfas no 
 we performed a transitional goodwill impairment test during the quarter ended september  with respect to goodwill related to the sensys acquisition 
the impairment test under sfas no 
was based on a two step process involving comparing the estimated fair value of the related reporting unit to its net book value  and comparing the estimated implied fair value of goodwill to its carrying value 
as a result of our transitional impairment analysis  which considered current operating losses  a decrease in market capitalization below tangible book value  the absence of positive cash flows  and uncertainties resulting from the duration and severity of the industry downturn  a goodwill impairment loss of million was recorded in the quarter ended september   which reduced the goodwill balance related to the sensys acquisition to zero 
we have also conducted impairment reviews for other intangible assets under sfas no 
our impairment review process is based on a discounted future cash flow approach that uses our estimates of revenues and estimated costs as well as appropriate discount rates 
as a result of the reviews  we wrote off  for developed technology   for a development contract and  for trade name intangible assets in fiscal we will conduct impairment reviews for the remaining balance of intangible assets in the future when we determine that the carrying value of intangible assets may not be recoverable 
restructuring  severance and other 
during fiscal  we recorded million charges related to restructuring  severance and other costs 
we closed down two facilities in santa clara  california to reduce operating expenses and recorded a million charge associated with the abandonment of leased facilities and write off of fixed assets 
we also implemented two reduction in force programs affecting approximately people and recorded million of severance and related costs 
during fiscal  we recorded million in severance charges as we reduced our workforce by approximately people to reduce operating costs 
we had also implemented another reduction in force program of approximately employees in april and will record the related severance and other costs in the first quarter of stock based compensation 
as part of the sensys acquisition  we assumed million of stock based compensation to be amortized over the vesting period of the options 
the amortization expense was million or of net revenues in fiscal and million or of net revenues in fiscal we expect that the stock based compensation in fiscal will be lower than that of fiscal due the cancellation of options held by the sensys employees who left the company in fiscal and in the first quarter of other income 
other income includes interest expense  interest income  and other non operating income  net 
total other income for fiscal was million  compared to million of total other income in fiscal the decrease from fiscal to fiscal was primarily due to the decrease in the interest generating investment balance 
we expect that other income in fiscal will be lower than that of fiscal due to the lower balance of interest generating investment 
benefit for income taxes 
the effective tax rate of for fiscal year was based upon our net tax loss for fiscal for fiscal  we recorded a million benefit for income taxes due to a change in the tax law that allowed us to carry back net operating losses for five years instead of two years under the previous law 
we received the million tax refund during fiscal net loss 
net loss for fiscal was million  as compared to net loss of million for the prior fiscal year 
the loss in fiscal was primarily a result of decreased revenues  lower gross profit margin and charges recorded in fiscal of million of goodwill and other intangible assets impairment  million of additional reserves for obsolete and excess inventories and million of restructuring  severance and other costs 
fiscal year ended march  compared to fiscal year ended march  net revenues 
net revenues for the fiscal year ended march  and were million and million  respectively 
both fiscal and fiscal results reflect our adoption of sab under sab  a portion of revenues are deferred until installation is complete and the customer accepts the system 
deferred revenues relative to service contracts are recognized over of the life of the related service contract 
compared to fiscal  net revenues decreased million or 
the decrease in fiscal revenues was primarily attributable to the capital spending reductions in the semiconductor industry during fiscal  which were primarily related to the cyclical downturn of semiconductor manufacturers and the weakness of the global economy 
revenues decreased primarily due to decreased units sold of both our therma probe and opti probe products 
net revenues attributable to international sales for the fiscal years ended march  and accounted for and of our total revenues for such periods  respectively 
gross profit 
gross profit decreased from million in fiscal to million in fiscal as a percentage of net revenues  gross profit decreased from in fiscal to in fiscal the substantial decrease in gross profit in fiscal was primarily because of lower revenue  a substantial increase of inventory reserves  and lower production volume  which was inadequate to absorb manufacturing overhead 
we increased inventory reserves for obsolete and excess inventories by million in the fourth quarter of fiscal the charges were significantly higher than the normal level and were primarily caused by a significant reduction in demand including reduced demand for our older technology products 
during fiscal  we did not reduce our manufacturing overhead enough to compensate for the decrease in revenues compared to fiscal research and development  or r d  expenses 
r d expenses were million and million for fiscal years and  respectively  representing a decrease in fiscal of million  or from fiscal r d expenses as a percentage of net revenues for fiscal increased to from for fiscal the decrease of absolute dollars from the prior year is primarily the result of reductions in patent defense expense  contract labor and discretionary expenses 
selling  general and administrative  or sg a  expenses 
sg a expenses were million and million for fiscal years and  respectively 
the decrease in fiscal sg a expenses was due primarily to decreased headcount as well as decreased sales expenses  such as sales commissions  related to decreased revenues 
compared to fiscal  sg a expenses in fiscal decreased million  or 
sg a expenses as a percentage of net revenues increased to in fiscal from in fiscal primarily due to significantly lower revenue levels in fiscal in process research and development 
in january  we acquired sensys in a transaction accounted for as a purchase 
the purchase price was allocated to the assets acquired  including intangible assets  based on their estimated fair values 
the intangible assets included approximately million for acquired in process technology for various projects that did not have future alternative uses 
the value of the purchased in process technology was determined using the income approach  which discounts expected future cash flows from projects under development to their net present value 
each project was analyzed to determine the technological innovations included  the utilization of core technology  the complexity  cost and time to complete development  any alternative future use or current technological feasibility  and the stage of completion 
the cash flows derived from the in process technology projects were discounted at a rate of 
we believe this rate was appropriate given the risks associated with the technologies for which commercial feasibility had not been established 
the percentage of completion for each in process project was determined by identifying the elapsed time invested in the project as a ratio of the total time required to bring the project to technological and commercial feasibility 
at the date of the acquisition  the development of these projects had not yet reached technological feasibility  and the technology in process had no alternative future uses 
accordingly  these costs were expensed in the fourth quarter of fiscal severance charge 
during fiscal  we recorded million in severance charges as we reduced our workforce by approximately people to reduce operating costs 
in fiscal  we accrued a million severance charge due to the retirement of our former chairman and chief technical officer  dr 
allan rosencwaig 
stock based compensation 
as part of the acquisition of sensys  we assumed million of stock based compensation to be amortized over the vesting period of the options 
the amortization expense was million in our fiscal fourth quarter  or of revenues for the quarter 
other income expense 
other income expense includes interest expense  interest income  and other non operating income expense  net 
total other income for fiscal was million  compared to million of total other income in fiscal a million charge was recorded as other expense in fiscal in connection with the settlement of patent lawsuits with kla tencor 
interest income included in the total other income of fiscal and was million and million  respectively 
the decrease in interest income from fiscal to fiscal was primarily due to the decrease in interest rate 
provision benefit for income taxes 
for fiscal  we recorded a million benefit for income taxes due to a change in the tax law that allowed us to carry back net operating losses for five years instead of two years under the previous law 
for fiscal  we recorded a million provision for income taxes 
net income loss 
net loss for fiscal was million  as compared to net income of million for the prior fiscal year 
the loss in fiscal was primarily a result of decreased revenue  lower gross profit margin and charges recorded in the fiscal fourth quarter of of million for the write off of acquired ipr d and million additional reserves for obsolete and excess inventories 
backlog at march    and  our backlog was million  million  and million  respectively 
our backlog consists of product orders for which a customer purchase order has been received and accepted and which are scheduled for shipment within twelve months 
orders that are scheduled for shipment beyond the twelve month window are not included in backlog until they fall within the twelve month window 
orders are subject to rescheduling or cancellation by the customer  usually without penalty 
backlog also includes recurring fees payable under support contracts with our customers and orders for spare parts and billable service 
because of possible changes in product delivery schedules and cancellation of product orders and because our sales will sometimes reflect orders shipped in the same quarter that they are received  our backlog at any particular date is not necessarily indicative of actual sales for any succeeding period 
liquidity and capital resources our principal liquidity requirements are for working capital  consisting primarily of accounts receivable and inventories 
we believe that because of the relatively long manufacturing cycle of certain of our systems  our inventories will continue to represent a significant portion of working capital 
over the last three fiscal years  we have funded our operating activities principally from net proceeds from our initial public offering as well as cash from operating activities in fiscal year our consolidated financial statements have been prepared on the basis of a going concern  which contemplates the realization of assets and the satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business 
we have incurred substantial losses and experienced negative cash flow since fiscal  and have an accumulated deficit of million at march  as a result of these circumstances  our independent auditors report indicates that there is a substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern 
to conserve cash  we have implemented cost cutting measures  and in september  implemented a restructuring program 
in addition  in june  we entered into a credit agreement with a financial institution that provides for a credit facility of up to million  subject to certain restrictions in the borrowing base based on eligibility of receivables and inventory 
if liquidity problems should arise  we will  as a last resort  take measures to reduce operating expenses such as reducing headcount or cancelling research and development projects 
however  we may need to raise additional funds to finance our activities next year and beyond through public or private equity or debt financings  the formation of strategic partnerships or alliances with other companies or through bank borrowings with existing or new banks 
we may not be able to obtain additional funds on terms that would be favorable to us  or at all 
we believes  based on our ability to implement the aforementioned measures  if needed  that we will have liquidity sufficient to meet our operating  working capital and financing needs for the next twelve months and perhaps beyond 
we have not made any adjustment to our consolidated financial statements as a result of the outcome of the uncertainty described above 
cash flow provided by used in operating activities was million  million and million for the years ended march   and  respectively 
the cash used in operating activities in fiscal years and was mainly due to the net loss in these two fiscal years of million and million  respectively 
excluding the non cash expenses  net losses were million and million  respectively for the years ended march  and cash from changes in accounts receivable and inventory in fiscal year was largely offset by cash payments for accounts payable 
during fiscal year  the million cash from change in accounts receivable was not sufficient to cover additional payments for accounts payable and other accrued liabilities 
the net cash flow provided by operations in fiscal year was due to the net income generated in the year of million 
during the year ended march   cash provided by investing activities was million  a result of a net decrease in short term investments of million and capital expenditures and other investment of million 
purchases of property and equipment were million  million and million for the years ended march   and  respectively 
capital expenditures for fiscal included approximately million for expansion of our clean room at our fremont  california manufacturing facility and million for leasehold improvements to our sales  marketing and customer support facility in fremont 
cash used in financing activities was million during the year ended march  a total of million cash was generated from the issuance of common stock under our employee stock purchase plan and equity incentive plan and for the exercise of warrants in connection with sensys acquisition 
a total of million cash was restricted due to the requirement of our insurance premium financing agreement 
also million cash was used to purchase stock pursuant to the stock repurchase program discussed in note of notes to consolidated financial statements entitled treasury stock 
our off balance sheet commitments are limited to equipment operating leases  leases on office and manufacturing space and certain software license agreements 
future payments due under these obligations as of march  in thousands are as follows operating other fiscal year leases commitments thereafter total future minimum payments  we indemnify some of our suppliers and customers for specified intellectual property rights pursuant to certain parameters and restrictions 
the scope of these indemnities varies  but in some instances includes indemnification for damages and expenses including reasonable attorney fees related to any misuse by us of the intellectual property 
no amounts have been accrued in respect of the indemnification provisions at march  we had a million loan and security agreement with comerica bank which allowed us to borrow money bearing interest at a floating rate per annum equal to the prime rate for our prime rate advances or at a rate per annum equal to libor plus for our libor rate advances under the agreement 
we could request advances in an aggregate outstanding amount not to exceed the lesser of million or the borrowing base  in each case minus the aggregate face amount of outstanding letters of credit  including any drawn but unreimbursed letters of credit 
our borrowings under the comerica bank credit facility were secured by substantially all of our assets 
the comerica bank credit facility was scheduled to mature on june  as of march   due to the violation of the financial covenants related to the bank credit facility  we only maintained two standby letters of credit totaling million as required by the lease agreements on our buildings 
an amendment to the bank credit facility agreement was entered into as of may   but was limited to the larger of a borrowing base amount or million 
in june  we entered into a new loan and security agreement with silicon valley bank  or svb  replacing the agreement with comerica bank 
the new agreement includes a million domestic line of credit  including a sub limit of million for letters of credit  and a million exim bank guaranteed revolving line of credit 
the new bank credit facility allows us to borrow money under the domestic line bearing interest at the svb prime rate plus floating 
the exim revolving line allows us to borrow money at svb prime rate plus floating 
we may request advances in an aggregate outstanding amount not to exceed the lesser of million total under the two lines or the borrowing base  in each case minus the aggregate face amount of outstanding letters of credit  including any drawn but unreimbursed letters of credit 
our borrowings under the svb and exim guaranteed credit facilities are secured by substantially all of our assets 
the credit facilities mature on june  our principal sources of funds have been and are anticipated to be cash and short term investments on hand million unrestricted as of march   cash flows from operating activities and  if available and necessary  borrowings under our bank credit facility 
our cash and short term investments balance decreased by million during fiscal year we have implemented various cost reduction programs during and subsequent to the end of fiscal year to bring operating expenses in line with revenue projections 
we believe that with these cost reduction programs in place  we will reduce operating expenses significantly enough so that we will have sufficient liquidity and capital resources to meet our current and future financial obligations for at least the next twelve months 
no assurance can be given  however  that this will be the case 
we may require additional equity or debt financing to meet our working capital requirements or to fund our research and development activities 
there can be no assurance that additional financing will be available when required or  if available  will be on terms satisfactory to us

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk related to interest rates and foreign currency we are exposed to market risks related to changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates  however  we believe those risks to be not material in relations to our operations 
we do not have any derivative financial instruments 
interest rate risk as of march   our cash included money market securities and commercial paper 
due to the short term duration of our investment portfolio  an immediate change in interest rates would not have a material effect on the fair market value of our portfolio  therefore  we would not expect our operating results or cash flows to be affected to any significant degree by the effect of a sudden change in market interest rates on our securities portfolio 
foreign currency exchange risk a substantial portion of our sales are denominated in us dollars and  as a result  we have relatively little exposure to foreign currency exchange risk with respect to sales made 
we do not use forward exchange contracts to hedge exposures denominated in foreign currencies or any other derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes 
the effect of an immediate change in exchange rates would not have a material impact on our future operating results or cash flows
