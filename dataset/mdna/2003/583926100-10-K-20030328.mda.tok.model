item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview we are principally engaged in the design  development and licensing of safety medical devices intended to reduce the incidence of accidental needle sticks 
each safety medical device we design and develop incorporates our proprietary needle retraction technology 
our technology enables health care professionals to retract a needle into the body of the medical device for safe disposal without any substantial change in operating technique 
to date  substantially all of our revenues have been derived from up front license payments made by bd 
however  principally as a result of the launch of certain of our products licensed to bd  we realized increased revenues from minimum royalties on our licensed product technologies  particularly during the fourth quarter 
a dispute with bd over the appropriate amount of royalty payment for the bd integra syringe was resolved through mediation in january  resulting in a royalty rate of to us on all sales of the product 
results of operations year ended december  compared to year ended december  total revenue was  compared to revenue of  in revenue in consisted of royalty payments from the sale of our licensed products 
revenue in consisted principally of an up front license payment from medamicus for our license of the safety seldinger introducer needle for use in arterial access 
general and administrative expenses  excluding stock based compensation were  in  an increase of  as compared to general and administrative expenses of  in the increase was primarily due to our increase in corporate  legal  consulting and travel related to the arbitration and subsequent mediation of our dispute with bd relating to the royalty rate for the integra syringe licensed to bd  hiring and relocation of a new executive and costs related to increased marketing to allow the company to negotiate agreements for its portfolio products 
stock based compensation  which resulted from the issuance and modification of options  warrants and other stock based grants and awards was  in and  in  a reduction of  several grants issued in have been fully vested offset by three new grants 
research and development expenses for the year ended december  were  an increase of  as compared to research and development expenses of  for the corresponding period in the increase was due primarily to costs associated with an evaluation study  regulatory application costs related to the safety dental pre filled cartridge injector  the development of new products and payment in connection with a claim by the former director of research and development 
in accordance with fas no 
 accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities  and consistent with the company s accounting policy for marketable equity securities  in the fourth quarter of fiscal  the company determined that the decline in the fair value of its investment in medamicus stocks which was received as part of a development and licensing agreement in was other than temporary 
accordingly  the company established a new basis of  in the investment equivalent to its fair market value at december  as a result  the company realized a loss of  or per basic and diluted common share 
year ended december  compared to year ended december  total revenue for the year ended december  was  compared to revenue of  in the revenue in consisted principally of an up front license payment from medamicus for the safety seldinger introducer needle arterial access 
the revenue in consisted principally of  in up front licensing payments made by bd under the may  license agreement 
general and administrative expenses  excluding stock based compensation for the year ended december  were  an increase of  as compared to general and administrative expenses of  for the corresponding period in the increase in general and administrative expenses was principally due to an increase in the general level of business activities  primarily related to increased legal and travel expenses  to enable us to market our products 
stock based compensation  which resulted from the issuance and modification of options  warrants and other stock based grants and awards was  in and  in  a reduction of  there were no new agreements for stock based compensation in that resulted in expense in the period 
all expense recorded in related to the vesting of arrangements entered into in research and development expenses for the year ended december  were  a decrease of  as compared to research and development expenses of  for the corresponding period in the higher levels of expenses in were due primarily to research and development activities to modify our licensed products based on specific requests of our licensees 
liquidity and capital resources at december   we had cash  cash equivalents and available for sale securities of  as compared to  at  an increase of  or 
the increase resulted from the private equity placement of  shares of our common stock on march  med design received net proceeds of approximately  from this offering 
for the year ended december   our net cash used in operating activities was  consisting of net loss of  non cash depreciation and amortization of  stock based compensation and realized loss on available for sale securities of  and  respectively 
net cash used in investing activities of  consisted primarily of additions to property  plant and equipment of  and patents  and net investment in available for sale securities of  net cash provided by financing activities of  consisted primarily of net proceeds from the private placement of  and proceeds from warrant and stock option exercises of  at december   we had a revolving line of credit which makes available up to  this facility can be used to fund working capital needs and finance capital equipment purchases 
although advances for capital equipment financing may not exceed  borrowings are collateralized by substantially all of our assets 
any borrowings to meet working capital needs bear interest at libor plus  while borrowings to finance capital equipment purchases bear interest at the prime rate plus 
the facility expires on may   and there is no assurance that we will be successful in negotiating a continuation of the availability of the line of credit or the terms that will be made available to us 
there were no amounts outstanding under the agreement at december  we believe that we have sufficient funds to support our planned operations for at least the next twelve months 
the availability of resources over a longer term will be dependent on our ability to enter into licensing agreements  the amount of royalty payments we receive from our current and future licensees  our ability to enter into and profitably operate under collaborative arrangements  and our ability to raise additional equity or debt financing 
we have not yet generated sufficient cash flows from operations to support our operations on an on going basis and anticipate that we may need to seek additional sources of funding in the future 
historically  our cash flow has been provided almost exclusively by securities offerings and up front license fees 
if we are unsuccessful in negotiating additional agreements  or if licensing revenues are insufficient to support our operations  we may be required to reduce the scope of  or cease  our operations 
pursuant to our oem manufacturing agreements with owens illinois  we are required to purchase the automated equipment and molds necessary for owens illinois to manufacture our products 
these expenditures may be significant 
however  we will not incur any such expenses until we have entered into distribution agreements for such products 
critical accounting policies in preparing our financial statements  management is required to make estimates and assumptions that  among other things  affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and reported amounts of revenues and expenses 
these estimates are most significant in connection with our critical accounting policies  namely those of our accounting policies that are most important in the portrayal of our financial condition and results and require management s most difficult  subjective or complex judgments 
these judgments often result from the need to make estimates about the effects of matters that are inherently uncertain 
we believe that our most critical accounting policies relate to revenue recognition involving up front license fees and royalties based on production or sales volume  stock based compensation and accounting for available for sale securities 
our revenue recognition policy with regard to up front license fees calls for recognition upon the signing of a binding agreement when we have no further obligation under the agreement other than to defend the patent rights associated with such agreement 
our revenue recognition policy with regard to royalties based on production or sales volume calls for recognition in the period in which the relevant products are produced or sold 
the recognition of such revenues is dependent on our licensees and strategic allies accurately and timely reporting sales and production volume 
inaccurate or late reporting could result in recognition of revenue and related costs at an earlier or a later time 
certain of our licensees and strategic allies are contractually required to pay minimum royalties if sales or production volumes do not reach specified levels 
our revenue recognition policy with respect to these minimum royalties calls for recognition in the period to which the minimum royalties relate 
we periodically grant compensation to employees and non employee consultants in the form of equity 
these grants typically consist of common stock  stock options and warrants to purchase common stock 
we apply the guidance of apb accounting for stock issued to employees in accounting for stock options  warrants and common stock issued to employees 
we record compensation expense over the service period of the employee if the exercise price of the option or warrant is less than the fair value of our common stock on the date of the grant 
we account for options and warrants issued to our non employee consultants and directors who perform consulting services in accordance with statement of financial accounting standard  accounting for stock based compensation 
accordingly  we record compensation expense over the contractual performance period and re measure that expense at the end of each fiscal quarter 
we measure the value of these instruments using the black scholes valuations model which requires management to make estimates 
variations in these estimates could have a material effect on the reported expenses recorded in the financial statements in any given period  and therefore  a material effect on our reported financial results 
available for sale securities are reported at a fair value  based on quoted market prices  with the net unrealized gain or loss reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income loss in stockholders equity 
the company records an impairment charge when it believes an investment has experienced a decline in value that is other than temporary 
in determining if a decline in market value below cost for a publicly traded security is other than temporary  the company evaluates the relevant market conditions  offering prices  trends of earnings  price multiples and other key measures 
when a decline in value is deemed to be other than temporary  the company recognizes an impairment loss in the current period to the extent of the decline below the carrying value of the investment 
adverse changes in market conditions or poor operating results of underlying investments could result in additional other than temporary losses in future periods 
new accounting standards in june  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued a statement of financial accounting standard sfas no 
 accounting for asset retirement obligation 
this standard provides the accounting for the cost of legal obligations associated with the retirement of long lived assets 
sfas no 
requires that companies recognize the fair value of a liability for asset retirement obligations in the period in which the obligations are incurred and capitalize that amount as a part of the book value of the long lived asset 
that cost is then depreciated over the remaining life of the underlying long lived asset 
the adoption of this pronouncement will have no material impact on our financial position or results of operations 
in august  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for impairment of disposal of long lived assets 
this standard supersedes sfas no 
and the provisions of accounting principles board opinion no 
 reporting the results of operations reporting the effects of disposal of a segment of a business  and extraordinary  unusual and infrequently occurring events and transactions with regard to reporting the effects of a disposal of a segment of a business 
sfas no 
establishes a single accounting model for assets to be disposed of by sale and addresses several sfas no 
implementation issues 
we were required to adopt sfas no 
effective january  the adoption of this pronouncement will have no material impact on our financial position or results of operations 
in june  the fasb issued sfas  accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities  which addresses the accounting and reporting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities 
the provisions of this statement are effective for fiscal years ending after december  the adoption of this pronouncement will have no material impact on our financial position or results of operations 
in december  the fasb issued sfas  accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure  which provides alternative methods of transition for a voluntary change to a fair value based method of accounting for stock based employee compensation as prescribed in sfas accounting for stock based compensation 
additionally  sfas requires more prominent and more frequent disclosures in financial statements about the effects of stock based compensation 
the provisions of this statement are effective for fiscal years ending after december  the adoption of this pronouncement will have no material impact on our financial position or results of operations 
in january  the emerging issues task force issued eitf revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables 
eitf primarily addresses certain aspects of the accounting by a vendor for arrangements under which it will perform multiple revenue generating activities 
specifically  it addresses how to determine whether an arrangement involving multiple deliverables contains more than one unit of accounting 
in apply eitf  separate contracts with the same entity or related parties that are entered into at or near the same time are presumed to have been negotiated as a package and should  therefore  be evaluated as a single arrangement in considering whether there are one or more units of accounting 
that presumption may be overcome if there is sufficient evidence to the contrary 
eitf also addresses how arrangement consideration should be measured and allocated to the separate units of accounting in the arrangement 
the provisions of eitf are effective for revenue arrangements entered into in fiscal periods beginning after june  we are currently evaluating the impact this statement will have on our financial position or results of operations 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk there were no amounts outstanding under our revolving line of credit at december  if we were to borrow under our credit facility  borrowings to meet working capital needs would bear interest at libor plus and borrowings to finance capital equipment purchases would bear interest at the prime rate plus 
as a result  any such borrowings would be subject to interest rate fluctuations which could increase our interest expense  respectively 
we invest a portion of excess cash in marketable securities in accordance with our investment guidelines as approved by our board of directors 
these investments are in highly liquid  low risk securities where our risk of loss is at a minimum 
additionally  we have acquired shares of a publicly traded company for which we are at risk of loss based on downward fluctuations in the quoted market fair value of those shares based on the fair value of the equity securities held as of december  if the quoted fair value of this company s shares were to fall by and  we would incur an unrealized loss of  and  respectively 
such losses are ultimately recognized as expense in the period in which the stock is sold or in the current period if the decline in market value is deemed to be other than tempory
