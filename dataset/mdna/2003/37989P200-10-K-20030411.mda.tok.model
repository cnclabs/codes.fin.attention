item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto appearing elsewhere in this report 
overview glycogenesys  inc is a biotechnology company that develops novel pharmaceutical products based on carbohydrate compounds and related technologies 
our lead drug candidate  gcs  a potential treatment for multiple forms of cancer  completed a phase ii a clinical trial for pancreatic cancer in april and completed a phase ii a clinical trial for colorectal cancer in march we began a phase i dose escalation trial in february dosing in patients at up to mg m while we have also developed two agricultural products elexa  a registered trademark of ours and bb  we plan to sell  or may no longer pursue development of these products by mid during and the first quarter of  the company modified the manufacturing process resulting in a new formulation of gcs which is substantially free of ethanol and which will produce commercial size lots 
in addition  during and the first quarter of  the company has recruited additional members to its development team and scientific advisory board with diverse and complementary industry experience to assist management in the design of clinical trials  compliance with the regulatory processes of the fda  manufacturing and scientific development 
after raising million in december and another million in january   we believed that eis would provide most of the funding necessary to support development activities of gcs during the year 
while eis did provide million during the first eight months of the year  their decision to exit the oncology segment of the pharmaceutical industry left us with no direct external means of fully funding research and development costs 
we negotiated the termination of our joint venture in december which yielded million in additional research and development funding and we regained all intellectual property  development and marketing rights of gcs at the end of  we still had million of cash available  however  we must raise significant additional funds to move forward in the product development clinical trial process 
our financial strategy for and beyond is to secure the necessary financial resources to pay for the development of gcs  either through repartnering with a large biotechnology or pharmaceutical company or raising funds in the capital market or a combination of both 
critical accounting policies the company s significant accounting policies are described in note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements included in this report 
the company s critical accounting policies are those that are important to the portrayal of the company s financial condition and operating results and require management s most difficult  subjective or complex judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
the company believes that its most critical accounting policies include those related to the termination of its joint venture with elan and the accounting for its accrued liabilities  specifically clinical research organization costs 
while the company bases its judgments and estimates on historical experience and other assumptions that management believes are appropriate and reasonable under current circumstances  actual results may differ from those estimates 
termination of joint venture with elan in december  the company terminated its joint venture with elan 
pursuant to the termination agreement  the company acquired all of elan s equity interest in safescience newco in exchange for a royalty interest on certain future revenues and payments related to gcs under the termination agreement  such royalty payments  if any  are to be reduced by certain development costs to be incurred by the company 
a discounted cash flow analysis was applied to both the estimated future royalty payments and the offsetting development costs to be incurred by the company to measure the cost of the acquisition and the related liability 
the valuation of the royalty liability was determined using an income approach  discounted based on the estimated likelihood that such payments will ultimately be required to be made 
based upon this analysis  the company believes that the fair value of the development costs to be reimbursed by elan approximates the fair value of the estimated future royalty payments  accordingly no liability for the future contingent royalty payments has been reflected in the company s financial statements 
accrued clinical research organization costs the preparation of financial statements requires our management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amount of assets and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of expenses during the reported period 
specifically  our management must make estimates of costs incurred to date but not yet invoiced in relation to external clinical research organization  or cro  costs 
management analyzes the progress of clinical trials  invoices received and budgeted costs when evaluating the adequacy of the accrued liability 
significant management judgments and estimates must be made and used in connection with the accrued balance in any accounting period 
results of operations year ended december  versus year ended december  we had a net loss applicable to common stock of  for the year ended december  versus a net loss applicable to common stock of  for the year ended december  the net loss applicable to common stock for the year ended december  included a charge of  for dividends accreted on our series a and b convertible preferred stock compared to a charge of  for dividends accreted on our series a convertible preferred stock for the year ended december  we had a loss from continuing operations of  for the year ended december  versus a loss from continuing operations of  for the year ended december  the loss for the year ended december  included a charge in the amount of  related to our equity in the loss of safescience newco  compared to a charge in the amount of  related to our equity in the loss of safescience newco for the year ended december  research and development expenses developing carbohydrate based therapeutic compounds is our primary business focus and to a lesser extent  we have developed nontoxic agricultural products 
both areas are in the research and development phase and explanations of the changes in both areas from year to year are described in this section 
in july  the company transferred its rights to gcs in the field of oncology to safescience newco in connection with the formation of a joint venture with elan 
costs related to gcs incurred after the transfer to safescience newco  which were on behalf of safescience newco  were expensed by safescience newco 
these research and development costs were incurred either by the company or eis on behalf of safescience newco 
we reported our share of such expenses as a component of our equity in the loss of safescience newco 
all expenses associated with development of gcs incurred prior to the formation of safescience newco were recorded in the line item research development r d in the consolidated statement of operations 
following the termination of the joint venture with elan  on december   expenses associated with the development of gcs are again charged to r d expenses 
our research and development expenses for the years ended december  and were reported in the following financial statement captions years ended december  gcs equity in loss of safescience newco r d total gcs other products r d total research development expenses total research and development expenses for the year ended december  decreased by approximately  or  from the year ended december total gcs development expenses of  for the year ended december  represent a decrease of  or  from the  of expenses incurred during the year ended december  this decrease is primarily attributable to the expense incurred in conjunction with the license fee paid to elan by safescience newco in the amount of  in   of which was included in the equity in loss of safescience newco during the year ended december  other decreases include reductions of approximately i  in expenses for sponsored research  ii  in license fees paid to wayne state university  iii  in gcs production expense  iv  in non cash compensation related to warrants granted to wayne state university and the barbara ann karmanos cancer institute as compensation for a license  and v  in reduced costs associated with clinical trials 
these reductions were partially offset by increases in clinical  professional  analytical and consulting services of approximately  costs incurred by elan related to gcs included in the equity in loss of safescience newco of approximately  staffing related expenses of approximately  and royalty payments of approximately  research and development expenses for elexa and bb  our agricultural compounds  which consisted primarily of wages  consulting  registration and license fees  increased  or  to  for the year ended december  from  for the year ended december  the increase reflects additional field trials performed in and additional federal and state registrations 
the company plans to sell  or may no longer pursue active development of its agricultural products which are in various stages of development  by mid general and administrative expenses general and administrative expenses decreased to  for the year ended december  from  for the year ended december   a decrease of  or 
this decrease was principally attributable to reductions of approximately i  in non cash compensation for stock options granted to employees  ii  in public relations expenses  iii  in expenses charged to safescience newco and included as a component of our equity in loss of safescience newco  iv  in legal expenses  and v  in outside consulting expenses  partially offset by increased expenses for accounting of approximately  and insurance of approximately  interest income interest income decreased to  for the year ended december  from  for the year ended december   a decrease of  or 
this decrease was attributable to a reduction in cash available for investment and lower rates of return on those investments 
results of operations year ended december  versus year ended december  we had a net loss applicable to common stock of  for the year ended december  versus a net loss applicable to common stock of  for the year ended december  the net loss applicable to common stock for the year ended december  included a charge of  for dividends accreted on our series a convertible preferred stock that was issued in we had a loss from continuing operations of  for the year ended december  versus a loss from continuing operations of  for the year ended december  the loss for the year ended december  included a charge in the amount of  related to our equity in the loss of safescience newco 
safescience newco was formed in  accordingly  there was no loss related to safescience newco in research and development expenses our research and development expenses for the years ended december  and were reported in the following financial statement captions years ended december  gcs equity in loss of safescience newco r d total gcs other products r d total research development expenses total research and development expenses for the year ended december  increased by approximately  or  from the year ended december  total gcs development expenses of  represent an increase of  from the  of expenses incurred during the year ended december  this increase is primarily attributable to the expenses incurred in conjunction with the license fee paid to elan by safescience newco in the amount of  in   of which was included in the equity in loss of safescience newco during the year ended december  sponsored research expenses increased  to  during the year ended december  from  for the year ended december   primarily due to the relationship with mit begun in august we incurred research and development expenses of  related to license fees paid to wayne state university and non cash research and development expenses of  in connection with warrants issued to wayne state university and the barbara ann karmanos cancer institute to purchase common stock that vested during we had no such expenses in cost of managing our clinical trials decreased  or  to  during the year ended december  from  for the year ended december   primarily due to completion of the field work on both the colorectal and pancreatic trials 
research and development expenses for elexa and bb  our agricultural compounds  which consisted primarily of wages  consulting and license fees  decreased  or  to  for the year ended december  from  for the year ended december  the decrease reflects the company s de emphasis of its agricultural products 
general and administrative expenses general and administrative expenses decreased to  for the year ended december  from  for the year ended december   a decrease of  or 
this decrease was principally attributable to reductions of approximately i  in outside consulting expenses  ii  in public relations expenses  iii  in office expenses  iv  in expenses charged to safescience newco and reported as a component of our equity in the loss of safescience newco  v  in travel expenses  and vi  in rent expenses charged to continuing operations 
these decreases were offset by expenses previously charged as overhead in our consumer products business now discontinued of approximately  an increase in legal expense of approximately  due primarily to professional fees associated with the negotiation of the elan transactions and increased non cash compensation for stock options granted to employees of approximately  interest income interest income decreased to  for the year ended december  from  for the year ended december   a decrease of  or 
this decrease was attributable to a reduction in cash available for investment and lower rates of return on those investments 
liquidity and capital resources since inception  the company has funded its operations primarily with the proceeds from equity securities totaling approximately million 
for the year ended december   the company s operations utilized cash of approximately  primarily to fund the operating loss 
this use of cash was offset by equity financings that resulted in net proceeds of approximately  to the company 
in  the company s operations utilized cash of approximately  which was offset by equity financings that resulted in net proceeds of approximately  capital expenditures for the years ended december  and  which totaled  and  respectively  primarily related to computer and office equipment 
the company has no significant commitments for the purchase of equipment  product manufacturing facilities or marketing efforts at present 
the company leases office facilities under an operating lease that ends in march rent expense for this space will be approximately  in the company anticipates that its current offices will be adequate for its space requirements for the foreseeable future 
the company has retained beardsworth consulting group  a full service contract research organization cro  to support its clinical trial program 
they provide clinical research management  study and medical monitoring  data management and medical writing 
the total cost of beardsworth s services through june  is estimated to be approximately  for previously initiated trials  of which approximately  has been paid or accrued as of december  the remaining  is expected to be paid out by june  in addition  the cro costs associated with the planned future phase i and phase ii iii trials are estimated at  for fixed costs for each trial plus  per patient 
there are additional non cro costs associated with planned future clinical trials of approximately  per patient 
the company expects to incur substantial additional operating costs  including costs related to ongoing and planned research and development activities and preclinical studies 
the company is seeking to expand its product pipeline under development 
these new product candidates will either be developed jointly or licensed by the company 
the cost related to the development of new product candidates is projected to be in the range of  to  during the twelve months ended december  although it could be higher 
on december   the company and elan terminated their joint venture  safescience newco  and the company acquired elan s equity interest in safescience newco 
from inception on july  through december   elan provided million in research and development funding for gcs the company will not receive any additional funding from elan 
as of december   the company s cash and cash equivalents were  as compared to  as of december  the company has a  stand by line of credit with a bank secured by the company s cash and cash equivalents  which has no outstanding balance and a secured letter of credit in the amount of  which is held as security for deposits required by its lease of office space 
the company has no other commercial financing sources at present but may seek such sources in the future 
it is not known whether additional funds could be borrowed from stockholders or other sources 
as of april   the company s cash and cash equivalents were approximately  the company s future is dependent upon its ability to obtain financing to fund its operations 
as of april   the company has not obtained commitments from any existing or potential investors to provide additional financing 
the company expects to incur substantial additional operating costs  including costs related to ongoing research and development activities  preclinical studies and clinical trials 
to the extent that the company is unable to raise additional capital on a timely basis  management may prioritize research activities to conserve cash 
in the event additional financing is not obtained  the company may be required to significantly reduce or curtail operations 
the company believes that its existing funds will be sufficient to fund its operating expenses and capital requirements into the fourth quarter of consistent with prioritizing r d expenditures 
the company intends to raise additional equity financing 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure and market risk market risk the company is exposed to market risk related to changes in interest rates as well as changes in currency exchange rates as measured against the us dollar and each other which could positively or negatively affect results of operations and retained earnings 
as of december   the company has evaluated its risk and determined that any exposure to currency exchange is not significant to the company s overall consolidated financial results 
there can be no assurance that the company s exposure will remain at these levels  especially in the event of significant and sudden fluctuations in the value of local currencies 
the company does not use derivative financial instruments for speculative or trading purposes 
interest rate sensitivity the company maintains short term investments in an overnight money market account comprised of us treasury bills 
if market interest rates were to increase immediately and uniformly by from levels that existed at december   the fair value of the portfolio would change by an immaterial amount 
certain factors that may affect future results you should carefully consider the risks described below before making an investment decision 
if any of the following risks actually occur  our business  financial condition or results of operations could be materially and adversely affected 
in such case  the trading price of our common stock could decline  and you may lose all or part of your investment 
we have experienced significant losses throughout our history  we expect these losses to continue and we may not achieve profitability in the future 
we began operations more than ten years ago and have not generated revenue from human therapeutic products 
we previously generated limited revenues from the sale of consumer and commercial cleaning products  however  we discontinued our consumer and commercial product business in early we do not expect to generate product revenue for several years  if at all 
we will not generate funds unless we are able to sell our consumer and commercial and or agricultural business areas  or generate revenues through the receipt of payments in connection with any potential licensing  marketing or other partnering arrangement with other pharmaceutical or biotechnology companies  or bringing to market pharmaceutical products 
excluding dividends accreted to preferred stock  we have incurred approximately million of losses since our inception  including approximately million for the year ended december  extensive losses can be expected to continue for the foreseeable future 
we also expect to continue to incur significant operating expenses and capital expenditures and anticipate that our expenses will increase substantially in the foreseeable future as we conduct clinical trials  conduct research and development on existing and new product candidates  make milestone and royalty payments  seek regulatory approvals for our product candidates  commercialize our product candidates  if approved  hire additional clinical  scientific and management personnel  add operational  financial and management information systems and personnel  and identify and in license additional compounds or product candidates 
we may not be able to obtain additional funding  which could reduce our ability to fund  expand or continue operations 
we believe that our existing funds will be sufficient to fund our operating expenses and capital requirements into the fourth quarter of consistent with prioritizing r d expenditures 
we intend to raise additional capital through the sale of equity securities 
our future is dependent on our ability to obtain additional financing to fund our operations 
we expect to incur substantial additional operating costs  including costs related to ongoing research and development activities  preclinical studies and clinical trials 
additional equity financing may result in dilution to our shareholders 
at our current stock price or if the market price of our common stock declines  some potential investors may either refuse to offer us any financing or will offer financing at unacceptable rates or unfavorable terms 
if we are unable to obtain financing necessary to fund our operations  we may have to sell or liquidate glycogenesys or significantly reduce or curtail our operations 
we have received a going concern opinion from our independent auditors 
our consolidated financial statements have been prepared on the assumption that we will continue as a going concern 
deloitte touche llp issued a report dated march  that includes an explanatory paragraph stating that our recurring losses from operations  accumulated deficit of million as of december   and our expectation that we will incur substantial additional operating costs  including costs related to ongoing research and development activities  preclinical studies and clinical trials  among other things  raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern 
our future prospects are heavily dependent on the results of gcs while we seek to increase our portfolio of potential products  currently we are not developing a wide array of products 
most of our attention and resources are directed to the development of gcs if gcs is ultimately ineffective in treating cancer  does not receive the necessary regulatory approvals or does not obtain commercial acceptance  we will be materially adversely affected 
we are dependent on the successful outcome of clinical trials for gcs gcs is not currently approved for sale by the fda or by any other regulatory agency in the world  and gcs may never receive approval for sale or become commercially viable 
before obtaining regulatory approval for the sale of gcs or other product candidates  they must be subjected to extensive preclinical and clinical testing to demonstrate safety and efficacy for a particular indication for humans in addition to meeting other regulatory standards 
our success will depend on the successful outcome of our clinical trials 
there are a number of difficulties and risks associated with clinical trials 
the possibility exists that we may discover that gcs or another product candidate may cause harmful side effects  we may discover that gcs or another product candidate does not exhibit the expected therapeutic results in humans  results from early trials may not be statistically significant or predictive of results that will be obtained from large scale  advanced clinical trials  we or the fda may suspend the clinical trials of gcs or another product candidate  patient recruitment may be slower than expected  and patients may drop out of our clinical trials 
given the uncertainty surrounding the regulatory and clinical trial process  we may not be able to develop safety and efficacy data necessary for approval 
in addition  even if we receive approval  such approval may be limited in scope and hurt the commercial viability of such product 
if we are unable to successfully obtain approval of and commercialize any product candidate  this would materially harm our business  impair our ability to generate revenues and adversely impact our stock price 
our ability to develop gcs may be harmed if we are unable to find a new development partner 
on december   we and eis mutually terminated our joint venture and we acquired all outstanding capital stock of safescience newco 
safescience newco received a total of approximately million of research funds over the course of our joint venture with eis 
we must either fund the development of gcs ourselves or replace eis with a new development partner 
if we are unable to find a partner to replace eis  our ability to develop and commercialize gcs  and our prospects as a whole  could be materially harmed 
our failure to protect our intellectual property or our infringement on the property rights of others may impede our ability to operate freely 
we rely significantly upon proprietary technology and protect our intellectual property through patents  copyrights  trademarks and contractual agreements as appropriate 
we own or exclusively license issued us patents having expiration dates ranging from to four of these issued patents relate to gcs we own or exclusively license five foreign patents having expiration dates ranging from to four of these five foreign patents relate to gcs we own or exclusively license nine pending us patent applications  of which five relate to gcs and pending foreign patent applications  of which relate to gcs as we develop gcs  we may discover more about its characteristics and manufacturing which will require additional patent prosecution 
thus  we continually evaluate our technology to determine whether to make further patent filings 
to the extent aspects of our technology may be unpatentable  we may determine to maintain such technology as trade secrets or we may protect such unpatented technology by contractual agreements 
our unpatented technology or similar technology could be independently developed by others 
in addition  the contractual agreements by which we protect our unpatented technology and trade secrets may be breached 
if our technology is independently developed or our contractual agreements are breached  our technology will be less valuable and our business will be harmed 
there is always a risk that issued patents may be subsequently invalidated  either in whole or in part  and this could diminish or extinguish our patent protection for key elements of our technology 
we are not involved in any such litigation or proceedings  nor are we aware of any basis for such litigation or proceedings 
the patents we exclusively license from wayne state university and the karmanos cancer institute and the patent application we exclusively license from dr 
david platt could become subject to a proceeding at the us patent and trademark office to determine priority 
we cannot be certain as to the scope of patent protection  if any  which may be granted on our patent applications 
our potential products or business activities could be determined to infringe intellectual rights of third parties despite our issued patents 
any claims against us or any purchaser or user of our potential products  including gcs  asserting that such product or process infringes intellectual property rights of third parties  if determined adversely to us could have a material effect on our business  financial condition or future operations 
any asserted claims of infringement  with or without merit  could be time consuming  result in costly litigation  divert the efforts of our technical and management personnel  or require us to enter into royalty or licensing agreements  any of which could materially adversely affect our operating results 
such royalty or licensing agreements  if required  may not be available on terms acceptable to us  if at all 
in the event a claim is successful against us and we cannot obtain a license to the relevant technology on acceptable terms  license a substitute technology or redesign our products to avoid infringement  our business  financial condition and operating results would be materially adversely affected 
we depend on technology licensed to us by third parties and if we are unable to continue licensing this technology our future prospects may be materially adversely affected 
we license technology  including gcs  from third parties 
we anticipate that we will continue to license technology from third parties in the future 
to maintain our license with wayne state university and the karmanos cancer institute we must  among other things  pay wayne state university and the karmanos cancer institute royalties on product sales and up to million in milestone payments and receive fda or equivalent agency approval to sell gcs by january  to maintain our license with dr 
platt we must pay an annual license fee equal to the greater of  or of product sales 
the technology we license from third parties would be difficult to replace 
the loss of any of these technology licenses would result in delays in the development of our products until equivalent technology  if available  is identified  licensed and integrated and could materially adversely affect our future prospects 
the use of replacement technology from other third parties would require us to enter into license agreements with these third parties  which could result in higher royalty payments and a loss of product differentiation 
we expect to remain dependent on third parties for research and development activities necessary to commercialize our products 
we do not maintain our own laboratories  however  we employ four full time scientific personnel and utilize the services of several scientific consultants 
we do utilize laboratory space which we rent on a short term basis 
however  we contract out most of our research and development operations for gcs  utilizing third party contract manufacturers such as hollister stier llc to manufacture gcs  cbr laboratories  inc  incell corporation  llc and tga sciences  inc for assay development and third party contract research organizations  such as itr laboratories canada  inc and beardsworth consulting group  inc 
to perform pre clinical and or clinical studies in accordance with our designed protocols  as well as sponsoring research at medical and academic centers  such as the university of arizona and st 
bartholomew s and the royal london school of medicine 
in addition  we employ several consultants to oversee various aspects of our protocol design  clinical trial oversight and other research and development functions 
because we rely on third parties for much of our research and development work  we have less direct control over our research and development 
we face risks that these third parties may not be appropriately responsive to our timeframes and development needs and could devote resources to other customers 
if our agriculture products are not accepted by the agricultural community the agricultural area of our business will suffer 
our focus is primarily pharmaceuticals and to a lesser extent agricultural products 
we intend to either sell or curtail development of our agricultural products by mid if we sell our agricultural products  we would seek to receive royalties on future sales of such products 
commercial sales of our proposed agricultural products will substantially depend upon the products efficacy and on their acceptance by the agricultural community 
for example  elexa works by a different mode of action than current fungicides because it increases a plant s natural resistance to disease instead of killing the fungus directly 
widespread acceptance of elexa in the agricultural field will require educating the agricultural community as to the benefits and reliability of elexa 
our proposed products may not be accepted  and  even if accepted  we are unable to estimate the length of time it would take for a purchaser of our agriculture business to gain such acceptance 
if the third parties we rely on for manufacturing our products are unable to produce the necessary amounts of our products  do not meet our quality needs or terminate their relationships with us  our business will suffer 
we do not presently have our own manufacturing operations  nor do we intend to establish any unless and until  in the opinion of our management  the size and scope of our business so warrants 
while we have established a manufacturing relationship with hollister stier llc to provide us with gcs that we believe will provide the capability to meet our anticipated requirements for the foreseeable future  we have not entered into any long term arrangements for manufacturing and such arrangements may not be obtained on desirable terms 
therefore  for the foreseeable future  we will be dependent upon third parties to manufacture our products 
our reliance on independent manufacturers involves a number of risks  including the absence of adequate capacity  the unavailability of  or interruptions in  access to necessary manufacturing processes and reduced control over delivery schedules 
third party manufacturers may not comply with fda regulations  or other regulatory requirements relating to the manufacturing of our products  including compliance with good manufacturing practice  or gmp 
we do not have control over  other than through contract  third party manufacturers compliance with these regulations and standards 
if our manufacturers are unable or unwilling to continue manufacturing our products in required volumes  we will have to identify acceptable alternative manufacturers 
if we need to change manufacturers  the fda and corresponding foreign regulatory agencies must approve these manufacturers in advance  which will involve testing and additional inspections to ensure compliance with fda regulations and standards 
the use of a new manufacturer may cause significant expense and interruptions in supply if the new manufacturer has difficulty manufacturing products to our specifications 
further  the introduction of a new manufacturer may increase the variation in the quality of our products 
many of our competitors have substantially greater resources than we do and may be able to develop and commercialize products that make our potential products obsolete or non competitive 
a biotechnology company such as ours must keep pace with rapid technological change and faces intense competition 
we compete with biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies for funding  access to new technology  research personnel and in product research and development 
many of these companies have greater financial resources and more experience than we do in developing drugs  obtaining regulatory approvals  manufacturing and marketing 
we also face competition from academic and research institutions and government agencies pursuing alternatives to our products and technologies 
we expect that our products under development  including gcs  will face intense competition from existing or future drugs 
in addition  our product candidates may face increasing competition from generic formulations or existing drugs whose active components are no longer covered by patents 
according to industry surveys  there are over new drug candidates in development to treat various types of cancer  many of them for multiple indications 
this research is being conducted by pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies and the national cancer institute 
we have completed two phase i clinical trials  the first enrolled late stage patients with differing types of cancer all comers and the second enrolled patients with late stage prostate cancer 
we also conducted two phase ii a clinical trials  one in patients with refractory or relapsing pancreatic cancer and the other in refractory or relapsing colorectal cancer 
in addition  we have completed patient enrollment in a dose escalation phase i trial in which patients were dosed at up to mg m twice a week 
in the two cancer types in which we have conducted phase ii a clinical trials  pancreatic and colorectal  there are many drugs being developed 
we believe  based on industry studies there are  including gcs  approximately drugs in phase i  drugs in phase ii  drugs in phase iii or pre registration for treatment of pancreatic cancer 
in addition  gcs  if it receives fda approval for pancreatic cancer  will face competition from existing drugs approved or used to treat pancreatic cancer 
these drugs are fluorouracil fu  eli lilly s gemcitabine gemzar and supergens mitozytrex 
combination studies utilizing new drug candidates and gemzar are ongoing and combination therapies of new drug candidates and gemzar may present future competition 
we believe  based on industry studies  there are  including gcs  approximately drugs in phase i  drugs in phase ii  and drugs in phase iii development for treatment of colorectal cancer 
in addition gcs  if it receives fda approval for colorectal cancer  will face competition from existing drugs approved or used to treat colorectal cancer 
these drugs include roche pharmaceuticals capecitabine xeloda  flourouracil adrucil or fu  leucovorin  in combination with fu  janssen s levamisole ergamisol in combination with fu and pharmacia s irinotecan camptosar 
our competitors may successfully identify drug candidates or develop products earlier than we do  obtain approvals from the fda or foreign regulatory bodies more rapidly than we do  develop products that are more effective  have fewer side effects or cost less than our products  or successfully market products that may compete with our product candidates 
the success of our competitors in any of these efforts would adversely affect our ability to develop  commercialize and market our product candidates 
our businesses are subject to significant government regulation and failure to achieve regulatory approval of our products would severely harm our business 
the fda regulates the development  testing  manufacture  distribution  labeling and promotion of pharmaceutical products in the united states pursuant to the federal food  drug  and cosmetic act and related regulations 
we must receive premarket approval by the fda prior to any commercial sale of our pharmaceutical products 
before receiving such approval we must provide proof in human clinical trials of the nontoxicity  safety and efficacy of our pharmaceutical products  which trials can take several years 
premarket approval is a lengthy and expensive process 
we may not be able to obtain fda approval for any commercial sale of our product 
by statute and regulation  the fda has days to review an application for approval to market a pharmaceutical product  however  the fda frequently exceeds the day time period  at times taking up to months 
in addition  based on its review  the fda may determine that additional clinical trials are required 
except for any potential licensing or marketing arrangements with other pharmaceutical or biotechnology companies  we will not generate any revenues in connection with our pharmaceutical products unless and until we obtain fda approval to sell our products in commercial quantities for human application 
the investigation  manufacture and sale of agricultural products are subject to regulation by the epa  including the need for approval before marketing  and by comparable foreign and state agencies 
our agricultural products will be able to be commercially marketed for use either in the united states or other countries only by first obtaining the necessary approvals 
while we hope to obtain all regulatory approvals for our proposed products  we may not obtain these approvals on a timely basis  if at all 
we have received approval from the epa  california and other states for elexa 
in addition  bb has received full approval from the epa 
reimbursement procedures and future healthcare reform measures are uncertain and may adversely impact our ability to successfully sell or license any pharmaceutical product 
our ability to successfully sell or license any pharmaceutical product will depend in part on the extent to which government health administration authorities  private health insurers and other organizations will reimburse patients or providers for the costs of our future pharmaceutical products and related treatments 
in the united states  government and other third party payers have sought to contain healthcare costs by limiting both coverage and the level of reimbursement for new pharmaceutical products approved for marketing by the fda 
in some cases  these payers may refuse to provide any coverage for uses of approved products to treat medical conditions even though the fda has granted marketing approval 
healthcare reform may increase these cost containment efforts 
we believe that managed care organizations may seek to restrict the use of new products  delay authorization to use new products or limit coverage and the level of reimbursement for new products 
internationally  where national healthcare systems are prevalent  little if any funding may be available for new products  and cost containment and cost reduction efforts can be more pronounced than in the united states 
if we are unable to enter into agreements with third parties to provide sales  marketing and distribution capabilities  or to create these functions ourselves  we will not be able to commercialize our product candidates 
we do not have any sales  marketing or distribution capabilities 
in order to commercialize gcs or other product candidates  if any are approved  we must either make arrangements with third parties to provide sales  marketing and distribution capabilities or acquire or internally develop these functions ourselves 
if we obtain fda approval for gcs or other product candidates  we intend to rely on relationships with one or more pharmaceutical companies or other third parties with established distribution systems and direct sales forces to market gcs or other product candidates 
if we decide to market any of our product candidates directly  we must either acquire or internally develop a marketing and sales force with technical expertise and with supporting distribution capabilities 
the acquisition or development of a sales and distribution infrastructure would require substantial resources  which may divert the attention of our management and key personnel  and negatively impact our product development efforts 
moreover  we may not be able to establish in house sales and distribution capabilities or relationships with third parties 
to the extent we enter into co promotion or other licensing agreements  our product revenues are likely to be lower than if we directly marketed and sold our product candidates  and any revenue we receive will depend upon the efforts of third parties  which may not be successful 
our growth may be limited if we are unable to retain and hire additional qualified personnel as necessary 
our success will depend on our ability to retain key employees and our continuing ability to attract and retain highly qualified scientific  technical and managerial personnel 
under our current clinical trial and business plan  we may add up to an additional employees over the course of the next two years  as needs develop 
competition for such personnel is intense and we may not be able to retain existing personnel or attract qualified employees in the future 
our limited drug pipeline and small size make it more difficult to compete for such personnel against larger  more diversified companies 
at present  we employ full time employees and one part time worker 
we depend upon the personal efforts and abilities of our officers and directors  including bradley j 
carver  our president  ceo and interim chairman of the board and john w 
burns  our senior vice president  chief financial officer and a director and would be materially adversely affected if their services ceased to be available for any reason and comparable replacement personnel were not employed 
the businesses in which we engage have a risk of product liability  and in the event of a suit against us  our business could be severely harmed 
the testing  marketing and sale of pharmaceutical and agricultural products entails a risk of product liability claims by patients and others 
while we currently maintain product liability insurance  such insurance may not be available at reasonable cost and in the event of a significant adverse event with a patient or customer such insurance would likely be insufficient to cover the full amount of the liability incurred 
in the event of a successful suit against us  payments and damage to our reputation could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition 
even if such a suit is unsuccessful  our reputation could be damaged and litigation costs and expenditures of management time on such matters could adversely affect our business and financial condition 
we are contractually obligated to issue shares in the future  including shares to be issued upon the conversion of outstanding preferred stock and warrants held by eis  which will cause dilution of your interest in us 
as of march   there are outstanding options to purchase  shares of common stock  at a weighted average exercise price of per share and warrants to purchase  shares of common stock at a weighted average exercise price of per share 
moreover  we may in the future issue additional shares to raise capital  acquire other companies or technologies  to pay for services  or for other corporate purposes 
any such issuances will have the effect of further diluting the interest of shareholders 
in july  in connection with a business venture and financing transaction  we issued to eis  shares of our series c convertible non voting preferred stock   shares of our series a convertible non voting preferred stock and a warrant to purchase  shares of our common stock 
between the formation of the joint venture with eis and its termination in december  we sold  shares of our series b convertible non voting preferred stock to eis 
in addition  in december  we issued  shares of series a preferred stock to eis in exchange for the cancellation of mandatory dividends and the redemption feature 
each share of our series a preferred stock and series c preferred stock is convertible after july  into  shares of our common stock  subject to anti dilution adjustments 
each share of our series b preferred stock is presently convertible after december  into  shares of our common stock  subject to anti dilution adjustments 
the series b preferred stock bears a dividend payable in series b preferred stock  which compounds annually 
in january  we sold to eis warrants to purchase a total of  shares of common stock in connection with a private placement 
accordingly  a total of  shares of our common stock could be issued to eis  assuming the exercise of the warrants and the conversion into common stock of all shares of series a  series b and series c preferred stock currently outstanding  but not including any dividends to be issued on the series b preferred stock 
this amount of shares represents of our currently outstanding common stock 
pursuant to provisions in our agreement with eis  if the exercise or conversion of any of our securities held by eis would result in eis owning more than of our common stock at any time eis may opt to receive non voting securities instead of common stock 
we must comply with the listing requirements of the nasdaq smallcap market or our common stock may decline and the liquidity of an investment in our securities would decrease 
our common stock could be delisted from the nasdaq smallcap market for the following reasons among others if the bid price of our common stock falls below per share for thirty consecutive business days  if our market capitalization falls below million and we have less than  in stockholders equity  or if the value of our common stock held by our stockholders other than our directors  executive officers and stockholders is less than there are other quantitative and qualitative criteria of the nasdaq smallcap market which if violated could lead to delisting of our common stock 
we may not be able to maintain our compliance with nasdaq continued listing requirements in the future 
the closing bid price of our common stock has been below since june  on july   we received a letter from nasdaq that the bid price of our common stock had been below for consecutive business days and that we had a day grace period to january  to achieve a bid price of at least for a period of consecutive business days or face delisting 
in january  under a program implemented on a pilot basis  nasdaq granted us an additional day grace period ending july  to correct our minimum bid price deficiency because we had in excess of  in stockholders equity 
our stockholders equity was approximately million as of december  in light of the declines in our stock price  our market capitalization has been below million since july  if nasdaq delisted our common stock  we would likely seek to list our common stock for quotation on a regional stock exchange 
however  if we were unable to obtain listing or quotation on such market or exchange  trading of our common stock would occur in the over the counter market on an electronic bulletin board for unlisted securities or in what are commonly known as the pink sheet 
in addition  delisting from nasdaq and failure to obtain listing or quotation on such market or exchange would subject our common stock to so called penny stock rules 
these rules impose additional sales practice and market making requirements on broker dealers who sell and or make a market in such securities  such as disclosing offer and bid prices and compensation received from a trade to a purchaser and sending monthly account statements to purchasers 
consequently  broker dealers may be less willing or able to sell and or make a market in our common stock 
these rules also require that purchasers be accredited investors  which would reduce the number of investors who could purchase our shares 
additionally  an investor would find it more difficult to dispose of  or to obtain accurate quotations for the price of  our common stock 
as a result of delisting  it may become more difficult for us to raise funds through the sale of our securities 
our stock price could decline if a significant number of shares become available for sale 
as of march   approximately  shares of common stock presently issued and outstanding are restricted securities as that term is defined in rule promulgated under the act 
in general  a person or persons whose shares are aggregated who has satisfied a one year holding period may sell  within any three month period  an amount of restricted securities which does not exceed the greater of of the then outstanding shares of common stock or the average weekly trading volume during the four calendar weeks prior to such sale 
persons who are not affiliates of glycogenesys and who have beneficially owned the shares for a minimum period of two years can sell restricted securities  under certain circumstances  without any quantity limitation 
the sale of these restricted shares including restricted shares that may be sold pursuant to our seven effective registration statements  shall increase the number of free trading shares and may have a depressive effect on the price of our securities 
moreover  such sales  if substantial  might also adversely affect our ability to raise additional equity capital 
because our management could control a significant percentage of our common stock  they could exercise substantial control over us 
the holders of the common stock do not have cumulative voting rights 
our directors  two of whom are executive officers of glycogenesys  own approximately collectively of our currently outstanding shares of common stock 
one of the conditions of the transactions between us  elan and eis required that we expand our board of directors at our annual stockholder s meeting at which time eis could appoint one director 
eis decided not to appoint a director at our annual stockholders meeting but may choose to do so in the future as long as they own at least of our common stock assuming exercise or conversion of convertible or exercisable securities held by eis 
if eis appoints a director  members of the board of directors and their affiliates shall own approximately of our currently outstanding common stock  assuming eis has not converted or exercised any of our securities held by it  and the same number of shares are outstanding at such time as are currently outstanding 
if eis and our directors were to have converted or exercised all of our securities held by them  the members of our board of directors and their affiliates would own approximately of the outstanding common stock  assuming the number of shares outstanding at such time equals the number of shares currently outstanding plus the number of shares issued on exercise or conversion of securities held by eis and our directors 
this concentration of ownership would allow these stockholders to substantially influence all matters requiring stockholder approval and could have the effect of delaying or preventing a change in control or otherwise discouraging a potential acquirer from attempting to obtain control of us  which in turn could materially adversely affect our stock price 
the price of our common stock has been volatile  which could result in substantial losses by you 
the market price of our common stock  which is traded on the national association of securities dealers automated quotation nasdaq small cap has been  and may continue to be  highly volatile 
during the twelve months ending march   our common stock has traded at prices ranging from to per share 
factors such as announcements of clinical trial results  financings  technological innovations or new products  either by us or by our competitors or third parties  as well as market conditions within the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries  may have a significant impact on the market price of our common stock 
in addition  the stock market has from time to time  and especially in the last few years  experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations  particularly in the biotechnology sector  which have often been unrelated to the operating performance of particular companies 
current market conditions are particularly unstable and there is a large degree of uncertainty at this time 
in general  biotechnology stocks tend to be volatile even during periods of relative market stability because of the high rates of failure and substantial funding requirements associated with biotechnology companies 
market conditions and conditions of the biotechnology sector could negatively impact the price of our common stock
