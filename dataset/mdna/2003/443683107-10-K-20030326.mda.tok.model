item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations this discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with hudson city bancorp s consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements in item  and the other statistical data provided elsewhere in this document 
general our results of operations depend primarily on net interest income 
net interest income is the difference between the interest income we earn on our interest earning assets  primarily mortgage loans  mortgage backed securities and investment securities  and the interest we pay on our interest bearing liabilities  primarily time deposits  interest bearing demand deposits and borrowed funds 
our results of operations are also affected by our provision for loan losses  non interest income  and non interest expense 
non interest expense consists primarily of salaries and employee benefits  occupancy expenses and other general and administrative expenses 
non interest income generally consists of service charges and fees and may include gains on the disposition of assets 
our results of operations may also be affected significantly by general and local economic and competitive conditions  particularly those with respect to changes in market interest rates  government policies and actions of regulatory authorities 
future changes in applicable law  regulations or government policies may materially impact us 
additionally  our lending activity is concentrated in loans secured by real estate primarily located in new jersey 
accordingly  our results of operations may be affected by regional market and economic conditions 
mutual holding company structure in  hudson city savings converted and reorganized from a new jersey chartered mutual savings bank into a two tiered mutual savings bank holding company structure and became a wholly owned subsidiary of hudson city bancorp 
hudson city bancorp sold of the then outstanding shares of its common stock to the public at per share and received net proceeds of million 
hudson city bancorp contributed of the net proceeds from the initial public offering to hudson city savings 
hudson city bancorp issued of the then outstanding shares of its common stock to hudson city  mhc 
at december   as a result of stock repurchases  hudson city  mhc owned of hudson city bancorp 
growth initiatives in accordance with our business plan  we have developed and employed several initiatives  including a program to purchase whole mortgage loans and the introduction of our interest bearing high value checking account  to effectively and prudently utilize our capital through internally generated growth 
during  these initiatives helped us to increase our core investments in mortgage related assets  increase our deposit customer base and grow our assets by  or over billion 
we expect to continue to grow through internal expansion using borrowed funds to supplement our deposit initiatives as a funding source  as well as by adding new branch offices  a strategy that has been successful for us in the past 
page management of interest rate risk as a financial institution  our primary component of market risk is interest rate volatility 
net interest income is the primary component of our net income  and fluctuations in interest rates will ultimately impact the level of both income and expense recorded on a large portion of our assets and liabilities 
fluctuations in interest rates will also affect the market value of all interest earning assets  other than those that possess a short term to maturity 
a decreasing interest rate environment  such as experienced during and  can be beneficial to our net interest income as our interest bearing liabilities generally reprice faster than our interest earning assets 
a steepening yield curve  where the spread between long term interest rates and short term interest rates widens  can also be beneficial to our net interest income as our interest bearing liabilities generally price off short term market rates while our mortgage loan products  particularly those with initial terms to maturity or repricing greater than one year  generally price off long term market rates 
conversely  a narrowing or flattening yield curve may have an adverse impact on our net interest income as the interest rate spread between our interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities decreases 
also impacting our net interest income and net interest rate spread is the level of prepayment activity on our mortgage related assets 
the actual amount of time before mortgage loans and mortgage backed securities are repaid can be significantly impacted by changes in market interest rates and mortgage prepayment rates 
mortgage prepayment rates will vary due to a number of factors  including the regional economy in the area where the underlying mortgages were originated  seasonal factors  demographic variables and the assumability of the underlying mortgages 
however  the major factors affecting prepayment rates are prevailing interest rates  related mortgage refinancing opportunities and competition 
the historically low market interest rates experienced during and increased prepayment activity on our mortgage related assets  which may have an adverse impact on our net interest income and interest rate spread in future periods 
general market interest rates declined during and  reflecting reductions of rates by the federal open market committee fomc of the federal reserve bank 
the overall market yield curve steepened during as interest rates on short term maturities declined faster than the interest rates on long term maturities 
market interest rates on short term maturities remained relatively stable through the first nine months of  then declined slightly due to a further fomc rate reduction in the fourth quarter of long term market interest rates continued to steadily decline in  thus narrowing the overall market yield curve 
in the interest rate environment experienced in  our net interest rate spread increased basis points to from for it has been because of our ability to grow our business with low cost interest bearing liabilities that we have been able to increase our net interest income during however  the current narrower yield curve may have an adverse impact on our future net interest income and net interest rate spread 
the primary objectives of our interest rate risk management strategy are to evaluate the interest rate risk inherent in certain balance sheet accounts  determine the appropriate level of interest rate risk given our business plan  the current business environment and our capital and liquidity requirements  and manage interest rate risk in a manner consistent with the approved guidelines and policies set by our board of directors 
page we seek to coordinate asset and liability decisions so that  under changing interest rate scenarios  earnings will remain within an acceptable range 
to achieve the objectives of managing interest rate risk  our asset liability committee meets weekly to discuss and monitor the market interest rate environment compared to interest rates that are offered on our products 
this committee consists of the chief executive officer  the chief operating officer and the investment officer 
the asset liability committee presents periodic reports to the board of directors at its regular meetings  as well as a comprehensive quarterly report to the asset management committee of the board of directors 
the quarterly reports address the results of activities and strategies and the effect that changes in interest rates will have on our results of operations and the present value of our equity 
historically  our lending activities have emphasized one to four family first and second mortgage loans 
we believe that the frequent repricing of adjustable rate mortgage loans and adjustable rate securities  which reduces the exposure to interest rate fluctuations  would benefit our long term profitability 
however  the prevailing interest rate environment in recent years has resulted in increased demand for fixed rate first mortgage loans 
the result has been an increase in the proportion of fixed rate loans in our portfolio 
this may have an adverse impact on our net interest income  particularly in a rising interest rate environment 
the purchase of real estate mortgage investment conduits remic to supplement our purchases of adjustable rate mortgage backed securities has given us additional interest rate risk protection 
at the date of purchase  these remic securities generally had shorter weighted average lives than traditional mortgage backed security purchases due to their prepayment schedules 
however  since the remic purchases have fixed interest rates  the weighted average life will vary with changes in market interest rates 
our primary source of funds has been deposits  consisting primarily of time deposits  which have substantially shorter terms to maturity than the loan portfolio 
we use securities sold under agreements to repurchase and fhlb advances as additional sources of funds 
these borrowings are generally long term  in an effort to offset our short term deposit liabilities and assist in managing our interest rate risk 
certain of these borrowings have call options that could shorten their maturities in a rising interest rate environment 
due to the nature of our operations  we are not subject to foreign currency exchange or commodity price risk 
instead  our real estate loan portfolio  primarily located in new jersey  is subject to risks associated with the local economy 
we do not own any trading assets 
we did not engage in any hedging transactions that use derivative instruments such as interest rate swaps and caps during and did not have any such hedging transactions in place at december  in the future  we may  with approval of our board of directors  engage in hedging transactions utilizing derivative instruments 
gap analysis 
the matching of the repricing characteristics of assets and liabilities may be analyzed by examining the extent to which such assets and liabilities are interest rate sensitive and by monitoring a financial institution s interest rate sensitivity gap 
an asset or liability is said to be interest rate sensitive within a specific time period if it will mature or reprice within that time period 
the interest rate sensitivity gap is defined as the difference between the amount of interest earning assets maturing or repricing within a specific time period and the amount of interest bearing liabilities maturing or repricing within that same time period 
page a gap is considered positive when the amount of interest earning assets maturing or repricing within a specific time period exceeds the amount of interest bearing liabilities maturing or repricing within that specific time period 
a gap is considered negative when the amount of interest bearing liabilities maturing or repricing within a specific time period exceeds the amount of interest earning assets maturing or repricing within the same period 
during a period of rising interest rates  a financial institution with a negative gap position would be expected  absent the effects of other factors  to experience a greater increase in the costs of its liabilities relative to the yields of its assets and thus a decrease in the institution s net interest income 
an institution with a positive gap position would be expected  absent the effect of other factors  to experience the opposite result 
conversely  during a period of falling interest rates  a negative gap would tend to result in an increase in net interest income while a positive gap would tend to reduce net interest income 
the following table  referred to as the gap table  presents the amounts of our interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities outstanding at december   which we anticipate to reprice or mature in each of the future time periods shown 
except as stated below  we determined the amounts of assets and liabilities shown which reprice or mature during a particular period in accordance with the earlier of the term to repricing or the contractual maturity of the asset or liability 
the information presented in the gap table is also based on the following assumptions we assumed an annual prepayment rate of for mortgage loans repricing or maturing after one year  we assumed an annual prepayment rate of for mortgage backed securities repricing or maturing after one year  we reported savings accounts that had no stated maturity using decay rates of in less than six months  in six months to one year  in one year to two years  in two years to three years  in three years to five years  and in over five years  we reported the million balance in our high value checking account  which is a component of interest bearing demand accounts  that had no stated maturity using decay rates of in less than six months  in six months to one year  in one to two years  in two to three years  and in three years to five years  we reported the million balance in our traditional now accounts  which is a component of interest bearing demand accounts  that had no stated maturity using decay rates of in less than six months  in six months to one year  in one year to two years  in two years to three years  in three years to five years  and in over five years  we reported money market accounts using decay rates of in less than six months  in six months to one year  in one year to two years  and in two years to three years 
in  prepayment assumptions on mortgage loans and mortgage backed securities were and  respectively 
the change in the prepayment assumptions for was due to the increase in prepayments experienced during the year on these investments resulting from the lower interest rate environment 
page our determination of deposit decay rates is based on regulatory guidance  as modified by our historical experience 
the initial decay rates on our high value checking account are based on our initial assessment of the volatility of the product given its current interest rate in relation to the overall market interest rate environment 
the initial decay rates will be monitored closely and adjusted as required in future periods 
deposit decay rates  prepayment rates and anticipated bond or borrowing calls can have a significant impact on the estimated interest sensitivity gap 
while we believe that our assumptions are reasonable  they may not be indicative of actual future deposit decay activity  mortgage and mortgage backed securities prepayments  and the actual timing of calls of federal agency bonds or borrowed funds 
we have excluded non accrual loans totaling  from the table 
as indicated in the gap table at december   our interest bearing liabilities maturing or repricing within one year exceeded our interest earning assets maturing or repricing within the same period by million compared with billion at december  this represented a cumulative one year interest rate sensitivity gap as a percent of total assets of negative at december  compared with negative at december  however  if current mortgage loan and mortgage backed security prepayment assumptions were used at december   and all other assumptions remained the same for that analysis  the cumulative interest sensitivity gap as a percentage of total assets would have been approximately negative 
the ratio of interest earning assets maturing or repricing within one year to interest bearing liabilities maturing or repricing within one year was at december  compared with at december  the change in these ratios  year to year  was primarily due to the accelerated prepayment assumptions for mortgage loans and mortgage backed securities used during the current lower interest rate environment and the overall growth in our assets during the change also reflected the growth of borrowed funds in the current year with maturities in excess of one year  the shift of time deposit maturities to over one year due to pricing strategies  and the growth of our high value checking account  which we estimate to have a decay rate in excess of one year of

page the methods used in the gap table are inherently imprecise 
for example  although certain assets and liabilities may have similar maturities or periods to repricing  they may react in different degrees to changes in market interest rates 
interest rates on certain types of assets and liabilities may fluctuate in advance of changes in market interest rates  while interest rates on other types may lag behind changes in market rates 
certain assets  such as adjustable rate loans and mortgage backed securities  have features that limit changes in interest rates on a short term basis and over the life of the loan 
if interest rates change  prepayment and early withdrawal levels would likely deviate significantly from those assumed in calculating the table 
finally  the ability of borrowers to make payments on their adjustable rate loans may decrease if interest rates increase 
present value of equity 
in addition to the gap analysis  we also use a simulation model to monitor interest rate risk 
this model reports the present value of equity in different interest rate environments  assuming an instantaneous and permanent interest rate shock to all interest rate sensitive assets and liabilities 
the present value of equity is the difference between the estimated fair value of interest rate sensitive assets and liabilities 
the changes in market value of assets and liabilities due to changes in interest rates reflect the interest sensitivity of those assets and liabilities as their values are derived from the characteristics of the asset or liability ie  fixed rate  adjustable rate  caps  floors relative to the current interest rate environment 
for example  in a rising interest rate environment the fair market value of a fixed rate asset will decline  whereas the fair market value of an adjustable rate asset  depending on its repricing characteristics  may not decline 
increases in the market value of assets will increase the present value of equity whereas decreases in market value of assets will decrease the present value of equity 
conversely  increases in the market value of liabilities will decrease the present value of equity whereas decreases in the market value of liabilities will increase the present value of equity 
our policy sets a maximum percentage change in the present value of equity of from the current  or zero basis point  present value of equity  given an instantaneous and parallel increase or decrease of basis points 
although the percent change in the present value of equity at december  was within the december  maximum percent change limit of  the maximum percent change was increased in to to allow for more flexibility in managing our asset liability mix 
page the following table presents the estimated present value of equity over a range of interest rate change scenarios at december  the present value ratio shown in the table is the present value of equity as a percent of the present value of total assets in each of the different rate environments 
for purposes of this table  we have made assumptions such as prepayment rates and decay rates similar to those used for the gap analysis table 
present value of equity as percent of present present value of equity value of assets change in dollar dollar percent present value percent interest rates amount change change ratio change basis points dollars in thousands at december   the percent change in the present value of equity in the basis point increase scenario was negative and in the basis point decrease scenario it was positive compared with the table above 
the decreases in the present value of equity and the percent change in the present value of equity in the increasing rate scenarios in the december  analysis were primarily due to the growth of our fixed rate mortgage loans and mortgage backed securities 
generally  these assets will not reprice in a rising rate environment 
the overall decrease in the present value of equity and the percent change in the present value of equity in the decreasing rate scenarios in the december  analysis was primarily due to the growth of our fixed rate borrowed funds in this low interest rate environment 
fixed rate borrowed funds  even those with call options  generally do not reprice in a decreasing rate environment 
we believe the and basis point decrease scenarios presented above may not be meaningful given the prevailing low market interest rate environment 
as in the case of the gap table  the methods we used in the previous table are also inherently imprecise 
this type of modeling requires that we make assumptions that may not reflect the manner in which actual yields and costs respond to changes in market interest rates 
for example  we assume the composition of the interest rate sensitive assets and liabilities will remain constant over the period being measured and that all interest rate shocks will be uniformly reflected across the yield curve  regardless of the duration to maturity or repricing 
the table assumes that we will take no action in response to the changes in interest rates 
in addition  prepayment estimates and other assumptions within the model are subjective in nature  involve uncertainties  and  therefore  cannot be determined with precision 
accordingly  although the present value of equity model may provide an estimate of our interest rate risk at a particular point in time  such measurements are not intended to and do not provide a precise forecast of the effect of changes in interest rates on our present value of equity 
page analysis of net interest income net interest income represents the difference between the interest income we earn on our interest earning assets  such as mortgage loans  mortgage backed securities and investment securities  and the expense we pay on interest bearing liabilities  such as time deposits and borrowed funds 
net interest income depends on our volume of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities and the interest rates we earned or paid on them 
average balance sheet 
the following table presents certain information regarding our financial condition and net interest income for  and the table presents the average yield on interest earning assets and the average cost of interest bearing liabilities for the periods indicated 
we derived the yields and costs by dividing income or expense by the average balance of interest earning assets or interest bearing liabilities  respectively  for the periods shown 
we derived average balances from daily balances over the periods indicated

      page comparison of financial condition at december  and december  during the year ended december   we continued to grow our operating subsidiary  hudson city savings bank  primarily through our core investments of residential mortgage loans and mortgage backed securities 
customer deposits and long term borrowings funded the growth 
as a result  our total assets increased billion  or  to billion at december  from billion at december  loans increased billion  or  to billion at december  from billion at december  for the year ended december   we originated first mortgage loans of billion and purchased first mortgage loans of billion  compared with billion and million  respectively  for the corresponding period 
these first mortgage loan originations and purchases were exclusively in one to four family mortgage loans and were primarily fixed rate loans 
at december   fixed rate mortgage loans accounted for of our first mortgage loan portfolio compared with at december  this percentage of fixed rate loans to total loans may have an adverse impact on our earnings in a rising rate environment as the interest rate on these loans would not reprice as would adjustable rate loans 
the increase in loan originations and purchases reflected the low long term market interest rate environment experienced in  which caused increases in loan prepayments and refinancings 
the increase in mortgage loan purchases also reflected our internal growth strategy 
the loan purchases were made pursuant to our wholesale loan purchase program established to supplement our retail loan originations 
the purchasing agreements  as established with each seller servicer  contain parameters as to the loans that can be included in each package 
these parameters  such as maximum loan size and maximum loan to value ratio  conform to parameters utilized by us to originate mortgage loans 
purchased loan packages are subject to internal due diligence procedures that may include review of individual loan files 
this review subjects the purchased loan file to substantially the same underwriting standards used in our own loan origination process 
loan packages purchased include mortgage loans secured by properties located primarily in the east coast corridor states between boston and washington dc  and in michigan and illinois 
in  due to the low long term interest rate environment  approximately million of our loan originations were the result of refinancing of our existing mortgage loans 
these refinancings of existing loans are included in total loan originations 
last year we began to allow certain customers to modify  for a fee  their existing mortgage loans with the intent of maintaining customer relationships in periods of extensive refinancing due to lower interest rates 
in general  all terms and conditions of the existing mortgage loan remain the same except the adjustment of the interest rate to the currently offered fixed rate product with a similar term to maturity or to a reduced term at the request of the borrower 
approximately million of existing mortgage loans were modified during the year ended december  this total is not included in total loan originations 
mortgage backed securities increased billion  or  to billion at december  from billion at december  this increase includes a million increase in mortgage backed securities available for sale 
in addition to purchases of mortgage backed securities as part of our internal growth strategy  purchases also increased due to the low market interest rate environment experienced during  which caused increased prepayment activity 
investment securities available for sale increased million to million at december  from million at december  the increase in investment securities primarily reflected the investment of part of the excess cash flows from mortgage related prepayment activity 
these increases in interest earning assets reflected our continued emphasis on the origination and purchase of one to four family page mortgage loans as our primary growth strategy  supplemented by the purchase of mortgage backed securities and investment securities to help manage interest rate risk 
cash and due from banks increased million to million at december  from million at december  of the cash and due from banks balance at december   million was held at the federal home loan bank 
this balance receives interest credits equivalent to the current federal funds overnight borrowing rate 
federal funds sold increased million to million at december  from million at december  these increases in cash and cash equivalents were primarily due to the overall growth in assets  increased levels of cash flows due to mortgage related prepayment activity and excess liquidity received late in the period having been temporarily invested in federal funds sold 
fhlb stock increased million  or  to million at december   which was the amount of stock we were required by the fhlb to hold 
the growth in accrued interest receivable of million to million at december  was primarily due to the growth of our interest earning assets 
at december   total liabilities were billion  an increase of  or billion  compared with billion at december  borrowed funds increased billion  or  to billion at december  from billion at december  the additional borrowed funds were primarily used to fund asset growth consistent with our capital management strategy 
funding asset growth with borrowed funds generated additional earnings through a positive interest rate spread 
borrowed funds were comprised of billion of securities sold under agreements to repurchase and billion of federal home loan bank advances 
securities pledged as collateral against our securities sold under agreements to repurchase had a market value at december  of approximately billion 
advances from the fhlb utilize our mortgage portfolio as collateral 
our increase in borrowed funds consisted primarily of year terms to maturity with call options starting from to years from the borrowing date 
the use of long term borrowed funds has allowed us to better manage our interest rate risk by matching our long term assets with long term liabilities 
borrowing long term in this low interest rate environment should also allow us to better manage interest expense in future periods 
total deposits increased billion  or  to billion at december  from billion at december  interest bearing deposits increased billion  or  to billion at december  from billion at december  the increase in interest bearing deposits was primarily due to growth in interest bearing demand accounts of million due to the introduction of our interest bearing high value checking account 
the balance in the high value checking account at december  was million 
in april  we introduced our interest bearing high value checking account  which we view as an attractive alternative to cash management accounts offered by brokerage firms 
this account offers unlimited checking  on line banking and debit card availability as part of the product  and pays an interest rate generally above market competitive rates 
the growth in interest bearing deposits was also due to a million  or increase in money market deposits to million  an million  or  increase in time deposits to billion  and a million  or  increase in regular savings deposits to million at december  non interest bearing deposits increased million  or  to million at december  from million at december  the increase in total deposits was primarily used to fund our planned asset growth 
we believe the increase in interest bearing deposits was due primarily to our consistent offering of competitive rates on our deposit products  the introduction of our interest bearing high value checking account and an overall decrease in investor confidence in the equity markets 
page accrued expenses and other liabilities increased million  or  to million at december  from million at december  primarily due to an increase in accrued interest payable because of the growth in our borrowed funds and an increase in our accrued income tax payable due to timing of tax payments 
total stockholders equity increased million  or  to billion at december  from billion at december  the increase was primarily the result of net income of million  an increase of million in accumulated other comprehensive income  net of tax  an increase of million due to the exercise of  stock options  and an increase of million due to the allocation of stock related employee benefit plans 
the increase in accumulated other comprehensive income was primarily due to the growth in our portfolio of mortgage backed securities available for sale and increases in the value of our investment securities available for sale 
partially offsetting these increases in stockholders equity were repurchases of  shares of our common stock at an aggregate cost of million and cash dividends declared and paid to common stockholders of million 
as of december   there remained  shares authorized to be purchased under our current stock repurchase program 
at december   the ratio of total stockholders equity to total assets was compared with at december  for the year ended december   the ratio of average stockholders equity to average assets was compared with for the year ended december  the decrease in these ratios was primarily due to our capital management strategy of planned internal asset growth  and a slower percentage growth in stockholders equity as compared to the percentage growth in assets due to payment of cash dividends and stock repurchases 
stockholders equity per common share was and at december  and december   respectively 
comparison of operating results for the year ended december  and general 
net income was million for the year ended december   an increase of million  or  compared with net income of million for the year ended december  basic and diluted earnings per common share were and  respectively  for the year ended december  compared with basic and diluted earnings per share of and  respectively  for the year ended december  for the year ended december  our return on average stockholders equity was compared with for the year ended december  our return on average assets for the year ended december  was compared with for the year ended december  these increases reflected our improved profitability due to increased interest rate spreads that we experienced in the low interest rate environment and our ability to grow our business with low cost interest bearing liabilities 
interest and dividend income 
total interest and dividend income increased million  or  to million for the year ended december  compared with million for the year ended december  the increase in total interest income was primarily due to the average balance of total interest earning assets increasing billion  or  to billion for the year ended december  compared with billion for the year ended december  this increase was due in part to a billion  or  increase in the average balance of first mortgage loans  net to billion for the year ended december  compared with billion for the average balance of mortgage backed securities increased billion  or  to billion for the year ended december  compared with billion for these increases were slightly offset by a decrease in the average balance of investment securities for the year ended december  of million  or  to million from million for the increase in the average page balance of fhlb stock of million reflected the increase in the amount of fhlb stock required to be held by us 
the above increases in the average balances of first mortgage loans and mortgage backed securities reflected internal growth that was consistent with our capital management strategy to originate and purchase first mortgage loans as our primary growth strategy  while purchasing mortgage backed securities to supplement loan originations and purchases  and assist in the management of interest rate risk 
the growth in the average balance of mortgage backed securities also reflected the investment of excess cash flows  due to the increased prepayment activity on our mortgage related assets  into mortgage backed securities 
although the increase in the average balance of loans was somewhat less than the increase in the average balance of mortgage backed securities  the impact of the loan growth was more significant in terms of interest income because our first mortgage loans are generally higher yielding assets than our mortgage backed securities 
the impact on interest income due to the growth in the average balance of interest earning assets  was partially offset by a basis point decrease in the average yield on interest earning assets to for the year ended december  from for the year ended december  the average yield on first mortgage loans  net decreased basis points to for the year ended december  from for the average yield on mortgage backed securities decreased basis points to for the year ended december  from for the decrease in the average yield on first mortgage loans reflected the large volume of loan originations  purchases and modifications during the low interest rate environment of and the decrease in the average yield on mortgage backed securities reflected the large volume of purchases and the downward repricing of our adjustable rate securities during the low interest rate environment of and the larger decrease in the average yield on mortgage backed securities compared with mortgage loans was due to the larger increase in the average balance of mortgage backed securities in this low rate environment and the greater percentage of adjustable rate securities in the mortgage backed security portfolio as compared to our mortgage loan portfolio 
if market interest rates remain low  the yield on our mortgage backed securities may continue to adjust downward due to annual rate change limits that are part of the terms of the security  which have limited the extent our adjustable rate securities may have adjusted in prior periods 
interest expense 
total interest expense  comprised of interest on deposits and interest on borrowed funds  decreased million  or  to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december   notwithstanding an overall increase in interest bearing liabilities 
interest expense on borrowed funds increased million  or  to million for the year ended december  from million for interest expense on deposits decreased million  or  to million for the year ended december  from million for the decrease in total interest expense reflected the impact of a basis point decrease in the average cost of interest bearing liabilities to for the year ended december  from for the decrease in interest expense was offset  in part  by an increase in the average balance of interest bearing liabilities of billion  or  to billion for the year ended december  from billion for the year ended december  the increase in interest expense on borrowed funds was primarily due to a billion  or  increase in the average balance of borrowed funds to billion for the year ended december  from billion for the impact on interest expense on borrowed funds due to the increase in the average balance of borrowed funds was offset  in part  by a basis point decrease in the average cost of borrowed funds to for the year ended december  from for page the growth of borrowed funds has been used to fund internal asset growth consistent with our capital management and growth strategies 
the funds borrowed during had year terms to maturity with call options starting to years from the borrowing date 
although these borrowings generally had higher costs than short term borrowings  the use of long term borrowed funds has allowed us to better manage our interest rate risk by matching long term assets with long term liabilities 
borrowing long term in the prevailing interest rate environment should also allow us to better manage interest expense in future periods 
the decrease in the average cost of borrowed funds reflected the continued growth of our borrowed funds in the low interest rate environment that existed during and and the restructuring of certain of our borrowed funds to obtain lower interest rates 
the million decrease in interest expense on deposits was primarily due to a basis point decrease in the average cost of interest bearing deposits to for the year ended december  from for the decrease in the average cost of interest bearing deposits was primarily due to a basis point decrease in the average cost of our time deposits to for from for the average cost of regular savings accounts decreased basis points to for and the average cost of money market deposits decreased basis points to for partially offsetting these decreases  the average cost of interest bearing demand accounts increased basis points to for from for due to the introduction during the second quarter of of our high value checking account 
the decrease in the annualized average cost of interest bearing deposits reflected the low interest rate environment experienced during and the impact on the average cost of interest bearing liabilities due to possible further decreases in market interest rates may not be as favorable in future periods as short term market rates are currently at historically low levels 
the impact on interest expense on deposits due to the decrease in the average cost of interest bearing deposits was offset  in part  by a billion  or  increase in the average balance of interest bearing deposits to billion for the year ended december  from billion for the average balance of time deposits increased million  or  to billion for from billion for the average balance of interest bearing demand accounts increased million to million for from million for due to the introduction of our high value checking account in the second quarter of the average balance of money market accounts increased million to million for from million for and the average balance of regular savings accounts increased million to million for from million for we believe the increase in the interest bearing deposits was due primarily to our consistent offering of competitive rates on our deposit products  the introduction of our interest bearing high value checking account and an overall decrease in investor confidence in the equity markets 
net interest income 
net interest income increased million  or  to million for the year ended december  compared with million for the year ended december  this increase primarily reflected our planned balance sheet growth  which resulted in increases in the average balance of both interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities  and the improved net interest rate spread earned on this growth 
our net interest rate spread  the difference between the average yield on total interest earning assets and the average cost of total interest bearing liabilities  increased basis points to for the year ended december  from for our net interest margin  represented by net interest income divided by average total interest earning assets  increased basis points to for the year december  from for these increases reflected our improved profitability due to the declining interest rate environment experienced during and  the fact that our interest bearing liabilities repriced faster than our interest earning assets in the declining interest rate environment and our ability to grow our business with page low cost interest bearing liabilities during this period 
the larger increase in our net interest spread compared with the increase in our net interest margin reflected the use of investable funds to purchase treasury stock 
however  during  long term interest rates generally declined  while short term interest rates remained relatively stable  thus narrowing the yield curve 
the narrower yield curve and the increased prepayment activity on our mortgage related assets  due to the historically low market interest rates  may have a negative impact on our net interest income  net interest rate spread and net interest margin in future periods 
provision for loan losses 
our provision for loan losses for the year december  was million  a decrease of million  or  compared with million for the year ended december  net charge offs for the year ended december  were  compared with net charge offs of  for the decrease in the provision reflected our recent low charge off history given the relative stability of the housing market 
the allowance for loan losses increased million  or  to million at december  from million at december  the increase in the allowance for loan losses  through the provision for loan losses  reflected the overall growth of the loan portfolio and the level of delinquent and non performing loans 
non performing loans  defined as non accruing loans and accruing loans delinquent days or more  increased million  or  to million at december  from million at december  the increase in the dollar amount of our non performing loans  which was primarily due to an increase of our non performing purchased fha va loan portfolio of million  was due to the slow economic conditions during  characterized by higher unemployment 
the ratio of non performing loans to total loans was at december  compared with at december  the ratio of the allowance for loan losses to non performing loans was at december  compared with at december  the ratio of the allowance for loan losses to total loans was at december  compared with at december  although we believe that we have established and maintained the allowance for loan losses at adequate levels  additions may be necessary if future economic and other conditions differ substantially from the current operating environment 
although we use the best information available  the level of the allowance for loan losses remains an estimate that is subject to significant judgment and short term change 
see critical accounting policies 
non interest income 
total non interest income  consisting generally of service charges and fees on customer accounts  was million and million  respectively  for the years ended december  and the increase in service fees and other income of million was primarily due to a  gain on the sale of a commercial property not deemed to be a strategic part of our business plan 
the million gain on securities transactions  net  which occurred in the fourth quarter of  resulted from an opportunity to restructure certain assets and liabilities to allow us to be better positioned for future changes in interest rates 
the cash flow of million from the sale of the securities was reinvested in higher yielding securities at a slightly longer duration 
to match this duration extension  we restructured certain of our borrowed funds to extend their maturity and lower the contract rate 
non interest expense

interest expense on deposits decreased million  or  to million for the year ended december  compared with million for the corresponding period 
the increase in total interest expense was attributable to an increase in the average balance of total interest bearing liabilities of billion  or  to billion for the year ended december  compared with billion for the year ended december  the increase in the average balance of total interest bearing liabilities primarily resulted from an increase in the average balance of borrowed funds of million  or  to billion for compared with million for the use of borrowed funds has accelerated over the past year to fund asset growth

net interest income increased million  or  to million for the year ended december  compared with million for the year ended december  this increase primarily reflected increases in the average balance of both interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities  and the net interest rate spread earned on this growth 
our net interest rate spread  the difference between the average yield on average total interest earning assets and the average cost of average total interest bearing liabilities  increased basis points to for the year ended december  compared with for the corresponding period

income taxes 
income tax expense increased million  or  to million for the year ended december  compared with million for year ended december  the increase in income tax expense was due to the increase in income before income tax expense 
our effective tax rate for and was 
liquidity and capital resources the term liquidity refers to our ability to generate adequate amounts of cash to fund loan originations  loan purchases  deposit withdrawals and operating expenses 
our primary sources of funds are scheduled amortization and prepayments of loan principal and mortgage backed securities  deposits  borrowed funds  maturities and calls of investment securities and funds provided by our operations 
our membership in the fhlb provides us access to additional sources of borrowed funds  which is generally limited to twenty times the amount of fhlb stock owned 
scheduled loan repayments and maturing investment securities are a relatively predictable source of funds 
however  deposit flows  calls of investment securities and borrowed funds  and prepayments of loans and mortgage backed securities are strongly influenced by interest rates  general and local economic conditions and competition in the marketplace 
these factors reduce the predictability of the timing of these sources of funds 
as mortgage interest rates decline  customer prepayment activity tends to accelerate causing an increase in cash flow from both our mortgage loan and mortgage backed security portfolios 
if our pricing is competitive  the demand for mortgage originations also accelerates 
when mortgage rates increase  the opposite effect tends to occur and our loan origination and purchase activity becomes increasingly dependent on the strength of our residential real estate market  home purchase and new construction activity 
principal repayments on loans were billion during compared with billion for principal payments received on mortgage backed securities totaled billion during compared to billion during the increase in payments on loans and mortgage backed securities reflected the low market interest rate environment during and  which caused an increase in prepayment activity when compared with the prior period 
the increase also reflected the growth in those portfolios  thus a larger base from which to receive payments 
maturities and calls of investment securities totaled million during compared with maturities and calls of million during the higher amount of calls during was due to the declining interest rate environment that began early in and the larger balance of callable investment securities held at the beginning of compared with the amount of callable investment securities held at the beginning of for the years ended december  and  we borrowed funds of billion and billion  respectively 
the billion of new long term borrowed funds in consisted primarily of borrowings with year terms to maturity with call options starting from to years from the borrowing date 
there were no principal payments on borrowed funds during  but there were million of principal payments during page the billion increase in borrowed funds during funded planned internal asset growth and generated additional earnings through a positive interest rate spread 
the use of long term borrowed funds has allowed us to better manage our interest rate risk by matching long term assets with long term liabilities 
borrowing long term funds in this low interest rate environment should also allow us to better control interest expense in future periods 
at december   there were million of borrowed funds scheduled to mature within one year 
total deposits increased billion during compared with an increase of billion during deposit flows are affected by the level of market interest rates  the interest rates and products offered by competitors  the volatility of equity markets  and other factors 
we believe the increase in interest bearing deposits was due primarily to our consistent offering of competitive rates on our deposit products  the introduction of our interest bearing high value checking account and an overall decrease in investor confidence in the equity markets 
time deposit accounts scheduled to mature within one year were billion at december  based on our deposit retention experience and current pricing strategy  we anticipate that a significant portion of these time deposits will remain with hudson city savings

we anticipate that we will have sufficient funds to meet our current funding commitments 
our primary investing activities are the origination and purchase of one to four family real estate loans and consumer and other loans  the purchase of mortgage backed securities  and to a lesser extent  the purchase of investment securities

purchases of mortgage backed securities during were billion compared with billion during of the mortgage backed securities purchased in  billion were real estate mortgage investment conduits remic compared with billion purchased in the remic purchases in and had fixed interest rates and generally had shorter average lives compared with alternate mortgage backed security investments available at the time of purchase 
generally  these purchases experienced faster prepayment speeds during than other mortgage backed securities 
the volume of purchases of mortgage backed securities was related to the increase in prepayment activity due to the low market interest rate environment during and and the internal growth strategies employed by us during these periods 
during  we purchased million of investment securities compared with purchases of million during these purchases were made with excess cash flows from payments on our mortgage related assets
