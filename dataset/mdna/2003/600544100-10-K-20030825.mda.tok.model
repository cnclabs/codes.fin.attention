item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations management s discussion and analysis you should read the issues discussed in management s discussion and analysis in conjunction with the company s consolidated financial statements and the notes to the consolidated financial statements included in the company s form k 
overview in our annual report  we noted the contract furniture industry had experienced the worst business environment in decades 
at that time  it was difficult to predict the timing and extent of an industry recovery 
facing this uncertainty  we focused on the tough business decisions that  in our view  made us a leaner and stronger organization 
we believed that we were positioned to produce stronger returns in the future 
as we look back on our fiscal financial results  two things become immediately clear 
first  the industry failed to show signs of recovery throughout most of the year 
to the contrary  industry sales further contracted and the competitive landscape intensified 
second  we were able to deliver improved profitability and cash flow in the midst of an even more challenging business environment 
the leading economic indicators for our industry showed mixed results during the fiscal year 
new office construction rates declined substantially from the prior year while office worker unemployment edged upward over the same period 
corporate profitability  however  moved in a more encouraging direction and showed marginal improvement throughout the year 
the business climate in fiscal was also unsettled by geopolitical instability 
the war in iraq  conflicts in afghanistan and other parts of the middle east  and increasing tensions over north korea were all factors adding to global economic uncertainty 
in response to these factors  companies continued to defer plans to buy furniture 
competitive pricing pressure increased as industry participants battled for fewer new projects 
our order pacing for the year averaged million per week as compared to million in the prior year 
given the year over year reduction in demand  we relied more heavily on order activity from our installed product base to generate positive profitability and cash flow 
the health of our owned and independent dealer network remains a key area of focus at the highest levels within our organization 
current business conditions have continued to place financial pressure on several of our dealers 
the primary risks to our business resulting from the financial difficulties experienced by a dealer are the potential disruption of our distribution channels  the resulting adverse impact on our customers  and the credit risk related to the limited instances in which we have entered into dealer financing arrangements 
while these risks cannot be avoided with certainty  we believe our action plans have largely mitigated them 
our dealer financing arrangements have enhanced the financial stability of certain dealers 
we believe our recorded reserves related to dealer notes receivable are adequate to cover the associated credit risk of these arrangements 
in fact  these reserves  as a percent of gross notes receivable  totaled percent at the end of fiscal compared to percent last year 
additionally  we believe our marketing and merchandising strategies have positioned our dealers to compete effectively in each of our key markets

throughout the year we continued to implement the restructuring initiatives announced during fiscal these initiatives  which involved significant workforce and square footage reductions  sourcing changes for select products and services  and brand consolidation  are now largely completed 
as planned  the financial benefits from these actions translated into improved profitability 
despite this work and the significant benefits achieved  we decided once again to undertake restructuring actions to further enhance operational efficiency and profitability 
during the fourth quarter of this year  we announced workforce reductions involving approximately employees in our worldwide operations 
in addition to this  due largely to improvements made through our lean manufacturing program  the herman miller production system hmps  we were able to announce plans for two more facility consolidations 
first  during the fourth quarter we announced the planned consolidation of our holland  michigan formcoat operation into existing space located in zeeland  michigan 
the second move was announced subsequent to year end and involves the relocation of our canton  georgia operation into our spring lake  michigan campus 
during the year we made significant changes and additions to key management positions 
brian walker  previously president of our north american operations  was elected to our board of directors and promoted to president and chief operating officer 
in his new role  brian will oversee all aspects of our worldwide operations 
we also bolstered management strength in the area of product marketing and realigned the corporate finance team 
all of these changes were implemented to make sure we have the right people focused in the right areas 
new product innovation remains a key requirement of our mission to create great places to work 
this year we built upon our history of industry leading innovation through the introduction of several new products 
these include  among others  posturefit tm  a breakthrough technology in ergonomic seating  and mirra tm  a high performance work chair aimed at the mid market price category 
while we have demonstrated our focus on cost containment  we have done so without compromising our investment in future innovation 
in fact  our fiscal spending in the area of design and research  including royalty payments  totaled million  an increase in both dollars and percent of sales from the prior year 
our fiscal results provide the best evidence that we have weathered the economic storm and remain in a strong financial condition 
we delivered four consecutive quarters of significantly improved year over year net earnings 
this was accomplished even as sales for the full year declined million or percent from the prior year 
we generated million in cash flow from operations and ended the year with a combined cash  cash equivalents  and short term investment balance of million 
at the same time  we reduced total interest bearing debt by million 
our employee owners remain focused on continuous improvement and our management team continues to demonstrate a willingness to respond proactively to industry conditions 
restructuring activities as previously mentioned  during the year we made significant progress toward the completion of the restructuring actions announced in fiscal in addition  during the current year we announced further actions 
in all of these efforts our goal has remained the same to lower the cost of doing business without compromising customer service or our ability to respond to renewed demand in the future 
last year  we reported to you the plan to aggressively reduce our overall manufacturing  warehousing and office square footage 
this plan involved both leased and owned facilities 
the following is an update on the status of the major facilities exited in connection with our fiscal  as well as the recently announced  consolidation actions 
rocklin  california owned the sale of our  square foot rocklin facility was successfully completed in the fourth quarter of this year 
proceeds from the sale totaled million 
holland  michigan chair plant owned as of the end of the fiscal year  the holland chair plant remains for sale 
throughout the year  we saw a significant amount of interest in this  square foot facility 
in fact  in the fourth quarter we received a letter of intent from an interested party and  subsequent to year end  we entered into a formal sales agreement 
we expect this sale to be completed during the first half of fiscal provided all contingencies are cleared 
spring lake  michigan pct owned we successfully completed the sale of our  square foot powder coat technology painting facility during the first quarter of fiscal proceeds from the sale totaled million 
canton  georgia owned our  square foot canton manufacturing facility has been appraised and is currently listed for sale 
while the timing of the building sale remains unknown  we expect to have the canton manufacturing operations moved by february holland  michigan formcoat leased the remaining lease term on this  square foot manufacturing facility is approximately months 
due to this relatively short timeframe  our ability to enter into a sub lease arrangement is unknown 
we expect to complete the transfer of the formcoat operation by november zeeland  michigan leased a large portion approximately percent of these buildings  representing a combined  square feet  referred to as the dejonge facilities  is now under sub lease 
pretax restructuring charges totaling and million were recognized in fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
the following is a breakdown by category of these charges 
in millions fiscal fiscal severance and outplacement asset impairments pension related lease and supplier contract terminations facility exit costs and other total of the total fiscal charges  million was recognized in the fourth quarter 
fixed asset impairments related to the canton  georgia and formcoat consolidation projects totaled million 
the workforce reduction action announced during the fourth quarter resulted in additional charges of million 
accrual adjustments totaling million reduced fourth quarter restructuring expenses and were primarily related to the final sale of our rocklin  california facility 
the remaining fiscal charges totaled approximately million and related principally to changes in assumptions around carrying costs and sub lease timing for previously exited facilities 
also included in this remaining charge are credits recognized in the first quarter of fiscal related to the re deployment of fixed assets in our ongoing manufacturing operation 
these assets were previously impaired in connection with the restructuring plan 
we expect to incur additional restructuring expenses of approximately million related to the most recent workforce reduction and facility consolidations 
the majority of these charges will likely be recognized in the first half of fiscal in total  these new actions are expected to result in future cash outflows of between million and million  and annualized pre tax cost savings of between million and million 
financial results consolidated net sales  orders  and backlog fiscal net sales totaled  million compared to  million in fiscal and  million in fiscal on a percentage basis  net sales for the current year declined percent from fiscal weekly sales averaged million during the first half of fiscal  and dropped to an average of million in the second half 
by comparison  the same averages in fiscal totaled million and million  respectively 
the relative change from the first half of the fiscal year to the second is partially attributable to the normal seasonality of our business 
we entered the year with a backlog of approximately million 
net trade orders for fiscal of  million were slightly lower than net sales 
this resulted in a reduction in our ending backlog  which totaled million at the end of the year 
on a weekly average basis  orders for fiscal averaged million 
net trade orders in fiscal totaled  million or an average of million per week 
domestic operations our domestic sales this year totaled  million and were down approximately percent from the prior year total of  million 
two years ago  in fiscal  domestic net sales totaled  million 
increased price discounting has continued to place significant pressure on our top line 
while we have strived to avoid deep discounting by focusing on product and service differentiation  as well as other forms of incentives  this pressure has remained a competitive reality 
higher domestic discounting in fiscal reduced net sales by approximately million compared to fiscal year over year net sales in fiscal years and declined million and million  respectively  as a result of increased discounting 
domestic new orders totaled  million in fiscal compared to  million in fiscal and  million in fiscal this represents year over year declines of percent and percent for and  respectively 
the business and institutional furniture manufacturers association bifma reported that us sales declined approximately percent in the months ended may and percent for the same period ended may for the month period ended may  bifma reported a slight year over year increase in sales of percent 
as previously discussed  we believe that corporate profitability  office worker employment levels  and new office construction are among the leading macro economic indicators of demand for office furniture in the us while these indicators were mixed over the past year  the latest bifma forecast estimates that year over year industry shipments will decline percent in calendar year and increase percent during calendar year considering the bifma forecast data that most closely corresponds to our fiscal quarters  year over year industry shipments are expected to remain relatively flat during our fiscal international operations and exports from the united states sales in our international operations declined on a year over year basis in most of our international markets 
the exception to this was mexico  which experienced significant growth due mainly to a few large project wins 
in total  net sales for our international business totaled million for fiscal this is a reduction of approximately percent from million reported in the prior year 
in fiscal  international net sales totaled million 
international sales accounted for percent of consolidated sales in fiscal  which is similar to the past several years 
we reported last year a number of the changes in our international operations as a result of the restructuring plan 
to recap  we first improved the utilization of our domestic infrastructure and customer service capabilities to support the export business  allowing us to decrease overhead previously dedicated to the international business 
second  we eliminated certain positions and now rely on fewer people  reducing overall compensation costs 
third  we strengthened the distribution channels and increased the use of dealer relationships  lowering our fixed direct selling costs 
we are pleased to report that these efforts allowed us to return to positive international net earnings of million in fiscal this compares to negative net earnings of million in the prior year and positive million in fiscal gross margin we are pleased to report a significant improvement in gross margin performance as compared to a year ago 
fiscal gross margin  as a percent of net sales  was percent compared to percent in and percent in the year over year improvement of percentage points was accomplished despite a reduction in net sales of million 
this improvement was made possible through both the cost reductions resulting from the restructuring as well as the hard work of our operations leadership in implementing the lean manufacturing principles of hmps 
we made improvements in most areas of cost of sales  including manufacturing overhead  direct labor  freight  and product distribution 
the only exception was in direct materials  which increased slightly over the fiscal level 
higher steel costs resulting from the government imposed tariff as well as increases in plastic components and fuel costs contributed significantly to our direct material cost performance 
another major factor in the percent of sales increase for direct materials was the higher level of price discounting  which lowered overall net sales and  consequently  gross profit by more than million 
our procurement and supply chain management teams have continued to do an excellent job managing the effects of increasing material costs 
through supplier negotiation and sourcing consolidation  they have been able to significantly reduce our initial estimates of the impact of the steel  plastics  and fuel costs 
the rationalization of our supplier base continues to be an important component of our overall procurement strategy 
this effort  in connection with hmps  has resulted in improved efficiency  costs  and reliability 
despite the benefits received  this strategy does increase the risks associated with supplier transitions and  potentially  dependence upon fewer suppliers 
we continue to seek financially strong suppliers interested in long term business relationships to minimize the risk of interruption to our business 
the single largest area of margin improvement came in the area of manufacturing overhead 
on a sales adjusted basis  current year overhead spending declined almost million or approximately percent of sales from fiscal we have long employed a variable compensation program tied to internal measures of profitability and capital utilization 
we are pleased that  as a result of our improved year over year financial performance in the current year  our employee owners earned a small bonus 
in total  pretax variable compensation costs included in our fiscal gross margin totaled million 
in  we recorded pretax credits in cost of sales totaling million as a result of reductions to variable compensation accruals 
operating expenses for the year  operating expenses totaled million 
this compares to million in fiscal and million in fiscal included in these amounts are pretax restructuring expenses of million and million for fiscal and  respectively 
excluding these restructuring charges  operating expenses in fiscal declined million or approximately percent from fiscal it is important to point out that our fiscal operating expenses included million in charges related to the accelerated depreciation of certain technology related assets 
even with this taken into consideration  we view the overall reduction in expenses from the prior year as a noteworthy accomplishment 
in the first quarter of this year  we adopted statement of financial accounting standards no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets sfas 
this new accounting rule required us to evaluate our existing goodwill and other intangible assets for impairment 
adoption of sfas in the first quarter did not result in the impairment of our goodwill or other intangible assets 
the rule also requires us to test our recorded goodwill assets for impairment annually 
during the fourth quarter of this year  this testing was completed and the results indicated the recorded carrying value of our goodwill assets was reasonable 
accordingly  no impairment charge was required 
sfas also eliminated the amortization of goodwill 
pretax goodwill amortization expense in fiscal totaled million or per share net of taxes 
in fiscal  these amounts totaled million and  respectively 
our current year operating expenses include million in pretax incentive compensation expenses 
by comparison  fiscal operating expenses included credits totaling million  before tax  related to the reduction in incentive bonus accruals that were established in a prior period 
also included in fiscal operating expenses was a pretax charge totaling million related to a legal judgment from a lawsuit filed against one of our wholly owned dealers 
as of may   the total accrued liability recorded on our consolidated balance sheet related to this original legal judgment totaled approximately million  including interest 
subsequent to the end of fiscal  we received a favorable court of appeals judgment regarding this lawsuit 
based on this  we anticipate fully reversing this accrued liability in the first quarter of fiscal further information on this subsequent event can be found in the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
other significant drivers of the decline in operating expenses from fiscal levels were lower overall compensation  employee benefits  and depreciation expenses 
we remain committed to managing cash flow and maintaining spending patterns at levels appropriate for the current business environment 
this discipline has resulted in a significant reduction in operating expenses 
that said  we are also committed to further investment in the future 
herman miller has a long legacy of leadership in product innovation and we intend to build upon this tradition 
research and design expenses  excluding royalty payments  were million in fiscal this compares to million in and million in royalty payments made to designers of the company s products as the products are sold are not included in research and development costs  since they are considered to be a variable cost of the product 
operating earnings operating earnings in fiscal totaled million or percent of net sales 
comparatively  we posted an operating loss of million or negative percent in the prior fiscal year 
fiscal operating earnings totaled million or percent of sales 
again  our fiscal and results included pretax restructuring charges of million and million  respectively 
in recent months pension plan accounting has attracted much attention 
during the current year  we revised our annual asset rate of return assumption on our primary domestic employee pension plan from percent down to percent 
this assumption is a key factor used in the actuarial determination of pension expense and the change effectively increased our fiscal pension expense by approximately million 
this expense is split approximately evenly between cost of sales and operating expenses 
we believe this revised rate is a reasonable expectation of long term asset returns given the investment portfolio of our employee pension fund 
other expenses and income net other expenses for fiscal totaled million 
this compares to million and million in fiscal and  respectively 
the increase over the prior year is primarily attributable to an equity investment impairment charge and higher equity losses recognized on our investment in op spectrum  a philadelphia based joint venture jv 
in addition  our expenses were partially offset by gains related to the sale of certain dealerships 
during the current year  we recognized a million pretax charge related to the impairment of our investment in op spectrum 
this charge  combined with the jv s ongoing losses  reduced our equity investment in the jv to zero 
because of the continued losses and our relationship as the jv s only source of financing  we began recognizing percent of the jv s book losses during the fourth quarter 
equity losses recognized in connection with the jv totaled million before taxes for fiscal this compares to income of million recognized in fiscal interest expense  net of interest income  totaled million in fiscal compared to million last year 
lower overall debt levels  combined with million in savings resulting from our interest rate swap arrangement  drove the year over year decrease 
income taxes our effective tax rate was percent in fiscal compared to percent in and percent in the change in the tax rate from the prior years was driven primarily by changes in tax reserves resulting from the completion of prior year irs audits  the change in amortization of goodwill related to the adoption of sfas  and the effect of increased international tax benefits 
we expect our long term effective tax rate to be between and percent 
during fiscal  we entered into a settlement agreement with the internal revenue service irs primarily related to the disallowance of deductions for corporate owned life insurance coli policy loan interest and administrative fees for all years of the insurance programs since their inception in fiscal tax expenses were not affected as a result of this settlement  since we had previously reserved for this contingency 
the settlement with the irs provided for the surrender of our coli policies  thereby eliminating any future material tax exposure 
net earnings net earnings for the year totaled million or per share 
in comparison  net earnings in fiscal totaled a loss of million or per share 
restructuring charges recognized during fiscal years and amounted to approximately per share and per share net of taxes  respectively 
our fiscal net earnings totaled million or per share 
significant fourth quarter item gross margin reported for the fourth quarter of fiscal reflected favorable pretax adjustments totaling million for lifo inventory valuations as well as incentive bonus and benefit accrual reductions 
the incentive bonus accruals were established during the first three quarters of fiscal and were adjusted once it was determined that the related bonus payout would not be as significant as initially estimated 
liquidity and capital resources the table below presents certain key cash flow and capital highlights 
in millions cash and cash equivalents 


short term investments 


cash generated from operating activities 

cash used for investing activities 

cash used for financing activities 

capital expenditures 


interest bearing debt 


available unsecured credit facility 

stock repurchased and retired 


pension plan contributions 


restructuring related cash outflows 

in fiscal  the company s outstanding letters of credit were applied against the unsecured credit facility 
accordingly  the amount shown for is net of these letters of credit 
interest bearing debt totaled million at the end of fiscal this compares to million and million at the end of fiscal and  respectively 
outstanding standby letters of credit at may  totaled million 
these letters of credit represented the only usage against our unsecured revolving credit facility as of that date 
subsequent to the end of the fourth quarter  the standby letter of credit balances increased million 
we were in compliance with all provisions of our debt covenants throughout fiscal years   and days sales outstanding dso in accounts receivable and inventory totaled as of the end of fiscal this compares to in fiscal and in fiscal our ending net accounts receivable balance of million decreased significantly from million at the end of last year 
this was a significant contributor to our current year cash flow performance 
collections on accounts receivable remain relatively strong 
the recorded allowance for non collectible accounts  as a percent of gross accounts receivable  totaled percent  percent  and percent as of the end of fiscal   and  respectively 
we believe the allowance as of the end of the year is adequate to cover the risk of potential bad debts 
cash flow operating activities cash flow from operating activities totaled million in fiscal as compared to million and million in fiscal and  respectively 
the increase from the prior year is due primarily to improved net earnings and favorable working capital changes 
the following discussion describes other significant items affecting these results 
during fiscal  we made cash contributions to our employee pension funds totaling million 
similar payments totaling million and million were made in fiscal and  respectively 
these contributions reduced operating cash flows 
federal tax refunds received during fiscal increased cash flow by million 
these refunds related primarily to net operating losses generated in fiscal tax and interest payments totaling million were made during the current year relating to our fiscal coli program settlement with the irs 
these payments reduced fiscal operating cash flows 
we expect to make similar tax and interest payments of approximately million during the first quarter of fiscal as in the prior year  our restructuring actions had cash flow implications 
cash payments reduced fiscal operating cash flows by million 
by comparison  payments totaling million were made in fiscal for both years  the outflows were primarily associated with workforce reduction and facility exit activities 
future payments  including those related to the restructuring actions announced during and subsequent to the fourth quarter of this year  are expected to total between million to million 
we anticipate the majority of these payments to be completed by the end of fiscal cash flow investing activities cash outflows for investing activities totaled million  million  and million for fiscal   and  respectively 
for the third consecutive year  capital expenditures were significantly reduced as we pursued initiatives to better match the structure of our operations to market conditions 
capital spending totaled million in the current year 
this represents a reduction of million or percent from our spending level 
capital expenditures in totaled million 
our cash flow was favorably impacted by proceeds received from the sale of two facilities exited in connection with prior year restructuring actions 
the transactions involved our rocklin  california and west michigan powder coat technology pct facilities and resulted in net proceeds of million 
as of the date of this report  our holland  michigan chair plant and canton  georgia manufacturing facility are the only remaining properties yet to be sold as a result of the restructuring initiatives 
the canton facility has been appraised and placed on the market 
subsequent to year end  we entered into a formal sales agreement for the chair plant facility and expect to complete this transaction during the first half of fiscal provided all contingencies are cleared 
outflows from investing activities in the prior year were partly offset by a cash receipt of million for the net surrender value of our coli policies 
as of the end of fiscal  we had outstanding commitments for future capital purchases of approximately million 
we expect fiscal capital expenditures to total between million and million 
cash flow financing activities in millions  except share and per share data shares acquired    cost of shares acquired weighted average cost per share acquired shares issued    weighted average price per share issued cash dividends dividends per share 


cash outflows for financing activities totaled million  million  and million for fiscal   and  respectively 
 shares were repurchased for million or an average price of per share during fiscal share repurchases for fiscal and totaled million and million  respectively 
we  along with our board of directors  continue to believe share repurchases are an effective means of returning value to our shareholders 
as of may   we had remaining authorization of million on our share repurchase plan 
repayments of long term and short term debt totaled million in fiscal included in this amount is the repayment of bank debt associated with our former australian business unit and a million scheduled principal payment on our private placement notes 
debt repayments in the prior year  which totaled million  primarily related to activity on our private placement as well as the payoff of a note related to the purchase of technology assets 
the current portion of our long term debt at may  totaled million 
we are scheduled to make this payment in the fourth quarter of fiscal we use various stock option plans as an incentive to align executive performance with shareholder interests 
further information on these plans can be found in the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal  standard poors ratings services announced that it had lowered our corporate credit rating from bbb to bbb 
the announcement indicated that the change reflected significant declines in revenues as well as increased business uncertainty for the office furniture industry as a whole 
while we were disappointed in the revision  we are encouraged that our credit rating continues to be classified as investment grade 
we do not believe this revision will have a significantly adverse impact on our ability to borrow in the future 
we believe cash on hand  cash generated from operations  and our credit facilities will provide adequate liquidity to fund near term and future business operations and capital needs 
contingencies the company  for a number of years  has sold various products to the united states government under general services administration gsa multiple award schedule contracts 
under the terms of these contracts  the gsa is permitted to audit the company s compliance with the gsa contracts 
at any point in time  a number of gsa audits are either scheduled or in process 
management does not expect resolution of the audits to have a material adverse effect on the company s consolidated financial statements 
in march  a settlement was reached in mediation concerning an audit of the company s compliance with its international gsa contract for the years   and the terms of the settlement required the company to pay million to the united states government 
this payment was made during the fourth quarter of fiscal the financial impact of this settlement was previously reserved for and  consequently  had no impact on fiscal net earnings 
the company is also involved in legal proceedings and litigation arising in the ordinary course of business 
in the opinion of management  the outcome of such proceedings and litigation currently pending will not materially effect the company s consolidated financial statements 
conclusion our fiscal financial results validated the statement in our annual report that we were positioned to produce stronger returns in the future 
we made significant improvements in our overall profitability and operating cash flows despite a million decline in net sales 
the us economy continued to struggle as evidenced by broad economic indicators such as unemployment and construction spending 
increased global geopolitical uncertainty complicated matters 
these factors  among others  combined to further depress demand for office furniture 
the result was lower industry sales and intensified price competition 
during the year we completed a number of previously announced restructuring initiatives and announced a few new ones 
through all of these efforts over the last two years  our production efficiency has increased  our cost structure is more variable  and our overall manufacturing capacity is intact 
we believe an industry recovery is on the horizon and feel well prepared to leverage our new cost structure for improved profitability 
if  however  a recovery is further off than expected  the changes we have made to our business structure should allow us to remain profitable and generate positive cash flows 
we are also focusing vigorously on new product development 
our goal in this area is simple to build upon our legacy of industry leading innovation 
while bragging rights are nice  the real purpose of this is to create the products and services that truly make great places to work and to profitably grow our business as a result 
fiscal once again put our board of directors  management team  and employee owners to the test 
our financial results have shown that we have weathered the storm and remain in strong condition to compete in the future 
we look forward to the future with the confidence that our leadership team and business model will lead us further down the path of improved shareholder returns 
finally  we believe it is important to stress to our investors that in our view  integrity and ethical business behavior are an absolute requirement in everything we do 
these attributes have long been a part of the herman miller corporate culture and always will be 
basis of presentation fiscal years   and each contained weeks 
this should be considered when comparing year over year changes 
it is also the basis upon which all of the above weekly average data is presented 
critical accounting policies we strive to report our financial results in a clear and understandable manner 
we follow accounting principles generally accepted in the us in preparing our consolidated financial statements  which require us to make certain estimates and apply judgments that affect our financial position and results of operations 
we continually review our accounting policies and financial information disclosures 
following is a summary of our more significant accounting policies that require the use of estimates and judgments in preparing the financial statements 
receivable allowances we base our allowances related to receivables on known customer exposures  historical credit experience  and the specific identification of other potential problems  including the economic climate 
these methods are applied to all major receivables  including trade  lease  and notes receivables 
in addition to known or judgmental components of our allowances  we follow a policy that consistently applies reserve rates based on the age of outstanding accounts receivables 
actual collections can differ  requiring adjustments to the reserves 
warranty reserve we stand behind our products and keep our promises to customers 
in some situations  issues arise resulting in the need to incur costs to correct or replace problems with products or services 
we have established warranty reserves for the various costs associated with these guarantees 
general warranty reserves are based on historical claims experience and periodically adjusted for business levels 
specific reserves are established once an issue is identified 
the valuations of such reserves are based on the estimated costs to correct the problem 
actual costs may vary and result in an adjustment to our reserves 
inventory reserves inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market 
the inventories of certain subsidiaries are valued using the last in  first out lifo method 
we establish reserves for excess and obsolete inventory  based on material movement and a component of judgment for consideration of current events  such as economic conditions  that may affect inventory 
the amount of reserve required may be adjusted as conditions change 
income taxes deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities  and their respective tax bases 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using the enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to reverse 
we have net operating loss nol carryforwards available in certain jurisdictions to reduce future taxable income 
future tax benefits for nol carryforwards are recognized to the extent that realization of these benefits is considered more likely than not 
we base this determination on the expectation that related operations will be sufficiently profitable or various tax planning strategies available to us will enable us to utilize the nol carryforwards 
to the extent that available evidence about the future raises doubt about the realization of a deferred income tax asset  a valuation allowance is established 
self insurance reserves with the assistance of independent actuaries  we provide reserves for health  worker s compensation  long term disability  and general liability exposures 
the reserves are established based on actuarially determined expected future claims 
the methods and assumptions used to determine the liabilities are applied consistently  although actual claim experience can vary 
we maintain certain insurance coverage for risk exposures through traditional premium based insurance policies 
pension and other post retirement benefits the determination of the obligation and expense for pension and other post retirement benefits depends on certain actuarial assumptions used in calculating such amounts 
some of the assumptions include the discount rate  expected long term rate of return on plan assets  and expected rate of increases in compensation and healthcare costs 
these assumptions are reviewed annually based on internal and external factors 
adjustments to the assumptions could result in changes to the future expense and liabilities 
see the notes to the consolidated financial statements for more information regarding costs and assumptions used for employee benefit plans 
long lived assets we evaluate long lived assets and acquired businesses for indicators of impairment when events or circumstances indicate that this risk may be present 
our judgments regarding the existence of impairment are based on market conditions  operational performance  and estimated future cash flows 
if the carrying value of a long lived asset is considered impaired  an impairment charge is recorded to adjust the asset to its fair value 
new accounting standards in may  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity sfas 
sfas modifies the traditional definition of liabilities to encompass certain obligations that must be settled through the issuance of equity shares 
these obligations are considered liabilities as opposed to equity or mezzanine financing under the provisions of sfas in addition  sfas increases the required disclosures of alternate settlement methods related to these obligations 
this new standard is effective immediately for financial instruments entered into or modified after may   and for all other financial instruments beginning in the second quarter of fiscal we do not expect it to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
in january  the fasb issued interpretation no 
 consolidation of variable interest entities fin 
this new rule requires that companies consolidate a variable interest entity if the company is subject to a majority of the risk of loss from the variable interest entity s activities  or is entitled to receive a majority of the entity s residual returns or both 
the provisions of fin apply currently to variable interest entities created after january   and for the first fiscal year or interim period beginning after june  for variable interest entities in which an enterprise holds a variable interest that is acquired on or before january  we are required to adopt the provisions of fin in the second quarter of fiscal  and are currently evaluating the expected impact on our consolidated financial statements  primarily as it relates to our independent dealer lending activities 
in december  the fasb finalized statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure an amendment of fasb statement no 
sfas 
sfas amends sfas  accounting for stock based compensation  to provide alternative methods of transition for a voluntary change to the fair value based method of accounting for stock based employee compensation 
in addition  sfas amends the disclosure requirements of sfas to require prominent disclosures in both annual and interim financial statements about the method of accounting for stock based employee compensation and the effect of the method used on reported results 
we adopted the disclosure provisions of sfas in our fourth quarter ended may  we account for stock based employee compensation under the provisions of accounting principles board opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees 
under this method  which continues to be acceptable under sfas  no compensation expense is recognized when stock options are granted to employees and directors at fair market value as of the grant date

for fixed rate debt  changes in interest rates generally affect the fair market value but not earnings or cash flows 
the company does not have an obligation to prepay fixed rate debt prior to maturity  and as a result  interest rate risk and changes in fair market value should not have a significant impact on such debt until the company would be required to refinance it

this debt is subject to changes in interest rates  which could have a material impact on the company s financial results
