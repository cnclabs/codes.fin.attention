item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations management s discussion and analysis contains forward looking statements  including statements about our beliefs  plans  objectives  goals  expectations  estimates and intentions  as well as trends and uncertainties that could affect our results 
these statements are subject to risks and uncertainties and are subject to change based on various factors  many of which are beyond our control 
for additional information concerning these factors and related matters  see risk factors in item of this report 
critical accounting policies and estimates the discussion and analysis of the company s financial condition and results of operations are based upon the company s consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities 
we base these estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that management believes are reasonable under the circumstances 
additionally  we evaluate the results of these estimates on an on going basis 
management s estimates form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies reflect the company s more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements investment in real estate 
costs associated with a specific real estate project are capitalized once we determine that a real estate project is economically viable 
the company capitalizes costs directly associated with the development and construction of identified real estate projects 
indirect costs  such as internal costs of a regional project field office  that clearly relate to a specific project under development  are also capitalized 
we capitalize interest based on the amount of underlying expenditures up to an amount not to exceed total interest expense  and real estate taxes on real estate projects under development 
if we determine not to complete a project  any costs previously capitalized are expensed 
residential real estate inventory and cost of sales 
real estate inventories include land and common development costs  such as roads  sewers  and amenities 
a portion of real estate inventory and estimates for costs to complete are allocated to each unit based on the relative sales value of each unit as compared to the estimated sales value of the total project 
estimates of costs to complete for sold homes are recorded at the time of closing 
estimates of sales values or costs to complete may differ from actual results 
revenue recognition percentage of completion 
in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for sales of real estate  revenue for multi family residences under construction is recognized on the percentage of completion method when construction is beyond a preliminary stage  the buyer is committed to the extent of being unable to require a refund except for nondelivery of the unit  sufficient units have already been sold to assure that the entire property will not revert to rental property  sales price is assured and aggregate sales proceeds and costs can be reasonably estimated 
revenue is recognized in proportion to the percentage of total costs incurred in relation to estimated total costs 
impairment of long lived assets and goodwill 
our long lived assets  primarily real estate held for investment  are carried at cost unless circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the assets may not be recoverable 
we review long lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate such an evaluation is warranted 
the review involves a number of assumptions and estimates used in determining whether impairment exists 
depending on the asset  we use varying methods such as i estimating future cash flows  ii determining resale values by market  or iii applying a capitalization rate to net operating income using prevailing rates in a given market 
these methods of determining fair value can fluctuate up or down significantly as a result of a number of factors including changes in the general economy of our markets and demand for real estate 
if we determine that impairment exists due to the inability to recover an asset s 
table of contents carrying value  a provision for loss is recorded to the extent that the carrying value exceeds estimated fair value 
goodwill is carried at the lower of cost or fair value and is tested for impairment at least annually by comparing the carrying amount of the net assets of each reporting unit with goodwill to the fair value of the reporting unit taken as a whole 
the impairment review involves a number of assumptions and estimates including estimating future cash flows  net operating income  future economic conditions  fair value of assets held and discount rates  if this comparison indicates that the goodwill of a particular reporting unit is impaired  the aggregate of the fair value of each of the individual assets and liabilities of the reporting unit are compared to the fair value of the reporting unit to determine the amount of goodwill impairment  if any 
pension plan 
the company sponsors a defined benefit pension plan covering a majority of our employees 
currently  the company s pension plan is over funded and contributes income to the company 
the accounting for pension benefits is determined by standardized accounting and actuarial methods using numerous estimates  which include discount rates  expected long term investment returns on plan assets  employee turnover  mortality and retirement ages  and future salary increases 
changes in these key assumptions can have a significant impact on the income contributed by the pension plan 
we engage the services of our independent actuary and investment consultant to assist us in determining these assumptions and in the calculation of pension income 
income taxes 
in preparing our consolidated financial statements  significant management judgment is required to estimate our income taxes 
our estimates are based on our interpretation of federal and state tax laws 
we estimate our actual current tax due and assess temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items for tax and accounting purposes 
the temporary differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included within our consolidated balance sheet 
adjustments may be required by a change in assessment of our deferred tax assets and liabilities  changes due to audit adjustments by federal and state tax authorities  and changes in tax laws 
to the extent adjustments are required in any given period we would include the adjustments within the tax provision in the statement of operations and or balance sheet 
these adjustments could materially impact our financial position and results of operation
