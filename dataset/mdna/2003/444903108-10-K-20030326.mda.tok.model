item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview human genome sciences is dedicated to discovery for health 
our goal is to build a global biopharmaceutical company that discovers  develops  manufactures and markets gene based drugs to treat and cure disease 
the success of our drug discovery efforts derives from our expertise in genomics  the systematic collection and understanding of human genes and their functions  and from our exclusive focus on developing human protein and antibody drugs 
we focus our internal product development efforts on novel human protein and antibody drugs discovered through genomics based research  and on new improved long acting versions of existing protein drugs created using our albumin fusion technology 
we are conducting clinical trials with eight of our products 
four additional products are in clinical trials by companies with which we are collaborating 
the number of new drugs we have in advanced preclinical studies continues to grow 
we have established strategic partnerships with a number of leading pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies to leverage our strengths and to gain access to complementary technologies and sales and marketing infrastructure 
some of these partnerships provide us with research funding and milestone payments  along with royalty payments as products are developed and commercialized 
we also are entitled to certain co promotion  co development  revenue sharing and other product rights 
we have not received any product sales revenue or royalties from product sales and do not anticipate revenues from product sales or from royalties on product sales in the next several years 
to date  all of our revenue relates to payments made under our collaboration agreements with glaxosmithkline and  to a lesser extent  other agreements 
the glaxosmithkline collaboration agreement and many of our other collaboration agreements expired in and will only generate additional milestone and royalty payments if our collaborators successfully develop drugs based on our technology 
we may not receive any of these payments and may not be able to enter into additional collaboration agreements 
we expect that our revenue or income sources for at least the next several years may be limited to interest income  payments under various collaboration agreements to the extent milestones are met  payments from the sale of product rights and other payments from other collaborators and licensees under existing or future arrangements  to the extent that we enter into any future arrangements 
we expect to continue to incur substantial expenses relating to our research and development efforts  as we focus on preclinical and clinical trials required for the development of therapeutic protein  antibody and fusion protein product candidates 
as a result  we expect to incur continued and increasing losses over the next several years unless we are able to realize additional revenues under existing or new collaboration agreements 
the timing and amounts of such revenues  if any  cannot be predicted with certainty and will likely fluctuate sharply 
results of operations for any period may be unrelated to the results of operations for any other period 
in addition  historical results should not be viewed as indicative of future operating results 
critical accounting policies and the use of estimates a critical accounting policy is one that is both important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results and that requires management s most difficult  subjective or complex judgments 
such judgments are often the result of a need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
the preparation of our financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
actual results could differ materially from those estimates 
critical accounting policies and the use of estimates continued we currently believe the following accounting policies to be critical we carry our cash  cash equivalents  investments  other assets  accounts payable and accrued expenses and other accrued expenses at their respective fair values 
we periodically monitor these fair values to determine if impairment write downs are required 
because we may determine that market or business conditions may lead us to sell a short term investment prior to maturity  we classify our short term investments as available for sale 
investments in securities that are classified as available for sale and have readily determinable fair values are measured at fair market value in the balance sheets  and unrealized holding gains and losses for these investments are reported as a separate component of stockholders equity until realized 
if we held investments that were classified as held to maturity securities  these would be carried at amortized cost rather than at fair market value 
if we held investments that were classified as trading securities  these would be carried at fair market value  with a corresponding adjustment to earnings for any change in fair market value 
our other assets include deferred financing costs relating to our convertible subordinated notes 
we are amortizing these costs over the life of the notes and  in the event the notes are converted to equity  we would reclassify the unamortized deferred financing costs to equity 
in the event the notes are repurchased  we would net the unamortized deferred financing costs with any gain or loss recognized on the extinguishment of this debt 
we lease various real properties under operating leases that generally require us to pay taxes  insurance and maintenance 
two of our operating leases are commonly referred to as synthetic leases 
a synthetic lease is a form of off balance sheet financing under which an unrelated third party funds of the costs for the acquisition and or construction of the property and leases the asset to the lessee 
under these leases  we provide a residual value guarantee which guarantees the lessor that the residual value of the leased assets will be at least equal to a specified amount at lease termination 
we have determined that the entities that own the properties have sufficient substance such that they can be treated as unrelated entities to us and  accordingly  do not require consolidation into our financial statements 
further  we have determined that the terms of the property leases qualify them as operating leases under generally accepted accounting principles 
accordingly  these synthetic leases are treated as operating leases for accounting purposes and capital leases for tax purposes 
changes in the equity participation of the third parties or our obligations under the agreements could affect the classification of these leases from operating to capital 
in that event  we would include both the cost and debt associated with the properties on our consolidated balance sheet 
we are currently evaluating the impact of financial accounting standards board interpretation no 
 consolidation of variable interest entities fin and potential changes to the ownership or lease structures of these real properties on our accounting treatment 
we are exploring a restructuring of these operating lease arrangements in which the lessor would be considered a variable interest entity under fin if the lessors were determined to be variable interest entities  it is likely that fin would require us to consolidate them when fin is adopted 
we recognize revenue from non refundable upfront license fees where we have a continuing obligation to provide access to our technology ratably over the period of obligation in accordance with the guidance provided in the sec s staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition in financial statements sab 
we recognize deferred revenues related to these obligations on a straight line basis over the life of the obligation 
our revenues with transgene are being recognized on a straight line basis over the shorter of the ten year term of the agreement or prorated upon the selection of genes by transgene 
revenue associated with performance milestones is recognized based on the achievement of the milestones  as defined in the applicable agreement 
research and development expenses primarily include related salaries  outside services  materials and supplies  and allocated facility costs 
such costs are charged to research and development expense as incurred 
our drug development expenses include accruals for clinical site and clinical research organization costs 
we make estimates of the costs incurred to date but not yet invoiced in relation to clinical site costs and clinical research organization cro costs 
we analyze the progress of the clinical trials  including levels of patient critical accounting policies and the use of estimates continued enrollment  invoices received and contracted costs  when evaluating the adequacy of the accrued liabilities 
significant judgments and estimates must be made and used in determining the accrued balance in any accounting period 
actual results could differ significantly from those estimates under different assumptions 
we have stock option plans under which options to purchase shares of our common stock may be granted to employees  consultants and directors at a price no less than the fair market value on the date of grant 
we account for our stock based compensation in accordance with the provisions of apb no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees apb no 

under apb no 
 compensation expense is based on the difference  if any  on the date of the grant between the fair value of our stock and the exercise price of the option and is recognized ratably over the vesting period of the option 
because our options must be granted at fair market value  we recognize no compensation expense at the time of the grant in accordance with apb no 
if we were to adopt statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation sfas no 
 we would recognize compensation expense based upon the fair value at the grant date for awards under the plans using the fair value method 
the amount of compensation expense recognized using the fair value method requires us to exercise judgment and make assumptions relating to the factors that determine the fair value of our stock option grants 
we have provided pro forma disclosures in the notes to our consolidated financial statements of our net loss and net loss per share as if we used the fair value method 
we account for equity instruments issued to non employees in accordance with sfas no 
and emerging issues task force issue no 
 accounting for equity instruments that are issued to other than employees for acquiring  or in conjunction with selling goods or services 
results of operations years ended december  and revenues 
we had revenues of million and million for the years ended december  and december   respectively 
the revenues consisted of the recognition of million from our collaboration with transgene and million in a milestone payment from glaxosmithkline 
the revenues consisted of the recognition of million in license fees and additional payments from collaborations with schering plough  sanofi synthelabo  and merck kgaa  substantially all of which was due to the implementation of sab  retroactive to january   the recognition of million from our collaboration with transgene and million in a milestone payment from glaxosmithkline 
expenses 
research and development expenses increased to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december   excluding the million charge for construction design changes in we expect to continue to incur substantial expenses relating to our research and development efforts  as we focus on preclinical and clinical trials required for the development of our protein  antibody and fusion product candidates 
we track our research and development expenditures by type of cost incurred discovery  drug development  manufacturing and clinical development costs 
our discovery costs increased to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  this increase is due primarily to increased costs in antibody development related to collaboration payments made to cambridge antibody technology along with the expense recognition of the remaining prepaid license fees to dyax corporation 
our drug development costs increased to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  this increase is due primarily to increased toxicology activity  where we are conducting studies to support our investigational new drug filings that were made or will be made in the future 
our manufacturing costs increased to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  this increase is due to the increased production activities results of operations continued years ended december  and continued within our process development and manufacturing facilities needed to support our increased clinical activities 
our clinical development costs increased to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  this increase is due primarily to the cost of continuing ongoing trials from along with the cost of filing  initiating and sustaining new trials that began in we had eight drugs in clinical trials ongoing as of december  compared to seven drugs in clinical trials ongoing as of december  the charge for construction design changes of million for the year ended december  relates to our decision to modify the initial design of the large scale manufacturing facility 
see note j  commitments and other matters  for additional discussion 
general and administrative expenses increased to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  to support the increase in our development activities 
the increase also resulted from increased legal expenses associated with filing and prosecuting a larger number of patent applications relating to genes and proteins we discovered  along with increased recruiting and relocation expenses 
interest income decreased to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december   due to lower average cash and short term investment balances and reduced yield due to declining interest rates 
the yield on our investments was for the year ended december   as compared to for the year ended december  our average cash balance decreased during as a result of our net loss and capital expenditures in interest expense decreased for the year ended december  in comparison to the year ended december   due primarily to a reduction in the average debt balance as a result of the conversion to equity of million of convertible notes during the charge for impaired investment of million for the year ended december  relates to the reduction made to the carrying value in our equity investment in cambridge antibody technology cat 
during the third quarter of  we reduced the carrying value of this investment to million from million due to the significant reduction in market value of cat s shares that we believe may not be temporary 
the charge for impaired investment of million for the year ended december  relates to the reduction made to the carrying value in our equity investment in transgene 
we reduced the carrying value of this investment to million from million due to an impairment that we deemed to be other than temporary 
see note d of the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional discussion 
debt conversion expenses of million for the year ended december  relate primarily to the conversion of million aggregate principal of convertible subordinated notes due into equity 
see note i of the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional discussion 
net income loss 
we recorded a net loss of million  or per share  for the year ended december   compared to a net loss of million  or per share  for the year ended december  the increased loss for compared to reflects charges for increased impairment of investments and construction design changes  increased manufacturing operations  increased investment in the discovery and development of our drug candidates  reduced net interest income  increased general and administrative activities and reduced revenue 
excluding the charge for construction design changes incurred in  the charges for impaired investments incurred in and  and the charge for debt conversion expenses for  our net loss would have been million  or per share  for the year ended december   compared to million  or per share  for the year ended december  results of operations continued years ended december  and revenues 
we had revenues of million and million for the years ended december  and december   respectively 
the revenue consisted of the recognition of million in license fees and additional payments from collaborations with schering plough  sanofi synthelabo  and merck kgaa  substantially all of which was due to sab  the recognition of million from the collaboration with transgene and million in a milestone payment from glaxosmithkline 
the revenue consisted of million in license fees and additional payments from collaborations with schering plough  sanofi synthelabo  and merck kgaa  the recognition of million from the collaboration with transgene and million in license revenue from medimmune 
expenses 
research and development expenses increased to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december   excluding the million charge for purchased in process research and development in our discovery costs increased to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  this increase is due primarily to expanded activities in the area of antibody development  including increased outside collaboration costs and milestone payments 
our drug development costs increased to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  this increase is due primarily to expanded activities  including toxicology studies  needed to support our investigational new drug filings that were made or will be made in the future 
our manufacturing costs increased to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  this increase is due to the increased production activities within our process development and manufacturing facilities needed to support our increased clinical activities 
our clinical development costs increased to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  this increase is due primarily to the cost of continuing ongoing trials from along with the cost of filing  initiating and sustaining new trials that began in we had seven drugs in clinical trials ongoing as of december  compared to four drugs in clinical trials ongoing as of december  purchased in process research and development expense of million for the year ended december  relates to the acquisition of principia pharmaceutical corporation on september  this amount represents that portion of the million purchase price allocated to in process research and development 
see note c of the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional discussion 
general and administrative expenses increased to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  to support the increase in our activities 
the increase also resulted from increased market research costs in connection with our expanding clinical activities and higher legal expenses associated with filing and prosecuting a larger number of patent applications relating to genes and proteins we discovered 
interest income was million for the year ended december   compared to million for the year ended december   due to higher average cash and short term investment balances 
while we had higher average cash balances  the yield on our investments was for the year ended december  as compared to for the year ended december  our average cash balance decreased during as a result of our net loss and capital expenditures in  partially offset by proceeds from the issuance of stock pursuant to our stock option and employee stock purchase plans 
interest expense increased for the year ended december  in comparison to the year ended december  due primarily to a full year of interest expense in relating to the issuance of million of convertible subordinated notes during the first quarter of partially offset by a reduction in interest expense associated with previously issued convertible subordinated notes that were converted to equity during the first quarter of results of operations continued years ended december  and continued the charge for impaired investment of million for the year ended december  relates to the reduction made to the carrying value in our equity investment in transgene 
we reduced the carrying value of this investment to million from million due to an impairment that we deemed to be other than temporary 
see note d of the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional discussion 
debt conversion expenses decreased to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  the debt conversion expenses of million relate primarily to the second quarter of conversion of million aggregate principal of convertible subordinated notes due into equity 
the debt conversion expenses of million relate to the first quarter of conversion costs of million aggregate principal amount of convertible subordinated notes into equity 
we converted million of our million aggregate principal amount of notes due into common stock at a cost of million  substantially all of which was paid in the form of common stock 
in addition  we converted all of our million aggregate principal amount of notes due into common stock at a cost of million  all of which was paid in cash 
see note i of the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional discussion 
other income of million for the year ended december  relates to the gain realized on the sale of  ordinary shares of our investment in cambridge antibody technology 
see note d of the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional discussion 
cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle of million for the year ended december  relates to our implementation of sab net income loss 
we recorded a net loss of million  or per share  for the year ended december   compared to a net loss of million  or per share  for the year ended december  the decreased loss for compared to reflects the absence of purchased in process research and development expense of million  or per share  reduction of debt conversion expenses  an increase in net interest income and the result of the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle recognized in  partially offset by the charge for impaired investment  decreased revenue and the increase in manufacturing operations  increased investment in the discovery and development of our drug candidates  and increased general and administrative activities 
excluding the charge for impaired investment incurred in  the charges for debt conversion expenses for both and  the purchased in process research and development and the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle incurred in  our net loss would have been million  or per share  for the year ended december   compared to million  or per share  for the year ended december  liquidity and capital resources we had working capital of billion at december  as compared to billion at december  the decrease in working capital is due to our net loss and capital expenditures  along with an increase in our restricted investments 
our restricted investments totaled approximately million and million at december  and  respectively 
if the full amount of million of lease financing is used for construction activities and our other collateral obligations remain in place  our restricted investments would increase to approximately million by however  we have announced that we are redesigning and reducing the size of the proposed large scale manufacturing facility 
we currently believe our restricted investments upon completion of the projects may be reduced as a result of this redesign and the possible restructuring of the lease financings 
we will be required to maintain this collateral in the form of restricted investments until  at which time all or a portion of the collateral may be used to satisfy our residual value guarantees under the leases or to exercise our options to acquire the related properties 
as a result  this increase in restricted investments will reduce our working capital 
we expect to continue to incur substantial expenses relating to our research and development efforts 
such expenses are expected to increase relative to historical levels as we focus on preclinical and clinical trials liquidity and capital resources continued required for the development of an increasing number of therapeutic protein  antibody and fusion protein product candidates 
at december   we had outstanding commitments for construction and equipment purchases totaling approximately million 
the amounts of expenditures that will be needed to carry out our business plans are subject to numerous uncertainties  which may adversely affect our liquidity and capital resources 
we are proceeding with numerous clinical trials 
we have several phase and phase trials underway and expect to initiate additional trials in the future 
completion of these trials may extend several years or more  but the length of time generally varies considerably according to the type  complexity  novelty and intended use of the drug candidate 
we estimate that the completion periods for our phase  phase and phase trials could span one year  one to two years and two to four years  respectively 
the duration and cost of our clinical trials are a function of numerous factors such as the number of patients to be enrolled in the trial  the amount of time it takes to enroll them  the length of time they must be treated and observed  and the number of clinical sites and countries for the trial 
we identify our potential drug candidates by conducting numerous preclinical studies 
we may conduct multiple clinical trials to cover a variety of indications for each drug candidate 
based upon the results from our trials  we may elect to discontinue clinical trials for certain indications or certain drugs in order to concentrate our resources on more promising drug candidates 
we are advancing many drug candidates  including therapeutic proteins  antibodies and albumin fusion proteins  in part to diversify the risks associated with our research and development spending 
in addition  our manufacturing plants have been designed to enable multi product manufacturing capability 
accordingly  we believe our future financial commitments  including those for preclinical  clinical or manufacturing activities  are not substantially dependent on any single drug candidate 
should we be unable to sustain a multi product drug pipeline  our dependence on the success of one or a few drug candidates would increase 
we must receive fda clearance to advance each of our products into and through each phase of clinical testing 
moreover  we must receive fda regulatory approval to commercially launch any of our products 
in order to receive such approval  the fda must conclude that our clinical data establish safety and efficacy and that our products and the manufacturing facilities meet all fda requirements 
we cannot be certain that we will establish sufficient safety and efficacy data to receive regulatory approval for any of our drugs or that our products and the manufacturing facilities will meet all fda requirements 
in addition  part of our business plan includes collaborating with others 
for example  glaxosmithkline gsk is developing three products discovered by gsk as part of our collaboration with them 
we have no control over the progress of gsk s development plans 
while we have received payments of million from gsk in connection with development milestones met by gsk during and  we cannot forecast with any degree of certainty the likelihood of receiving future milestone or royalty payments 
we also cannot forecast with any degree of certainty whether any of our current or future collaborations will affect our drug development efforts and therefore  our capital and liquidity requirements 
because of the uncertainties discussed above  the costs to advance our research and development projects are difficult to estimate and may vary significantly 
we expect that our existing funds and interest income will be sufficient to fund our operations for the next several years 
our future capital requirements and the adequacy of our available funds will depend on many factors  including scientific progress in our research and development programs including our discovery and development activities  the magnitude of those programs  the ability to establish collaborative and licensing arrangements  the cost involved in preparing  filing  prosecuting  maintaining and enforcing patent claims and competing technological and market developments 
there can be no assurance that any additional financing required in the future will be available on acceptable terms  if at all 
depending upon market and interest rate conditions  we are exploring  and  from time to time  may take actions to strengthen further our financial position  including the restructure of our outstanding lease liquidity and capital resources continued obligations in order to reduce our restricted investments and the repurchase or restructure of some or all of our outstanding convertible debt instruments 
our future liquidity and capital resources will be affected by our contractual obligations 
these obligations as of december  are summarized below payments due by period dollars in millions one four to after year two to five five total or less three years years years contractual obligations long term debt capital lease obligation operating leases operating leases with residual value guarantees unconditional purchase obligations long term collaboration obligations total contractual cash obligations certain of our current or future lease payments are based upon currently applicable interest rates 
see additional discussion of these facility leases below 
certain of our operating leases contain residual value guarantees relating to two facility leases described below 
our unconditional purchase obligations relate primarily to commitments for capital expenditures  consisting primarily of laboratory space build out and equipment 
because we cannot forecast with any degree of certainty whether any of our current collaborations will require us to make future milestone or royalty payments  we have excluded these amounts from the above table 
for additional discussion of our debt obligations and lease commitments  see notes i and j of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
during  we entered into two seven year lease agreements the october lease and the november lease relating to research  manufacturing  and administrative space either acquired or under construction by two trusts controlled by third parties established solely for that purpose 
none of our directors  officers or employees has any financial interest with regard to these lease arrangements or with any of the trusts used in these arrangements 
as part of these agreements  we are required to maintain collateral  in the form of restricted investments  in amounts equal to of the financed project cost for the duration of the leases 
under these lease agreements  which we have accounted for as operating leases  we have the option to purchase the properties  during and at the end of the lease terms  at an aggregate amount of approximately million 
alternatively  we can cause the properties to be sold to third parties 
we are contingently liable for the residual value guarantee associated with each property in the event the net sale proceeds are less than the original financed costs of the facilities 
the residual value guarantee for the october lease and the november lease is approximately million and million  respectively  assuming the full amount of the financings is used for construction activities 
however  with respect to the november lease  we are currently modifying the design of the large scale manufacturing facility  based on an assessment of production requirements for products currently in clinical development 
the modified design will likely result in a reduction in the total cost of the facility and the residual value guarantee 
as a result of the planned redesign  during we recorded an expense of million associated with the previous facility design 
liquidity and capital resources continued the october lease relates to a research and development complex adjacent to our current corporate campus 
we are leasing this property for seven years from a trust established solely for this purpose by allfirst bank 
the trust is leasing the property from the maryland economic development corporation medco  which is the owner of the property 
the cost of the existing property along with a building currently under construction is approximately million 
we are required to maintain collateral in the form of marketable securities equal to of the financed project cost with the lending institution for the duration of the lease 
the rent under this lease is fixed 
as of december   the weighted average interest rate was approximately 
we have a residual value guarantee of of the total financed cost under the october lease at lease termination 
in the event of our default  we are responsible for of the total financed cost of the project 
although the trust is responsible for servicing and repaying the debt and equity financings to various parties  we have made the residual value guarantee to the trust 
this trust was established solely for this one lease 
in the event the trust defaults to the lender or in the event the trust is terminated  we have the right to cure the default or exercise our option to acquire the property 
at any time during the lease term  we have the option to purchase legal and or beneficial interest in the project for of the lease balance plus any unpaid indemnity amounts 
the november lease relates to the construction of our research and development and administrative main campus and a large scale manufacturing facility 
we will lease these properties for approximately five years  following an estimated two year construction period  from a trust established solely for this purpose by bancboston leasing investment  inc and first union national bank  now part of wachovia bank  national association 
the trust has entered into agreements with bancboston and wachovia to provide financing for construction of the properties in the aggregate amount of million 
we are required to maintain collateral in the form of marketable securities equal to of the financed project cost with the lending institutions for the duration of the lease 
the rent under these leases is currently based on a floating interest rate  but the trust can lock in a fixed interest rate at any time at our request 
to the extent the trust does not lock in a fixed interest rate  if interest rates increase  our rent obligations would also increase 
if interest rates decrease  our rent obligations would decrease 
at december   the floating interest rate based primarily on short term commercial paper was approximately 
we have retained ownership of the land for the main campus component of this project 
we have entered into a ground lease with the trust for the land at fair market value rates 
thereafter  rent will be reduced to a nominal amount 
we are recording these lease payments on our balance sheet as deferred rental income over the two year construction period and then we will amortize this deferral over the remaining term approximately five years 
we have a residual value guarantee of of the total financed cost under the november lease at lease termination 
in the event of default  we are responsible for of the total financed cost of the project 
during the construction period  we have a residual value guarantee of of the financed cost incurred 
although the trust is responsible for servicing and repaying the debt and equity financings to various parties  we have made the residual value guarantee to the trust 
this trust was established solely for this one lease 
in the event the trust defaults to the lender or in the event the trust is terminated  we have the right to cure the default or exercise our option to acquire the property 
at any time during the lease term  we have the option to purchase legal and or beneficial interest in the project for of the lease balance plus any unpaid indemnity amounts 
there are no recourse provisions under either the october or november lease that would enable us to recover from third parties any of the amounts paid under the guarantees 
we have set aside collateral in the form of restricted investments sufficient to satisfy all obligations under the guarantees 
in addition  we have the right to cause the sale of the properties covered by the leases and may recover all or a portion of the money paid under the guarantees 
liquidity and capital resources continued our commitments and their expiration dates are as follows amount of commitment expiration per period dollars in millions other commercial commitments one four to after total amounts year two to five five committed or less three years years years lines of credit standby letters of credit guarantee october lease guarantee november lease standby repurchase obligations other commercial commitments total commercial commitments the guarantee of included above is based upon the loaned amount of million as of december  the construction period guarantee of included above is based upon a financed cost incurred of approximately million as of december  our post construction guarantee will be of financed project costs and will increase to approximately million if we reach the full million financed cost of the project at the end of the construction period 
however  we are currently modifying the design of the large scale manufacturing facility 
the modified design will likely result in a reduction in the total cost of the facility and the residual value guarantee 
as of december   we had net operating loss carry forwards for federal income tax purposes of approximately million  which expire  if unused  by the year we also have available research and development tax credit and other tax credit carry forwards of approximately million  the majority of which will expire  if unused  by the year our funds may be invested in us treasuries  government agency obligations  high grade debt securities and various money market instruments rated a or better

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we do not have operations subject to risks of foreign currency fluctuations  nor do we use derivative financial instruments in our operations or investment portfolio 
our investment portfolio may be comprised of low risk us treasuries  government agency obligations  high grade debt having at least an a rating and various money market instruments 
the short term nature of these securities  which currently have an average term of approximately months  significantly decreases the risk of a material loss caused by a market change 
we believe that a hypothetical basis point adverse move increase in interest rates along the entire interest rate yield curve would adversely affect the fair value of our cash  cash equivalents and short term and restricted investments by approximately million  or approximately of the aggregate fair value of billion  at december  for these reasons  and because these securities are generally held to maturity  we believe we do not have significant exposure to market risks associated with changes in interest rates related to our debt securities held as of december  we believe that any market change related to our investment securities held as of december  is not material to our consolidated financial statements 
however  given the short term nature of these securities  a general decline in interest rates would adversely affect the interest income from our portfolio as securities mature and are replaced with securities having a lower interest rate 
as of december   the carrying values of our equity investments in transgene  cambridge antibody technology cat and ciphergen were approximately million  million and million  respectively 
our investments in transgene and ciphergen are subject to equity market risk 
our investment in cat is denominated in pounds sterling and is subject to both foreign currency risk as well as equity market risk 
in  we reduced the carrying value of our equity investment in cat to million from million due to an impairment of the value of the investment that we deemed to be other than temporary 
see note d of the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional discussion 
in  we reduced the carrying value of our equity investment in transgene to million from million due to an impairment of the value of the investment that we deemed to be other than temporary

the facility leases we entered into during require us to maintain minimum levels of restricted investments as collateral for these facilities 
by  our maximum restricted investments for these leases could be approximately million 
however  our restricted investments under these leases could be lower in light of design changes currently under consideration for our large scale manufacturing facility  which may reduce the cost of the facility 
we are also required to maintain up to approximately million in restricted investments with respect to our process development and manufacturing facility leases 
although the market value for these investments may rise or fall as a result of changes in interest rates  we will be required to maintain this level of restricted investments in both a rising or declining interest rate environment
