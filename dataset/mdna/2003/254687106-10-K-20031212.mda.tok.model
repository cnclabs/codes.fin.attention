overview our income before the cumulative effect of accounting change was billion in fiscal  which was million  or  higher than in fiscal this represented diluted earnings per share before the cumulative effect of accounting change of  which was higher than in fiscal we made an accounting change effective as of the beginning of fiscal to adopt a new accounting rule for multiple element revenue accounting eitf  see note to the consolidated financial statements  which impacted the timing of revenue recognition related to nfl football programming at espn 
this change resulted in a cumulative effect charge totaling million 
diluted earnings per share including the effect of this accounting change were for fiscal results for the current year included a write off of an aircraft leveraged lease investment with united airlines million pre tax or per share  a pre tax gain of million on the sale of the anaheim angels and restructuring and impairment charges of million at the disney store  as described more fully under consumer products  below 
additionally  the current year included a benefit from the favorable settlement of certain state tax issues million or per share 
results for the prior year included a pre tax gain on the sale of shares of knight ridder  inc million or per share and a pre tax gain on the sale of the disney store business in japan million or per share 
excluding the aforementioned items  the increase in net income for fiscal was primarily the result of increased segment operating income at our studio entertainment and media networks segments and increased equity in the income of cable investees  partially offset by lower segment operating income at our parks and resorts segment and consumer products segment  higher corporate and unallocated shared expenses and increased net interest expense 
changes in segment operating income are discussed in detail in the separate sections below 
net interest expense net interest expense is detailed below year ended september  in millions interest expense interest and investment income loss net interest expense 
table of contents the increase in net interest expense reflects lower interest expense due to lower interest rates and average debt balances  offset by higher investment losses 
the investment losses in fiscal included the million write off of our leveraged lease investment with united airlines referred to above 
in contrast  fiscal included the million gain on the sale of knight ridder  inc shares referred to above 
equity in the income of investees the increase in equity in the income of our investees reflected increases at lifetime television  due to lower advertising expenses  as well as increases at a e and e entertainment due to higher advertising revenues 
in addition  a write down of an investment in a latin american cable operator negatively affected prior year equity income 
effective income tax rate the effective income tax rate decreased from in fiscal to in fiscal the decrease in the current year effective income tax rate is primarily due to a reduction in income tax expense due to a million reserve release as a result of the favorable resolution of certain prior year state income tax exposures 
as more fully disclosed in note to the consolidated financial statements  the current year effective income tax rate reflects a million benefit for certain income exclusions provided for under us income tax laws 
these income exclusions are under review and if they were to be repealed without the enactment of legislation replacing a substantial amount of the current benefit  there would be a negative impact on the company s income tax expense going forward 
pension and benefit costs increasing pension and post retirement medical benefit plan costs have affected results in all of our segments  with the majority of these costs being borne by the parks and resorts segment 
the costs increased from million in fiscal to million in fiscal the increase in fiscal was due primarily to a lower discount rate used to measure the present value of plan obligations  a lower expected long term return on plan assets and the actual performance of plan assets 
for fiscal expense  the discount rate assumption decreased from to reflecting the decline in overall market interest rates and the expected return on plan assets was reduced from to reflecting trends in the overall financial markets 
we expect pension and post retirement medical costs to increase further in fiscal to million 
the increase is due primarily to a further decrease in the discount rate assumption and a further reduction in the expected return on plan assets 
for fiscal expense  the discount rate assumption is decreasing from to  reflecting the further decline in prevailing market interest rates 
our long term expected rate of return on plan assets has been reduced from for fiscal to for fiscal cash contributions to the pension plans are expected to increase in fiscal to approximately million from million in fiscal over the past few years  the value of assets in the plans have declined in line with the performance of the financial markets generally 
this situation combined with the increase in the present value of pension obligations results in pension obligations exceeding the fair value of plan assets for certain of the pension plans 
in this circumstance  the accounting rules require that we record an immediate adjustment to reflect the unfunded accumulated pension obligation 
accordingly  as of september   the company recorded an additional minimum pension liability adjustment totaling million million after tax  see note to the consolidated financial statements 
the accounting rules require that this after tax adjustment be recorded as a reduction of equity by charging accumulated other comprehensive income rather than as a current year expense

higher interest expense was partially offset by increased investment income due to the gain on the sale of knight ridder shares 
effective income tax rate the effective income tax rate decreased from in fiscal to in fiscal the fiscal effective income tax rate was higher due to nondeductible impairment charges related to intangible assets that were recorded during that year 
additionally  fiscal had much higher non deductible goodwill amortization as the company ceased amortizing goodwill in fiscal fiscal restructuring and impairment charges the company recorded restructuring and impairment charges of approximately billion for the year ended september   which primarily related to the closure of the go

revenues media networks revenues increased  or billion  to billion 
the increase reflected an increase of  or million  at broadcasting and an increase of  or million at the cable networks 
increased broadcasting revenues were driven primarily by an increase of million at the abc television network  million at the company s owned and operated television stations and million at the radio networks and stations 
the increases at the television network and stations were primarily driven by higher advertising revenues reflecting higher rates due to an improved advertising marketplace 
the airing of the super bowl in the second quarter of the current year also contributed to increased advertising revenues 
revenues at the radio networks and stations also increased due to the stronger advertising market 
increased cable networks revenues were driven by increases of million in revenues from cable and satellite operators and million in advertising revenues 
increased advertising revenue was primarily a result of the addition of nba games 
revenues from cable and satellite operators are largely derived from fees charged on a per subscriber basis  and the increases in the current year reflected both contractual rate adjustments and subscriber growth 
the company s contractual arrangements with cable and satellite operators are renewed or renegotiated from time to time in the ordinary course of business 
a significant number of these arrangements will be up for renewal in the next months 
consolidation in the cable and satellite distribution industry and other factors may adversely affect the company s ability to obtain and maintain contractual terms for the distribution of its various cable and satellite programming services that are as favorable as those currently in place 
if this were to occur  revenues from cable networks could increase at slower rates than in the past or could be stable or decline 

table of contents costs and expenses costs and expenses for this segment consist primarily of programming rights costs and amortization  production costs  distribution and selling expenses and labor costs 
costs and expenses increased  or million  over fiscal due to higher programming and production costs  partially offset by lower bad debt expense at the cable networks 
additionally  the prior year benefited from the receipt of insurance proceeds related to the loss of a broadcast tower 
higher programming and production costs at the abc television network were primarily due to the airing of the super bowl and the costs of coverage of the war in iraq 
higher programming costs at the cable networks were primarily due to nba and mlb telecasts and higher programming costs at abc family 
programming cost increases were partially offset by lower cost amortization for the nfl contract due to commencing the three year option period as described under sports programming costs  below 
the decrease in bad debt expense at cable networks reflected negative impacts in the prior year related to financial difficulties of adelphia communications company adelphia in the united states and kirchmedia company kirch in germany 
segment operating income segment operating income increased  or million  to billion 
the increase reflected increases of million at broadcasting and million at the cable networks 
increased segment operating income at broadcasting reflected higher advertising revenues  partially offset by increased programming and production costs 
growth at the cable networks reflected higher revenues from cable and satellite operators and higher advertising revenue  partially offset by increased sports programming costs 
sports programming costs the initial five year period of the company s contract to televise nfl games was non cancelable and ended with the telecast of the pro bowl 
in february  the nfl did not exercise its renegotiation option and as a result  the company s nfl contract was extended for an additional three years ending with the telecast of the pro bowl 
the aggregate fee for the three year period will be billion 
espn recognized the costs of the initial five year term of the contract at levels that increased each year commensurate with increasing nfl revenues 
as a result  espn experienced its highest level of nfl programming costs during fiscal the implementation of the contract extension will reduce fiscal nfl costs by approximately million versus fiscal  and such costs are expected to be relatively level over the remaining two years of the contract extension 
cost recognition for nfl programming at the abc television network in fiscal is expected to decrease by million as compared to fiscal the decrease at the abc television network is primarily due to the absence of the super bowl  which was aired by the abc television network in fiscal and will be absent in fiscal  as well as fewer games in fiscal the absence of the super bowl and the lower number of games at the abc television network will also result in lower revenue from nfl broadcasts in fiscal due to the payment terms in the nfl contract  there will be approximately a million decrease in cash payments under the contract in fiscal as compared to fiscal the company has various contractual commitments for the purchase of television rights for sports and other programming  including the nfl  nba  mlb  nhl and various college football conference and bowl games 
the costs of these contracts have increased significantly in recent years 
we enter into these contractual commitments with the expectation that  over the life of the contracts  revenue from advertising during the programming and affiliate fees will exceed the costs of the programming 
while contract costs may initially exceed incremental revenues and negatively impact operating income  it is our expectation that the combined value to our sport networks from all of these contracts will result in long term benefits 
the actual impact of these contracts on the company s 
table of contents results over the term of the contracts is dependent upon a number of factors  including the strength of advertising markets  effectiveness of marketing efforts and the size of viewer audiences

we believe that the company s financial condition is strong and that its cash balances  other liquid assets  operating cash flows  access to debt and equity capital markets and borrowing capacity  taken together  provide adequate resources to fund ongoing operating requirements and future capital expenditures related to the expansion of existing businesses and development of new projects 
however  the company s operating cash flow and access to the capital markets can be impacted by macroeconomic factors outside of its control 
in addition to macroeconomic factors  the company s borrowing costs can be impacted by short and long term debt ratings assigned by independent rating agencies  which are based  in significant part  on the company s performance as measured by certain credit measures such as interest coverage and leverage ratios 
on october   standard poor s ratings services lowered its long term ratings on the company to bbb 
subsequently  on march   standard poor s placed the bbb long term corporate credit rating of the company on credit watch with negative implications

the slowdown in the european travel and tourism industry has negatively affected euro disney s results of operations and cash flow 
in response to this situation  euro disney initiated discussions with its lenders and the company to obtain waivers of its fiscal loan covenants and to obtain supplemental financing to address euro disney s cash requirements 
as a result of an agreement entered into on march   the company did not charge euro disney royalties and management fees for the period from january  to september  during the last three quarters of fiscal  the company s royalty and management fee income from euro disney totaled million 
additionally  the company agreed to allow euro disney to pay its royalties and management fees annually in arrears for fiscal  instead of quarterly 
on november   euro disney obtained waivers from its lenders  effective through march   with respect to covenants for fiscal the agreement is expected to give euro disney  its lenders and the company time to find a resolution to euro disney s financial situation 
in conjunction with the bank waivers  the company has provided a new million euros million at september  exchange rates subordinated credit facility  which can be drawn on through march  only after euro disney s existing line of credit with the company is fully drawn 
repayment of any amount drawn down on the new credit facility is subject to euro disney meeting certain financial thresholds or the prior repayment of all of euro disney s existing debt to its lenders 
euro disney is currently engaged in discussions with its agent banks and the company to obtain supplemental financing to address its cash requirements 
such financing may include an extension or change in the terms associated with the company s credit line or additional commitments from the company 
if a resolution to euro disney s future financing needs is not obtained by march   the waivers would expire and euro disney s lenders could accelerate the maturity of euro disney s debt 
should that occur  euro disney would be unable to meet all of its debt obligations 
the company believes that euro disney will ultimately obtain the requisite loan modifications and additional financing  however  there can be no assurance that this will be the case 
should euro disney be unable to obtain loan modifications and or additional financing  some or all of the company s million euro disney investment and receivables would likely become impaired

in connection with a financial restructuring of euro disney in  euro disney associ s snc disney snc  a wholly owned affiliate of the company  entered into a lease arrangement with a financing company with a noncancelable term of years related to substantially all of the disneyland park assets  and then entered into a year sublease agreement with euro disney on substantially the same terms 
remaining lease rentals at september  of approximately million receivable from euro disney under the sublease approximate the amounts payable by disney snc under the lease 
at the conclusion of the sublease term  euro disney will have the option of assuming disney snc s rights and obligations under the lease for a payment of million over the ensuing months 
if euro disney does not exercise its option  disney snc may purchase the assets  continue to lease the assets or elect to terminate the lease 
in the event the lease is terminated  disney snc would be obligated to make a termination payment to the lessor equal to of the lessor s then outstanding debt related to the disneyland park assets  which payment would be approximately billion 
disney snc would then have the right to sell or lease the assets on behalf of the lessor to satisfy the remaining debt  with any excess proceeds payable to disney snc 
notwithstanding euro disney s financial difficulties  the company believes it is unlikely that disney snc would be required to pay the lease termination payment as the company currently expects that in order for euro disney to continue its business it will either exercise its assumption option in or that the assumption of the lease by euro disney will otherwise be provided for in the resolution to euro disney s financial situation 
insurance significant changes have occurred during and in the commercial insurance market which impacted the cost and availability of the company s insurance coverage 
we have successfully renewed all of our policies in the current fiscal year  with premiums and deductibles at levels consistent with the prior year 
in  the company established a wholly owned captive insurance company to insure certain components of loss exposure which were previously insured by third party insurance companies 
the company s risk of loss created by the captive insurance company has been reduced during by the ability of the company to economically transfer some of this additional risk to third party insurers 
aircraft leases as disclosed in note to the consolidated financial statements  based on united airlines bankruptcy filing  the company believes it is unlikely that it will recover its aircraft leveraged lease investment with united airlines 
during the first quarter of the current year  the company wrote off its investment in leveraged leases with united airlines and the pre tax charge of million for the write off is reported in net interest expense in the consolidated statements of income 
as of september   the company s remaining net aircraft leveraged lease investment totaled approximately million  consisting of million and million with delta air lines and fedex  respectively 
given the current status of the airline industry  we continue to monitor the recoverability of these investments  particularly delta air lines 
the inability of delta air lines to make their lease payments  or the termination of our leases in bankruptcy proceeding  could result in a material charge for the write down of some or all our investment and acceleration of income tax payments 

table of contents legal and tax matters as disclosed in notes and to the consolidated financial statements  the company has exposure for certain legal and tax matters 
management believes that it is currently not possible to estimate the impact  if any  that the ultimate resolution of these matters will have on the company s operations  financial position or cash flows 
accounting policies and estimates we believe that the application of the following accounting policies  which are important to our financial position and results of operations  requires significant judgments and estimates on the part of management 
for a summary of all of our accounting policies  including the accounting policies discussed below  see note of the consolidated financial statements 
film and television revenues and costs we expense the cost of film and television production and participations as well as certain multi year sports rights over the applicable product life cycle based upon the ratio of the current period s gross revenues to the estimated remaining total gross revenues or straight line  as appropriate 
these estimates are calculated on an individual production basis for film and television and on an individual contract basis for sports rights 
estimates of total gross revenues can change due to a variety of factors  including the level of market acceptance  advertising rates and subscriber fees 
for film and television productions  estimated remaining gross revenue from all sources includes revenue that will be earned within ten years of the date of the initial theatrical release for film productions 
for television series  we include revenues that will be earned within years of the delivery of the first episode  or if still in production  five years from the date of delivery of the most recent episode 
for acquired film libraries  remaining revenues include amounts to be earned for up to years from the date of acquisition 
television network and station rights for theatrical movies  series and other programs are charged to expense based on the number of times the program is expected to be shown 
estimates of usage of television network and station programming can change based on competition and audience acceptance 
accordingly  revenue estimates and planned usage are reviewed periodically and are revised if necessary 
a change in revenue projections or planned usage could have an impact on our results of operations 
costs of film and television productions and programming costs for our television and cable networks are subject to valuation adjustments pursuant to the applicable accounting rules 
the net realizable value of the television broadcast program licenses and rights are reviewed using a daypart methodology 
the company s dayparts are early morning  daytime  late night  prime time  news  children and sports includes network and cable 
a daypart is defined as an aggregation of programs broadcast during a particular time of day or programs of a similar type 
the net realizable values of other cable programming are reviewed on an aggregated basis for each cable channel 
estimated values are based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions 
if actual demand or market conditions are less favorable than our projections  film  television and programming cost write downs may be required 
revenue recognition the company has revenue recognition policies for its various operating segments  which are appropriate to the circumstances of each business 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for a summary of these revenue recognition policies 
we record reductions to revenues for estimated future returns of merchandise  primarily home video  dvd and software products  and for customer programs and sales incentives 
these estimates are based upon historical return experience  current economic trends and projections of customer 
table of contents demand for and acceptance of our products 
differences may result in the amount and timing of our revenue for any period if actual performance varies from our estimates 
pension and postretirement benefit plan actuarial assumptions the company s pension benefit and postretirement medical benefit obligations and related costs are calculated using actuarial concepts  within the framework of statement of financial accounting standards no 
employer s accounting for pensions sfas and statement of financial accounting standards no 
 employers accounting for postretirement benefit other than pension sfas  respectively 
two critical assumptions  the discount rate and the expected return on plan assets  are important elements of expense and or liability measurement 
we evaluate these critical assumptions annually 
other assumptions involve demographic factors such as retirement  mortality  turnover and rate of compensation increases 
the discount rate enables us to state expected future cash flow as a present value on the measurement date 
the guideline for setting this rate is a high quality long term corporate bond rate 
a lower discount rate increases the present value of benefit obligations and increases pension expense 
we reduced our discount rate to in from in to reflect market interest rate conditions 
a one percentage point decrease in the assumed discount rate would increase annual expense and the projected benefit obligation by million and million  respectively 
a one percentage point increase in the assumed discount rate would decrease annual expense and projected benefit obligations by million and million  respectively 
to determine the expected long term rate of return on the plan assets  we consider the current and expected asset allocation  as well as historical and expected returns on each plan asset class 
a lower expected rate of return on pension plan assets will increase pension expense 
our long term expected return on plan assets was and in and  respectively 
a one percentage point increase decrease in the long term return on pension plan asset assumption would decrease increase annual pension expense by million 
goodwill  intangible assets  long lived assets and investments effective october   we adopted statement of financial accounting standards no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets sfas  as described more fully in note to the consolidated financial statements 
goodwill and other intangible assets must be tested for impairment on an annual basis 
we completed our impairment testing as of september  and determined that there were no impairment losses related to goodwill and other intangible assets 
in assessing the recoverability of goodwill and other intangible assets  market values and projections regarding estimated future cash flows and other factors are used to determine the fair value of the respective assets 
if these estimates or related projections change in the future  we may be required to record impairment charges for these assets 
for purposes of performing the impairment test for goodwill and other intangible assets as required by sfas we established the following reporting units cable networks  television broadcasting  radio  studio entertainment  consumer products and parks and resorts 
for purposes of performing our impairment test  we used a present value technique discounted cash flow to determine fair value for all of the reporting units except for the television broadcasting group 
the television broadcasting reporting unit includes the abc television network and owned and operated television stations 
these businesses have been grouped together because their respective cash flows are dependent on one another 
for purposes of our impairment test  we used a present value technique to value the owned and operated television stations and a revenue multiple to value the television network 
we did not use a present value technique or a market multiple approach to value the television network as a present value technique would not capture the full fair value of the television network and there have been no recent comparable sale transactions for a television network 
we applied what we believe to be the most appropriate valuation methodologies 
table of contents for each of the reporting units 
if we had established different reporting units or utilized different valuation methodologies the impairment test results could differ 
long lived assets include certain long term investments 
the fair value of the long term investments is dependent on the performance of the investee companies  as well as volatility inherent in the external markets for these investments 
in assessing potential impairment for these investments  we consider these factors as well as forecasted financial performance of our investees 
if these forecasts are not met  impairment charges may be required 
contingencies and litigation we are currently involved in certain legal proceedings and  as required  have accrued our estimate of the probable costs for the resolution of these claims 
this estimate has been developed in consultation with outside counsel and is based upon an analysis of potential results  assuming a combination of litigation and settlement strategies 
it is possible  however  that future results of operations for any particular quarterly or annual period could be materially affected by changes in our assumptions or the effectiveness of our strategies related to these proceedings 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for more detailed information on litigation exposure 
income tax audits as a matter of course  the company is regularly audited by federal  state and foreign tax authorities 
from time to time  these audits result in proposed assessments 
the internal revenue service irs has completed its examination of the company s federal income tax returns for through and has proposed assessments that challenge certain of the company s tax positions 
the company has negotiated the settlement of a number of these assessments  and is pursuing an administrative appeal before the irs with regard to the remainder 
if the remaining proposed assessments are upheld through the administrative and legal process  they could have a material impact on the company s earnings and cash flow 
however  the company believes that its tax positions comply with applicable tax law and intends to defend its positions vigorously 
the company believes it has adequately provided for any reasonably foreseeable outcome related to these matters 
accordingly  although their ultimate resolution may require additional cash tax payments  the company does not anticipate any material earnings impact from these matters 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal  the company favorably resolved certain state income tax audit issues and the corresponding reduction in income tax expense was due to the release of related income tax reserves and is reflected in the current year income tax provision

 revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables eitf in the fiscal fourth quarter of this new accounting rule addresses revenue recognition for revenues derived from a single contract that contains multiple products or services 
the rule provides additional requirements to determine when such revenues may be recorded separately for accounting purposes 
historically  the company has recognized the nfl broadcast portion of espn s affiliate revenue when the nfl games were aired  as espn s affiliate contracts provided a basis for allocating such revenue between nfl and non nfl programming 
since the cost of the nfl rights has also been recognized as the games were aired  the company recognized both the nfl revenues and nfl costs in the quarters the games were aired 
under eitf s requirements for separating the revenue elements of a single contract  the company will no longer allocate espn s affiliate revenue between nfl and non nfl programming for accounting purposes 
as a consequence  the company will no longer match all nfl revenue with nfl costs as espn affiliate revenue including the nfl portion will be recognized ratably throughout the year  while nfl contract costs will continue to be recognized in the quarters the games are aired 
this accounting change impacts only the timing of revenue recognition and has no impact on cash flow 
as a result of this change  the media networks segment will report significantly reduced revenue and profitability in the first fiscal quarter when the majority of the nfl games are aired  with commensurately increased revenues and profits in the second and third fiscal quarters 
the company has elected to adopt this new accounting rule using the cumulative effect approach 
in the fiscal fourth quarter of  the company recorded an after tax charge of million for the cumulative effect of a change in accounting as of the beginning of fiscal year this amount represents the revenue recorded for nfl games in the fourth quarter of fiscal year  which would have been recorded ratably over fiscal under the new accounting method 
the impact in the fourth quarter reflects the recognition of the remaining million of the million cumulative effect  offset by the million impact of not recognizing nfl revenue that  under the pre eitf method  the company would have recorded in the fourth quarter of fiscal as the games were aired 
this amount will be recognized during fiscal year the following table shows the quarterly effect on fiscal year of this new accounting method

 consolidation of variable interest entities fin and amended it in october  such that it is now effective for the company in the first fiscal quarter of variable interest entities vies are entities that lack sufficient equity to finance their activities without additional financial support from other parties or whose equity holders lack adequate decision making ability based on criteria set forth in the interpretation 
all vies  with 
table of contents which the company is involved  must be evaluated to determine the primary beneficiary of the risks and rewards of the vie

the company has equity interests in certain entities  including euro disney sca euro disney and hongkong international theme parks limited hong kong disneyland  which are currently not consolidated  but under current rules are accounted for under the equity or cost method of accounting 
the current fin guidance is still evolving with several proposed amendments and clarifications recently issued through an exposure draft release 
while we continue to evaluate the total impact of fin  based on the current exposure draft  the company anticipates that it will likely be required to consolidate euro disney and hong kong disneyland in the first quarter of fiscal see note to the consolidated financial statements for the impact of consolidating euro disney and hong kong disneyland 
the company also has variable interests in certain other entities  including  but not limited to  financing arrangements for film rights and certain capital assets 
these entities may be considered vies under fin and we may be required to consolidate certain of them 
management believes that recognition of any additional liabilities as a result of consolidating any vies would not increase the level of claims on the general assets of the company  rather  they would represent claims against the additional assets recognized by the company as a result of consolidating the vies 
conversely  we believe that any additional assets recognized as a result of consolidating any vies would not represent additional assets of the company that could be used to satisfy claims by the creditors of the company 
in addition  the potential consolidation of vies in which the company is not the majority equity holder will generally result in an increase in the minority interest in our financial statements

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company is exposed to the impact of interest rate changes  foreign currency fluctuations and changes in the market values of its investments 
policies and procedures in the normal course of business  we employ established policies and procedures to manage the company s exposure to changes in interest rates  foreign currencies and the fair market value of certain investments in debt and equity securities using a variety of financial instruments 
our objectives in managing exposure to interest rate changes are to limit the impact of interest rate volatility on earnings and cash flows and to lower overall borrowing costs 
to achieve these objectives  we primarily use interest rate swaps to manage net exposure to interest rate changes related to the company s portfolio of borrowings 
by policy  the company maintains fixed rate debt as a percentage of its net debt between a minimum and maximum percentage 
our objective in managing exposure to foreign currency fluctuations is to reduce earnings and cash flow volatility in order to allow management to focus on core business issues and challenges 
accordingly  the company enters into various contracts that change in value as foreign exchange rates change to protect the value of its existing foreign currency assets  liabilities  commitments and forecasted foreign currency revenues 
the company utilizes option strategies and forward contracts that provide for the sale of foreign currencies to hedge probable  but not firmly committed  revenues 
the company also uses forward contracts to hedge foreign currency assets and liabilities 
the principal foreign currencies hedged are the euro  british pound  japanese yen and canadian dollar 
cross currency swaps are used to effectively convert foreign currency denominated borrowings to us dollar denominated borrowing 
by policy  the company maintains hedge coverage between minimum and maximum percentages of its forecasted foreign exchange exposures generally for periods not to exceed five years 
the gains and losses on these contracts offset changes in the value of the related exposures 
in addition  we use various financial instruments to minimize the exposure to changes in fair market value of certain investments in debt and equity securities 
it is the company s policy to enter into foreign currency and interest rate derivative transactions and other financial instruments only to the extent considered necessary to meet its objectives as stated above 
the company does not enter into these transactions for speculative purposes 
value at risk we utilize a value at risk var model to determine the maximum potential one day loss in the fair value of interest rate  foreign exchange and qualifying equity sensitive financial instruments 
the var model estimates are made assuming normal market conditions and a confidence level 
various modeling techniques can be used in a var computation 
the company s computations are based on the interrelationships between movements in various interest rates  currencies and equity prices a variance co variance technique 
these interrelationships were determined by observing interest rate  foreign currency and equity market changes over the preceding quarter for the calculation of var amounts at year end and over each of the four quarters for the calculation of average var amounts during the year ended september  the model includes all of the company s debt as well as all interest rate and foreign exchange derivative contracts and qualifying 
table of contents equity investments 
the values of foreign exchange options do not change on a one to one basis with the underlying currencies  as exchange rates vary 
therefore  the hedge coverage assumed to be obtained from each option has been adjusted to reflect its respective sensitivity to changes in foreign currency values 
forecasted transactions  firm commitments and receivables and payables denominated in foreign currencies  which certain of these instruments are intended to hedge  were excluded from the model
