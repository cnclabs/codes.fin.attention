item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
strategy synthetech s strategy is to emphasize a commitment to its customers from the early phases of discovery through clinical development in order to develop larger orders to the extent that the products receive regulatory approval 
product overview peptide building blocks 
pbbs are amino acids that have been chemically modified through organic chemistry and biocatalysis techniques to enable them to link with other amino acids or chemicals in a particular defined sequence 
these pbbs are used as starting materials in the manufacture of peptide  peptidomimetic small molecule and other drugs  and for the cosmeceutical product 
the amino acids that are transformed into pbbs may be either natural amino acids that is  amino acids that occur in nature  including their chiral or mirror image form or synthetic amino acids that is  amino acids that have a side chain that does not occur in nature 
synthetech refers to the synthetic amino acids as specialty amino acids 
since  the company has produced a wide range of natural amino acid pbb products 
the company has also developed and manufactures over three dozen specialty amino acids 
the company uses a wide array of raw materials to produce pbbs 
these materials generally are in adequate supply from multiple suppliers 
the company has developed and scaled up process technology to produce this wide range of pbb products in a grams to tons scale 
the company continues to produce most bulk orders on an as ordered basis 
the company also maintains small inventory quantities of many pbbs  permitting immediate deliveries 
at march   the company s order backlog was million  with shipments extending into fiscal at march  and the company s order backlog was million and million  respectively 
marketing the company markets its products and capabilities through attendance at trade shows  listings in biotechnology and chemical industry directories  advertisements in chemical trade periodicals and a website 
in addition  the company maintains ongoing direct relationships with major pharmaceutical  emerging biopharmaceutical  contract drug synthesis and other firms that it believes might have a need for its products 
the company typically sells its products directly to its customers  although it uses independent sales representatives for some european sales in switzerland and france  and has usually sold products to japanese customers through chemical trading firms 
customers although the company has customers in various countries  the company expects that a few customers will continue to account for a significant portion of revenues each year 
during fiscal  the top customers represented over of the company s revenues 
of these ten customers  four were major pharmaceutical companies  two were emerging biopharmaceutical companies  three were contract drug synthesis companies  and one was a cosmeceutical company 
the company had two customers each accounting for over of fiscal revenues telik  inc and f 
hoffman la roche  ltd 
which individually accounted for approximately and  respectively  of the company s fiscal revenues 
for the fiscal years ended march   and  sales to international customers were million  million  and million  respectively  accounting for approximately   and  of the company s total revenues 
the company s international sales were principally to europe 
see note k to financial statements 
competition because peptide and peptidomimetic small molecule drugs are relatively new  the market in the past for pbbs has been quite small  with sales typically in the hundreds of kilos or smaller size 
as a result  the pbb market has not attracted a significant amount of direct competition 
as the market continues to grow with larger order sizes becoming more prevalent  the company has begun to see more competition 
current competition in multi kilo quantities of natural amino acid based pbbs comes primarily from several european fine chemical companies 
multi ton order sizes of these natural pbbs have begun to attract a wider group of domestic and international chemical companies 
in the area of specialty amino acids  the company has competition on a selected product basis at the multi kilo scale from fine chemical producers in europe  japan and the united states 
competition from companies in developing countries  such as india  china and korea  is also starting to emerge 
additionally  there is some competition from internal production departments of pharmaceutical companies 
competition also increases for supplying pbbs for drug development programs that reach late clinical trials and move into approved status as a result of the increased quantities typically required at these stages and pharmaceutical company requirements to have second sources of material available 
many of the company s competitors have technical  financial  selling and other resources available to them that are significantly greater than those available to the company 
the principal methods of competition in the market for pbbs and other fine chemicals are price  quality  customer service and delivery responsiveness 
the company believes that it competes effectively in each of these areas 
the company also believes that its production of a wide range of products and quantities gives it a competitive advantage in the marketplace 
in addition  the company believes that pharmaceutical companies generally view internal production of pbbs as a misallocation of resources and  given a reliable source of a quality product  would rather obtain them from an outside supplier 
research and development the company s research and development group is composed of nine degreed chemists  of whom four have advanced degrees in chemistry 
the company s research and development efforts focus on process development to support the company s pbb product lines 
in addition  the group explores alternative scaleable routes for pbb production  especially for its specialty amino acids 
the company has expanded its research staff in both fiscal and to place additional emphasis on developing novel technologies to seek to address identifiable market trends and business opportunities 
during the fiscal years ended march   and  the company s research and development expenses were   and  respectively 
employees as of may   the company employed individuals 
regulatory matters because the company s products are intermediates sold to drug manufacturers  the company has been generally unaffected directly by fda regulation which is directed at the drug manufacturers 
the company s customers do  however  typically conduct periodic reviews and audits of the company s operations  including its inspection and quality assurance programs 
these programs involve materials tracking  record keeping and other documentation 
because some customers have begun to request the company to manufacture and supply pbbs with additional processing that complies with the fda s good manufacturing practice guidelines  the company expects these programs will often include more extensive quality assurance systems and documentation 
the company anticipates that the expenses of implementing these programs will increase 
the company s business is also subject to substantial regulation in the areas of safety  environmental control and hazardous waste management 
although the company believes that it is in material compliance with these laws  rules and regulations  the failure to comply with present or future regulations could result in fines being imposed on the company  suspension of production or cessation of operations 
as additional and more extensive regulations are being added in these areas at the federal  state and local levels  the compliance costs likely will continue to increase 
the operation of fine chemical manufacturing plants involves a risk of environmental damage or personal injury due to the potentially harmful substances used 
there can be no assurance that material costs and liabilities will not be incurred in the future because of an accident or other event resulting in personal injury or an unauthorized release of such substances to the environment 
the company also generates hazardous and other wastes that are disposed at various off site facilities 
the company may be liable  irrespective of fault  for material cleanup costs or other liabilities incurred at these disposal facilities due to releases of such substances into the environment 
expenditures for capital equipment related to maintaining compliance with government regulatory matters were insignificant in fiscal and are anticipated to be insignificant in fiscal the company maintains property damage insurance  liability insurance  environmental risk insurance  and product liability insurance 
however  coverage may be inadequate to cover potential environmental liabilities 
product liability use of the company s products in pharmaceuticals and cosmeceuticals and the subsequent testing  marketing and sale of such products involves a risk of product liability 
claims for product liability may be asserted against the company 
the company may not be able to successfully defend any claim that may be asserted 
a product liability claim could have a material adverse effect on the business and or financial condition of the company 
the company maintains product liability insurance with a million limit per occurrence and a million aggregate limit 
the company also maintains an umbrella liability insurance policy with an additional million of coverage  which may be inadequate to cover its liabilities 
company background the company was formed in to develop novel chemical process technology by combining classical organic chemistry with enzyme based biocatalysis 
for the first several years  it operated mainly as a research and development group focused on process development of pharmaceuticals and other fine chemicals 
after its initial public offering in  the company s research efforts were concentrated on the development of a proprietary process for aspartame and l phenylalanine 
although the company has entered into one license for this technology  the company discontinued marketing this technology in and does not expect additional licensing revenue for this technology 
throughout its development during the s  the company also offered contract research services 
these research services were typically provided to pharmaceutical clients and generally involved the development of biocatalytic processes that is  chemical processes which are affected by the use of enzymes or micro organisms 
since the end of fiscal  the company has phased out contract research services and does not anticipate receiving any significant revenue from research services in the future 
by the end of the s  the company  building on prior experience  began to focus on the production of pbbs and other fine chemicals for customers 
with the successful completion of large scale orders  the company has demonstrated its capability as a full cycle grams to tons pbb producer 
factors affecting future results readers should carefully consider the following factors that may affect the company s business  future operating results and financial condition  as well as other information included in this annual report 
the risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones the company faces 
additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to the company or that the company currently deems immaterial also may impair its business operations 
if any of the following risks actually occur  the company s business  financial condition and operating results could be materially adversely affected 
uncertain market for products  customer concentration  and potential quarterly revenue fluctuations 
historically  the company has experienced substantial period to period revenue fluctuations reflecting the industry environment in which the company has operated 
the market for pbbs is driven by the market for the synthetically manufactured peptide  peptidomimetic small molecule and other drugs  and cosmeceuticals into which they are incorporated 
the drug development process is dictated by the marketplace  drug companies and the regulatory environment 
the company has no control over the pace of peptide  peptidomimetic small molecule and other drug development  which drugs get selected for clinical trials  which drugs are approved by the fda  and  even if approved  the ultimate potential of such drugs 
recurring sales of pbbs for discovery or clinical trial stage development programs is sporadic at best 
the high cancellation rate for drug development programs results in a significant likelihood that there will be no subsequent or follow on pbb sales for any particular drug development program 
accordingly  the level of purchasing by the company s customers for specific drug development programs varies substantially from year to year and the company cannot rely on any one customer as a constant source of revenue 
sales of pbbs for marketed drugs provide an opportunity for continuing longer term sales and the size of the pbb orders for marketed drugs can be substantially larger than those for the discovery or clinical trial stages 
while not subject to the same high cancellation rate faced by discovery and clinical trial stage drug development programs  the demand for the approved drugs remains subject to many uncertainties  including the drug price  the drug side effects and the existence of other competing drugs 
these factors  which are outside of the control of the company  will affect the level of demand for the drug itself and  therefore  the demand for pbbs 
since the company s revenues are composed of pbb sales in all three drug development stages  and since even sales of pbbs for marketed drugs are subject to cancellation or reduction  the company is likely to continue to experience significant fluctuations in its periodic results 
the company faces similar challenges in any sales in the cosmeceutical market 
downward price pressure 
as successful customer projects develop into larger volume orders  either during late stage clinical trials  product pre launch or for marketed products  the company s per unit price may decline 
additionally  the international fine chemicals industry  in which the company is a niche participant  has been marked by overcapacity  resulting in downward pressure on pricing 
downward price pressure and resulting price declines could significantly decrease the company s absolute gross margin if not offset by a substantial increase in customer requirements 
key personnel 
the company s success depends largely on its president and ceo  its vice president of finance and cfo  its vice president of operations  its director of business development  its technical director and other key employees 
the company does not have key man life insurance on any of these employees 
if one or more of these key employees were to resign  the loss could result in delays to production  loss of sales  and diversion of management resources 
synthetech s success also depends on its ability to attract and retain qualified  experienced employees 
there is substantial competition for experienced technical  sales and marketing personnel in the industry 
if synthetech is unable to retain its existing personnel  or attract and retain additional qualified personnel  it may from time to time experience inadequate levels of staffing which could have a material adverse effect on the company 
the company s growth could be limited due to its lack of capacity to produce and market products to customers or it could experience deterioration in service or decreased customer satisfaction 
competition 
in the past  the company has not had a significant amount of direct competition for discovery and clinical trial stage drug development projects 
the company believes that this resulted from peptide and peptidomimetic small molecule drugs  particularly those that utilize synthetic amino acids  being relatively new and the market for pbbs relatively small 
as the market has continued to grow with multi ton order sizes becoming more prevalent  the company has begun to see more competition 
current competition in the multi kilo or smaller quantities of natural amino acid based pbbs comes primarily from several european fine chemical companies 
multi ton order sizes of these natural pbbs have begun to attract a wider group of domestic and international chemical companies 
in the area of synthetic amino acid based pbbs  the company has competition on a selective product basis from fine chemical producers in europe and japan 
competition from companies in developing countries  such as india  china and korea  is also starting to emerge 
competition has also increased for supplying pbbs for drug development programs that reach late clinical trials and move into an approved status as a result of increased quantities typically required at these stages and pharmaceutical company requirements to have second sources of material available 
the company s competitors have technical  financial  selling and other resources available to them that are significantly greater than those available to the company 
risks of technological change 
the market for the company s products is characterized by rapid changes in both product and process technologies 
the company s future results of operations will depend upon its ability to improve and market its existing products and to successfully develop  manufacture and market new products 
the company may not be able to continue to improve and market its existing products or develop and market new products and technological developments could cause the company s products and technology to become obsolete or noncompetitive 
industry cost factors 
the market for pbbs used by pharmaceutical companies is dependent on the market for pharmaceutical products 
the levels of revenues and profitability of pharmaceutical companies may be affected by the continuing efforts of governmental and third party payers to contain or reduce the cost of health care through various means 
for example  in certain foreign markets  pricing or profitability of prescription pharmaceuticals is subject to government control 
in the united states  there have been  and the company expects that there will continue to be  a number of federal and state proposals to implement similar government controls 
in addition  in the united states and elsewhere  sales of prescription pharmaceuticals are dependent in part on the availability of reimbursement to the consumer from third party payers such as government and private insurance plans 
third party payers are increasingly challenging the prices charged for medical products and services 
peptide and peptidomimetic small molecule drugs may not be considered cost effective  and reimbursement may not be available or sufficient to allow these drugs to be sold on a profitable basis 
in addition  as cost pressures in the pharmaceutical industry have tightened  the cancellation rate for drug development programs has increased 
industry cost pressures can also cause pharmaceutical companies to investigate alternative drug manufacturing processes that may not include pbbs 
production factors 
synthetech has a full cycle grams to tons production capability and has made over products 
with over years of experience  synthetech has developed extensive peptide and peptidomimetic small molecule process technology 
nevertheless  initial batches of new products and scaling up production of existing products may result in significantly lower than expected yields or may require substantial rework to meet the required specification 
production of new products may even result in total write offs 
such write offs would reduce the company s gross margin 
regulatory matters 
the company is subject to a variety of federal  state and local laws  rules and regulations related to the discharge or disposal of toxic  volatile or other hazardous chemicals 
although the company believes that it is in compliance with these laws  rules and regulations in all material respects  the failure to comply with present or future regulations could result in fines being imposed on the company  suspension of production or cessation of operations 
third parties may also have the right to sue to enforce compliance 
moreover  it is possible that increasingly strict requirements imposed by environmental laws and enforcement policies thereunder could require the company to make significant capital expenditures 
the operation of a chemical manufacturing plant entails the inherent risk of environmental damage or personal injury due to the handling of potentially harmful substances  and there can be no assurance that material costs and liabilities will not be incurred in the future because of an accident or other event resulting in personal injury or unauthorized release of such substances to the environment 
in addition  the company generates hazardous materials and other wastes that are disposed at various offsite facilities 
the company may be liable  irrespective of fault  for material cleanup costs or other liabilities incurred at these disposal facilities in the event of a release of hazardous substances by such facilities into the environment 
although  the company has obtained environmental risk insurance  it may be inadequate to cover the company s potential environmental liabilities 
potential regulation 
the pbbs produced by the company are intermediate ingredients that are then processed by the companies to which they are sold  and are therefore currently not subject to the requirements of the fda 
the company s customers do  however  typically conduct periodic reviews and audits of the company s operations  including its inspection and quality assurance programs 
these programs involve materials tracking  record keeping and other documentation 
as some customers have begun to request the company to manufacture and supply pbbs with additional processing  the company believes that these programs will often become more extensive 
accordingly  the company expects its compliance documentation efforts will continue to increase and anticipates that the expenses of implementing such programs will increase in the future 
in the future  the company may not be able to comply with the applicable documentation or such documentation may require substantial incremental expense for additional labor and capital 
risks of international business 
sales to customers outside the united states accounted for approximately of the company s net sales during fiscal year and and for fiscal years and  respectively 
the company expects that international sales will continue to account for a significant percentage of net sales 
the company s business is and will be subject to the risks generally associated with doing business internationally  including changes in demand resulting from fluctuations in exchange rates  foreign governmental regulation and changes in economic conditions 
these factors  among others  could influence the company s ability to sell its products in international markets 
in addition  the company s sale of its products is subject to the risks associated with legislation and regulation relating to imports  including quotas  duties or taxes and other charges  restrictions and retaliatory actions on imports into other countries in which the company s products may be sold 
the company is also subject to similar risks with respect to the importation of raw materials from foreign countries 
changes in these regulations could increase costs or prevent the company from accessing materials necessary for its products 
manufacturing capacity 
as a manufacturer of pbbs  the company will continually face risks regarding the availability and costs of raw materials and labor  the potential need for additional capital equipment  increased maintenance costs  plant and equipment obsolescence and quality control 
the company has constructed additional manufacturing and related facilities on its site in albany  oregon 
nevertheless  existing facilities may not have sufficient capacity to meet the future demand for the company s products 
the company utilizes a single facility 
a disruption in the company s production or distribution or damage or destruction of the company s facility could have a material adverse effect on the company s financial results 
conversely  the company may not have sufficient demand to utilize the additional capacity  which could also have a material adverse effect on the company s financial results 
product liability 
use of the company s products in pharmaceuticals and cosmeceuticals and the subsequent testing  marketing and sale of such products involves an inherent risk of product liability 
claims for product liability could be asserted against the company and the company may not be able to successfully defend any claim that may be asserted 
even if the company is successful  the costs of defense could materially affect its business 
a product liability claim could have a material adverse effect on the business and or financial condition of the company 
the company has purchased product liability insurance with a million limit per occurrence and a million aggregate limit 
also  the company maintains an umbrella liability insurance policy with an additional million of coverage  which may be inadequate to cover its potential liabilities 
change in independent auditors 
in may  the company dismissed arthur andersen llp  which had audited the company s financial statements since  and engaged kpmg llp to audit the company s financial statements for the fiscal year ended march  and the fiscal year ended march  the company has not been able to obtain arthur andersen s consent to incorporate by reference their report on the audited financial statements for the fiscal year ended march  into the company s existing or future registration statements or periodic reports 
because the company has not been able to obtain such consent  recovery of damages by investors in the company s common stock sold pursuant to those registration statements may be limited 
item properties synthetech s headquarters and production facility are located in albany  oregon 
the company purchased this property in since then  it has undergone a number of plant and building expansions on site 
at present  the company s operating facilities aggregate  square feet and are comprised of production  pilot plant  laboratory  warehouse and office space 
these facilities include a separate  square foot production facility

overview synthetech has a full cycle grams to tons production capability to produce synthetically manufactured amino acid derivatives  small peptides  and similar intermediates referred to as peptide building blocks or pbbs 
this full cycle pbb production capability reinforces synthetech s long term growth strategy emphasizing a commitment to its customers from the early phases of research and discovery through regulatory trials and culminating in marketed product 
management believes that synthetech is well positioned for growth and is active as a supplier of pbbs for a variety of pharmaceutical development projects  and a marketed pharmaceutical and cosmeceutical project 
although the progress  timing and continued success of these projects remain outside the company s control  management believes that there are a number of different combinations of possible revenue sources with the potential to generate substantial future revenues 
see industry factors below 
new accounting pronouncements in august  the fasb approved sfas no 
 accounting for asset retirement obligations  which becomes effective beginning with fiscal year sfas no 
addresses the financial accounting and reporting for obligations associated with the retirement of tangible long lived assets and the associated asset retirement costs 
the adoption of sfas is not expected to have a significant impact on the company s financial condition or results of operations 
in november  the eitf reached a consensus on issue no 
 revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables 
eitf no 
addresses certain aspects of the accounting by a vendor for arrangements under which the vendor will perform multiple revenue generating activities 
eitf no 
will be effective for interim periods beginning after june  the company does not expect the application of the provisions of eitf no 
to have a material effect on the company s financial condition or results of operations 
critical accounting policies and estimates the discussion and analysis of synthetech s financial condition and results of operations are based upon its financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires synthetech to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  synthetech evaluates its estimates  including those related to inventory realizability  allowance for doubtful accounts and revenue recognition 
synthetech bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
synthetech believes the following critical accounting policies and the related judgments and estimates affect the preparation of its financial statements 
item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued inventories inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market  determined on the first in first out fifo basis 
costs include direct material  direct labor  applicable manufacturing overhead  and other direct costs 
management evaluates the company s inventory for impairment whenever indicators of impairment exist 
factors contributing to inventory impairment include  but are not limited to  decreases in selling price  changes in customer specifications  project terminations or holds  variations in material produced by the company from customer specifications  production costs materially in excess of current market price 
management writes down the company s inventories to reflect an estimate for impairment in an amount equal to the difference between the cost of inventory and the estimated market value based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions 
if actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management  additional inventory write downs may be required in the future 
write downs would be reflected as a charge to earnings in the relevant period 
long lived asset impairment management regularly evaluates long lived assets for impairment in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  which requires a review of long lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset might not be recoverable  utilizing an undiscounted cash flow analysis 
based on this analysis  the company did not recognize an impairment on long lived assets during the year ended march  if circumstances related to long lived assets change  the company may record an impairment charge in the future 
in addition  the useful lives of long lived assets are an estimate and may change based on the company s experience with the actual lives 
if circumstances related to the company s estimate of useful lives changes  depreciation expense could materially change 
revenue recognition the company recognizes revenues including shipping and handling charges billed to customers  upon shipment of product when title and risk of loss pass to customers 
shipping and handling costs are classified as part of cost of revenues 
allowance for doubtful accounts credit limits for customers are established through a process of reviewing the financial history and stability of each customer 
the company regularly evaluates the collectability of its trade receivable balances by monitoring past due balances 
if the company determines that a customer will be unable to meet its financial obligation  the company will record a specific reserve for bad debt to reduce the related receivable to the amount the company expects to recover 
bad debts have not historically been significant 
if circumstances related to specific customers change  the company s estimates of the recoverability of receivables could materially change 
item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued operations the following table sets forth  for the periods indicated  the percentage of revenues represented by each item included in the statements of operations 
percentage of revenues fiscal year ended march  revenue cost of revenue gross profit loss research and development selling  general and administrative operating expense operating loss interest income interest expense loss before income taxes benefit for income taxes net loss item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued revenue synthetech revenues were million  million  and million in fiscal  fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
revenues increased in fiscal as compared to fiscal and increased in fiscal as compared to fiscal in total  fiscal revenue was substantially similar to fiscal changes in revenue for the specified periods primarily relate to revenue from significant customers 
revenue from significant customer projects was million  million  and  for fiscal  fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
significant project revenue in fiscal arose from four customer projects 
two of those included shipments of pbbs to support production of large scale drug projects in clinical trials 
one of those projects achieved marketing approval in the united states and europe and the other moved into phase testing following favorable clinical results 
fiscal significant project revenue also included pbb shipments to a major pharmaceutical company to support a drug project in early development and shipments to support an established product in the cosmeceutical sector 
significant project revenue in fiscal was attributable to three orders 
significant project revenue in fiscal was for a pbb to be used in pre launch and market launch quantities of a cosmeceutical 
the company continues to produce pbbs for this marketed cosmeceutical 
the company estimates that in fiscal approximately of the company s pbb sales went into drugs in clinical trials  approximately went into marketed drugs and the cosmeceutical and approximately went into drugs at the r d or discovery stage 
in fiscal  the company estimates that approximately of the company s pbb sales went into drugs in clinical trials  approximately went into marketed drugs and the cosmeceutical and approximately went into drugs at the r d or discovery stage 
in fiscal  the company estimates that approximately of the company s pbb sales went into drugs in clinical trials  approximately went into marketed drugs and the cosmeceutical  and approximately went into drugs at the r d or discovery stage 
these estimates are based on an analysis of the company s sales  publicly available information and information to the extent available from customers 
the company s backlog of pbb orders at march  was million compared to a backlog at march  and of million and million  respectively 
approximately million of the march  backlog is comprised of pbbs for the recently approved drug and the cosmeceutical 
deliveries for the march  backlog extend into fiscal during the fourth quarter of fiscal the company experienced a substantial price decline on a product that accounted for a significant level of revenue in fiscal fiscal customer requirements  if any  for this product are dependent on future outcomes of clinical trials and timing of the customer s drug development efforts 
to the extent successful customer projects develop into larger volumes  either during late stage clinical trials  pre launch or as a marketed product  the company s per unit pricing may decline 
there is a risk that the impact on future sales and profitability from declines in pricing may not be offset by an increase in customer requirements 
item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued the level of synthetech s business from period to period is largely unpredictable 
although pbb sales associated with marketed products are more likely to provide a longer term  on going revenue stream than sales associated with drugs at the clinical or discovery stages  continuation of customer demand for pbbs associated with marketed products remains subject to various market conditions  including potential use of alternative manufacturing methods  continued market demand for drugs that include pbbs  or the cosmeceutical and competition from other suppliers of pbbs 
accordingly  while significant orders for marketed products provide substantial and predictable revenues the company expects revenues to continue to fluctuate from period to period 
gross profit loss cost of revenue in fiscal was million  resulting in a gross profit of million 
cost of revenue in fiscal was million  resulting in a gross loss of  cost of revenue in fiscal was million  resulting in a gross profit of  as a percentage of revenue  gross profit loss margins were  and in fiscal  and fiscal  respectively 
the improvement in gross profit between fiscal and fiscal relates to an improved product mix and a reduction in depreciation expense relating to the extension of asset lives  partially offset by unfavorable adjustments for impaired inventory 
the mix of products shipped in fiscal had an unusually high gross profit 
in future periods  the company does not expect to achieve the level of gross profit experienced in fiscal at this level of revenue 
as further discussed in note d to the attached financial statements  at the beginning of fiscal  the company reassessed the useful lives of certain of its machinery and equipment 
the resulting extension in asset lives decreased depreciation expense which increased gross profit for fiscal by approximately million 
gross profit for fiscal also reflects charges for impaired inventory of million 
this compares to charges for impaired inventory totaling approximately  in fiscal the company routinely develops manufacturing processes to produce new products or refine procedures for existing products 
it is not unusual for manufacturing costs associated with new processes to exceed the selling price for the initial batches of product  which results in an inventory write off 
the international fine chemicals industry  where the company is a niche participant  has been marked by overcapacity and a resulting downward pressure on pricing 
it has become increasingly difficult to rework certain materials on a cost effective basis 
a significant portion of the charges for impaired inventory for fiscal and related to material that failed to meet customer specifications or was associated with the early stages of development and production of products not previously manufactured by the company 
in addition  the company s charge for impaired inventory also included material related to customer projects that have been discontinued or are on hold  and changes in customer preferences towards products that contain no animal content 
item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued property taxes and insurance costs increased  or  during fiscal compared to fiscal the increase is the result of the company s plant expansions  the expiration of a property tax deferral  and general increases in the cost of insurance 
losses on the retirement of machinery and equipment totaled  in fiscal as discussed above  fiscal gross loss was impacted by inventory write offs of  primarily resulting from production batches not meeting specification 
to a lesser extent  fiscal was negatively impacted by lower than expected yields and product rework associated with production scale up of certain existing products and initial production batches of certain new products 
see industry factors below 
fiscal gross profit was affected by lower revenues and increased manufacturing overhead costs associated with the company s plant expansions 
cost of revenues includes raw materials consumed  all labor  facility and similar expenses incurred by the company s manufacturing department during the period  including expenses not directly allocated to manufacturing the products sold during the period  and adjustments to inventory 
operating expenses research and development r d expense in fiscal was  or of revenue  compared to  or of revenue  and  also of revenue  in fiscal and  respectively 
during the past two years  the company expanded and modernized its r d facility and has added chemists to better support critical customer programs 
the company s r d department develops processes to produce and optimize the production of pbbs and their related scale up to manufacturing quantities 
selling  general and administrative sg a expense in fiscal was million  or of revenue  compared to million  or of revenue  and million  or of revenue  in fiscal and  respectively 
the increase in sg a expense for fiscal compared to fiscal includes severance costs related to the retirement of a company officer  general increases in compensation and related employee benefit costs  increased costs related to professional services and increased expenditures for marketing programs 
the increase in sg a expense in fiscal compared to fiscal primarily reflected the increased cost associated with the addition of a senior member to the company s marketing staff 
sg a expense consists of compensation and related fringe benefits for sales and administrative employees  cost of professional services  marketing costs  costs associated with being a public company and costs related to administrative facilities and information services 
item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued operating loss as a result of the foregoing  the company s operating loss decreased to  in fiscal from million and million in fiscal and  respectively 
the decrease in operating loss between fiscal and was primarily the result of a more favorable product mix and the reduction of depreciation expense from the reassessment of useful lives of certain machinery and equipment 
these favorable items were partially offset by unfavorable adjustments for impaired inventory and increased sg a and r d expenses 
in fiscal  labor costs increased to million from million in fiscal  principally due to an increase in headcount 
interest income interest income in fiscal was  compared to  and  in fiscal and  respectively 
the company s interest income is primarily derived from earnings on the company s cash equivalents 
the changes in interest income for the years presented were due to the amount of cash equivalents and the interest rates in effect during the periods 
average rates of interest earned on the company s cash and cash equivalents in fiscal were  compared to and in fiscal and  respectively 
the decrease for fiscal was primarily due to lower average interest rates 
the decrease for fiscal was a combination of lower average interest rates and lower average cash equivalents 
interest expense interest expense in fiscal was  compared to  and  in fiscal and  respectively 
benefit for income taxes for all periods presented  the company recorded an income tax benefit at the statutory combined federal and state income tax rate of 
management has determined for the tax losses incurred  it is more likely than not the resulting deferred tax asset will be realized 
net loss net loss for fiscal was  compared to a net loss of million and  for fiscal and  respectively 
the effect on net loss for fiscal from the extension of the useful lives of certain of the company s machinery and equipment  as discussed in note d to the attached financial statements  was to decrease net loss by approximately  or per share 
item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued industry factors market factors the company manufactures pbbs for use in synthetically manufactured peptide  peptidomimetic small molecule and other drugs 
the market for pbbs is driven by the market for the drugs in which they are incorporated 
the drug development process is dictated by the marketplace  drug companies and the regulatory environment 
the company has no control over the pace of these drug development efforts  which drugs get selected for clinical trials  which drugs are approved by the fda or  even if approved  the ultimate market potential of the drugs 
the company also manufactures pbbs for use in a cosmeceutical  and faces similar factors in that market 
the three stages of the drug development process include r d or discovery stage  clinical trial stage and marketed drug stage 
synthetech s customers can spend years researching and developing new drugs  and take only a small percentage to clinical trials and fewer yet to commercial market 
a substantial amount of activity continues to occur at the earlier stages of research and development and clinical trials 
the market for peptide and peptidomimetic small molecule drugs is still developing 
recurring sales of pbbs for development programs is sporadic because of the high cancellation rate for drug development programs there is a significant likelihood that there will be no subsequent or follow on pbb sales for any particular drug development program 
accordingly  the level and timing of customer orders relating to specific drug development programs vary substantially from period to period and the company cannot rely on any one customer as a constant source of revenue 
the size of the pbb orders for marketed drugs can be substantially larger than those for the discovery or clinical trial stages 
sales of pbbs for marketed drugs can also provide an opportunity for continuing  longer term sales 
while not subject to the same high cancellation rate faced by discovery and clinical trial stage drug development programs  the demand for the approved drugs remains subject to many uncertainties  including the drug price  the drug side effects and the existence of other competing drugs 
these factors  which are outside of the control of the company  will affect the level of demand for the drug itself and  therefore  the demand for pbbs 
also  industry cost pressures can cause pharmaceutical companies to explore and ultimately adopt alternative manufacturing processes that may not include the company s pbbs as an intermediate 
finally  with longer term  significant or large scale orders  the company expects increased competition to supply these pbbs 
similar dynamics affect the cosmeceutical development process and market  except that the regulatory oversight and  consequently  the typical length of a product s time to market are reduced 
due to the foregoing industry factors the company cannot predict future demand beyond its current order base 
until there is stable demand for its products  the company is likely to continue to experience significant fluctuations in its periodic results 
item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued production factors synthetech has a full cycle grams to tons production capability and has made over products 
with over years of experience  synthetech has developed extensive pbb process technology and is recognized as one of the leaders in this area 
nevertheless  initial batches of new products and scaling up production processes for existing products may result in significantly lower than expected yields and extended processing time  and may require substantial rework to meet the required specification 
these factors could cause increased costs and delayed shipments  either of which could negatively affect periodic operating results 
liquidity and capital resources the company s cash and cash equivalents totaled million at march   compared to million and million at march  and  respectively 
during the past three years  the company has incurred a cumulative net loss of million and generated cash from operating activities of million  offset by investments in property plant and equipment totaling million 
the company has not undertaken any significant external financing activities during this period 
at march   the company had working capital of million  compared to million and million at march  and march   respectively 
the company has a million bank line of credit  collateralized by accounts receivable  of which there was no amount outstanding at march  the line of credit expires on august  the company intends to renew the credit facility upon expiration 
accounts receivable decreased to  at march  from million at march  primarily due to differences in the timing and the amount of shipments between the periods 
inventory decreased to million at march  from million at march  primarily due to fiscal charges for impaired inventory 
see the gross profit loss section of the management discussion and analysis  in this report on form k 
income tax receivable decreased to at march   from  at march   as a result of a tax refund in the amount of  received in the fourth quarter of fiscal accounts payable increased to  at march   from  at march   primarily due to timing differences in expenditures related to raw materials and capital equipment 
on march   the company s board of directors approved a share repurchase program and authorized the purchase of up to  shares of the company s common stock in the open market over the succeeding year 
as of march   the company has not repurchased any of its shares 
capital expenditures for fiscal totaled million 
during fiscal  the company purchased and improved an office and warehouse facility adjacent to its production facility at a total cost of  the company also completed the installation of an automated process control system  at a total cost of   of which was incurred in fiscal in addition  the company remodeled its item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued quality control department in fiscal for a cost of  and extended its fire suppression system on a budgeted cost of   of which was incurred in fiscal the company had various other capital expenditures during fiscal totaling  the company s capital plan for fiscal is for various projects totaling approximately  the company expects to finance all capital expenditures from cash on hand and internal cash flow and does not anticipate the need for any new debt or equity financing 
the company believes that its existing cash and cash equivalents  its bank line of credit and funds generated from operations will be sufficient to support its operations and its stock repurchase program for the next twelve months 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk synthetech s primary market risk exposure is the impact of interest rate fluctuations on interest income earned on the company s cash deposits and cash equivalents 
the risks associated with market  liquidity and principal are mitigated by investing in high credit quality securities and limiting concentrations of issuers and maturity dates 
derivative financial instruments are not part of synthetech s investments 
substantially all of synthetech s purchases and sales are denominated in us dollars and as a result  it has relatively little exposure to foreign currency exchange risk with respect to any of its purchases and sales 
should the company enter into a significant transaction denominated in a foreign currency the company may enter into a forward exchange contract at that time 
the company is not a party to any forward exchange contracts as of march  with regards to existing company transactions denominated in a foreign currency  the effect of an immediate change in relevant exchange rates would not have a material impact on synthetech s operating results or cash flows
