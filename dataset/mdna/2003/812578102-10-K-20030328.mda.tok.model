in some cases  you can identify forward looking statements by terminology such as may  will  should  expect  plan  anticipate  believe  estimate  predict  potential or continue  the negative of terms like these or other comparable terminology 
these statements are only predictions 
actual events or results may differ materially 
all forward looking statements included in this document are based on information available to us on the date hereof  and we assume no obligation to update any such forward looking statements 
in evaluating these statements  you should specifically consider various factors  including the risks outlined under the caption important factors that may affect our business  results of operations and stock price set forth at the end of this item and those contained from time to time in our other filings with the sec 
we caution investors that our business and financial performance are subject to substantial risks and uncertainties 
overview we focus on the discovery and development of monoclonal antibody based drugs to treat cancer and other human diseases 
we have three monoclonal antibody based technologies genetically engineered monoclonal antibodies  monoclonal antibody drug conjugates adcs  and antibody directed enzyme prodrug therapy adept 
our technologies enable us to develop monoclonal antibodies that can kill cells on their own as well as to increase the potency of monoclonal antibodies by enhancing their tumor cell killing ability 
using our expertise in cancer and monoclonal antibody technologies  we have constructed a diverse portfolio of product candidates 
our technologies also provide us with an opportunity to partner with other companies that are developing monoclonal antibodies 
we have two monoclonal antibody based product candidates in clinical trials  sgn and sgn sgn is being developed to treat patients with hematologic malignancies 
sgn targets a variety of solid tumors  including prostate  ovarian and lung 
we also have three product candidates presently undergoing preclinical development sgn formerly sgn  sgn and sgn sgn is in preclinical development for the treatment of hematologic malignancies and some types of solid tumors such as bladder and renal cancer 
sgn  which utilizes our next generation adc technology  is in preclinical development for hematological malignancies 
this technology utilizes proprietary stable linkers that can significantly reduce the toxic side effects caused by the systemic release of drugs associated with less stable linker technology 
these linkers attach our antibodies to synthetic  highly potent  cell killing drugs we have developed  including variants of auristatin e  which are scaleable for commercial development 
sgn  which utilizes our adept technology  is being developed preclinically in collaboration with genencor international for patients with metastatic melanoma 
since our inception  we have incurred substantial losses and  as of december   we had an accumulated deficit of million 
these losses and accumulated deficit have resulted from the significant costs incurred in the development of our monoclonal antibody based technologies  clinical trial costs  manufacturing expenses of preclinical and clinical grade materials  general and administrative costs and non cash stock based compensation expenses associated with stock options granted to employees and consultants prior to our initial public offering in march operating expenses increased to million in from million in and million in we expect that our losses will increase for the foreseeable future as we continue to expand our research  development  clinical trial activities and infrastructure in support of these activities 
in january  we entered into an agreement with genencor international  inc to jointly discover and develop a class of cancer therapeutics based on our adept program 
the companies have agreed to jointly fund certain preclinical and clinical development costs and have the right to jointly commercialize any resulting 
table of contents products within the field 
the companies may also pay each other specific fees and milestone payments 
as part of the collaboration  genencor paid million to acquire  shares of our common stock at fair value 
in july  we received a license fee under this collaboration agreement from genencor 
in march  we entered into an agreement with celltech group to use our adc technology with celltech s monoclonal antibodies and antibody fragments directed against specific diseases  including immunological targets 
under the terms of the multi year agreement  celltech paid an up front technology access fee and may make progress dependent milestone payments 
in addition  celltech is paying research and reagent fees and will pay royalties on net sales of any resulting products 
celltech will be responsible for product development  manufacturing and marketing of any products generated through the collaboration 
in april  we entered into an agreement with genentech  inc to license our adc technology for use with genentech s antibodies targeted to certain diseases 
under the terms of the multi year agreement  genentech paid a million up front fee and is paying technology access fees and research fees 
genentech may also pay progress dependent milestone payments and will pay royalties on net sales of any resulting products 
genentech is responsible for research  product development  manufacturing and commercialization of any products resulting from the collaboration 
as part of the collaboration  genentech purchased  shares of our common stock at fair value on april  in a private placement for an aggregate purchase price of approximately million 
this stock purchase increased genentech s total equity ownership in seattle genetics to  shares  or approximately of our outstanding common stock 
if an additional benchmark is achieved under the collaboration agreement  we have an option  at our sole discretion  to sell additional equity to genentech at fair value 
during september  seattle genetics was awarded a small business innovation research sbir grant from the national institutes of health nih through the national cancer institute 
the  grant was awarded under phase i of the sbir program of the nih to develop anti cancer prodrugs that can be activated by tumor associated enzymes 
the amount awarded is being recognized over a one year period as the research is performed 
we do not currently have any commercial products for sale 
to date  our revenues have been derived principally from our collaboration and license agreements and small business innovative research grants 
in the future  we believe our revenues will consist of milestone payments  technology licensing fees and sponsored research fees under existing and future collaborative arrangements  royalties from collaborations with current and future strategic partners and commercial product sales 
because a substantial portion of our revenues for the foreseeable future will depend on achieving development and clinical milestones  our results of operations may vary substantially from year to year and quarter to quarter 
we believe that period to period comparisons of our operating results are not meaningful and you should not rely on them as indicative of our future performance 
results of operations years ended december  and revenues 
revenues increased to million in from  in revenues in were derived from the earned portion of technology access fees of approximately  from service and reagent fees of approximately  and from two small business innovative research sbir grants of approximately  revenues in were derived from service and reagent fees of approximately  the earned portion of technology access fees of approximately  and a sbir grant of approximately  research and development expenses 
research and development expenses  excluding non cash stock based compensation expenses  increased to million in from million in this increase was principally due to increases in personnel expenses of approximately million  increases in rent and occupancy costs related to our new headquarters and operations facility of approximately million  increased 
table of contents usage of laboratory materials and supplies of approximately  and increases in clinical trial costs of approximately  these expenses were offset by decreases in manufacturing for clinical grade materials of approximately  and shared development funding under our collaboration agreement with genencor of approximately  the number of research and development personnel increased to at december  from at december  we anticipate that our research and development expenses will continue to grow in the foreseeable future as we expand our research  development  contract manufacturing  shared development funding and clinical trial activities  however  those expenses may fluctuate quarter to quarter based on the timing of manufacturing campaigns  accrual of patients in clinical trials and collaborative activities 
general and administrative expenses 
general and administrative expenses  excluding non cash stock based compensation expenses  increased to million in from million in this increase was primarily due to additional administrative personnel 
the number of general and administrative personnel increased to at december  from at december  we anticipate that general and administrative expenses will increase as our costs related to adding personnel in support of our general and administrative operations increase 
non cash stock based compensation expense 
non cash stock based compensation expense decreased to million in from million in this decrease is attributable to the accelerated amortization of deferred stock based compensation  which will decrease in later years as the options vest  and to adjustments to options subject to variable accounting 
variable accounting treatment will result in charges or credits  recorded to non cash stock based compensation  dependent on fluctuations in the market value of our common stock 
we anticipate that non cash stock based compensation expense will decrease based upon scheduled amortizations in accordance with financial accounting standards board interpretation no 
using an accelerated basis over the vesting period of the individual options 
investment income  net 
investment income decreased to million in from million in this decrease is due to lower average balances of cash and cash equivalents  short term and long term investments and restricted investments at lower average interest yields in  compared to higher average balances and higher average interest yields in net loss 
net loss increased to million in from million in as a result of the factors mentioned above 
years ended december  and revenues 
revenues increased to  in from  in revenues in were derived from service and reagent fees of approximately  the earned portion of technology access fees of approximately  and a sbir grant of approximately  in  revenues were derived exclusively from a small business innovative research grant 
research and development expenses 
research and development expenses  excluding non cash stock based compensation expenses  increased to million in from million in this increase was principally due to contract manufacturing expenses of approximately million  increases in rent and occupancy costs related to our new headquarters and operations facility of approximately million  increases in personnel expenses of million and clinical trial costs of approximately  the number of research and development personnel increased to at december  from at december  general and administrative expenses 
general and administrative expenses  excluding non cash stock based compensation expenses  increased to million in from million in this increase was primarily due to additional administrative personnel and other increases attributable to being a public company  including costs related to investor relations programs and directors and officers insurance 
the number of general and administrative personnel increased to at december  from at december  
table of contents non cash stock based compensation expense 
non cash stock based compensation expense increased to million in from million in the increase is attributable to increasing levels of stock option grants and the difference between the deemed fair values as compared to the related exercise prices  reduced by an adjustment to the unvested stock options granted to nonemployees which are subject to variable accounting 
investment income  net 
investment income increased to million in from million in the increase was due to higher average balances of cash and cash equivalents  short term and long term investments and restricted investments primarily from the net proceeds of our initial public offering on march  offset by generally lower interest rates 
net loss 
net loss increased in to million from million in as a result of the factors mentioned above 
liquidity and capital resources we have financed our operations primarily through funding from the issuance of equity securities and collaborative agreements 
for the last three years  we have received cash of approximately million from the net proceeds from our initial public offering and concurrent private placement on march   approximately million from private equity financings  approximately million from investment income  net and approximately million from collaborative research and license agreements  including government grants 
at december   cash  cash equivalents  short term and long term investments totaled million and restricted investments totaled approximately  our cash  cash equivalents  short term and long term investments and restricted investments are held in a variety of interest bearing instruments  consisting of us government and agency securities  high grade us corporate bonds  taxable municipal bonds  mortgage backed securities  commercial paper and money market accounts 
net cash used in operating activities in both and was million 
net cash used in operating activities in was million 
our net losses of million in  million in and million in were adjusted for non cash charges  which were primarily related to amortization of deferred stock compensation  depreciation and changes in operating assets and liabilities 
changes in operating assets and liabilities include deferred revenue 
expenditures in all periods were a result of clinical trials  contract manufacturing  preclinical research and development and general administrative expenses in support of our operations 
in and  we financed a portion of the net cash used to support operating activities from various collaborative sources 
these sources include technology access and license fees  and shared development funding received under our collaboration agreements with eos biotechnology  celltech  genentech and genencor international 
we expect cash used in operating activities to increase in the future as we increase our number of employees  expand our contract manufacturing initiatives and increase the patient enrollments in our clinical trials 
however  we may experience quarterly fluctuations in cash used in operations based on the timing of manufacturing campaigns and cash provided from collaboration activities 
net cash provided by investing activities for the year ended was million compared to net cash used in investing activities of million in and million in cash provided by investing activities in included million from sales and maturities of investments  net of the purchase of investments 
this compared to million from the purchase of investments  net of sales and maturities of investments in and million in purchases of property and equipment were million for the year ended compared to million in and  in capital expenditures in included laboratory equipment of approximately  and computers  leasehold improvements  furniture and fixtures of approximately  in support of employee growth 
capital expenditures in included leasehold improvements of approximately million  laboratory equipment of approximately million and furniture and fixtures of approximately  all in connection with our new headquarters and operations facility 
we expect that our future capital expenditures will decrease in compared to capital expenditures 

table of contents net cash provided by financing activities was million in compared to million in and million in financing activities in consisted primarily of the receipt of million from the private placement of common stock with genencor and million from the private placement of common stock with genentech 
financing activities in included net proceeds of million from our initial public offering  million from our concurrent private placement and from repayment of notes receivable from stockholders 
financing activities during consisted primarily of million from the collection of subscriptions receivable and  from the sale of additional series b convertible preferred stock 
we expect to incur substantial costs as we continue to develop and commercialize our product candidates 
we anticipate that our rate of spending will accelerate as a result of the increased costs and expenses associated with clinical trials  regulatory filings  manufacturing  and research and development collaborations 
however  we may experience fluctuations in incurring these costs from quarter to quarter based on the timing of manufacturing campaigns  accrual of patients to clinical trials and collaborative activities 
our future expenditures and capital requirements will depend on numerous factors  including the progress of our research and development activities  the cost of filing and enforcing any patent claims and other intellectual property rights  competing technological and market developments and our ability to establish license and collaboration agreements 
the following are future minimum contractual commitments for the years subsequent to december  in thousands total thereafter minimum payments under operating leases minimum payments under license and collaboration agreements total our license and collaboration agreements also provide for payments upon the achievement of development or regulatory milestones and the payment of royalties based on commercial product sales 
we do not expect to pay any royalties on net sales of products under any of these agreements for at least the next several years 
the milestone payments could be substantially higher and the royalties could be payable earlier if we file or receive regulatory approvals or achieve commercial sales sooner than expected 
as part of the terms of our office and laboratory lease  we have restricted approximately  of our investments as collateral for certain obligations under the lease 
these investment securities are restricted as to withdrawal and are managed by a third party 
the lease terms provide for changes in the amounts pledged as restricted securities based upon our market capitalization  stockholders equity or cash and investments balance 
in the event that our market capitalization  stockholders equity or cash and investments balance fall below specific thresholds  we will be obligated to increase our restricted investment balance to approximately million 
we believe that our current cash and investment balances will be sufficient to enable us to meet our anticipated expenditures and operating requirements for at least the next months 
we intend to seek additional funding through some or all of the following methods corporate collaborations  licensing arrangements and public or private equity financings 
however  additional capital may not be available on favorable terms or at all 
if we are unable to raise additional funds should we need them  we may be required to delay  reduce or eliminate some of our development programs and some of our clinical trials  which may adversely affect our business and operations 
recent accounting pronouncements in june  the financial accounting standards board the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for asset retirement obligations  or sfas no 
 which addresses financial accounting and reporting for obligations associated with the retirement of tangible 
table of contents long lived assets and the associated asset retirement costs 
sfas requires that the fair value of a liability for an asset retirement obligation be recognized in the period in which it is incurred if a reasonable estimate of fair value can be made 
sfas no 
is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after june  we do not expect the adoption of this statement to have a significant impact on our financial position or results of operations 
in june  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities 
the standard addresses financial accounting and reporting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities and nullifies emerging issues task force  or eitf  issue no 
 liability recognition for certain employee termination benefits and other costs to exit an activity including certain costs incurred in a restructuring 
sfas no 
states that a liability for a cost associated with an exit or disposal activity shall be recognized and measured initially at its fair value in the period in which the liability is incurred  except for a liability for one time termination benefits that are incurred over a period of time 
sfas no 
is effective for exit or disposal activities that are initiated after december  we do not expect the adoption of this statement to have a significant impact on our financial position or results of operations 
in november  the emerging issues task force eitf finalized its consensus on eitf issue  revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables  which provides guidance on the timing and method of revenue recognition for sales arrangements that include the delivery of more than one product or service 
eitf is effective prospectively for arrangements entered into in fiscal periods beginning after june  we are currently assessing the impact of eitf and will adopt this standard in the second quarter of in november  the fasb issued financial accounting standards board interpretation no 
 or fin  guarantor s accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees  including indirect guarantees of indebtedness of others  an interpretation of fasb statement nos 
  and and rescission of fasb interpretation no 
fin requires that upon issuance of a guarantee  the guarantor must recognize a liability for the fair value of the obligation it assumes under that guarantee 
the disclosure provisions of fin are effective for financial statements of periods that end after december  however  the provisions for initial recognition and measurement are effective on a prospective basis for guarantees that are issued or modified after december  we do not expect the adoption of this fasb interpretation to have a significant impact on our financial position or results of operations 
in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure an amendment of fasb statement no 
this statement amends sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  to provide alternative methods of transition for a voluntary change to the fair value based method of accounting for stock based employee compensation 
in addition  this statement amends the disclosure requirements of sfas no 
to require prominent disclosures in both annual and interim financial statements about the method of accounting for stock based employee compensation and the effect of the method used on reported results 
this statement requires that companies having a year end after december  follow the prescribed format and provide the additional disclosures in their annual reports 
the accompanying financial statements include the required disclosures 
we do not believe there will be a significant impact on our financial position or results of operations from the adoption of this new standard unless we were to make a change in our accounting policy and account for all stock option grants as compensation expense 
in january  the fasb issued interpretations no 
 or fin  consolidation of variable interest entities 
fin clarifies the application of accounting research bulletin no 
 consolidated financial statements  to certain entities in which equity investors do not have i the characteristics of a controlling financial interest or ii sufficient at risk equity 
fin no 
applies to a broad rang of unconsolidated investee entities eg joint ventures  partnerships and cost basis investments and  effective for financial statements issued after january   adds certain disclosure requirements 
adoption of this fasb interpretation is not expected to have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations 

table of contents critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements requires us to make estimates  assumptions and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our financial statements 
collaboration and license agreements 
revenues from the sale of products and services are recognized when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred or services have been rendered  the fees are fixed and determinable and collectibility is reasonably assured 
revenues from up front payments  technology license fees and milestone payments received for the delivery of products and services representing the culmination of a separate earnings process are recognized when due and the amounts are judged to be collectible 
revenues from up front payments  technology license fees and milestone payments received in connection with other rights and services  which represent continuing obligations to us  are deferred and recognized ratably over the period term of the agreement 
stock based compensation 
we grant stock options to employees for a fixed number of shares with an exercise price equal to the fair value of our common stock on the date of grant 
we recognize no compensation expense on these employee stock option grants 
we also have  in the past  granted stock options for a fixed number of shares to employees with an exercise price less than the fair value of our common stock on the date of grant 
we recognize the difference between the exercise price and fair value as compensation expense  which is amortized on an accelerated basis over the vesting period of the stock options the intrinsic value method 
for certain stock options granted to nonemployees  we recognize as expense the estimated fair value of such options as calculated by the black scholes option pricing model  which is re measured during the service period 
fair value is determined using allowable methodologies and the expense is amortized over the vesting period of each option or the recipient s contractual arrangement  if shorter 
changes in the fair value of our common stock during the service period will cause fluctuations in recognized compensation expense for variable options 
investments 
our investments are diversified among high credit quality debt securities in accordance with our investment policy 
we classify our investments as available for sale  which are reported at fair market value with the related unrealized gains and losses included as a component of stockholders equity 
realized gains and losses and declines in value of investments judged to be other than temporary are included in other income expense 
the fair value of our investments is subject to volatility 
to date  the carrying values of our investments have not been written down due to declines in value judged to be other than temporary 
declines in the fair value of our investments judged to be other than temporary could adversely affect our future operating results 
income taxes 
we have net deferred tax assets at december  totaling approximately million  which are fully offset by a valuation allowance due to our determination that the criteria for recognition have not been met 
we believe that a full valuation allowance will be required on losses reported in future periods 
in the event we were to determine that we would be able to realize our net deferred tax assets in the future  an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would be made  increasing income or decreasing losses in the period in which such a determination was made 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to collaboration and license agreements  stock based compensation  investments and income taxes 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form our basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from those estimates under different assumptions and conditions 

table of contents subsequent events we have a k plan for all of our employees 
effective february   we implemented a k matching program whereby we contribute fifty cents for each dollar a participant contributes  with a maximum contribution of of the first of a participant s earnings not to exceed of the prescribed annual limit 
in march  we entered into license agreements with genentech pursuant to which we have the right to pursue the development and commercialization of sgn on our own  subject to payment of an up front license fee  a progress dependent milestone payment and royalties on net sales of products that use genentech s technology 
in march  we agreed to secure the majority of our property and equipment as collateral for certain obligations under our office and laboratory lease 
important factors that may affect our business  results of operations and stock price you should carefully consider the risks described below  together with all of the other information included in this annual report on form k and the information incorporated by reference herein 
if we do not effectively address the risks we face  our business will suffer and we may never achieve or sustain profitability 
see management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
this annual report on form k also contains forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in the forward looking statements as a result of factors that are described below and elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
we have a history of net losses 
we expect to continue to incur net losses and may not achieve or maintain profitability for some time  if at all 
our limited operating history may make it difficult to evaluate our business and an investment in our common stock 
we incorporated in july and have a limited operating history upon which an investor may evaluate our operations and future prospects 
we have incurred net losses in each of our years of operation and  as of december   we had an accumulated deficit of approximately million 
we expect to make substantial expenditures to further develop and commercialize our product candidates and anticipate that our rate of spending will accelerate as the result of the increased costs and expenses associated with research  development  clinical trials  manufacturing  regulatory approvals and commercialization of our potential products 
in the near term  we expect our revenues to be derived from milestone payments  technology licensing fees and sponsored research fees under existing and future collaborative arrangements 
in the longer term  our revenues may also include royalties from collaborations with current and future strategic partners and commercial product sales 
however  our revenue and profit potential is unproven and our limited operating history makes our future operating results difficult to predict 
our product candidates are at an early stage of development and  if we are not able to successfully develop and commercialize them  we may not generate sufficient revenues to continue our business operations 
all of our product candidates are in early stages of development 
significant further research and development  financial resources and personnel will be required to develop commercially viable products and obtain regulatory approvals 
currently  sgn and sgn are our only product candidates in clinical trials 
we are also conducting preclinical development  either alone or in collaboration with others  of sgn  sgn and sgn we expect that much of our efforts and expenditures over the next few years will be devoted to these clinical and preclinical product candidates 
we have no products that have received regulatory approval for commercial sale 
our ability to commercialize our product candidates depends on first receiving fda approval 
thereafter  the commercial success of these product candidates will depend upon their acceptance by physicians  patients 
table of contents and other key decision makers as therapeutic and cost effective alternatives to currently available products 
if we fail to gain approval from the fda or to produce a commercially successful product  we may not be able to earn sufficient revenues to continue as a going concern 
we will continue to need significant amounts of additional capital that may not be available to us 
we expect to make additional capital outlays and to increase operating expenditures over the next several years as we hire additional employees and support our preclinical development and clinical trial activities 
we believe that our existing cash and investment securities will be sufficient to fund our operations for at least the next months 
however  changes in our business may occur that would consume available capital resources sooner than we expect 
if adequate funds are not available to us  we will be required to delay  reduce the scope of or eliminate one or more of our development programs 
we do not know whether additional financing will be available when needed  or that  if available  we will obtain financing on terms favorable to our stockholders or us 
to the extent that we raise additional capital by issuing equity securities  our stockholders may experience substantial dilution 
to the extent that we raise additional funds through collaboration and licensing arrangements  we may be required to relinquish some rights to our technologies or product candidates  or grant licenses on terms that are not favorable to us 
clinical trials for our product candidates are expensive  time consuming and their outcome is uncertain 
before we can obtain regulatory approval for the commercial sale of any product candidate that we wish to develop  we are required to complete preclinical development and extensive clinical trials in humans to demonstrate its safety and efficacy 
each of these trials requires the investment of substantial expense and time 
we are currently conducting multiple clinical trials of our two most advanced product candidates  and expect to commence additional trials of these and other product candidates 
there are numerous factors that could delay each of these clinical trials or prevent us from completing these trials successfully 
ongoing and future clinical trials of our product candidates may not show sufficient safety or efficacy to obtain requisite regulatory approvals 
in october  we decided to discontinue clinical trials of sgn and close our sgn program 
we have also completed and closed our clinical trials of sgn in combination with taxotere for the treatment of colon and breast cancer 
we still have only limited clinical data in our ongoing clinical trials of sgn and have seen evidence of gastrointestinal toxicity 
commercialization of our product candidates will ultimately depend upon successful completion of additional research and development and testing in both preclinical models and clinical trials 
at the present time  sgn and sgn are our only product candidates in clinical trials and sgn  sgn and sgn are our only product candidates in preclinical development 
as a result  any delays or difficulties we encounter with these product candidates may impact our ability to generate revenue and cause our stock price to decline significantly 
furthermore  success in preclinical and early clinical trials does not ensure that large scale trials will be successful nor does it predict final results 
acceptable results in early trials may not be repeated in later trials 
a number of companies in the biotechnology industry have suffered significant setbacks in advanced clinical trials  even after promising results in earlier trials 
negative or inconclusive results or adverse medical events during a clinical trial could cause it to be redone or terminated 
in addition  failure to construct appropriate clinical trial protocols could result in the test or control group experiencing a disproportionate number of adverse events and could cause a clinical trial to be redone or terminated 
the length of time necessary to complete clinical trials and to submit an application for marketing approval for a final decision by the fda or another regulatory authority may also vary significantly based on the type  complexity and novelty of the product involved  as well as other factors 

table of contents we may choose to  or may be required to  delay  suspend  repeat or terminate our clinical trials if patient enrollment cannot be achieved on a timely basis or if the trials are not conducted in accordance with regulatory requirements  the results are negative or inconclusive or the trials are not well designed 
clinical trials must be conducted in accordance with the fda s guidelines and are subject to oversight by the fda and institutional review boards at the medical institutions where the clinical trials are conducted 
in addition  clinical trials must be conducted with product candidates produced under the fda s current good manufacturing practices  and may require large numbers of test patients 
patient enrollment is a function of many factors  including the size of the patient population  the proximity of patients to clinical sites  the eligibility criteria for the trial  the existence of competing clinical trials and the availability of alternative or new treatments 
we depend on medical institutions to conduct our clinical trials and to the extent they fail to enroll patients for our clinical trials or are delayed for a significant time in achieving full enrollment  we may be affected by increased costs  program delays or both  which may harm our business 
in addition  we or the fda might delay or halt our clinical trials of a product candidate for various reasons  including deficiencies in the conduct of the clinical trials  the product candidate may have unforeseen adverse side effects  the time required to determine whether the product candidate is effective may be longer than expected  fatalities arising during a clinical trial due to medical problems that may not be related to clinical trial treatments  the product candidate may not appear to be more effective than current therapies  we may have insufficient patient enrollment in the clinical trials  the quality or stability of the product candidate may fall below acceptable standards  or we may not be able to produce sufficient quantities of the product candidate to complete the trials 
due to these and other factors  our current product candidates or any of our other future product candidates could take a significantly longer time to gain regulatory approval than we expect or may never gain approval  which could reduce or eliminate our revenue by delaying or terminating the potential commercialization of our product candidates 
our antibody drug conjugate adc technology is still at an early stage of development and has not yet entered human clinical trials our next generation adc technology  utilizing proprietary stable linkers and highly potent cell killing drugs  is still at an early stage of development 
this adc technology is used in our sgn product candidate and is the basis of our collaborations with eos biotechnology  celltech and genentech 
we and our corporate collaborators are still conducting toxicology  pharmacology  pharmacokinetics and other preclinical studies of these antibody drug conjugates  and significant additional studies will be required before any of these adc product candidates enter human clinical trials 
any failures or setbacks in our adc program could have a detrimental impact on our internal product candidate pipeline and our ability to maintain and or enter into new corporate collaborations regarding this technology  which would negatively affect our business and financial position 
we currently rely on third party manufacturers and other third parties for production of our drug products and our dependence on these manufacturers may impair the development of our product candidates 
we do not currently have the ability to manufacture the drug products that we need to conduct our clinical trials 
for sgn  we presently rely on drug products that were produced and vialed by bristol myers squibb and contract manufacturers retained by bristol myers squibb 
we have entered into  and intend to continue to enter into  agreements with contract manufacturers to supplement our supplies of sgn as necessary  including icos corporation  albany molecular research  inc and gensia sicor pharmaceuticals  inc for our second product candidate in clinical trials  sgn  we have contracted with icos to manufacture preclinical and clinical supplies 
in addition  we currently and will in the future continue to rely on other third parties to perform additional steps in the manufacturing process  including conjugation  vialing and storage of our product candidates 

table of contents for the foreseeable future  we expect to continue to rely on contract manufacturers and other third parties to produce  vial and store sufficient quantities of our product candidates for use in our clinical trials 
if our contract manufacturers or other third parties fail to deliver our product candidates for clinical use on a timely basis  with sufficient quality  and at commercially reasonable prices  and we fail to find replacement manufacturers or to develop our own manufacturing capabilities  we may be required to delay or suspend clinical trials or otherwise discontinue development and production of our product candidates 
contract manufacturers have a limited number of facilities in which our product candidates can be produced 
we currently rely on contract manufacturers to produce our product candidates under fda current good manufacturing practices to meet acceptable standards for our clinical trials 
such standards may change  affecting the ability of contract manufacturers to produce our product candidates on the schedule we require for our clinical trials 
contract manufacturers may not perform or may discontinue their business before the time required by us to successfully produce and market our product candidates 
in some circumstances we rely on collaborators to assist in the research and development activities necessary for the commercialization of our product candidates 
if we are not able to locate suitable collaborators or if our collaborators do not perform as expected  we may not be able to commercialize our product candidates 
we have established and intend to continue to establish alliances with third party collaborators to develop and market some of our current and future product candidates and to license our antibody drug conjugate technology 
these collaborations provide us cash and revenues through technology access and license fees  sponsored research fees  equity sales and potential milestone and royalty payments 
we use these funds to partially fund the development costs of our internal pipeline of product candidates 
collaborations can also create and strengthen our relationships with leading biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies and may provide synergistic benefits by combining our technologies with the technologies of our collaborators 
we currently have a collaboration with genencor regarding our adept technology and co development of our sgn product candidate for the treatment of metastatic melanoma 
in addition we have licensed our adc technology to eos biotechnology  celltech and genentech 
under certain conditions  these collaborators may terminate their agreements with us and discontinue use of our technologies 
for example  genentech recently terminated its rights to develop sgn  which we are now pursuing on our own 
we cannot control the amount and timing of resources our collaborators may devote to products incorporating our technology 
additionally  our relationships with our collaborators divert significant time and effort of our scientific staff and management team and require effective allocation of our resources to multiple internal and collaborative projects 
our collaborators may separately pursue competing products  therapeutic approaches or technologies to develop treatments for the diseases targeted by us or our collaborators 
even if our collaborators continue their contributions to the collaborative arrangements  they may nevertheless determine not to actively pursue the development or commercialization of any resulting products 
our collaborators may fail to perform their obligations under the collaboration agreements or may be slow in performing their obligations 
if any of our collaborators terminate or breach our agreements with them  or otherwise fail to complete their obligations in a timely manner  it may have a detrimental effect on our financial position by reducing or eliminating the potential for us to receive technology access and license fees  milestones and royalties  as well as possibly requiring us to devote additional efforts and incur costs associated with pursuing internal development of product candidates 
furthermore  if our collaborators do not prioritize and commit substantial resources to programs associated with our product candidates  we may be unable to commercialize our product candidates  which would limit our ability to generate revenue and become profitable 
in the future  we may not be able to locate third party collaborators to develop and market our product candidates and we may lack the capital and resources necessary to develop all our product candidates alone 

table of contents we depend on a small number of collaborators for most of our current revenue 
the loss of any one of these collaborators could result in a substantial decline in our revenue 
we have collaborations with a limited number of companies 
to date  almost all of our revenue has resulted from payments made under agreements with our corporate collaborators  and we expect that most of our future revenue will continue to come from corporate collaborations until the approval and commercialization of one or more of our product candidates 
the failure of our collaborators to perform their obligations under their agreements with us  including paying license or technology fees  milestone payments or royalties  could have a material adverse effect on our financial performance 
payments under our existing and future collaboration agreements are also subject to significant fluctuations in both timing and amount  which could cause our revenue to fall below the expectations of securities analysts and investors and cause a decrease in our stock price 
we rely on license agreements for certain aspects of our product candidates and technology 
failure to maintain these license agreements could prevent us from developing or commercializing our product candidates and technology 
we have entered into agreements with third party commercial and academic institutions to license technology for use in our adc technology and product candidates 
currently  we have license agreements with bristol myers squibb  arizona state university  proacta therapeutics  mabtech ab and the university of miami  among others 
some of these license agreements contain diligence and milestone based termination provisions  in which case our failure to meet any agreed upon diligence requirements or milestones may allow the licensor to terminate the agreement 
many of our license agreements grant us exclusive licenses to the underlying technologies 
if our licensors terminate our license agreements or if we are unable to maintain the exclusivity of our exclusive license agreements  we may be unable to continue to develop and commercialize our product candidates 
if we are unable to protect our proprietary technology  trade secrets or know how  we may not be able to operate our business profitably 
similarly  if we fail to sustain and further build our intellectual property rights  competitors may be able to develop competing therapies 
our success depends  in part  on our ability to maintain protection for our products and technologies under the patent laws or other intellectual property laws of the united states  france  germany  japan  united kingdom and italy  as well as other countries 
we have filed several patent applications with the us patent and trademark office for our technologies that are currently pending 
we also have exclusive or partially exclusive rights to issued us patents  foreign counterpart patents and patent applications in the countries listed above relating to our monoclonal antibody based technology 
our rights to these patents are derived from worldwide licenses from bristol myers squibb  arizona state university and proacta therapeutics  among others 
in addition  we have licensed or optioned rights to pending us patent applications and foreign counterpart patents and patent applications to third parties 
the standards which the us patent and trademark office uses to grant patents are not always applied predictably or uniformly and can change 
consequently  the pending patent applications may not be allowed and  if allowed  may not contain the type and extent of patent claims that will be adequate to conduct our business as planned 
additionally  any issued patents may not contain claims that will permit us to stop competitors from using similar technology 
similarly  the standards that courts use to interpret patents are not always applied predictably or uniformly and may evolve  particularly as new technologies develop 
as a result  the protection  if any  given by our patents if we attempt to enforce them or if they are challenged in court is uncertain 
in addition  we rely on certain proprietary trade secrets and know how 
we have taken measures to protect our unpatented trade secrets and know how  including the use of confidentiality and assignment of inventions agreements with our employees  consultants and certain contractors 
it is possible  however  that these persons may breach the agreements or that our competitors may independently develop or otherwise discover our trade secrets 

table of contents we may incur substantial costs and lose important rights as a result of litigation or other proceedings relating to patent and other intellectual property rights 
the defense and prosecution of intellectual property rights  us patent and trademark office interference proceedings and related legal and administrative proceedings in the united states and elsewhere involve complex legal and factual questions 
these proceedings are costly and time consuming 
if we become involved in any litigation  interference or other administrative proceedings  we will incur substantial expense and it will divert the efforts of our technical and management personnel 
an adverse determination may subject us to significant liabilities or require us to seek licenses that may not be available from third parties on commercially reasonable terms  if at all 
we may be restricted or prevented from developing and commercializing our product candidates in the event of an adverse determination in a judicial or administrative proceeding  or if we fail to obtain necessary licenses 
if we lose our key personnel or are unable to attract and retain additional qualified personnel  our future growth and ability to compete would suffer 
we are highly dependent on the efforts and abilities of the principal members of our managerial and scientific staff  particularly dr 
clay b 
siegall  our president and chief executive officer  and dr 
h 
perry fell  our chairman of the board and chief strategy officer 
additionally  we have several scientific personnel with significant and unique expertise in monoclonal antibodies and related technologies 
the loss of the services of principal members of our managerial or scientific staff may prevent us from achieving our business objectives 
the competition for qualified personnel in the biotechnology field is intense  and we rely heavily on our ability to attract and retain qualified scientific  technical and managerial personnel 
our future success depends upon our ability to attract  retain and motivate highly skilled employees 
in order to commercialize our products successfully  we will be required to expand our workforce  particularly in the areas of manufacturing  clinical trials management  regulatory affairs  business development and sales and marketing 
these activities will require the addition of new personnel  including management  and the development of additional expertise by existing management personnel 
we face intense competition for qualified individuals from numerous pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies  as well as academic and other research institutions 
to the extent we are not able to attract and retain these individuals on favorable terms  our business may be harmed 
we face intense competition and rapid technological change  which may result in others discovering  developing or commercializing competing products before or more successfully than we do 
the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries are highly competitive and subject to significant and rapid technological change 
we are aware of several pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies that are actively engaged in research and development in areas related to antibody therapy 
some of these companies have commenced clinical trials of antibody products or have successfully commercialized antibody products 
many of these companies are developing products for the same disease indications as we are 
some of these competitors have received regulatory approval or are developing or testing product candidates that do or may in the future compete directly with our product candidates 
for example  genentech  immunogen  idec pharmaceuticals  medarex and wyeth are developing and or marketing products that may compete with ours 
other potential competitors include large  fully integrated pharmaceutical companies and more established biotechnology companies  which have significant resources and expertise in research and development  manufacturing  testing  obtaining regulatory approvals and marketing 
also  academic institutions  government agencies and other public and private research organizations conduct research  seek patent protection and establish collaborative arrangements for research  development  manufacturing and marketing 
it is possible that these competitors will succeed in developing technologies that are more effective than our product candidates or that would render our technology obsolete or noncompetitive 

table of contents if our competitors develop superior products  manufacturing capability or marketing expertise  our business may fail 
our business may fail because we face intense competition from major pharmaceutical companies and specialized biotechnology companies engaged in the development of other products directed at cancer 
many of our competitors have greater financial and human resources expertise and more experience in the commercialization of product candidates 
our competitors may  among other things develop safer or more effective products  implement more effective approaches to sales and marketing  develop less costly products  obtain quicker regulatory approval  have access to more manufacturing capacity  form more advantageous strategic alliances  or establish superior proprietary positions 
in addition  if we receive regulatory approvals  we may compete with well established  fda approved therapies that have generated substantial sales over a number of years 
we anticipate that we will face increased competition in the future as new companies enter our market and scientific developments surrounding other cancer therapies continue to accelerate 
we have no experience in commercializing products on our own and  to the extent we do not develop this ability or contract with a third party to assist us  we may not be able to successfully sell our product candidates 
we do not have a sales and marketing force and may not be able to develop this capacity 
if we are unable to establish sales and marketing capabilities  we will need to enter into sales and marketing agreements to market our products in the united states 
for sales outside the united states  we plan to enter into third party arrangements 
in these foreign markets  if we are unable to establish successful distribution relationships with pharmaceutical companies  we may fail to realize the full sales potential of our product candidates 
additionally  our product candidates may not gain market acceptance among physicians  patients  healthcare payors and the medical community 
the degree of market acceptance of any approved product candidate will depend on a number of factors  including establishment and demonstration of clinical efficacy and safety  cost effectiveness of a product  its potential advantage over alternative treatment methods  and marketing and distribution support for the product 
moreover  government health administrative authorities  private health insurers and other organizations are increasingly challenging both the need for and the price of new medical products and services 
consequently  uncertainty exists as to the reimbursement status of newly approved therapeutics and diagnostics 
for these and other reasons  physicians  patients  third party payors and the medical community may not accept and utilize any product candidates that we develop and even if they do  reimbursement may not be available for our products to enable us to maintain price levels sufficient to realize an appropriate return on our investment in research and product development 
our stock price may be volatile and our shares may suffer a decline in value 
the market prices for securities of biotechnology companies have in the past been  and are likely to continue in the future to be  very volatile 
for example  during our common stock price fluctuated between and per share 
as a result of fluctuations in the price of our common stock  you may be unable to sell your shares at or above the price you paid for them 
the market price of our common stock may be subject to substantial volatility in response to many risk factors listed in this section  and others beyond our control  including announcements regarding the results of discovery efforts and preclinical and clinical activities by us or our competitors  changes in our existing corporate partnerships or licensing arrangements  establishment of new corporate partnering or licensing arrangements by us or our competitors  our ability to raise capital  developments or disputes concerning our proprietary rights  issuance of new or changed analysts reports and recommendations regarding us or our competitors  share price and volume fluctuations attributable to inconsistent trading volume levels of our shares  changes in government regulations  and economic or other external factors 

table of contents we face product liability risks and may not be able to obtain adequate insurance to protect us against losses 
we currently have no products that have been approved for commercial sale 
however  the current and future use of our product candidates by us and our corporate collaborators in clinical trials  and the sale of any approved products in the future  may expose us to liability claims 
these claims might be made directly by consumers or healthcare providers or indirectly by pharmaceutical companies  our corporate collaborators or others selling such products 
we may experience financial losses in the future due to product liability claims 
we have obtained limited general commercial liability insurance coverage for our clinical trials 
we intend to expand our insurance coverage to include the sale of commercial products if we obtain marketing approval for any of our product candidates 
however  we may not be able to maintain insurance coverage at a reasonable cost or in sufficient amounts to protect us against losses 
if a successful product liability claim or series of claims is brought against us for uninsured liabilities or in excess of insured liabilities  our assets may not be sufficient to cover such claims and our business operations could be impaired 
we may engage in future acquisitions that increase our capital requirements  dilute our stockholders  cause us to incur debt or assume contingent liabilities and subject us to other risks 
we actively evaluate various strategic transactions on an ongoing basis  including licensing or acquiring complementary products  technologies or businesses 
any potential acquisitions may entail numerous risks  including increased operating expenses and cash requirements  assimilation of operations and products  retention of key employees  diversion of our management s attention and uncertainties in our ability to maintain key business relationships of the acquired entities 
in addition  if we undertake acquisitions  we may issue dilutive securities  assume or incur debt obligations  incur large one time expenses and acquire intangible assets that could result in significant future amortization expense 
moreover  we may not be able to locate suitable acquisition opportunities and this inability could impair our ability to grow or obtain access to technology or products that may be important to the development of our business 
our existing stockholders have significant control of our management and affairs  which they could exercise against your best interests 
our executive officers and directors and greater than five percent stockholders  together with entities that may be deemed affiliates of  or related to  such persons or entities  beneficially own approximately percent of our outstanding common stock 
as a result  these stockholders  acting together  may be able to control our management and affairs and matters requiring stockholder approval  including the election of directors and approval of significant corporate transactions  such as mergers  consolidations or the sale of substantially all of our assets 
consequently  this concentration of ownership may have the effect of delaying  deferring or preventing a change in control  including a merger  consolidation  takeover or other business combination involving us or discourage a potential acquirer from making a tender offer or otherwise attempting to obtain control  which might affect the market price of our common stock 
anti takeover provisions could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us 
our board of directors has the authority to issue up to  shares of preferred stock and to determine the price  rights  preferences  privileges and restrictions  including voting rights  of those shares without any further vote or action by the stockholders 
the rights of the holders of common stock may be subject to  and may be adversely affected by  the rights of the holders of any preferred stock that may be issued in the future 
the issuance of preferred stock may have the effect of delaying  deferring or preventing a change of control of seattle genetics without further action by the stockholders and may adversely affect the voting and other rights of the holders of common stock 
further  certain provisions of our charter documents  including provisions eliminating the ability of stockholders to take action by written consent and limiting the ability of stockholders to raise matters at a meeting of stockholders without giving advance notice  may have the effect of delaying or preventing changes in control or management of seattle genetics  which could have an adverse effect on the market price of our stock 
in addition  our charter documents provide for a classified board  which may make it more difficult for a third party to gain control of our board of directors 
similarly  state anti takeover laws in washington related to corporate takeovers may prevent or delay a change of control of seattle genetics
