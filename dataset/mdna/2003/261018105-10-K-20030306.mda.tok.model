item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations certain statements under this caption constitute forward looking statements under the private securities litigation reform act of which involve risks and uncertainties 
our actual results may differ significantly from the results discussed in such forward looking statements 
factors that might cause such a difference include  but are not limited to  economic conditions  competition in the geographic and business areas in which we conduct our operations  fluctuations in interest rates  credit quality and government regulation 
for additional information concerning these factors  see business factors that may affect future results of operations on page overview our net income for totaled million or per share on a diluted basis  down from last year s record of million or per share  but second highest in downey s history 
during the year  we repurchased  shares of common stock at an average price per share of  leaving million of the million authorization available for future share repurchases 
the decline in our net income between years reflected lower net income from our banking operations  as net income from our real estate operations increased million to million due primarily to higher gains from sales and lower operating expense 
net income from our banking operations totaled million  down million due to the following o a million higher loss from loan servicing due primarily to higher provisions to the valuation allowance for mortgage servicing rights reflecting the continued decline in market interest rates that increased the actual and expected rate of prepayments on loans we service for others  o a million increase in operating expense due to higher costs associated with the increased number of branch locations and higher loan origination activity  and o a million decline in loan related fees due to lower prepayment fees 
those unfavorable items were partially offset by the following o a million increase in net gains on sales of loans and mortgage backed securities due to a record volume of sales and the favorable impact from the sfas valuation of derivatives associated with the sale of loans  o a million increase in net interest income due to higher interest earning assets  o a million increase in deposit related fees  and o a million decline in provision for loan losses

our single family loan originations increased from billion in to a record billion in  of which billion were originated for sale in the secondary market 
of the total  billion represented originations of loans for portfolio  of which million were subprime credits 
in addition to single family loans  we originated million of other loans during the year  including million of construction and land loans 
our assets increased million or during to billion at year end  following a increase during we primarily funded our asset growth with deposits that increased million or to a record year end level of billion at december  non performing assets totaled million at december   down from million a year ago 
the decrease was due primarily to a decline in our residential non performers 
when measured as a percentage of total assets  our non performing assets dropped from at year end to at year end at december   the bank exceeded all regulatory capital tests  with capital to asset ratios of for both tangible and core capital and for risk based capital 
these capital levels are significantly above the well capitalized standards defined by the federal banking regulators of for core and tangible capital and for risk based capital

our significant accounting policies are described in the notes to the consolidated financial statements beginning on page certain accounting policies require us to make significant estimates and assumptions which have a material impact on the carrying value of certain assets and liabilities  and we consider these to be critical accounting policies 
the estimates and assumptions we use are based on historical experience and other factors  which we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results could differ significantly from these estimates and assumptions which could have a material impact on the carrying value of assets and liabilities at the balance sheet dates and our results of operations for the reporting periods 
we believe the following are critical accounting policies that require the most significant estimates and assumptions that are particularly susceptible to significant change in the preparation of our financial statements o allowance for losses on loans and real estate 
for further information  see financial condition problem loans and real estate allowance for losses on loans and real estate on page and note of notes to the consolidated financial statements on page o valuation of mortgage servicing rights

results of operations net interest income net interest income is the difference between the interest and dividends earned on loans  mortgage backed securities and investment securities interest earning assets and the interest paid on deposits  borrowings and capital securities interest bearing liabilities 
the spread between the yield on interest earning assets and the cost of interest bearing liabilities and the relative dollar amounts of these assets and liabilities principally affects net interest income 
our net interest income totaled million in  up million or from and million or greater than the improvement during reflected higher interest earning assets  as our effective interest rate spread was unchanged 
our average interest earning assets increased by million or to billion 
our effective interest rate spread averaged in both and  up from in the following table presents for the years indicated the total dollar amount of o interest income from average interest earning assets and the resultant yields  and o interest expense on average interest bearing liabilities and the resultant costs  expressed as rates 
the table also sets forth our net interest income  interest rate spread and effective interest rate spread 
the effective interest rate spread reflects the relative level of interest earning assets to interest bearing liabilities and equals o the difference between interest income on interest earning assets and interest expense on interest bearing liabilities  divided by o average interest earning assets for the year 
the table also sets forth our net interest earning balance the difference between the average balance of interest earning assets and the average balance of total deposits  borrowings and capital securities for the years indicated 
we included non accrual loans in the average interest earning assets balance 
we included interest from non accrual loans in interest income only to the extent we received payments and to the extent we believe we will recover the remaining principal balance of the loans

changes in our net interest income are a function of both changes in rates and changes in volumes of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities

provision for loan losses provision for loan losses was million in  down from million in and million in the decrease is due primarily to an improvement in asset quality from a year ago 
for further information  see financial condition problem loans and real estate allowance for losses on loans and real estate on page other income our total other income was million in  down from million in  but up from million in the decline in our other income in was primarily due to a larger addition to the valuation allowance for mortgage servicing rights 
the addition was reflected within the category of loan servicing loss and was necessary due to the drop in long term interest rates  which resulted in an increase in the actual and projected rate at which loans serviced for others are expected to prepay  thereby shortening their expected average life 
in addition  the decline in long term interest rates reduced the expected value of associated custodial accounts 
the pre tax addition was million  up from million during and million during excluding the valuation allowances additions  our total other income would have been million in  up million or from the adjusted level and up million or from the adjusted level 
this adjusted increase was primarily due to the following o a million increase in net gains on sales of loans and mortgage backed securities  o a million increase in income from real estate held for investment due to higher gains from sales  and o a million increase in deposit related fees 
those favorable items were partially offset by a million decline in loan related fees and a million increase in the adjusted loss associated with our loan servicing activity 
total other income increased million during due primarily to a million increase in loan and deposit related fees and a million increase in net gains on sales of loans  mortgage backed securities and mortgage servicing rights 
those favorable items were partially offset by the absence of a million pre tax gain associated with our sale of the indirect automobile finance subsidiary in  an increase of million in loan servicing losses as well as a decline of million in income from real estate held for investment 
below is a further discussion of the major other income categories 
loan and deposit related fees loan and deposit related fees totaled million in  down from million in  but up from million in our current year loan related fees declined million from  due to a decline in loan prepayment fees 
this decline was partially offset by a million or increase in our deposit related fees  primarily due to higher fees from our checking accounts

excluding the valuation additions  we incurred a loss of million in in the loan servicing category  compared to a loss of million in when a loan we service for others prepays  we benefit from the use of those proceeds from the time of repayment until we are required to remit the funds to the investor 
that benefit results in a reduction of our borrowing costs within net interest income 
most of our loan servicing agreements  however  require us to pay interest to the investor up to the date we remit funds to them 
therefore  when the loan prepays  we remit to the investor more interest than we collect from the borrower 
that additional interest cost  which we call pay off and curtailment interest losses  appears as a reduction to income from servicing activities and totaled million in  up from million in and million in at december   we serviced billion of loans for others  compared to billion at december   and billion at december  the following table presents a breakdown of the components of our loan servicing loss for the years indicated

we originate one to four unit residential adjustable rate mortgages both with and without loan origination fees 
in adjustable rate mortgage transactions for which we charge no origination fees  we receive a larger margin over the index to which the loan pricing is tied than in those in which we charge fees 
in addition  a prepayment fee on these loans is generally required if prepaid within the first three years 
this trend towards loans with no origination fees has generally resulted in deferrable loan origination costs exceeding loan origination fees

the associated fair value changes to the notional amount of the derivative instrument are recorded on balance sheet 
for further information regarding our derivative instruments  see asset liability management and market risk on page  capital resources and liquidity contractual obligations and other commitments on page and note of notes to the consolidated financial statements on page we also utilize financial instruments with off balance sheet risk in the normal course of business to meet the financing needs of our customers 
these financial instruments include commitments to originate fixed and variable rate mortgage loans held for investment  commitments to purchase loans and mortgage backed securities for our portfolio  letters of credit  lines of credit and loans in process

for further information regarding these commitments  see asset liability management and market risk on page  capital resources and liquidity contractual obligations and other commitments on page and note of notes to the consolidated financial statements on page we use the same credit policies in making commitments to originate loans  lines of credit and letters of credit as we do for on balance sheet instruments 
for commitments to originate loans held for investment  the contract amounts represent exposure to loss from market fluctuations as well as credit loss 
in regard to these commitments  adverse changes from market fluctuations are generally not hedged 
downey controls the credit risk of its commitments to originate loans held for investment through credit approvals  limits and monitoring procedures 
we do not dispose of troubled loans or problem assets by means of unconsolidated special purpose entities

loans to our executive officers and directors were made in the ordinary course of business and were made on substantially the same terms as comparable transactions 
asset liability management and market risk market risk is the risk of loss from adverse changes in market prices and interest rates 
our market risk arises primarily from interest rate risk in our lending and deposit taking activities 
this interest rate risk primarily occurs to the degree that our interest bearing liabilities reprice or mature on a different basis generally more rapidly than our interest earning assets 
since our earnings depend primarily on our net interest income  which is the difference between the interest and dividends earned on interest earning assets and the interest paid on interest bearing liabilities  our principal objectives are to actively monitor and manage the effects of adverse changes in interest rates on net interest income while maintaining asset quality 
our primary strategy to manage interest rate risk is to emphasize the origination of adjustable rate mortgages or loans with relatively short maturities 
interest rates on adjustable rate mortgages are primarily tied to cofi and mta 
in addition to the market risk associated with our lending and deposit taking activities  we also have market risk associated with our secondary marketing activities 
changes in mortgage interest rates  primarily fixed rate mortgages  impact the fair value of loans held for sale as well as our interest rate lock commitment derivatives  where we have committed to an interest rate with a potential borrower for a loan we intend to sell 
our objective is to hedge against fluctuations in interest rates through use of forward sale and purchase contracts with government sponsored enterprises and whole loan sale contracts with various parties 
these contracts are typically obtained at the time the interest rate lock commitments are made 
therefore  as interest rates fluctuate  the changes in the fair value of our interest rate lock commitments and loans held for sale tend to be offset by changes in the fair value of the hedge contracts 
the method used for assessing the effectiveness of a hedging derivative  as well as the measurement approach for determining the ineffective aspects of the hedge  is established at the inception of the hedge 
although we continue to hedge as previously done  sfas  as applied to our risk management strategies  may increase or decrease reported net income and stockholders equity  depending on levels of interest rates and other variables affecting the fair values of derivative instruments and hedged items  but will have no effect on the overall economics of the transactions 
we generally do not enter into hedging contracts for speculative purposes 
changes in mortgage interest rates also impact the value of our mortgage servicing rights 
rising interest rates typically result in slower prepayment speeds on the loans being serviced for others which increase the value of mortgage servicing rights 
declining interest rates typically result in faster prepayment speeds which decrease the value of mortgage servicing rights 
currently  we do not hedge our mortgage servicing rights against that risk 
our asset liability management committee is responsible for implementing the interest rate risk management policy which sets forth limits established by the board of directors of acceptable changes in net interest income and net portfolio value from specified changes in interest rates 
the ots defines net portfolio value as the present value of expected net cash flows from existing assets minus the present value of expected net cash flows from existing liabilities plus the present value of expected cash flows from existing off balance sheet contracts 
our asset liability management committee reviews  among other items  economic conditions  the interest rate outlook  the demand for loans  the availability of deposits and borrowings  and our current operating results  liquidity  capital and interest rate exposure 
in addition  our asset liability management committee monitors asset and liability maturities and repricing characteristics on a regular basis and performs various simulations and other analyses to determine the potential impact of various business strategies in controlling interest rate risk and the potential impact of those strategies upon future earnings under various interest rate scenarios 
based on these reviews  our asset liability management committee formulates a strategy that is intended to implement the objectives set forth in our business plan without exceeding the net interest income and net portfolio value limits set forth in our interest rate risk policy 
one measure of our exposure to differential changes in interest rates between assets and liabilities is shown in the following table which sets forth the repricing frequency of our major asset and liability categories as of december   as well as other information regarding the repricing and maturity differences between our interest earning assets and total deposits  borrowings and capital securities in future periods 
we refer to these differences as gap 
we have determined the repricing frequencies by reference to projected maturities  based upon contractual maturities as adjusted for scheduled repayments and repricing mechanisms provisions for changes in the interest and dividend rates of assets and liabilities 
we assume prepayment rates on substantially all of our loan portfolio based upon our historical loan prepayment experience and anticipated future prepayments 
repricing mechanisms on a number of our assets are subject to limitations  such as caps on the amount that interest rates and payments on our loans may adjust  and accordingly  these assets do not normally respond to changes in market interest rates as completely or rapidly as our liabilities 
the interest rate sensitivity of our assets and liabilities illustrated in the following table would vary substantially if we used different assumptions or if actual experience differed from the assumptions set forth

subject to immediate repricing 
our six month gap at december  was a positive 
this means that more interest earning assets mature or reprice within six months than total deposits  borrowings and capital securities 
this compares to a positive six month gap of at december  and at december  we originated and purchased approximately billion during and billion during both and of loans and mortgage backed securities with adjustable interest rates or maturities of five years or less 
these loans represented approximately during both and  and during of all loans and mortgage backed securities originated and purchased for investment during these periods 
at december   essentially all of our interest earning assets mature  reprice or are estimated to prepay within five years  compared to at december  and at december  at december   loans held for investment and mortgage backed securities with adjustable interest rates represented of those portfolios 
during  we will continue to offer residential fixed rate loan products to our customers to meet customer demand 
we primarily originate fixed rate loans for sale in the secondary market and price them accordingly to create loan servicing income and to increase opportunities for originating adjustable rate mortgages 
however  we may originate fixed rate loans for investment when funded with long term funds to mitigate interest rate risk and small volumes to facilitate the sale of real estate acquired through foreclosure or that meet required yield and other approved guidelines 
for further information  see business banking activities lending activities secondary marketing and loan servicing activities on page we are better protected against rising interest rates with a positive six month gap 
however  we remain subject to possible interest rate spread compression  which would adversely impact our net interest income if interest rates rise 
this is primarily due to the lag in repricing of the indices to which our adjustable rate loans and mortgage backed securities are tied  as well as the repricing frequencies and periodic interest rate caps on these adjustable rate loans and mortgage backed securities 
the amount of such interest rate spread compression would depend upon the frequency and severity of such interest rate fluctuations 
in addition to measuring interest rate risk via a gap analysis  we establish limits on  and measure the sensitivity of  our net interest income and net portfolio value to changes in interest rates 
changes in interest rates are defined as instantaneous and sustained movements in interest rates in basis point increments 
we utilize an internally maintained asset liability management simulation model to make the calculations which  for net portfolio value  are calculated on a discounted cash flow basis 
first  we estimate our net interest income for the next twelve months and the current net portfolio value assuming no change in interest rates from those at period end 
once the base case has been estimated  we make calculations for each of the defined changes in interest rates  to include any associated differences in the anticipated prepayment speed of loans 
we then compare those results against the base case to determine the estimated change to net interest income and net portfolio value due to the changes in interest rates 
the following are the estimated impacts to net interest income and net portfolio value from various instantaneous  parallel shifts in interest rates based upon our asset and liability structure as of year ends and since we base these estimates upon numerous assumptions  like the expected maturities of our interest bearing assets and liabilities and the shape of the period end interest rate yield curve  our actual sensitivity to interest rate changes could vary significantly if actual experience differs from those assumptions used in making the calculations 
percentage change in percentage change in change in interest rates net interest net portfolio net interest net portfolio in basis points income value income value n a n a the percentage change in this column represents net interest income for months in a stable interest rate environment versus the net interest income in the various rate scenarios 
the percentage change in this column represents the net portfolio value of the bank in a stable interest rate environment versus the net portfolio value in the various rate scenarios 
the change in interest rates for is not applicable due to the low level of interest rates at december  the following table shows our financial instruments that are sensitive to changes in interest rates  categorized by expected maturity  and the instruments fair values at december  this data differs from that in the gap table as it does not incorporate the repricing characteristics of assets and liabilities 
rather  it only reflects contractual maturities adjusted for anticipated prepayments 
market risk sensitive instruments are generally defined as on and off balance sheet derivatives and other financial instruments 
our assets and liabilities that do not have a stated maturity date  such as certain deposits  are considered to be long term in nature and are reported in the thereafter column 
we do not consider these financial instruments to be materially sensitive to interest rate fluctuations  and historically  the balances have remained fairly constant over various economic conditions 
the weighted average interest rates for the various fixed rate and variable rate assets and liabilities presented are based on the actual rates that existed at december  the fair value of our financial instruments is determined as follows o fed funds and fhlb stock equal their book values due to their short maturities 
o investment securities and mortgage backed securities are based on the closing market price quotations from financial market monitoring firms 
o loans held for sale are based on bid quotations from financial market monitoring firms 
o loans held for investment takes into consideration discounted cash flows through the estimated maturity or repricing dates using estimated market discount rates 
o demand deposits  money market and savings accounts are equal to their book values 
o time deposits and borrowings are based on the discounted value of contractual cash flows  which is estimated using wholesale borrowing rates offered for similar terms 
the degree of market risk inherent in loans with prepayment features may not be completely reflected in the disclosures 
although we have taken into consideration our historical prepayment trends to determine expected maturity categories  prepayment features are triggered by changes in the market rates of interest 
unexpected changes may increase the rate of prepayments above those anticipated 
as such  the potential loss from such market rate changes may be significantly larger

our non performing assets totaled million at december   compared to million at december  and million at december  the decrease in our non performing assets during was primarily attributed to declines in our residential one to four unit prime category of million and subprime category of million 
other non accrual loans declined by million during the current year primarily due to a decline in commercial real estate non performers as a result of a short pay that was accepted in full consideration of the loan 
of the total  real estate acquired in settlement of loans represented million at december   down from million at december   but up from million at december  our non performing assets as a percentage of total assets was at year end  compared to at year end and at year end the following table summarizes our non performing assets at the dates indicated

it is our policy to take appropriate  timely and aggressive action when necessary to resolve non performing assets 
when resolving problem loans  it is our policy to determine collectibility under various circumstances which are intended to result in our maximum financial benefit 
we accomplish this by either working with the borrower to bring the loan current or by foreclosing and selling the asset 
we perform ongoing reviews of loans that display weaknesses and maintain adequate loss allowances on the loans 
for a discussion on our internal asset review policy  refer to allowance for losses on loans and real estate on page all but million of our non performing assets at december  were located in california  compared to million outside of california a year ago 
we evaluate the need for appraisals of non performing assets on a periodic basis 
we will generally obtain a new appraisal when we believe that there may have been an adverse change in the property operations or in the economic conditions of the geographic market of the property securing our loans 
our policy is to obtain new appraisals at least annually for all real estate acquired in settlement of loans 
non accrual loans 
it is our general policy to account for a loan as non accrual when the loan becomes days delinquent or when collection of interest appears doubtful 
in a number of cases  loans may remain on accrual status past days when we determine that continued accrual is warranted because the loan is well secured and in process of collection 
as of december   we had no loans days or more delinquent which remained on accrual status 
we reverse and charge against interest income any interest previously accrued with respect to non accrual loans 
we recognize interest income on non accrual loans to the extent that we receive payments and to the extent that we believe we will recover the remaining principal balance of the loan 
we restore these loans to an accrual status only if all past due payments are made by the borrower and the borrower has demonstrated the ability to make future payments of principal and interest 
at december   non accrual loans aggregating million were less than days delinquent relative to their contractual terms 
troubled debt restructurings 
we consider a restructuring of a debt a troubled debt restructuring when we  for economic or legal reasons related to the borrower s financial difficulties  grant a concession to the borrower that we would not otherwise grant 
troubled debt restructurings may include changing repayment terms  reducing the stated interest rate or reducing the amounts of principal and or interest due or extending the maturity date 
the restructuring of a loan is intended to recover as much of our investment as possible and to achieve the highest yield possible 
at december   we had no troubled debt restructurings on accrual status 
real estate acquired in settlement of loans 
real estate acquired in settlement of loans consists of real estate acquired through foreclosure or deeds in lieu of foreclosure and totaled million at december  delinquent loans when a borrower fails to make required payments on a loan and does not cure the delinquency within days  we normally record a notice of default to commence foreclosure proceedings  so long as we have given any required prior notice to the borrower 
if the loan is not reinstated within the time permitted by law for reinstatement  which is normally five business days prior to the date set for the non judicial trustee s sale  we may then sell the property at a foreclosure sale 
in general  if we have elected to pursue a non judicial foreclosure  we are not permitted under applicable law to obtain a deficiency judgment against the borrower  even if the security property is insufficient to cover the balance owed 
at these foreclosure sales  we generally acquire title to the property 
at december   loans delinquent days or more as a percentage of total loans was  down from at year end but up from at year end the decrease from prior year occurred in every one of the delinquent categories  most notably within our residential one to four unit categories 
as a percentage of its loan category  residential one to four units decreased from at year end to at year end  while subprime residential one to four units decreased from at year end to at year end a higher incidence of delinquency is expected on subprime loans as these borrowers have a history of delinquencies for which we charge higher interest rates to compensate for that risk 
in addition  the loan to value ratio on these loans is generally lower thereby providing more equity protection against loss 
the following table indicates the amounts of our past due loans at the dates indicated

allowance for losses on loans and real estate we maintain a valuation allowance for losses on loans and real estate to provide for losses inherent in those portfolios 
the adequacy of the allowance is evaluated quarterly by management to maintain the allowance at levels sufficient to provide for inherent losses 
a key component to our evaluation is our internal asset review process 
our internal asset review department conducts independent reviews to evaluate the risk and quality of all our assets 
our internal asset review committee is responsible for the review and classification of assets 
the internal asset review committee members include the chief internal asset review officer  chief executive officer  chief financial officer  chief administrative officer  chief lending officer  general counsel and director of compliance risk management 
the internal asset review committee meets quarterly to review and to determine asset classifications and to recommend any changes to asset valuation allowances 
with the exception of payoffs or asset sales  the classification of an asset  once established  can be removed or upgraded only upon approval of the internal asset review committee 
the chief internal asset review officer reports quarterly to the audit committee of the board of directors regarding overall asset quality  the adequacy of valuation allowances on classified assets and our adherence to policies and procedures regarding asset classification and valuation 
we adhere to an internal asset review system and loss allowance methodology designed to provide for timely recognition of problem assets and adequate general valuation allowances to cover asset losses 
our current asset monitoring process includes the use of asset classifications to segregate the assets  largely loans and real estate  into various risk categories 
we use the various asset classifications as a means of measuring risk for determining the valuation allowance at a point in time 
we currently use a six grade system to classify our assets 
the current grades are o pass  o watch  o special mention  o substandard  o doubtful  and o loss 
we consider substandard  doubtful and loss assets classified assets for regulatory purposes 
a brief description of these classifications follows o the pass classification represents a level of credit quality which contains no well defined deficiency or weakness 
o the watch classification is used to identify an asset that currently contains no well defined deficiency or weakness  but it is determined to be desirable to closely monitor the asset eg  loans to facilitate the sale of real estate acquired in settlement of loans 
this category may also be used for assets upgraded from lower classifications where continuing monitoring is deemed appropriate 
o a special mention asset does not currently expose us to a sufficient degree of risk to warrant an adverse classification  but does possess a correctable deficiency or potential weakness deserving management s close attention 
o substandard assets have a well defined weakness or weaknesses 
they are characterized by the distinct possibility that we will sustain some loss if the deficiencies are not corrected 
o an asset classified doubtful has all the weaknesses inherent in those classified substandard with the added characteristic that the weaknesses make collection or liquidation in full  on the basis of currently existing facts  conditions and values  highly questionable and improbable 
we consider doubtful to be a temporary classification until resolution of pending weakness issues enables us to more clearly define the potential for loss 
o that portion of an asset classified as loss is considered uncollectible and of so little value that its continuance as an asset  without establishment of a specific valuation allowance  is not warranted 
a loss classification does not mean that an asset has absolutely no recovery or salvage value  but rather it is not reasonable to defer writing off or providing for all or a portion of an impaired asset even though partial recovery may be effected in the future 
we will generally classify as loss the balance of the asset that is greater than the net fair value of the asset unless we can expect payment from another source 
therefore  the amount of an asset classified as loss reflects the total of specific valuation allowances established for the particular asset 
specific valuation allowances are not includable in determining the bank s total regulatory capital 
the ots has the authority to require us to change our asset classifications 
if the change results in an asset being classified in whole or in part as loss  a specific allowance must be established against the amount so classified or that amount must be charged off 
ots guidelines set forth quantitative benchmarks as a starting point for the determination of appropriate levels of general valuation allowances 
the ots directs its examiners to rely on management s estimates of adequate general valuation allowances if the bank s process for determining adequate allowances is deemed to be sound 
the allowances for losses on loans and real estate are maintained at an amount management deems adequate to cover inherent losses 
we have implemented and adhere to an internal asset review system and loan loss allowance methodology designed to provide for the detection of problem assets and an adequate allowance to cover loan losses 
in determining the allowance for loan losses related to specific large loans loans over million  we evaluate the allowance on an individual loan basis  including an analysis of the creditworthiness  cash flows and financial status of the borrower  and the condition and the estimated value of the collateral 
we review all loans under million by analyzing their performance and composition of their collateral as a whole because of the relatively homogeneous nature of the portfolios 
given the above evaluations  the amount of the allowance is based upon the summation of general valuation allowances  allocated allowances and an unallocated allowance 
we utilize the asset classifications from our internal asset review process in the following manner to determine the amount of our allowances o general valuation allowances this element relates to assets with no well defined deficiency or weakness ie  assets classified pass or watch and takes into consideration loss that is imbedded within the portfolio but has not yet been realized 
generally  we believe that borrowers are impacted by events well in advance of a lender s knowledge that may ultimately result in loan default and eventual loss 
examples of such loss causing events would be borrower job loss  divorce or medical crisis in the case of single family residential and consumer loans  or loss of a major tenant in the case of commercial real estate loans 
general valuation allowances are determined by applying factors that take into consideration past loss experience and asset duration for each major asset type to the associated asset balance 
o allocated allowances this element relates to assets with well defined deficiencies or weaknesses ie  assets classified special mention  substandard  doubtful or loss 
we calculate on an ongoing basis loss by credit classification for each major asset type 
factors based upon those loss statistics are applied against current classified asset balances to determine the amount of allocated allowances 
included in these allowances are those amounts associated with assets where it is probable that the value of the asset has been impaired and the loss can be reasonably estimated 
if we determine our carrying value of the asset exceeds the net fair value and no alternative payment source exists  then a specific allowance is recorded for the amount of that difference 
o unallocated allowance this element is more subjective and is reviewed quarterly to take into consideration estimation errors and economic trends that are not necessarily captured in determining the general valuation and allocated allowances

impaired loans 
we consider a loan to be impaired when  based upon current information and events  we believe it is probable that we will be unable to collect all amounts due according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement 
we carry impaired loans at either the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the loan s effective interest rate or at the loan s observable market price or the net fair value of the collateral securing the loan 
impaired loans exclude large groups of smaller balance homogeneous loans that we collectively evaluate for impairment 
for us  loans we collectively review for impairment include all single family loans and performing multi family and non residential loans having principal balances of less than million 
in determining impairment  we consider large non homogeneous loans with the following characteristics non accrual loans  debt restructurings and performing loans which exhibit  among other characteristics  high loan to value ratios or delinquent taxes 
we base the measurement of collateral dependent impaired loans on the fair value of the loan s collateral 
we value non collateral dependent loans based on a present value calculation of expected future cash flows  discounted at the loan s effective rate 
we generally use cash receipts on impaired loans not performing according to contractual terms to reduce the carrying value of the loan  unless we believe we will recover the remaining principal balance of the loan 
we include impairment losses in the allowance for loan losses through a charge to provision for loan losses 
we include adjustments to impairment losses due to changes in the fair value of the collateral of impaired loans in provision for loan losses 
upon disposition of an impaired loan  we record loss of principal through a charge off to the allowance for loan losses 
the recorded investment in loans for which we have recognized impairment totaled million at december  during  that amount increased but by year end had declined back to million as a short pay was accepted in full consideration of a commercial real estate loan 
the total allowance for losses related to these loans was million for both december  and during  the total interest recognized on the impaired portfolio was million  compared to million in for further information regarding impaired loans  see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements on page the following table summarizes the activity in our allowance for loan losses associated with impaired loans during the years indicated 
in thousands balance at beginning of period  provision reduction  charge offs  recoveries balance at end of period the provision of million during and resultant million charge off relates to the previously mentioned commercial real estate loan for which a short pay was accepted in full consideration 
in addition to losses charged against the allowance for loan losses  we have maintained a valuation allowance for losses on real estate and joint ventures held for investment 
the provision reductions in all years were  in general  due to a continuing improvement in the real estate market which favorably impacted the valuation of certain neighborhood shopping center investments and to a reduction in the investment in certain joint venture investments 
the following table summarizes the activity in our allowance for real estate and joint ventures held for investment during the years indicated 
in thousands balance at beginning of period      provision reduction   charge offs    recoveries balance at end of period     we have recorded losses on real estate acquired in settlement of loans by direct write off to net operations of real estate acquired in settlement of loans and against an allowance for losses specifically established for these assets 
as of september   we ceased maintaining an allowance for real estate acquired in settlement of loans as we record the related individual assets at the lower of cost or fair value 
the following table summarizes the activity of our allowance for real estate acquired in settlement of loans during the years indicated 
in thousands balance at beginning of period provision reduction charge offs recoveries balance at end of period capital resources and liquidity our sources of funds include deposits  advances from the fhlb and other borrowings  proceeds from the sale of loans  mortgage backed securities and real estate  payments of loans and mortgage backed securities and payments for and sales of loan servicing  and income from other investments 
interest rates  real estate sales activity and general economic conditions significantly affect repayments on loans and mortgage backed securities and deposit inflows and outflows 
our primary sources of funds generated during were from o principal repayments including prepayments  but excluding our refinances of our existing loans on loans and mortgage backed securities of billion  o sales of mortgage backed securities available for sale of billion  o an increase in deposits of million  o maturities and sales of us treasury securities  agency obligations and other investment securities available for sale of million  and o a net increase in fhlb advances and other borrowings of million 
we used these funds for the following purposes o to originate and purchase loans held for investment  excluding refinances of our existing loans  of billion  o to purchase mortgage backed securities available for sale of billion  o to purchase us treasury securities  agency obligations and other investment securities available for sale of million  and o to increase our loans held for sale a net million 
our principal source of liquidity is our ability to utilize borrowings  as needed 
our primary source of borrowings is the fhlb 
at december   our fhlb borrowings totaled billion  representing of total assets 
we currently are approved by the fhlb to borrow up to of total assets to the extent we provide qualifying collateral and hold sufficient fhlb stock 
that approved limit would have permitted us  as of year end  to borrow an additional billion 
to the extent deposit growth falls short of satisfying ongoing commitments to fund maturing and withdrawable deposits  repay maturing borrowings  fund existing and future loans  make investments  and continue branch improvement programs  we will utilize our fhlb borrowing arrangement or possibly other sources 
as of december   we had commitments to borrowers for short term rate locks of million  undisbursed loan funds and unused lines and letters of credit of million  and other contingent liabilities of million 
we believe our current sources of funds  including repayments of existing loans  enable us to meet our obligations while maintaining liquidity at appropriate levels 
another measure of liquidity in the savings and loan industry is the ratio of cash and eligible investments to the sum of withdrawable savings and borrowings due within one year 
at december   the bank s ratio was  compared to at both december  and the holding company currently has adequate liquid assets to meet its obligations and can obtain further funds by means of dividends from subsidiaries  subject to certain limitations  or issuance of further debt or equity 
at december   the holding company s liquid assets  including due from bank interest bearing balances  totaled million 
on july   the board of directors of downey authorized a share repurchase program of up to million of downey s common stock 
to fund this program  the bank paid a special million dividend during the year to the holding company 
the shares are being repurchased from time to time in open market transactions 
the timing  volume and price of purchases will be made at the discretion of downey  and will also be contingent upon downey s overall financial condition  as well as market conditions in general 
during the current year   shares were repurchased at an average price of and  at year end  million of the original authorization remains available for future purchases 
stockholders equity totaled million at december   up from million at december  and million at december  contractual obligations and other commitments through the normal course of operations  we have entered into certain contractual obligations and other commitments 
our obligations generally relate to funding of our operations through deposits and borrowings as well as leases for premises and equipment  and our commitments generally relate to our lending operations 
we enter into derivative financial instruments as part of our interest rate risk management process  primarily related to our sale of loans in the secondary market 
for further information regarding our derivative instruments  see asset liability management and market risk on page and note of notes to the consolidated financial statements on page commitments to originate fixed and variable rate mortgage loans are agreements to lend to a customer as long as there is no violation of any condition established in the commitment 
commitments generally have fixed expiration dates or other termination clauses and may require payment of a fee 
since some of the commitments may expire without being drawn upon  the total commitment amounts do not necessarily represent future cash requirements 
the credit risk involved in issuing lines and letters of credit requires the same creditworthiness evaluation as that involved in extending loan facilities to customers 
downey evaluates each customer s creditworthiness on a case by case basis 
undisbursed loan funds and unused lines of credit include home equity lines of credit and funds not disbursed  but committed to construction and commercial lending by the bank 
we have obligations under long term operating leases  principally for building space and land 
lease terms generally cover a five year period  with options to extend  and are non cancelable 
standby letters of credit are conditional commitments issued by the bank to guarantee the performance of a customer to a third party 
downey receives collateral to support commitments for which collateral is deemed necessary 
the most significant categories of collateral include real estate properties underlying mortgage loans  liens on personal property and cash on deposit with downey 
at december   scheduled maturities of certificates of deposit and fhlb advances  secondary marketing activities  loans held for investment and future operating minimum lease commitments  and other contractual obligations are as follows within over total in thousands year years years years balance certificates of deposit     fhlb advances      secondary marketing activities non qualifying hedge transactions expected rate lock commitments   associated forward sale contracts   associated forward purchase contracts   qualifying cash flow hedge transactions loans held for sale  at lower of cost or fair value   associated forward sale contracts   commitments to originate loans held for investment adjustable   fixed undisbursed loan funds and unused lines of credit     operating leases      standby letters of credit and other contingent liabilities   total obligations and commitments      regulatory capital compliance our core and tangible capital ratios were both and our risk based capital ratio was at december  these levels are down from comparable ratios of for both core and tangible capital and for risk based capital at december   and continue to exceed the well capitalized standards of for core capital and for risk based capital  as defined by regulation

it is possible that certain of our real estate joint venture partnerships may require consolidation as a result of applying the provisions of fin the financial impact will likely be immaterial
