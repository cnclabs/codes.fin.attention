critical accounting estimates the consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting standards generally accepted in the united states of america 
in preparing these consolidated financial statements management makes use of estimates and assumptions 
see note summary of significant accounting policies of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
the company believes that of its significant accounting policies  the following critical policies  estimates and assumptions may involve a higher degree of judgment and complexity and are the most susceptible to significant fluctuations in the near term 
the fair value of investments  for which a quoted market or dealer price is not available  is based on management s estimate 
among the factors considered by management in determining the fair value of investments are cost  terms and liquidity of the investment  the sale price of recently issued securities  the financial condition and operating results of the issuer  earnings trends and consistency of operating cash flows  the long term business potential of the issuer  the quoted market price of securities with similar quality and yields that are publicly traded  and other factors generally pertinent to the valuation of investments 
receivables from customers consist primarily of floating rate loans collateralized by margin securities 
management estimates an allowance for doubtful accounts to reserve for potential losses from unsecured and partially unsecured customer accounts deemed uncollectible 
the facts and circumstances surrounding each receivable and the number of shares  price and volatility of the underlying collateral are considered by management in determining the allowance 
management continually evaluates its receivables from customers for collectibility and possible write off 
the company manages the credit risk associated with its receivables from customers through credit limits and continuous monitoring of collateral 
the company is a defendant in a number of lawsuits and arbitrations which arose from its business activities 
some of these lawsuits and arbitrations claim substantial amounts  including punitive damage claims 
management has determined that it is likely that ultimate resolution in favor of the claimants will result in losses to the company on certain of these claims 
the company has  after consultation with outside counsel and consideration of facts currently known by management  recorded estimated losses to the extent they believe certain claims are probable of loss and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated 
factors considered by management in estimating the company s liability are the loss and damages sought by the claimants  the merits of the claims  the total cost of defending the litigation and the likelihood of a successful defense against the claims  and the potential for fines and penalties from regulatory agencies 
results of litigation and arbitration are inherently uncertain  and management s assessment of risk associated therewith is subject to change as the proceedings evolve 
accruals for tax contingencies require management to make estimates and judgments with respect to the ultimate outcome of a tax audit 
actual results could vary from these estimates 
the company operates within multiple taxing jurisdictions and is subject to audit in these jurisdictions 
these audits can involve complex issues  which may require an extended period of time to resolve

management of these risks is necessary for the long term profitability of the company 
the company manages these risks through the establishment of numerous policies  procedures and controls 
the company does not rely on off balance sheet arrangements or transactions with unconsolidated  special purpose or limited purpose entities to manage its risks 
the most significant risks to the company are operational  legal  credit and market risk 
operational risk operational risk refers generally to the risk of loss resulting from the company s operations including  but not limited to  improper or unauthorized execution and processing of transactions  deficiencies in the company s operating systems and inadequacies or breaches in the company s control processes 
the company operates in diverse markets and is reliant on the ability of its employees and systems to process high numbers of transactions 
in the event of a breakdown or improper operation of systems or improper action by employees  the company could suffer financial loss  regulatory sanctions and damage to its reputation 
in order to mitigate and control operational risk  the company developed  and continues to enhance  specific policies and procedures that are designed to identify and manage operational risk at appropriate levels 
for example  the company has procedures that require that all transactions are accurately recorded and properly reflected in the company s books and records and are confirmed on a timely basis  that position valuations are subject to periodic independent review procedures  and that collateral and adequate documentation eg  master agreements are obtained from counterparties in appropriate circumstances 
the company also uses periodic self assessments and internal audit examinations as further reviews of operational risk 
legal risk legal risk includes the risk of non compliance with applicable legal and regulatory requirements and the risk that a counterparty s performance obligations will be unenforceable 
the company is generally subject to extensive regulation in the different jurisdictions in which it conducts its business

in connection with its business  the company has various procedures addressing issues  such as regulatory capital requirements  sales and trading practices  new products  use and safekeeping of customer funds and securities  granting credit  collection activities  money laundering  privacy and record keeping 
credit risk credit risk is discussed in note financial instruments off balance sheet risk and concentration of credit risk of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
market risk market risk is the risk of loss to the company resulting from changes in interest rates  equity prices or both and has an indirect effect on the company s credit risk as it relates to the value of customer collateral 
the company is exposed to market risk to the extent it maintains positions in fixed income and equity securities 
the company primarily manages its risk through the establishment of trading policies and guidelines and through the implementation of control and review procedures 
the company s management philosophy provides for communication among all responsible parties throughout the trading day 
the company s policy is to purchase inventory to provide investment products for its clients 
consequently  the company purchases only inventory that it believes it can readily sell to its clients  thus reducing the company s exposure to liquidity risk but not market fluctuations 
in addition  the executive committee of ag edwards sons  inc establishes maximum inventory guidelines for fixed income and equity securities subject to certain limited exceptions 
capital management and control are accomplished through review by product managers and members of management outside of the trading areas of various reports  including reports that show current inventory profit and loss  inventory positions exceeding set limits  and aged positions 
additionally  real time capital management data are available for intraday assessments 
the company does not act as a dealer  trader or end user of complex derivative products such as swaps  collars and caps 
the company provides advice and guidance on complex derivative products to selected clients  however  this activity does not involve the company acquiring a position or commitment in these products

these transactions are not material to the company s financial condition or results of operations 
equity price risk 
equity price risk refers to the risk of changes in the level or volatility of the price of equity securities

interest rate risk 
interest rate risk refers to the risk of changes in the level or volatility of interest rates  the speed of payments on mortgage backed securities  the shape of the yield curve and credit spreads 
the company is exposed to this risk as a result of maintaining inventories of interest rate sensitive financial instruments 
this is the company s primary market risk 
the company has elected to use a sensitivity approach to express the potential decrease in the fair value of the company s interest rate sensitive financial instruments 
the company calculated the potential loss in fair value of its debt inventory by calculating the change in the offering price of each inventory item resulting from a percent increase in either the treasury yield curve for taxable products or the municipal market data corporation s aaa rated yield curve for tax exempt products 
using this method  if such a percent increase were to occur  the company calculated a potential loss in fair value of its debt inventory of million at february   and million at february  forward looking statements the management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations and other sections of this form k contains forward looking statements within the meaning of federal securities laws
