item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and related notes and other information included in this report 
the financial results reported herein do not indicate the financial results that may be achieved by the company in any future period 
background monterey pasta company was incorporated in june as a producer and wholesaler of refrigerated gourmet pasta and sauces to restaurants and grocery stores in the monterey  california area 
the company has since expanded its operations to provide a variety of gourmet refrigerated food products to grocery and club stores throughout the united states  selected regions in canada  the caribbean  latin america  and asia pacific 
the company s overall strategic plan is to enhance the value of the monterey pasta company brand name by distributing its gourmet products through multiple channels of distribution 
the company s product distribution to grocery and club stores increased from approximately stores as of december  to approximately  stores by december  during  and  significant costs were incurred to promote the rapid expansion that occurred  including product demonstration  advertising  warehousing  and distribution costs and the hiring of additional personnel 
in  the focus was changed to developing a profitable distribution base 
hence  the reduction in store totals  and the return to profitability 
during through  the company added profitable retail and club distribution including approximately additional club stores  retail stores as part of the march  frescala foods acquisition  several new retail chains  additional stores in existing chains  and added stores as part of the nate s and emerald valley acquisitions comprising approximately  stores 
the success of the company s efforts to increase revenue will depend on five key factors whether grocery and club store chains will continue to increase the number of their stores offering the company s products  whether the company can continue to increase the number of grocery and club store chains offering its products  continued introduction of new products that meet consumer acceptance and whether the company can diversify into other complementary businesses through new product offerings or acquisitions and leverage its strengths to continue to grow revenues at levels attractive to its investors 
grocery and club store chains continually re evaluate the products carried in their stores  and no assurances can be given that the chains currently offering the company s products will continue to do so in the future or that such chains will not reduce the number of stores carrying the company s products 
the company believes that access to substantially greater capital resources  coupled with continued reduction of its administrative and production costs as a percent of sales revenue  will be key requirements in the company s efforts to enhance its competitive position and increase its market penetration 
in order to support its expansion program  the company has developed  and is continuing to develop new products for consumers and revised advertising and promotional activities for its retail grocery and club store accounts 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to increase its net revenues from grocery and club stores 
because the company will continue to make expenditures associated with the expansion of its business  the company s results of operations may be affected 
operations for  and in  the emerging issues task force eitf of the financial accounting standards board fasb adopted issue  accounting for consideration given by a vendor to a customer or a reseller of the vendor s products 
this issue required reclassification of certain expenses which were formerly classified selling expense as reductions in sales see recently issued accounting standards page for a complete analysis of pre and post eitf net revenue and sales and selling  general and adminstrative sg a accounting 
post eitf net revenues were   and  for  and  respectively  reflecting an annual increase in sales of for  when compared to  and an increase for when compared to the and increases resulted from same store sales growth  increased store numbers from approximately  at the end of to approximately  individual grocery and club stores by year end of  and approximately  at year end the acquisition of emerald valley kitchen in late august contributed approximately of the overall sales growth of from its eighteen weeks of sales through fiscal year end 
the sales level represents a compound annual average growth since  when sales were  of over 
gross margin for   and based on post eitf sales accounting was  and  respectively 
the slight increase in was due to lower ingredients prices  especially dairy ingredients 
post eitf sg a increased to  up  or from  in  which had increased  or from in addition to variable selling expense increases associated with the sales growth  the increase resulted from approximately  in one time expenses associated with a union organizing effort  which was overwhelmingly defeated by a vote of company employees  and the successful search for a new president 
the numbers also included sg a expenses of  added with the acquisition of emerald valley for the eighteen week period following acquisition 
the increase also reflected an increased investment in marketing expenditures  most notably product demonstrations  without a commensurate increase in sales volume 
management is examining the level of product demonstration expenses to determine the most cost effective level relative to sales revenue 
sg a expense was   and in   and  respectively 
additional expenses in future periods  mainly in the sales and marketing area  will be directly associated with increased levels of sales 
depreciation and amortization expense  included in cost of sales and sg a approximately is in cost of sales  increased to  or of net revenues in  compared to  or of net revenues in  and  or in the increases over the past two years relate primarily to capital expenditures in the salinas  california production facility and the addition of the nate s polenta  and emerald valley kitchen businesses 
see liquidity  capital resources and business acquisitions  page 
the company anticipates further increase in depreciation expense in future periods as additional equipment is purchased and placed in service 
however  because of the changes associated with statement of financial accounting standards see new accounting pronouncements on page  and recently issued accounting standards on page  amortization of existing intangibles on the books in declined from  in to  in net interest income of  was recognized in compared to income of  in and  of interest expense in the and interest income was generated from investment in short term money funds from operating cash flow in the absence of bank debt 
at year end  the company had no bank debt and the net interest income for the year included  of interest expense from financing leases 
see consolidated balance sheets page 
income tax benefit expense for   and was   and  respectively 
the benefit resulted primarily from the utilization of certain tax credits including california manufacturer s tax credit  combined with the release of reserves against deferred tax assets relating to prior net operating losses nols 
the expense resulted from a more normalized tax rate  since nols utilized in were not reserved 
thus  during  deferred tax assets were utilized to offset state and federal income tax with only  in cash taxes paid 
during  another  of the remaining reserves against deferred tax assets were released and offset against income tax since  after a comprehensive study of the nature of the nols and their likelihood of being utilized  management concluded that it was more likely than not that they would be utilized 
this benefit  together with permanent differences and other current tax effects  resulted in a net income tax benefit of  for utilization of these nols and other deferred tax assets offset substantially all of the cash federal income taxes otherwise payable for as of december   remaining net deferred tax assets on the balance sheet available to offset future taxes are  short term and  long term 
additionally  in all three years  we realized additional tax benefits as a result of the exercise of non qualified stock options and the exercise and subsequent sale of certain incentive stock options disqualifying dispositions 
for financial reporting purposes  any resulting reduction in actual income tax obligations as a result of these disqualifying dispositions is credited to additional paid in capital see liquidity  capital resources and business acquisition deferred tax assets on page  and note to the consolidated financial statements on pages

the company paid only  in cash taxes for year and had a cash credit of  in  due primarily to utilization of nols as discussed above 
a change in working capital components contributed 
million in cash during  largely a result of the million increase in accounts payable and accrued liabilities offset by increase in accounts receivable  inventory and prepaids of 
million 
the improvement in cash flow from operations followed a million improvement of over  most of which was contributed by an increased net cash income  partially offset by a net increase in working capital components 
the company currently has a credit facility  which was renegotiated in august  for million in aggregate borrowings which has been unused since september  and has a zero balance outstanding at december  see note to the financial statements 
the million working capital portion of the facility is priced at either prime rate or libor  plus basis points for a debt tangible net worth ratio of  with libor premiums increasing in basis point increments based on increased debt tangible net worth increments of 
the working capital commitment expires october  the million non revolving term portion of the facility pricing is at either prime rate or libor plus premiums for the same debt tangible net worth ratios beginning at basis points over libor and increasing basis points for successive debt tangible net worth increments 
the term loan facility is subject to annual review if unused 
if used  it converts to an month term loan 
this access to capital provides us with flexible working capital  which occasionally may be needed in the normal course of business  and the opportunity to grow our business through acquisitions or develop our existing infrastructure through capital investment 
a letter of credit in the amount of  was negotiated during january in favor of an insurance company to support a deductible worker s compensation program initiated by the company on january  in addition to operating cash flows  the company also received cash proceeds of   and  from the exercise of employee stock options and sales of stock under the company s stock purchase plan during   and  respectively

million for a stuffed pizza calzone line 
the company anticipates capital expenditures in to be approximately million 
all future capital expenditures are expected to be funded with a combination of cash flow from operations and use of the company s credit facility 
business acquisitions on march   the company purchased the operating assets and inventory of frescala foods  inc frescala  a san antonio  texas based fresh pasta and sauce producer with an emphasis on private label production 
the company benefited in two ways from this acquisition it acquired several signature grocery chains in which it had no previous presence  and it was able to improve profitability through the closure of the san antonio facility  thereby eliminating the fixed overhead layer associated with running the facility 
the consideration to the frescala shareholders consisted of  in cash plus fully vested options to purchase  shares of the company s common stock 
the options had an approximate fair market value of  an exercise price of per share  and a three year expiration 
additionally  frescala owners received an earn out of  as of october  based upon frescala sales above a predetermined level 
funding for the transaction came from a new  two year term loan  since repaid  use of existing accounts receivable and inventory line  and cash flow from operations 
the total consideration for frescala of  plus related acquisition costs of  was allocated to identifiable fixed assets totaling  and inventories of  the balance of  which includes trademarks and recipes not specifically quantifiable  was classified as goodwill 
on december   the company purchased the nate s polenta business of south san francisco  california for a total consideration of  plus related acquisition costs of  approximately  was allocated to inventory 
the remaining  was classified as goodwill 
funding for the nate s purchase came from existing bank balances 
the nate s acquisition provided the company another gourmet niche item to complement its product lines and added approximately stores which the company did not formerly serve 
on august   the company purchased the operating assets and inventory of emerald valley kitchen  inc a eugene  oregon based producer of organic fresh salsas  dips  hummus  and sauces with over retail chain distribution 
the company considered this purchase an opportunity to enter the rapidly growing organic food market 
the consideration to the sellers consisted of  in cash 
additionally  the emerald valley owners are eligible to receive an earn out based upon emerald valley earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation  and amortization ebitda above predetermined levels starting at  for the first five years after the acquisition date 
the earn out will be calculated annually at the end of successive twelve month periods following acquisition 
funding for the transaction came from existing cash balances 
the total consideration of  plus related acquisition costs of  was allocated to identifiable property and equipment totaling  and inventories of  the balance of  was allocated to trademark  recipes  customer lists  and goodwill 
the trademark  which has been included in intangible assets  will continue to be used for an indefinite period 
therefore  this asset balance will not be amortized on a monthly basis  but will be tested for impairment annually in keeping with sfas recipes will be amortized over a three year life 
customer list will be amortized over a ten year life 
the following unaudited proforma financial data present the combined results of operations of monterey pasta company and emerald valley as if the purchase had occurred december  the proforma information gives effect to certain adjustments  including eliminating the amortization of goodwill for  which was expensed prior to the adoption of recently issued accounting standards on page this proforma summary does not necessarily reflect the results of operations  as they would have been if monterey pasta company and emerald valley had constituted a single entity during such periods  and is not necessarily indicative of results that may be obtained in the future 
twelve months ended december  december  proforma net sales net income basic income per share diluted income per share management believes that cash on hand of million at december   as well as projected cash flows from operations  and availability under our credit facility  is sufficient to fund our working capital needs  anticipated capital expenditures  and any acquisitions the company may enter into for we currently invest our cash on hand in highly liquid short term investments yielding approximately interest 
deferred tax assets due to the prior history of losses  a valuation allowance against deferred tax assets was provided in and earlier years  as we could not determine that it was more likely than not that we could use them 
as of december   however  we had experienced three consecutive years of increasingly profitable operations 
accordingly  we reversed a portion of the valuation allowance totaling  at year end  since we believed it was more likely than not that at least this portion of deferred tax assets would be realized 
additional reserves totaling million were reversed in  as operations remained profitable 
during  we completed a comprehensive study of the nature of certain net operating losses nols arising in connection with our previously owned subsidiary upscale food outlets  inc ufo and their likelihood of their being utilized 
we concluded that it was more likely than not that they would be utilized 
as a result  reserves against these specific deferred tax assets totaling  were released during and offset against income tax expense 
this credit  together with permanent differences and other current tax effects resulted in a net year to date income tax benefit of  utilization of these nols and other deferred tax assets offset substantially all of the federal income taxes otherwise payable for as of december   remaining net deferred tax assets available to offset future cash taxes are  short term and  long term 
as a result of this evaluation and resulting release of reserves  the company expects that future income tax expense will be accrued at a more normalized combined federal and state rate approaching statutory rates less certain tax credits and timing differences 
the future disallowance of any previous ufo nol usage  if it occurs  would increase both income tax expense and amounts actually payable 
sales and marketing the company s sales and marketing strategy is twofold  and targets sustainable growth in distribution of its products and the introduction of innovative new products to keep the company positioned as the gourmet refrigerated category leader in the marketplace 
its focus is on increasing sales through expansion of its club store and retail grocery business 
during  the company continued its emphasis on bringing innovative new products to the market place with the introduction of refrigerated stuffed pizzas  calzones  pierogies  a tortilla soup  and a vodka sauce 
the refrigerated pizzas and calzones were introduced late in the third quarter with a guaranteed shelf life of days  and  to the company s knowledge  are the only extended shelf life refrigerated pizzas and calzones 
the pierogies  introduced in the first quarter of  are also the only extended shelf life refrigerated pierogy the company is aware of  have been accepted nationally at sam s club stores  and have regional distribution elsewhere 
these introductions are part of an ongoing effort to rapidly introduce new products in the refrigerated section  which further enhance the company s gourmet image 
expansion of the company s club store business took on an international flavor during with the introduction of the company s products into the eastern canada division of costco  as well as costco locations in mexico  and locations in asia pacific 
the company s products are now found in approximately costco wholesale locations 
distribution of the company s products also continues to grow with the national expansion of sam s club  and the introduction of the company s products into sam s club locations in mexico 
monterey pasta s products are now found in approximately sam s club locations 
during  the company s retail business increased significantly with an additional albertson s stores including in the metro phoenix market  and in northern california  over dominick s stores in the metro chicago market  and jerry s enterprises stores in the upper midwest  which average  square feet in size 
the company also acquired significant retail business with its purchase of the nate s polenta brand in late the nate s polenta business added distribution to over retail outlets 
at end of  the company had distribution in over  retail outlets 
in  the company continued its emphasis on bringing innovative new products to the marketplace with the introduction of two new product lines veil thin pasta and italian classic sauces 
veil thin pasta features a delicate dough that is significantly thinner than traditional refrigerated pasta doughs 
the company s first offering in the veil thin line is its borsellini  which wraps gourmet fillings in small pouches of veil thin dough 
the product line has enjoyed considerable success in both retail and club store accounts 
the italian classics sauce line expands the company s sauce offerings  and features three varieties of traditional style italian sauces 
italian classics sauces can be found in both retail and club store accounts 
in addition  the company also added significantly to its existing line of refrigerated  fresh calzones during the year  and was successful in introducing them to both retail and club store accounts 
during the company launched three new product lines stuffed potato gnocchi with three flavors  a new line of premium sauces in plastic jars with several selections and pezzo grandi chunky stuffed ravioli with three flavors initially 
several extensions of existing lines were also marketed 
the company made significant distribution gains during with over albertson s stores   wal mart supercenters  bj s club stores and publix super markets added to its distribution base 
the emerald valley acquisition also added over stores not formerly served by the company 
in addition  the company purchased the operating assets of emerald valley kitchen of eugene  oregon  a producer of refrigerated organic salsas  dips  hummus and sauces 
the august acquisition marked the company s formal expansion into the rapidly growing organic food business the nate s polenta product is organic also and will be used as a platform for additional offerings in the future 
business risks certain characteristics and dynamics of the company s business and of financial markets generally create risks to the company s long term success and to predictable quarterly results 
these risks include no assurance of continued profitability 
in the second quarter of  the company reported its first operating loss from continuing operations 
subsequent to that quarter the company incurred losses through the first quarter of  after which it regained profitability  which has continued for twenty one consecutive quarters 
at december   the company had an accumulated deficit of  there can be no assurance that the company will maintain its profitability in the long or short term 
liquidity need for additional capital 
management believes that its current cash balances  operations  and existing bank lines of credit will provide adequate liquidity to meet the company s planned capital and operating requirements for normal operations and capital expenditures through the next twelve months refer to note to the financial statements for a description of credit facility 
in addition  the disallowance of a significant portion of previously utilized ufo nols might require an unexpected cash outlay 
the tax impact of the use of the ufo nols through is approximately million 
if the company s operations do not provide cash sufficient to fund its operations  and the company seeks outside financing  there can be no assurance that the company will be able to obtain such financing when needed  on acceptable terms  or at all 
in addition  any future equity financing or convertible debt financing would cause the company s stockholders to incur dilution in net tangible book value per share of common stock 
hiring and retention of key personnel 
the success of the company depends on its ability to retain key executives  and to motivate and retain other key employees and officers 
on september  the company announced the hiring of james m 
williams as the new president to replace r 
lance hewitt  who will be retiring from day to day operations sometime in early the company currently has key man insurance policies in place  each in the face amount of  for its chief executive officer  r 
lance hewitt  and its chief financial officer  stephen l 
brinkman 
a policy will be added for mr 
williams in the future 
there can be no assurance that significant management turnover will not occur in the future 
impact of inflation 
dairy ingredients and energy prices had a significant impact on its operations during the first six months of however  management believes that inflation has not had a material impact on its operations during substantial increases in labor  employee benefits  freight  ingredients and packaging  rents and other operating expenses  and future increases in cheese and energy prices could adversely affect the operations of the company s business in future periods 
the company cannot predict whether such increases will occur in the future  or their magnitude 
risks inherent in food production 
the company faces all of the risks inherent in the production and distribution of refrigerated food products  including contamination  adulteration for which it is insured  and spoilage  and the associated risks of product liability litigation  which may be associated with even an isolated event 
the company has modern production facilities  employs what it believes is state of the art thermal processing  temperature controlled storage  haacp programs intended to insure food safety  and has obtained usda approval for its california production facilities 
quality assurance programs and food safety programs similar to those employed in the salinas  california facilities will be established for the eugene  oregon facility 
however  there can be no assurance that the company s procedures will be adequate to prevent the occurrence of such events 
dependence on major customers 
during  two customers  costco and sam s club stores including wal mart supercenters  accounted for and  respectively  of the company s total revenues 
the company currently sells its products to eight separate costco regions approximately stores which make purchasing decisions independently of one another 
these regions re evaluate  on a regular basis  the products carried in their stores 
there can be no assurance that these costco regions will continue to offer monterey pasta products in the future or continue to allocate monterey pasta the same amount of shelf space 
the company also supplies its products to approximately sam s club stores  and  wal mart supercenters and neighborhood markets 
purchasing decisions are made at the respective company s headquarters with input from the store level 
while the company is in the fifth year of its relationship with sam s  and this relationship is expected to continue  there can be no assurance that sam s club stores will continue to carry its products 
loss of either of these customers  costco or sam s club  to either would have a material adverse effect on the company 
additionally  liberalized pricing or allowance terms would create downward pressure on gross margins 
seasonality and quarterly results 
the company s grocery and club store accounts are expected to experience seasonal fluctuations to some extent 
the company s business in general may also be affected by a variety of other factors  including but not limited to general economic trends  competition  marketing programs  and special or unusual events 
competition and dependence on common carriers 
the company s business continues to be dominated by several very large competitors  which have significantly greater resources than the company  such competitors can outspend the company and negatively affect the company s market share and results of operations 
the company also continues to be dependent on common carriers to distribute its products 
any disruption in its distribution system or increase in the costs thereof could have a material adverse impact on the company s business 
california energy crisis 
during  california experienced an energy crisis that could have disrupted the company s operations and did increase the company s energy expenses 
in the event of an acute power shortage  when power reserves for california fall below  electricity providers have on some occasions implemented  and may in the future implement  rolling blackouts 
if blackouts interrupt the power supply to the company s production facilities  such facilities would temporarily be unable to continue production 
any such interruption could result in a loss of revenue as a result of reduced production and  in severe cases  spoilage of food products 
in addition  related to the energy crisis  many of the electricity and natural gas suppliers raised their rates substantially during the first six months of because the company has most of its operations in california  its operating costs are affected by an increase in electricity and natural gas prices 
as a result  the company s operating results could to be affected in some measure by in the future by fluctuations in the price or supply of energy 
electricity prices remained unchanged from may through march  except for adjustment to a lower wintertime rate schedule  which began in november and ended in april current rates since april are similar to the same period a year ago 
natural gas prices have declined substantially from their levels in the first five months of and continued at much lower levels for all of management cannot predict the level of future energy prices or supply with certainty 
marketing and sales risks 
the future success of the company s efforts will depend on a number of factors  including whether grocery and club store chains will continue to expand the number of their individual stores offering the company s products and whether allowances and other incentives will expand retail distribution 
expansion into new markets increases the risk of significant product returns resulting from the company s supply of slower selling items to its customers 
in addition  grocery and club store chains continually re evaluate the products carried in their stores and no assurances can be given that the chains currently offering the company s products will continue to do so in the future 
should these channels choose to reduce or eliminate products  the company could experience a significant reduction in its product sales 
as indicated previously  the company remains dependent on the use of slotting allowances and other incentives to expand retail distribution 
in order to reduce risk  the company has significantly reduced expansion into new markets requiring such major expenditures 
dairy ingredients prices 
during the first ten months of average price of certain dairy ingredients increased over compared with the average of the prior twelve months  as measured by butterfat prices published by the state of california department of food and agriculture 
because the company utilizes various dairy ingredients in many of its products  its operating costs will be affected by an increase in those ingredients 
the company s operating results were affected in the first eleven months of although dairy ingredient prices have declined significantly in the past fourteen months since november  results could be affected in some measure in future months by renewed price increases  if they occur 
dairy ingredients historically tend to be cyclical in nature and subject to declines in price as well as increases 
management cannot predict with certainty the duration or magnitude of the current price cycle 
deductible worker s compensation program 
the company entered into a deductible worker s compensation program for fiscal year this program which features a fixed annual payment  a deductible of  per occurrence  and a  letter of credit in favor of the insurance company with an annual cost of  creates a maximum exposure of approximately million for claims occurring in a competitive guaranteed cost program would have cost the company approximately million 
management believes that its current safety program  and its safety record over the last six months of will provide the foundation to enable the company to realize the premium savings deductible programs are designed to achieve 
the company s maximum exposure in the event of adverse experience is approximately  the maximum potential gain as much as million 
critical accounting policies and management judgements accounts receivable and allowances the company provides allowances for estimated credit losses  product returns  spoilage  and adjustments at a level deemed appropriate to adequately provide for known and inherent risks related to such amounts 
the allowances are based on reviews of loss  return  spoilage  adjustment history  contractual relationships with customers  current economic conditions  and other factors that deserve recognition in estimating potential losses 
while management uses the best information available in making its determination  the ultimate recovery of recorded accounts  notes  and other receivables is also dependent on future economic and other conditions that may be beyond management s control 
sales incentives and advertising costs the company expenses advertising costs as incurred or when the related campaign commences 
sales incentives paid or credited to club stores and grocery chains for shelf space allocations are amortized between six and twelve months depending on the nature of the chain program or agreement 
loss of a major account could create the need to expense the remaining prepaid asset relating to that account in a specific quarter  thereby potentially affecting the results of that quarter 
in  addition sales incentives could increase thereby adversely affecting gross margins 
goodwill intangible assets intangible assets other than goodwill consist of tradenames  goodwill  and other intangibles and are recorded at cost  net of accumulated amortization 
these intangibles are amortized over their respective useful lives  if determinate  ranging from to years 
goodwill and intangibles with indeterminate useful lives are assessed for impairment at least annually 
the valuation of these intangibles is generally determined based upon valuations performed by third party specialists and management s best estimates of fair value 
as a result  the ultimate value and recoverability of these assets is subject to the validity of the assumptions used 
the company cannot predict the occurrence of events that might adversely affect the reported value of goodwill that totaled million at december  however  the current fair market value of our acquired assets are in excess of carrying values and  accordingly  management believes that only significant changes in cash flow assumptions would result in impairment 
income taxes deferred tax asset valuation allowance the company accounts for corporate income taxes in accordance with sfas  accounting for income taxes  which requires an asset and liability approach 
this approach results in the recognition of deferred tax assets future tax benefits and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of temporary timing differences between the book carrying amounts and the tax basis of assets and liabilities 
future tax benefits are subject to a valuation allowance to the extent of the likelihood that the deferred tax assets may not be realized 
the company has significant deferred tax assets comprised principally of nols from the company s former restaurant operating subsidiary ufo 
these nols were previously fully reserved based upon management s best estimate of ultimate realizeability 
during  based upon new evidence and management s judgments these reserves were substantially reduced 
the amount of the reserve is significantly dependent on management s assumptions regarding future taxable income and the availability of these nols to offset future taxable income 
the effect on the company s net income is significant whenever the estimate of realizability changes  as it did in see note to the financial statements 
the company expects to fully utilize all of the remaining nols in fiscal and contractual obligations the company has no raw material contracts exceeding one year in duration 
however  it does have one long term contract with its liquid nitrogen provider  which expires november  this contract features a price increase cap per year 
the vendor must provide written documentation supporting the price increase before company will agree to accept it 
the following table summarizes the estimated annual obligation of that contract through year contractual obligation and thereafter in addition  the company has a standby letter of credit in favor of an insurance company in the amount of  which expires december  recently issued accounting standards in may  emerging issues task force eitf of the financial accounting standards board reached a consensus on issue  accounting for certain sales incentives 
in april  the eitf reached a consensus on issue  vendor income statement characterization of consideration to a purchaser of the vendor s products or services 
both issue and have been codified under issue  accounting for consideration given by a vendor to a customer or a reseller of the vendor s products 
the company adopted this issue effective first quarter eitf requires the characterization of certain vendor sales incentives such as promotions  trade ads  slotting fees  and coupons as reductions of revenue 
certain of these expenses  previously classified as selling  general and administrative costs  are now characterized as offsets to revenue 
reclassifications have been made to prior period financial statements to conform to the current year presentation 
total vendor sales incentives now characterized as reductions of revenue that previously would have been classified as sg a costs were approximately   and  for   and  respectively 
the table on the following page depicts the proforma impact of reclassifications due to eitf on the company s operating results for  and and the actual impact for proforma and actual impact on income statement of adoption of eitf accounting for consideration given by a vendor to a customer or a reseller of the vendor s products s as originally stated reclassified as originally stated reclassified as stated net revenues coupon expense slotting expense promos  trade ads adjusted net revenues cost of sales gross profit gross profit sales  gen l admin 
coupon expense slotting expense promos  trade ads adjusted sg a sg a operating profit operating profit in june  the fasb finalized sfas  business combinations  and sfas  goodwill and other intangible assets 
sfas requires the use of the purchase method of accounting and prohibits the use of the pooling of interests method of accounting for business combinations initiated after june  sfas also requires the recognition of acquired intangible assets apart from goodwill if the acquired intangible assets meet certain criteria 
sfas changes the way companies account for goodwill in that goodwill is no longer amortized  but it is tested along with any other unamortized intangible assets at least annually for impairment 
in march  the eitf reached a consensus on issue  unit of accounting for testing impairment of indefinite lived intangible assets 
this issue addresses recording indefinite lived intangible assets in a single unit of accounting for purposes of testing impairment if they are operated as a single asset 
this guidance became applicable immediately upon the initial application of sfas in the first quarter of management does not expect the adoption of this statement to have a material impact on the company s financial condition or results of operations 
in august  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets was issued  superseding sfas  accounting for long lived assets to be disposed of 
among other things  sfas provides guidance on how long lived assets used as part of a group should be evaluated for impairment  establishes criteria for when long lived assets are held for sale  and prescribes the accounting for long lived assets that will be disposed of other than by sale 
sfas is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  the company s financial position and results of operations have not been affected by the adoption of sfas in july the fasb issued sfas  accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities  which addresses financial accounting and reporting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities
