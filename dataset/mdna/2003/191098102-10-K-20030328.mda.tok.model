actual results could differ significantly from those estimates under different assumptions and conditions 
the company believes that the following discussion addresses the company s most critical accounting policies  which are those that are most important to the portrayal of the company s financial condition and results of operations and require management s most difficult  subjective and complex judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
allowance for doubtful accounts the company evaluates the collectibility of its trade accounts receivable based on a number of factors 
in circumstances where the company becomes aware of a specific customer s inability to meet its financial obligations to the company  a specific reserve for bad debts is estimated and recorded which reduces the recognized receivable to the estimated amount the company believes will ultimately be collected 
in addition to specific customer identification of potential bad debts  bad debt charges are recorded based on the company s recent past loss history and an overall assessment of past due trade accounts receivable amounts outstanding 
property  plant and equipment property  plant and equipment is recorded at cost and is depreciated on a straight line basis over the estimated useful lives of such assets 
changes in circumstances such as technological advances  changes to the company s business model or changes in the company s capital strategy could result in the actual useful lives differing from the company s current estimates 
in those cases where the company determines that the useful life of property  plant and equipment should be shortened  the company would depreciate the net book value in excess of the estimated salvage value over its revised remaining useful life 
factors such as changes in the planned use of manufacturing equipment  vending equipment  transportation equipment  warehouse facilities or software could also result in shortened useful lives 
the company evaluates long lived assets and certain identifiable intangibles for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
when undiscounted future cash flows will not be sufficient to recover an asset s carrying amount  the asset is written down to its fair value 
long lived assets to be disposed of other than by sale are classified as held and used until they are disposed of 
long lived assets to be disposed of by sale are classified as held for sale and are reported at the lower of carrying amount or fair value less cost to sell  and depreciation is ceased 
goodwill and other intangible assets during  the company adopted the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards no 
 business combinations  and sfas no 
adoption of sfas no 
resulted in a reduction of amortization expense in by approximately million on a pre tax basis for the company and piedmont on a comparable basis 
as of the beginning of fiscal year  the company performed an impairment test of its goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite useful lives and concluded that current fair values for recorded goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives exceed their respective carrying values 
in the future the company will perform an annual impairment test in the third quarter of each year or earlier if significant impairment indicators arise 
deferred tax assets the company records a valuation allowance to reduce the carrying value of its deferred tax assets to an amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
while the company has considered future taxable income and prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for the valuation allowance  should the company determine that it would not be able to realize all or part of its net deferred tax assets in the future  an adjustment to the valuation allowance would be charged to income in the period in which such determination was made 
a reduction in the valuation allowance and corresponding credit to income may be required if the likelihood of realizing existing deferred tax assets were to increase 
pension and postretirement benefits obligations the company sponsors pension plans covering substantially all full time nonunion employees who meet eligibility requirements 
several statistical and other factors  which attempt to anticipate future events  are used in calculating the expense and liability related to the plans 
these factors include assumptions about the discount rate  expected return on plan assets  employee turnover  age at retirement and rate of future compensation increases as determined by the company  within certain guidelines 
in addition  the company s actuarial consultants also use subjective factors such as withdrawal and mortality rates to estimate the projected benefit obligation 
the actuarial assumptions used by the company may differ materially from actual results due to changing market and economic conditions  higher or lower withdrawal rates or longer or shorter life spans of participants 
these differences may result in a significant impact to the amount of pension expense recorded by the company in future periods 
in  the discount rate used in determining the actuarial present value of the projected benefit obligation for the company s nonunion pension plans decreased to from in due to declining interest rates for long term bonds 
the company sponsors a postretirement health care plan for employees meeting specified qualifying criteria 
several statistical and other factors  which attempt to anticipate future events  are used in calculating the expense and liability for this plan 
these factors include assumptions about the discount rate and the expected growth rate for the cost of health care benefits 
in addition  the company s actuarial consultants also use subjective factors such as withdrawal and mortality rates to estimate the projected liability under this plan 
the actuarial assumptions used by the company may differ materially from actual results due to changing market and economic conditions  higher or lower withdrawal rates or longer or shorter life spans of participants

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company is exposed to certain market risks that arise in the ordinary course of business 
the company may enter into derivative financial instrument transactions to manage or reduce market risk 
the company does not enter into derivative financial instrument transactions for trading purposes 
a discussion of the company s primary market risk exposure is presented below 
long term debt and interest rate risk the company is subject to interest rate risk on its long term fixed interest rate debt 
borrowings under lines of credit  other variable rate long term debt and variable rate leases do not give rise to significant interest rate risk because these borrowings either have maturities of less than three months or have variable interest rates 
all other things being equal  the fair market value of the company s debt with a fixed interest rate will increase as interest rates decline and the fair market value of the company s debt will decrease as interest rates rise 
this exposure to interest rate risk is generally managed by borrowing funds with a variable interest rate or using interest rate swaps to effectively change fixed interest rate borrowings to variable interest rate borrowings 
the company generally maintains between and of total borrowings at variable interest rates after taking into account all of the interest rate hedging activities 
while this is the target range  the financial position of the company and market conditions may result in strategies outside of this range at certain points in time 
before giving effect to forward rate agreements  approximately of the company s debt and capital lease obligations of million as of december  was subject to changes in short term interest rates 
as it relates to the company s variable rate debt and variable rate leases  if market interest rates average more in than the rates as of december   interest expense for would increase by million 
if market interest rates had averaged more in than the rates at december   interest expense for would have increased by million 
these amounts were determined by calculating the effect of the hypothetical interest rate on our variable rate debt and variable rate leases after giving consideration to all our interest rate hedging activities 
this sensitivity analysis assumes that there are no changes in the company s financial structure 
raw material and commodity price risk the company is subject to commodity price risk arising from price movements for certain commodities included as part of its raw materials 
the company generally manages this risk by entering into long term contracts with adjustable prices 
the company has not used derivative commodity instruments in the management of this risk 
effect of changing prices the principal effect of inflation on the company s operating results is to increase costs 
subject to normal competitive market conditions  the company believes it has the ability to raise selling prices to offset these cost increases over time
