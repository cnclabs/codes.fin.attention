year ended june  revenues net sales of million for fiscal year declined million when compared to net sales of million for fiscal year the decline in revenues primarily reflects unsatisfactory results in the marketing of the company s lite bites product line 
lower sales to the qvc channel can be partially attributable to increased competition in the nutrition bar category and a general decline in the weight loss supplement market related to negative press associated with the ephedra controversy 
softer sales resulted in more limited airtime driving the lite bites business on qvc into further decline 
in parallel during fiscal year  the company continued to explore alternative cost effective channels of distribution for the lite bites brand that  prior to this year  was by agreement sold exclusively through qvc  inc the company tested the proposition of taking lite bites into retail distribution though an alliance with leiner health products  one of the largest and most reputable supplement distributors in the us the resulting feedback indicated that the brand would require a much larger investment in marketing than the company believed was justified 
therefore  the company has made the decision to no longer invest in the lite bites product line 
as a result  the company determined that a million non cash charge associated with the long lived assets related to the lite bites product line was warranted 
the company will consider a sale of the lite bites assets 
any returns realized will be reinvested in the expansion of the company s chromium derived business opportunities 
lower weight loss and sports nutrition supplement sales have led to commensurate reductions in revenues from ingredient sales 
other revenue from license fees for fiscal year and fiscal year was million 
cost of goods sold cost of goods sold in fiscal year of million declined million when compared to million in fiscal year a reduction in cost of goods sold  which is directly related to lower sales in fiscal year  was partially offset by a charge of million for slow moving inventory of the lite bites product line 
gross margin on product sales was in fiscal year  compared to in fiscal year the decline was due primarily to product mix and charges to cost of goods sold for slow moving inventory 
selling  general and administrative selling  general and administrative expense for fiscal year of million increased million when compared to million for fiscal year charges for marketing  as well as personnel and personnel related costs associated with organizational expansion to support the company s planned launch of new chromium based therapeutic products were the primary reasons for the increase 
research and development research costs of million for fiscal year increased million when compared to million in fiscal year the increase is due primarily to spending to validate new chromium product applications in diabetes and depression 
the company s therapeutic strategy for the past year includes a larger commitment to spending on research and development and is targeted at further validating earlier findings focused on disease specific conditions in the areas of diabetes and depression 
the company entered into an agreement with diabetex  inc  a diabetes disease management company  and is funding a large scale trial in managed patient populations to evaluate diachrome s effect as a nutritional adjunct to standard care for people with diabetes 
the clinical trial is planned to complete by the close of fiscal year the company also entered into an agreement with comprehensive neurosciences  inc  a contract research organization in the neurosciences field  to perform studies related to the company s anti depressant technology 
the company expects that the first phase of its study will be completed during fiscal year the company expects to launch these products under the dietary supplement health and education act dshea regulatory pathway that is less costly and less time consuming than that required for drug development 
these large scale studies are being conducted to secure medical acceptance and adoption for the company s products as standard treatment protocols 
the company s spending in these areas of new technology is discretionary and is subject to the availability of funds 
there can be no assurances that the company s disease specific product development efforts will be successfully completed or that the products will be successfully manufactured or marketed

critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of the consolidated financial statements requires the company to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities and expenses 
on an on going basis  the company evaluates its estimates  including those related to uncollectible accounts receivable  inventories  goodwill  intangibles and other long lived assets 
the company bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
the company believes the following critical accounting policies affect its more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements o the company maintains allowances for uncollectible accounts receivable for estimated losses resulting from the inability of its customers to make required payments 
if the financial condition of the company s customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
o the company carries inventories at the lower of cost or estimated net realizable value 
if actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management write downs may be required 
o property  plant and equipment  patents  trademarks and other intangible assets owned by the company are amortized  over their estimated useful lives 
useful lives are based on management s estimates over the period that such assets will generate revenue 
intangible assets with definite lives are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable 
future adverse changes in market conditions or poor operating results of underlying capital investments or intangible assets could result in losses or an inability to recover the carrying value of such assets  thereby possibly requiring an impairment charge in the future
