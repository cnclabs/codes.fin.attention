item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation 
you should read the following discussion in conjunction with our financial statements and the related notes included in item the following information includes forward looking statements  the realization of which may be affected by certain important factors discussed under risk factors 
overview we are an independent architect of enterprise class information storage infrastructures 
we derive our revenues principally from designing and installing data storage systems 
our solutions can include hardware products  such as disk arrays  tape systems and interconnection components and storage management software products 
prior to january   we recognized revenues for hardware and software product sales when we shipped the products and software to our customers or after they accepted products under evaluation 
however  in december  the sec staff issued staff accounting bulletin  or sab  no 
 revenue recognition  which clarified the sec staff s view regarding the recognition and reporting of revenues in particular transactions 
in light of sab no 
 we modified our revenue recognition policy related to hardware and software products when we provide any installation or configuration services in connection with the sale 
we now recognize revenue from hardware and software product sales when we complete our installation and configuration services that are essential to the functionality of the delivered hardware and software products or after the customer has accepted products under evaluation 
for any remaining installation that is not essential to the functionality of delivered product  we account for the remaining installation as a separate unit of accounting and defer revenue based on objective fair value for such services 
this change was effective as of january  under the sab no 
transition provisions  we accounted for this change in accounting policy prospectively 
as of january   we recorded a charge to earnings of  representing the cumulative effect  net of income taxes  of this change in our accounting policy 
as indicated above  our customers frequently engage us for assistance in the installation of our solutions 
increasingly  they also engage us for consulting and other professional services 
we recognize revenues for this work as we render these services 
we sell support service contracts to most of our customers 
when customers purchase support services through us  customers receive the benefit of integrated support 
we have a qualified  independent support desk to provide routine customer support services covering minor problems 
we fulfill on site assistance by purchasing support service agreements for our customers from our hardware and software vendors or their designated third party service providers and by arranging on site support assistance with the appropriate vendor if necessary 
we defer revenues and direct costs resulting from these contracts  and amortize these revenues and expenses into operations  over the term of the contracts  which are generally twelve months 
in the past  we have experienced fluctuations in the timing of orders from our customers  and we expect to continue to experience these fluctuations in the future 
these fluctuations have resulted from  among other things  the time required to design  test and evaluate our data storage solutions before customers deploy them  the size of customer orders  the complexity of our customers network environments  necessary system configuration to deploy our solutions and new product introductions by suppliers 
completion of our installation and configuration services may also delay recognition of revenues 
current economic conditions and competition also affect our customers decisions to place orders with us 
as a result  our net sales may fluctuate from quarter to quarter 
in november  we acquired certain assets of the data storage and services business of opensystems 
com  inc  a walpole  massachusetts based firm engaged in the resale and installation of data storage solutions 
results of operations the following table shows  for the periods indicated  certain selected financial data expressed as a percentage of net sales 
years ended december  net sales cost of sales gross profit operating expenses sales and marketing general and administrative engineering amortization of goodwill and other intangibles offering costs total operating expenses operating income loss comparison of years ended december   and net sales 
our product sales decreased in from to million  and decreased in from to million 
our product sales were million in our service sales  which include customer support and installation services  remained relatively flat from to at million in and increased in over to million 
our service sales in were million 
the decline in our product sales since reflects a tremendously difficult operating environment as many companies have chosen to significantly reduce their spending on information technology 
the data storage industry as a whole was negatively impacted by these conditions 
given these developments  we cannot predict if or when our product sales will return to historically higher levels 
the growth in our service revenues between and reflects an increase in new maintenance contract sales and contract renewals by existing customers 
we derived approximately  and of our sales from one customer during  and  respectively 
we cannot assure you that this customer will account for a substantial portion of our future sales 
gross profit 
our total gross profit as a percentage of net sales decreased to in from in and in due to the current economic environment  our customers are continuing to seek storage solutions to meet minimum needs rather than implementing comprehensive infrastructure changes 
solutions that meet a minimum need generally carry lower margins than comprehensive infrastructure changes 
in addition  our gross profit percentage has suffered due to the high level of pricing competition in the marketplace 
given these developments  we cannot predict if or when our gross profit as a percentage of net sales will return to historically higher levels 
similarly  product gross profit as a percentage of product sales decreased to in as compared to in and in service gross profit as a percentage of service sales in remained relatively flat from at 
service gross profit as a percentage of service sales was in and in the increase in gross profit rates for services from to reflects our ability to obtain higher margins on our integrated support services 
charges for excess and obsolete inventory in  and of   and million  respectively  adversely affected our product gross profit 
in particular  during  we disposed of excess  old generation inventories at liquidation values significantly below our acquisition cost 
overall cost reduction initiatives 
because of the continuing difficult economic climate  we have actively sought to reduce costs across our business 
our principal fixed expense is for personnel 
through attrition and layoffs  we have reduced employee headcount to at december  from at december  we have also significantly reduced and continue to monitor discretionary areas of spending 
as a result of our efforts  our fixed expenses before amortization of intangibles during the fourth quarter of are down by million as compared to the fourth quarter of sales and marketing 
sales and marketing expenses include wages and commissions paid to sales and marketing personnel  travel costs and advertising  promotion and hiring expenses 
sales and marketing expenses totaled million  or of net sales for compared to million  or of net sales for and million  or of net sales for the decrease in sales expense in absolute dollars is a result of a decrease in commissions related to lower sales and gross margins in as compared to and and a decrease in travel and entertainment due to increased efforts to minimize expenses in these areas 
the increase in sales expense as a percentage of sales from as compared to and resulted primarily from lower sales combined with increased expenses related to investments in management for our regional structure 
these investments were completed in  however  the hiring and related expenses were not fully realized until the third quarter of general and administrative 
general and administrative expenses include wages for administrative personnel  professional fees  depreciation  communication expenses and rent and related facility expenses 
general and administrative expenses decreased to million  or of net sales for as compared to million  or in and million  or in when comparing to  the decrease in general and administrative expenses in absolute dollars reflects lower hiring costs due to fewer new employees  lower professional services fees due to the completion of several process improvement consulting engagements in and lower depreciation expense 
our general and administrative expenses were higher as a percentage of net sales because of the reduction in sales 
engineering 
engineering expenses include employee wages and travel  hiring and training expenses for our professional engineers and technicians 
we allocate engineering costs associated with installation services to our cost of service sales 
engineering expenses remained relatively flat at million  or of net sales in as compared to million  or of net sales in engineering expenses were million  or of net sales in the increase in engineering expenses as a percentage of net sales reflects fewer installations in as compared to as a result  there were fewer engineering costs associated with installation services recorded as cost of service sales and lower travel and entertainment costs associated with the installations 
in addition  the engineering expenses remained relatively flat in absolute dollars because there were lower costs associated with a reduction in headcount  lower depreciation expense on our engineering laboratory equipment and lower costs for travel and entertainment due to increased efforts to minimize expenses in these areas 
goodwill and other intangible amortization 
amortization of goodwill and other intangible assets decreased to million in compared to million in amortization of goodwill and other intangible assets was million in the amortization relates primarily to our acquisition of the data storage and services business of opensystems 
com  inc in november due to the adoption of statement of financial accounting standards sfas  goodwill and intangible assets  our amortization expense decreased by million in from this statement required that we no longer amortize goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives  but instead test for impairment annually or whenever impairment is indicated 
in  we amortized the remaining  balance of the trademark and name intangible asset we acquired in our july acquisition of direct connect systems  inc because we are not operating under its name and realization of future uses became uncertain in the fourth quarter of for more information  see note of the notes to our financial statements 
offering costs 
during the second quarter of  we expensed approximately  of costs for a proposed second public offering of our common stock  which was withdrawn due to market conditions 
operating loss income 
we incurred an operating loss of million in compared to  in operating income was million in the decrease in operating income was principally attributable to our sales decline under difficult economic conditions combined with an increase in our operating expenses in the anticipation of revenue growth and market share gains 
although our revenues remained relatively flat for the four quarters in  our operating loss decreased from million in the first quarter of to  in the fourth quarter of due to the reduction in operating expenses 
the reduction was a result of selective reductions in headcount and expense control 
income taxes 
we provided for an income tax benefit of  in and income taxes of  in and million in included in the income tax provision for is a non cash charge of million related to the creation of a valuation reserve for the deferred tax asset 
the ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon carry back to prior periods and upon the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which those temporary differences become deductible 
based upon the level of taxable losses in and the near term uncertainty of taxable income  management cannot reasonably predict when or if these deductible differences will be realized 
in addition  we do not have the ability to realize future income tax benefits on future losses 
excluding the impact of the reserve  our loss per diluted share would have been 
per share for the year ended december  even though we generated an operating loss in  we still incurred income tax expense which reflected permanent differences  such as non deductible goodwill amortization  between our reported and taxable income as well as state taxes 
cumulative effect of change in accounting principle 
as described in the overview above  in the first quarter of  we incurred a one time  non cash charge of  representing the cumulative effect  net of income taxes  of the accounting changes we made effective as of january   to our revenue recognition policies to comply with the provisions of sec staff accounting bulletin no 
see note of the notes to our financial statements 
quarterly results and seasonality the following table sets forth our unaudited quarterly financial data for each quarter of and in our opinion  this unaudited information has been prepared on the same basis as the audited information and includes all adjustments including all normal recurring adjustments necessary to present fairly the information set forth below

in thousands net sales gross profit operating income loss net income loss we have experienced  and expect to continue to experience  quarterly variations in our net sales as a result of a number of factors  including the length of the sales cycle with customers for large storage system evaluations and purchases  delays in storage system installations or configurations  new product introductions by suppliers and their market acceptance  delays in product shipments or other quality control difficulties  our ability to integrate any acquired businesses  trends in the enterprise class information storage industry in general  the geographic and industry specific market in which we are currently active  or may be in the future  and the opening of new field offices 
in addition  current economic conditions and competition also affect our customers decisions to place orders with us 
liquidity and capital resources historically  we have financed our operations and capital requirements through cash flows generated from operations  supplemental bank borrowings and the proceeds from our offerings of our common stock 
our working capital was million at december  as compared to million at december  our current ratio was at december  as compared to at december  at december   our cash and cash equivalents balance was million 
cash provided by operating activities for was  as compared to million in and million in the cash provided in resulted primarily from a reduction in our net operating assets 
the reduction in net operating assets reflects timing of certain payments and receipts and a reduction in the overall level of business 
the cash provided in resulted primarily from a reduction in inventories offset by a decrease in payables 
the reduction in inventories for resulted from our increased efforts to optimize our inventory levels and to complete the installation of products for customers at year end 
the cash provided by operating activities in resulted primarily from our net income and a reduction in accounts receivable and increases in accounts payable  partially offset by an increase in inventories 
cash used in investing activities during was million as compared to million in and million in in  we used this cash primarily to implement our customer relationship management information system 
in  we purchased furniture and fixtures for our new corporate headquarters in chanhassen  minnesota and invested in our new information and phone systems and engineering laboratory equipment 
our uses reflected expenditures for engineering and lab equipment  the purchase of land adjacent to our new corporate headquarters facility and a  deposit on the new corporate headquarters that we began leasing in june the uses also included million to acquire the data storage and services business of opensystems 
com  inc cash provided by financing activities during was million 
cash used in financing activities was  in and million in in  we received million from a direct private offering of newly issued common stock to institutional investors and  from stock sold under our employee stock purchase plan 
the cash provided was partially offset by the final scheduled payment of  on a note due to a former stockholder 
in  we made a scheduled payment of  on a note due to a former stockholder  which was partially offset by  of proceeds from our employee stock purchase plan and stock option exercises 
in  we used  to make a final dividend distribution to the ten pre initial public offering stockholders related to their tax liabilities 
we also made a scheduled payment of  on the former shareholder s note 
these uses were partially offset by  of proceeds from stock purchases under our employee stock purchase plan 
effective june   we signed a new credit agreement with a commercial bank that provides for an million revolving line of credit for financing our working capital needs 
the term of the agreement ends june  borrowings under the line of credit are secured by our accounts receivable and inventory and are subject to certain financial and operating covenants  including covenants that require us to maintain a maximum level of funded debt ebitda ratio and a minimum amount of working capital  tangible net worth and debt net worth ratio 
at december   we were in compliance with all covenants under this agreement 
we had no outstanding borrowings as of december  for more information  see note of the notes to our financial statements 
in  we signed an year non cancelable operating lease for our new corporate headquarters in chanhassen  minnesota 
the lease requires base rental payments of approximately million in the first year and million for each subsequent year 
for more information  see note of the notes to our financial statements 
in february  we redeemed  shares of common stock held by one of our former stockholders and issued him a million note payable in four installments through february we made principal payments of   and  on this note in august  february and february  respectively 
we made our final payment of  on this note in february  leaving datalink with no outstanding debt 
as of december   our contractual cash obligations consisting of future minimum lease payments due under non cancelable operating leases are as follows year ended total in thousands future we believe that funds generated from operations  together with the available credit under our revolving credit agreement  will be sufficient to finance our current operations and planned capital expenditures for at least the next twelve months 
we are planning for  to million of capital expenditures through primarily related to enhancements to our management information systems 
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect reported earnings 
we evaluate these estimates and assumptions on an on going basis based on historical experience and on other factors that we believe are reasonable 
estimates and assumptions include  but are not limited to  the areas of customer receivables  inventories  investments  income taxes  self insurance reserves and commitments and contingencies 
we believe that the following represent the areas where more critical estimates and assumptions are used in the preparation of the financial statements revenue recognition 
as discussed above  we recognize revenues from hardware and software product sales only after all functionally essential portions of the installation services have been completed and the product is functioning properly rather than upon shipment 
we recognize all professional service revenue  including installation and consulting service revenue  when the service is rendered 
we believe this policy minimizes management s judgments over the timing and extent of revenue recognition 
revenues from maintenance contracts are recognized ratably over the period of the contract 
although this policy that we adopted on january  contains very specific guidelines for measuring revenue  certain judgments do affect the application of our revenue policy  such as evaluating multiple element arrangements 
inventory 
we periodically review  estimate and adjust our reserves for obsolete or unmarketable inventory equal to the difference between the inventory cost and the estimated market value based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions 
results could be materially different if demand for our products decreased because of economic or competitive conditions  length of industry downturn  or if products become obsolete because of technical advancements in the industry 
valuation of goodwill and other intangible assets 
on january   we adopted statement of financial accounting standards sfas  goodwill and other intangible assets  and reclassified  of assembled workforce to goodwill 
as a result  we have ceased to amortize approximately million of goodwill 
goodwill is tested for impairment annually or more frequently if changes in circumstance or the occurrence of events suggests an impairment exists 
the test for impairment requires us to make several estimates about fair value  most of which are based on total market capitalization as compared to the carrying value of our net assets 
if our total market capitalization is at or below the carrying value of our net assets for several quarters  it may prompt us to engage a third party valuation firm to perform a valuatio n of us to further assess whether our goodwill or other intangibles are impaired pursuant to sfas we consider our goodwill impairment test estimates critical due to the amount of goodwill recorded on our balance sheet and the judgment required in determining fair value amounts 
other intangible assets consist of customer lists 
we amortize customer lists using the straight line method over an estimated useful life of five years 
we review these intangible assets for impairment as changes in circumstance or the occurrence of events suggests the remaining value is not recoverable 
income taxes 
we utilize the liability method of accounting for income taxes 
we recognize deferred tax liabilities or assets for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the book and tax bases of assets and liabilities 
we regularly assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income we record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amounts we believe to be realizable 
we consider projected future taxable income and ongoing tax planning strategies in assessing the amount of the valuation allowance 
if we determine it is more likely than not that we will not realize all or part of our deferred tax assets  we will adjust our earnings for the deferred tax in the period we make this determination 
as a result of our cumulative losses over the past two years and the full utilization of our loss carryback potential  we concluded during the fourth quarter of fiscal to make a full valuation allowance against our net deferred tax assets 
the valuation allowance at december  was million 
in addition  we expect to provide a full valuation allowance on any future tax benefits until we can sustain a level of profitability that demonstrates our ability to utilize these assets 
recent accounting pronouncements in june  the financial accounting standards board issued sfas no 
accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities 
sfas no 
supersedes eitf no 
the principle difference between sfas no 
and eitf no 
relates to when an entity can recognize a liability related to exit or disposal activities 
sfas no 
requires a liability be recognized for a cost associated with an exit or disposal activity when the liability is incurred 
eitf no 
allowed a liability  related to an exit or disposal activity  to be recognized at the date an entity commits to an exit plan 
the provisions of sfas no 
are effective on january  accordingly  we will apply this standard to all exit or disposal activities initiated after january  in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
 stock compensation 
sfas no 
provides alternative methods of transition for a voluntary change to the fair value based method of accounting for stock based employee compensation 
in addition  sfas no 
amends the disclosure requirements of sfas no 
to require prominent disclosures in both annual and interim financial statements about the method of accounting for stock based employee compensation and the effect of the method used on reported results 
we do not plan to change our method of accounting for stock based employee compensation 
we will make the required interim disclosures effective with the quarter ending march  in december  the eitf issued eitf  revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables 
this issue addresses certain aspects of the accounting by a vendor for arrangements under which it will perform multiple revenue generating activities 
in some arrangements  the different revenue generating activities deliverables are sufficiently separable  and there exists sufficient evidence of their fair values to separately account for some or all of the deliverables that is  there are separate units of accounting 
in other arrangements  some or all of the deliverables are not independently functional  or there is not sufficient evidence of their fair values to account for them separately 
this issue addresses when and  if so  how an arrangement involving multiple deliverables should be divided into separate units of accounting 
this issue does not change otherwise applicable revenue recognition criteria 
this issue is applicable for us for fiscal and could have an impact on revenue recognition of future sales transactions 
inflation we do not believe that inflation has had a material effect on our results of operations in recent years 
we cannot assure you that inflation will not adversely affect our business in the future 
risk factors current economic conditions adversely impact our revenues and profits 
since mid  we have experienced a very difficult and competitive operating environment 
this uncertainty was further complicated by the world events such as the terrorist attacks on the united states in september and the current threat of war in iraq 
the high level of economic uncertainty has led to an overall reduction in capital spending  including spending for technology 
some of our customers have canceled or delayed planned purchases 
others have replaced large storage solution installation projects with smaller  piecemeal projects that carry lower profit margins for us 
competition for available business has also affected our margins 
we cannot predict the continuing effect of current economic conditions on our business 
if our revenues and cash flows continue to be adversely affected  we may need to further reduce our expenses or personnel 
this could adversely affect our ability to capitalize on future technology spending by our customers at such time as economic conditions improve 
competition could prevent us from increasing or sustaining our revenues or profitability 
the enterprise class information storage market is rapidly evolving and highly competitive 
as technologies change rapidly  we expect that competition will increase in the future 
we compete with independent storage system suppliers to the high end market and numerous resellers  distributors and consultants 
we also compete in the storage systems market with general purpose computer suppliers 
many of our current and potential competitors have significantly greater financial  technical  marketing  purchasing and other resources than we do 
as a result  they may respond more quickly to new or emerging technologies and changes in customer requirements  devote greater resources to the development  promotion and sale of products and deliver competitive products at lower end user prices 
some of our current and potential competitors include our suppliers 
we are not the exclusive supplier of any data storage product we offer 
instead  our suppliers market their products through other independent data storage solution providers  original equipment manufacturers and  often  through their own internal sales forces 
we believe direct competition from our suppliers is likely to increase if  as expected  the data storage industry continues to consolidate 
this consolidation would probably result in fewer suppliers with greater resources to devote to internal sales and marketing efforts 
in addition  our suppliers have established and will probably continue to establish cooperative relationships with other suppliers and other data storage solution providers 
these cooperative relationships are often intended to enable our suppliers to offer comprehensive storage solutions  which compete with those we offer 
if our relationships with our suppliers become adversarial  it will be more difficult for us to stay ahead of industry developments and provide our customers with the type of service they expect from us 
in addition  most of our customers already employ in house technical staffs 
to the extent a customer s in house technical staff develops sophisticated storage systems expertise  the customer may be less likely to seek our services 
further  we compete with storage service providers who manage  store and backup their customers data at off site  networked data storage locations 
future goodwill impairment may unpredictably affect our financial results 
under new sec accounting rules  we no longer amortize goodwill 
instead  we perform impairment analyses of our goodwill at least annually or when we believe there is an impairment 
future events could cause us to conclude that impairment indicators exist and that goodwill associated with our acquired businesses is further impaired 
any resulting impairment loss could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations 
we derive a significant percentage of our revenues from a small number of customers 
in  we derived of our revenues from one customer  and our top five customers collectively accounted for of our revenues 
because we intend to continue to seek out large projects  we expect that a significant percentage of our revenues will continue to come from a small number of customers  although the composition of our key customers is likely to change from year to year 
if we fail to obtain a growing number of large projects each year  our revenues and profitability will likely be adversely affected 
in addition  our reliance on large projects makes it more likely that our revenues and profits will fluctuate unpredictably from year to year 
unpredictable revenue and profit fluctuations may make our stock price more volatile and lead to a decline in our stock price 
our revenue recognition policies unpredictably defer reporting of our revenues 
we increasingly sell complex enterprise class information storage solutions 
we do not recognize revenues from our sale of hardware and software products to our customers until we complete our required installation or configuration of these products 
installation and configuration of these solutions requires significant coordination with our customers and vendors 
therefore  even if we have shipped all products to our customers  we may be unable to control the timing of product installation and configuration 
these delays prevent us from recognizing revenue on products we ship and may adversely affect our quarterly reported revenues 
as a result  our stock price may decline 
we rely on only a few key suppliers and would suffer materially if we could not obtain their products 
we rely on our close relationships with our suppliers to provide access to products and new technology necessary to design and implement leading edge enterprise class information storage solutions for our customers 
we do not have long term supply contracts with any of our suppliers 
in many instances  we rely upon only one or two suppliers for each of our key products 
our reliance on these suppliers leaves us vulnerable to an inadequate supply of required products  price increases  late deliveries and poor product quality 
disruption or termination of the supply of products from our suppliers for any reason would likely prevent or delay our shipments to our customers 
our customers expect reliable and prompt service from us 
if we cannot obtain necessary components  or the components we obtain are unreliable or unexpectedly expensive  we will not meet our customers expectations 
if we cannot meet our customers expectations  our business will suffer considerably 
our growth plans depend in part on our ability to successfully complete acquisitions 
as part of our growth plan  we intend to continue to pursue strategic acquisitions of businesses that give us access to additional qualified technical personnel and either expand or complement our business 
to date we have completed two such acquisitions 
however  our last acquisition was in november and we cannot assure any further acquisitions 
if we do not make more suitable acquisitions  we will find it more difficult to realize our growth objectives 
if we do make acquisitions  we will face a number of other risks and challenges  including the difficulty of integrating dissimilar operations or assets  assimilation of new employees who may not initially contribute at the levels we expect from our other employees  diversion of management time and resources  increases in administrative costs  including amortization of purchased intangible assets  potential loss of key employees of an acquired company  and additional costs associated with obtaining any necessary financing 
these factors and our limited experience in negotiating  consummating and integrating acquisitions could hamper our ability to realize our growth objectives  and could adversely affect our business  earnings  financial condition and  ultimately  our stock price 
acquisitions that use stock as payment also could result in dilution of our per share earnings  and of your voting rights 
our business depends on our ability to hire and retain technical personnel 
our future operating results depend upon our ability to attract  retain and motivate qualified engineers with enterprise class information storage solutions experience 
if we fail to recruit and retain additional engineering personnel   or if continued losses require us in the future to terminate employment of some of these personnel  we will experience greater difficulty realizing our growth strategy  which could negatively affect our business  financial condition and stock price 
we generally do not have employment agreements with our key employees 
our future operating results depend in significant part upon the continued contributions of our executive officers  managers  salespeople  engineers and other technical personnel  many who have substantial experience in our industry and would be difficult to replace 
in general  we do not have employment  non competition or nondisclosure agreements with our officers or employees  including our executive officers 
accordingly  our employees may voluntarily leave us at any time and work for our competitors 
our growth strategy depends in part on our ability to retain our current employees and hire new employees 
any failure to retain our key employees will make it much more difficult for us to maintain our operations and attain our growth objectives and could therefore be expected to adversely affect our operating results  financial condition and stock price 
if we cannot effectively manage our future growth  our business may suffer 
our planned growth and expansion  if realized in light of current economic conditions  would place a significant strain on our administrative  operational and financial resources 
this growth may also increase demands on our professional and technical services  sales  marketing and customer service and support functions 
our planned geographic expansion may exacerbate these challenges and require us to hire  train  motivate and manage new management  technical  sales and administrative employees 
if we manage this planned growth poorly  we may be unable to continue to provide our customers with the high level of technical service and expertise they expect from us 
this failure would harm our reputation  hamper our ability to grow and adversely affect our financial condition and stock price 
if the data storage industry fails to develop compelling new storage technologies  our business may suffer 
rapid and complex technological change  frequent new product introductions and evolving industry standards increase demand for our services 
because of this  our future success depends in part on the data storage industry s ability to continue to develop leading edge storage technology solutions 
our customers utilize our services in part because they know that newer technologies offer them significant benefits over the older technologies they are using 
if the data storage industry ceases to develop compelling new storage solutions  or if a single data storage standard becomes widely accepted and implemented  it will be more difficult to sell new data storage systems to our customers 
our long sales cycle may cause fluctuating operating results  which may adversely affect our stock price 
our sales cycle is typically long and unpredictable  making it difficult to plan our business 
current economic conditions have increased this uncertainty 
our long sales cycle requires us to invest resources in potential projects that may not occur 
in addition  our long and unpredictable sales cycle may cause us to experience significant fluctuations in our future annual and quarterly operating results 
it can also result in delayed revenues  difficulty in matching revenues with expenses and increased expenditures 
our business  operating results or financial condition and stock price may suffer as a result of any of these factors 
control by our existing stockholders could discourage the potential acquisition of our business 
currently  our executive officers  directors and or greater stockholders and their affiliates beneficially own approximately of our outstanding common stock 
acting together  these insiders could elect our entire board of directors and control the outcome of all other matters requiring stockholder approval 
this voting concentration may also have the effect of delaying or preventing a change in our management or control or otherwise discourage potential acquirers from attempting to gain control of us 
if potential acquirers are deterred  you may lose an opportunity to profit from a possible acquisition premium in our stock price 
our stock price is volatile 
the market price of our common stock has fluctuated significantly since our initial public offering  and may continue to be volatile 
we cannot assure you that our stock price will increase  or even that it will not decline significantly from the price you pay 
our stock price may be adversely affected by many factors  including actual or anticipated fluctuations in our operating results  announcements of technical innovations  new products or services offered by us  our suppliers or our competitors  changes in estimates by securities analysts of our future financial performance  and general market conditions  including the effects of current economic conditions and war and terrorism threats 
in addition  the stock market has recently experienced significant downward price fluctuations 
over the past several years  companies in the technology sector  such as datalink  have experienced more stock price volatility than companies in other sectors of the market and may be more vulnerable to price declines in the event of a general market decline 
our governing documents and minnesota law may discourage the potential acquisitions of our business 
our board of directors may issue additional shares of capital stock and establish their rights  preferences and classes  in some cases without stockholder approval 
in addition  we are subject to anti takeover provisions of minnesota law 
these provisions may deter or discourage takeover attempts and other changes in control of us not approved by our board of directors 
if potential acquirers are deterred  you may lose an opportunity to profit from a possible acquisition premium in our stock price 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our interest income is sensitive to changes in the general level of us interest rates  particularly since the majority of our investments are in short term instruments 
due to the nature of our short term investments  we do not believe that we have any material market risk exposure 
therefore  no quantitative tabular disclosures are required 
the following discusses our exposure to market risk related to changes in interest rates  foreign exchange rates and equity prices 
interest rate risk 
as of december   we had million of cash and money market accounts 
a decrease in market rates of interest would have no material effect on the value of these assets or the related interest income due to the nature of money market accounts 
we have no short or long term debt 
foreign currency exchange rate risk 
we develop and sell all of our products in the united states 
therefore  we are not currently exposed to any direct foreign currency exchange rate risk 
equity price risk 
we do not own any equity investments 
therefore  we are not currently exposed to any direct equity price risk
