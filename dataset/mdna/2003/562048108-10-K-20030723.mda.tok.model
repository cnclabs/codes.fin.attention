item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
the following section provides a narrative discussion about manatron s financial condition  changes in financial condition and results of operations 
the comments that follow should be read in conjunction with the company s consolidated financial statements and related notes thereto appearing elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
critical accounting policies and estimates management s discussion and analysis of its results of operations and financial condition are based upon the company s consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires the company to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  the company evaluates its estimates  including those related to receivable allowances  long term service contracts  intangible assets  contingencies and litigation 
the company bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
the company believes the following critical accounting policies affect its more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements 
the company recognizes revenues in accordance with the provisions of the american institute of certified public accountants statement of position sop  software revenue recognition  as amended by sop and sop  as well as technical practice aids issued from time to time by the american institute of certified public accountants  and in accordance with the sec staff accounting bulletin no 
revenue recognition in financial statements 
the company s revenues are derived from software licenses  hardware  postcontract customer support maintenance and services that typically range from installation  training and basic consulting to software modification and customization to meet specific customer needs 
for multiple element software arrangements  which do not entail the performance of services that are considered essential to the functionality of the software  the company generally records revenue when the delivered products or performed services result in a legally enforceable claim 
for software arrangements that include customization of the software which is considered essential to its functionality and for real estate appraisal outsourcing projects  the company recognizes revenue and profit as the work progresses using the percentage of completion method 
this method relies on estimates of total expected contract revenue  billings and collections  and expected contract costs 
the company follows this method since reasonably dependable estimates of the revenue and costs applicable to various stages of a contract can be made 
at times  the company performs additional and or non contractual services for little to no incremental fee to satisfy the customers expectations 
recognized revenues and profit are subject to revisions such as the type just described as the contract progresses to completion 
revisions to future profit estimates are charged to income in the period in which the facts that give rise to the revision first become known 
the company maintains allowances for doubtful accounts  including billed retainages  which are provided at the time the revenue is recognized 
the company also provides for reserves on revenues earned in excess of billings and retainages on long term contracts 
the company reserves a portion of the gross under billed position associated with contracts recognized based on percentage of completion accounting  which historically has approximated of the gross under billed amount 
this reserve contains a general provision of of the gross under billed position as well as a specific provision for accounts the company believes will be difficult to collect 
this reserve methodology is consistent with the methodology utilized in calculating the company s allowance for doubtful accounts related to its accounts receivable 
because of the nature of its customers  which are predominantly governmental entities  the company does not generally incur losses resulting from the inabi lity of its customers to make required payments 
alternatively  customers may become dissatisfied with the functionality of the software products and or the quality of the services provided and request a reduction to the aggregate contract price 
while the company engages in extensive product and service quality programs and processes  the company s allowances for such contract price reductions are continually monitored by management 
in connection with its customer contracts and the related adequacy of its reserves and measures of progress towards completion  the company s project managers are charged with the responsibility of continually reviewing the status of each customer on a specific contract basis 
in addition  management reviews on a quarterly basis significant past due account receivables and the related adequacy of the company s reserves 
the company has approximately million of goodwill recorded as of april   related to prior acquisitions 
a new accounting standard adopted in fiscal  requires that goodwill be reviewed for impairment at least annually and as indicators of impairment occur 
the annual evaluation of goodwill impairment requires the use of estimates about the future cash flows of each reporting unit to determine estimated fair values 
changes in forecasted operations and changes in discount rates can materially affect these estimates 
the company capitalizes software development costs incurred subsequent to the establishment of technological feasibility on a specific software project 
this intangible asset is amortized over an estimated useful life of not greater than three years 
the unamortized balance of capitalized software is reviewed for impairment annually or whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable by calculating the net realizable value for each respective product 
the net realizable value is the estimated future gross revenues from a product reduced by the estimated future costs of completing and disposing of that product 
changes in forecasted operations  driven primarily by market trends and customer demand  can materially affect the estimates of net realizable value 
results of operations fiscal year compared to fiscal year total net revenues of million and million for the three months and year ended april   were approximately and lower than the net revenues of million and million that were reported for the three months and year ended april   respectively 
software systems and services segment revenues were comparable at approximately million and million for the three months ended april  and  respectively 
software systems and services segment revenues have increased by approximately to million for fiscal  compared to million for fiscal these revenues generally include software license fees  hardware sales  forms and supply sales and various professional services  such as software support  data conversions  installation  training  project management  hardware maintenance and forms processing and printing 
the year over year increase was primarily due to growth in professional services of million and recurring support revenues of million over the prior year 
the increase in professional services revenue is due to the execution of a number of new mvp tax and proval contracts in indiana and the southeast region during fiscal  as well as continued progress on the larger mvp tax projects in cuyahoga county  ohio  dauphin county  pennsylvania  baltimore  maryland and jefferson county  alabama 
mvp tax is currently being utilized by counties in four states and is in the process of implementation in three additional states 
the increase in recurring support revenues is due to a number of new software installations and annual price increases 
recurring support and maintenance and printing services represent approximately  or million  of this segment s annual revenue 
software license fees of million for fiscal  which represent approximately of this segment s annual revenue were approximately lower than the million recognized in fiscal this decline is due to the down economy and a few of the company s larger development projects taking longer to complete than initially anticipated 
appraisal service segment revenues  which include fees for mass real estate appraisals or revaluations  have decreased by to million for the three months ended april  and by to million for fiscal these anticipated decreases are the result of the cyclical nature of this segment s business activities 
the company s largest market for these services  ohio  uses a six year cycle for revaluations 
the company expects revenues from this segment to begin to increase again in fiscal  as demonstrated by the growth in backlog 
the company s backlog for appraisal services at april   of million is significantly higher than the million reported as of april  while the company continues to actively pursue new appraisal service contracts  efforts are being primarily focused on its traditional markets in ohio  indiana and pennsylvania where the company has historically been more successful in executing profitable contracts 
as noted in prior years  the company has reserved of retainage revenue related to the allegheny county appraisal project and a portion of the gross under billed position associated with appraisal contracts recognized based on percentage of completion accounting  which historically has approximated of the gross under billed amount 
this reserve contains a general provision of of the gross under billed position as well as a specific provision for accounts the company believes will be difficult to collect 
this reserve methodology is consistent with the methodology utilized in calculating the company s allowance for doubtful accounts related to its accounts receivable 
as of april  and  the total reserve against retainage revenue remaining under all appraisal service projects including allegheny was approximately  and  respectively 
as of april   the total reserve against retainage revenue under the allegheny county projec t was approximately  for both periods 
the company continues to believe it is appropriate to reserve of the remaining unpaid allegheny retention as well as certain other monies due for the performance of additional services in connection with that contract  because certain officials of allegheny county have continued to contest the payment of such amounts 
the ultimate collection of these monies is pending an order from the judge who initially ordered the reassessment  which is expected to be issued by the end of calendar cost of revenues of million for the three months ended april   decreased by compared to million for the three months ended april  annual cost of revenues decreased by from million in the prior fiscal year to million for the year ended april  these decreases are primarily due to a shift in the mix of revenues and costs generated by the company s two reportable segments as well as the decrease in net revenues for fiscal the software systems and services segment typically yields a higher gross margin than the appraisal services segment  which is highly labor intensive 
while margins for the software systems and services segment were approximately for the three months and year ended april  and  this segment accounts for a larger portion of the overall revenues and related costs  which has caused the combined margin to increase over the prior year comparable periods 
selling  general and administrative expenses have decreased by approximately  or to million for the three months ended april   and increased by approximately  or to million for the fiscal year ended april  the annual increase is primarily due to the company s continued investment in its software products  which is an integral component of the company s growth strategy 
research and development costs of approximately million and million were included in selling  general and administrative expense for the three months and year ended april   respectively as compared to  and million for the three months and year ended april  these increases were primarily due to increased development activities associated with the mvp tax and internet products and the increased utilization of outsourced third party developers in fiscal and the company also incurred approximately  of b ad debt expense during fiscal primarily to reserve for the remaining east coast exposure associated with the appraisal services segment 
these increases were offset by the discontinuance of goodwill amortization due to the implementation of sfas no 
the effect of discontinuing the amortization of goodwill benefited the current quarter net income by approximately  or 
per diluted share and net income for fiscal by  or 
per diluted share 
as a result of the factors noted above  the company reported substantial improvements in its operating income for the three months and year ended april  operating income increased approximately  to  for the three months and million to million for the fiscal year ended april  net other income for the three months and year ended april  increased by approximately  and  to approximately  and  respectively 
the improvement in net other income for both the three months and year ended april  is due to increased interest income associated with the company s growing cash balances as well as rental income generated from leasing back half of the building acquired during fiscal in portage  michigan to the prior owner 
the company s provision for federal income taxes generally fluctuates with the level of pretax income 
the effective tax rates for the three months and year ended april  are approximately equal to the statutory rate  which is 
the current year effective rate is substantially lower than the prior year because of the implementations of sfas no 
sfas no 
eliminated goodwill amortization expense  which was primarily non deductible for tax purposes 
net income was approximately  or 
per diluted share for the three months ended april   versus net income of approximately  or 
per diluted share for the three months ended april  net income for fiscal was million or 
per diluted share compared to net income of approximately million or 
per diluted share for fiscal diluted weighted average outstanding common shares increased by  shares for the three months and  shares for the year ended april  these increases are due to the issuance of stock associated with the company s employee stock purchase plan  the issuance of stock associated with the proval post merger contingent stock agreement  as well as the inclusion of additional shares within the diluted weighted average base as fewer options are under water than in the prior year comparable periods 
these increases were partially offset by the repurchase of  shares of common s tock by the company during fiscal in accordance with its previously announced repurchase program 
results of operations fiscal year compared to fiscal year net revenues were comparable at approximately million and million for the three months and year ended april  and  respectively 
however  fiscal fourth quarter and annual revenues included  and  respectively  of non recurring retention revenue associated with allegheny county  as described below 
when these amounts are excluded  net revenues actually increased by and for the three months and year ended april   respectively  over the fiscal comparable periods 
the components of revenues were essentially the same as noted for fiscal excluding the  and  of retention revenue noted above  appraisal service segment net revenues decreased by approximately and for the three months and year ended april   in comparison to the three months and year ended april  the allegheny county project accounted for of the appraisal service segment s net revenues for the year ended april  in comparison to for the year ended april  the company s backlog for appraisal services at april   decreased by approximately million to million compared to approximately million at april  both the decreases in fiscal revenues and backlog were due primarily to the wind down of the million allegheny county contract and the cyclical nature of this business 
as previously noted  the ohio market is on a six year cycle and the allegheny county project was an unusually large and non recurring contract 
as discussed above  the company had reserved of retainage revenue related to the allegheny county appraisal project and of the retainage revenue on all other appraisal service projects due to the high degree of uncertainty regarding their ultimate collection created by the political nature of this segment 
typically  appraisal service contracts result in increased property valuations and taxes for many county constituents  which creates additional work on the back end of these contracts to defend challenged values 
during the three months and year ended april   the company collected and recognized approximately  and  respectively  of retention revenue on the allegheny county project 
as of april  and  the total reserve against retainage revenue remaining under all appraisal service projects including allegheny county was approximately  and  respectively 
as of april  and  the total reserve against retainage revenue remaining under the allegheny county project was approximately  and  respectively 
the company believes it was appropriate to reserve of the remaining unpaid allegheny retention as well as certain other monies due for the performance of additional services since certain officials at allegheny county were contesting the payment of such amounts and their ultimate collection was pending an order from the judge who initially ordered the reassessment 
software systems and services segment revenues increased by approximately and for the three months and year ended april   versus the comparable periods in fiscal this growth was primarily due to the execution of a number of new mvp tax and mvp tax manager software contracts in the florida  indiana and ohio regions  as well as a number of new proval contract executions in the indiana region 
in addition  overall business in fiscal increased given that fiscal was negatively impacted by the national election and the post yk slowdown 
cost of revenues of million for the three months ended april  decreased compared to million for the three months ended april  annual cost of revenues decreased by from million in fiscal  to million for the year ended april  these decreases were primarily due to the reduction in appraisal service revenues noted above 
cost of revenues for fiscal were adversely effected by approximately million due to a number of appraisal service contracts in the northeast that were not completed on time or on budget 
however  there still was an improvement in gross margins for both the three and month periods ended april   over the comparable fiscal periods  when the impact of the allegheny retention revenue mentioned above is excluded 
this happened because the costs associated with allegheny retention were incurred in periods prior to fiscal this was due to a favorable shift in the mix of revenues from appraisal services to software and services 
software license fees typically yield a higher gross margin than appraisal services revenues and were a larger portion of total revenues in fiscal versus fiscal selling  general and administrative expenses increased by approximately to million for the three months ended april  compared to million for the three months ended april  selling  general and administrative expenses increased from million for the year ended april  to million for the year ended april  these increases were primarily due to increases in workers compensation premiums  salary increases  a ramp up in sales and marketing activities and higher sales commissions over the fiscal comparable periods 
as a result of the factors noted above  the company reported substantial improvements in its operating income in fiscal versus fiscal excluding the impact of the allegheny retention revenue noted above  operating income increased by approximately  for the three months and million for the year ended april  net interest income for the year ended april   was approximately  compared to net interest expense of  for the year ended april  this improvement was directly related to the reduction in the company s bank borrowings and increase in cash balances during fiscal the effective tax rate for both the three months and year ended april  was approximately 
this effective tax rate is substantially higher than the statutory rate of primarily because of the large amount of non deductible goodwill amortization related to certain of the company s acquisitions relative to the level of pretax income 
as a result of the factors noted above  the company reported an approximate  increase in its net income to approximately  or 
per diluted share for the three months ended april   compared to approximately  or 
l per diluted share for the fourth quarter in fiscal the company reported a million increase in its net income of  or 
per diluted share for the year ended april   versus a net loss of  or 
per diluted share for the year ended april  diluted weighted average outstanding common shares increased by approximately  shares for the twelve months ended april   compared to fiscal this increase was primarily due to the fact that potentially dilutive shares were excluded from the earnings per share calculations in the prior year due to the net loss that was reported 
quarterly results the following table sets forth selected unaudited quarterly financial data for the last eight quarters fiscal fiscal for the quarter ended april  january  october  july  april  january  october  july  net revenues gross profit income from operations net income basic earnings per share diluted earnings per share at quarter end cash and short term investments total assets shareholders equity book value per share financial condition and liquidity working capital of  at april   has increased by compared to the  that was reported at april  these levels reflect current ratios of and  respectively 
the improvement in both working capital and the current ratio is primarily due to cash flows from operations during fiscal resulting from increased profitability and cash collections 
shareholders equity at april   increased by  to  from the balance reported at april  this was due to  of net income   of employee stock purchases   of deferred compensation expense and  of stock issued or to be issued in connection with the post merger earn out agreement related to the proval acquisition see note for the year ended april  these increases were offset by  of company stock repurchases 
as a result  book value per share increased to as of april   from at april the nature of the company s business is generally not property or equipment intensive 
net capital expenditures of approximately million for the year ended april   were  higher than the prior year amount of  this increase is primarily attributable to the acquisition of a  square foot building that adjoins the company s current corporate facility in portage  michigan 
the company paid  in cash for the building in addition to  for related building improvements 
the company is leasing back approximately of this additional space to the prior owner for years and plans to use  square feet of the remaining space for growth and rent out the other  square feet until it is needed by the company 
current year expenditures also include approximately  for renovations  furniture and fixtures associated with the relocation of the company s canton  springfield and dayton  ohio offices  and the expansion of the t ampa  florida office 
the company s dayton and springfield offices were consolidated in one new office in beavercreek  ohio 
the remaining fiscal and expenditures related to purchases or upgrades of computer hardware and software used by the company s development and support personnel 
the company s future contractual obligations for operating leases with initial terms greater than one year are summarized as follows for the fiscal years ended april thereafter since the company s revenues are generated from contracts with local governmental entities  it is not uncommon for certain of its accounts receivable to remain outstanding for approximately three to four months  thereby having a negative impact upon cash flow 
the company currently has a secured line of credit agreement with comerica bank at the prime rate of interest less  up to a maximum of million 
borrowing limits under this agreement are contingent on meeting certain funded debt to ebitda levels 
as of april   the company had no borrowings outstanding under its million line of credit 
the company anticipates that the line of credit  together with existing cash balances  and cash generated from future operations  will be sufficient for the company to meet its working capital requirements for the foreseeable future 
on october   the board of directors authorized the company to repurchase up to  of the company s common stock for a month period 
since october   the company has repurchased  shares of common stock for approximately  under this program 
in addition  the company repurchased  shares of common stock totaling approximately  under a similar program approved on october   during the second quarter of fiscal the company cannot determine precisely the effect of inflation on its business 
the company continues  however  to experience relatively stable costs for its inventory and equipment as the computer hardware market is very competitive 
the company anticipates that inflationary price increases related to labor and overhead will have a negative effect on cash flow and net income to the extent that the increases cannot be offset through improved productivity and price increases

potential negative side effects stemming from the company s expansion into new regional markets  including canada as a result of this expansion  the company may face unanticipated pitfalls 
pricing and availability of equipment  materials  inventories and programming 
changes in existing computer software and service industry laws or the introduction of new laws  regulations or policies that could affect the company s business practices  including  by way of example  intellectual property laws and laws affecting software providers liability these laws  regulations or policies could impact the computer software and service industry as a whole  or could impact only those portions of the computer software and service industry in which the company is currently active  for example  privacy laws regulating how governmental units store and provide access to information  in either case  the company s profitability could be injured due to an industry wide market decline or due to the company s inability to compete with other computer software and service industry companies that are unaffected by these laws  regulations or policies
