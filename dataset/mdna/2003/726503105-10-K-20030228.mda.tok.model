ii part i items and business and properties general we are a publicly traded delaware limited partnership the partnership engaged in interstate and intrastate marketing  transportation and terminalling of crude oil and marketing of liquefied petroleum gas lpg 
we were formed in september to acquire and operate the midstream crude oil business and assets of plains resources inc and its wholly owned subsidiaries plains resources as a separate  publicly traded master limited partnership 
we completed our initial public offering in november immediately after our initial public offering  plains resources owned of our general partner interest and an overall effective ownership in the partnership of including the general partner interest and common and subordinated units owned by it 
as discussed below  plains resources effective ownership interest in the partnership has been reduced substantially 
in may  senior management and a group of financial investors entered into a transaction with plains resources to acquire majority control of our general partner and a majority of the outstanding subordinated units 
the transaction closed in june and  for purposes of this report  is referred to as the general partner transition 
as a result of this transaction and subsequent equity offerings  plains resources overall effective ownership in us was reduced to approximately 
see item security ownership of certain beneficial owners and management 
in addition  certain senior officers of the general partner that previously were also officers of plains resources  terminated their affiliation with plains resources and now devote of their efforts to the management of the partnership 
the general partner interest is now held by plains aap  lp  a delaware limited partnership 
plains all american gp llc  a delaware limited liability company  is plains aap  lp s general partner 
plains all american gp llc manages our operations and activities and employs our officers and personnel 
unless the context otherwise requires  we use the term general partner to refer to both plains aap  lp and plains all american gp llc 
we use the phrase former general partner to refer to the subsidiary of plains resources that formerly held the general partner interest 
our operations are concentrated in texas  oklahoma  california and louisiana and in the canadian provinces of alberta and saskatchewan  and can be categorized into two primary business activities crude oil pipeline transportation operations 
we own and operate over  miles of gathering and mainline crude oil pipelines located throughout the united states and canada 
our activities from pipeline operations generally consist of transporting crude oil for a fee  third party leases of pipeline capacity  barrel exchanges and buy sell arrangements 
gathering  marketing  terminalling and storage operations 
we own and operate approximately million barrels of above ground crude oil terminalling and storage facilities  including tankage associated with our pipeline systems 
these facilities include a crude oil terminalling and storage facility at cushing  oklahoma 
cushing  which we refer to in this report as the cushing interchange  is one of the largest crude oil market hubs in the united states and the designated delivery point for nymex crude oil futures contracts 
our terminalling and storage operations generate revenue through a combination of storage and throughput charges to third parties 
we also utilize our storage tanks to counter cyclically balance our gathering and marketing operations and to execute different hedging strategies to stabilize profits and reduce the negative impact of crude oil market volatility 
see crude oil volatility  counter cyclical balance  risk management 
our gathering and marketing operations include the purchase of crude oil at the wellhead and the bulk purchase of crude oil at pipeline and terminal facilities  the transportation of crude oil on trucks  barges and pipelines  the subsequent resale or exchange of crude oil at various points along the crude oil distribution chain  and the purchase of lpg from producers  refiners and other marketers  and the sale of lpg to wholesalers  retailers and industrial end users 
business strategy our business strategy is to capitalize on the regional crude oil and lpg supply and demand imbalances that exist in the united states and canada by combining the strategic location and unique capabilities of our transportation and terminalling assets with our extensive marketing and distribution expertise to generate sustainable earnings and cash flow 
we intend to execute our business strategy by increasing and optimizing throughput on our existing pipeline and gathering assets and realizing cost efficiencies through operational improvements  utilizing and expanding our cushing terminal and our other assets to service the needs of refiners and to profit from merchant activities that take advantage of crude oil pricing and quality differentials  selectively pursuing strategic and accretive acquisitions of crude oil and lpg transportation assets  including pipelines  gathering systems  terminalling and storage facilities and other assets that complement our existing asset base and distribution capabilities  and optimizing and expanding our canadian operations to take advantage of anticipated increases in the volume and qualities of crude oil produced in canada and exported to us markets 
financial strategy we believe that a major factor in our continued success will be our ability to maintain a low cost of capital and access to the capital markets 
since our initial public offering in  we have consistently communicated to the financial community our intention to maintain a strong credit profile that we believe is consistent with our goal of achieving and maintaining an investment grade credit rating 
we have targeted a general credit profile with the following attributes an average long term debt to total capitalization ratio of approximately or less  an average long term debt to ebitda ratio of approximately x or less  and an average ebitda to interest coverage ratio of approximately x or better 
as of december   we were within our targeted credit profile 
in order for us to maintain our targeted credit profile and achieve growth through acquisitions  we intend to fund acquisitions using approximately equal proportions of equity and debt 
because it is likely that acquisitions will initially be financed using debt and it is difficult to predict the actual timing of accessing the market to raise equity  from time to time we may be temporarily outside the parameters of our targeted credit profile 
in february  standard poor s upgraded our corporate credit rating to investment grade  assigning us a rating of bbb  stable outlook 
in september  moody s investor services upgraded our senior implied credit rating to ba  stable outlook 
you should note that a credit rating is not a recommendation to buy  sell or hold securities  and may be subject to revision or withdrawal at any time 
competitive strengths we believe that the following competitive strengths position us to successfully execute our business strategy our pipeline assets are strategically located and have additional capacity 
our primary crude oil pipeline transportation and gathering assets are located in prolific oil producing regions and are connected  directly or indirectly  with our terminalling and storage assets that service major north american refinery and distribution markets  where we have strong business relationships 
these assets are strategically positioned to maximize the value of our crude oil by transporting it to major trading locations and premium markets 
our pipeline networks currently possess additional capacity that can accommodate increased demand 
our cushing terminal is strategically located  operationally flexible and readily expandable 
our cushing terminal interconnects with the cushing interchange s major inbound and outbound pipelines  providing access to both foreign and domestic crude oil 
our cushing terminal is the most modern large scale terminalling and storage facility at the cushing interchange  incorporating operational enhancements designed to safely and efficiently terminal  store  blend and segregate large volumes and multiple varieties of crude oil and extensive environmental safeguards 
collectively  our phase ii expansion project  which became operational in july  and our phase iii expansion project  which became operational in january  increased the total capacity of our cushing terminal by approximately to approximately million barrels 
we believe that the facility can be further expanded to meet additional demand should market conditions warrant 
in addition  we own approximately million barrels of above ground crude oil terminalling and storage assets elsewhere in the united states and canada that complement our cushing terminal and enable us to serve the needs of our customers 
we possess specialized crude oil market knowledge 
we believe our business relationships with participants in all phases of the crude oil distribution chain  from crude oil producers to refiners  as well as our own industry expertise  provide us with an extensive understanding of the north american physical crude oil markets 
our business activities are counter cyclically balanced 
we believe that our terminalling and storage activities and our gathering and marketing activities are counter cyclical 
we believe that this balance of activities  combined with pipeline transportation operations  has a stabilizing effect on our cash flow from operations 
we have the financial flexibility to continue to pursue expansion and acquisition opportunities 
we believe we have significant resources to finance strategic expansion and acquisition opportunities  including our ability to issue additional partnership units  borrow under our credit facility and issue additional notes in the long term debt capital markets 
the amount of unused capacity available under our revolving credit facility at december   was approximately million 
our usage is subject to covenant compliance

logo major acquisitions and dispositions an integral component of our business strategy and growth objective is to acquire assets and operations that are strategic and complementary to our existing operations 
we have established a target to make million to million per year in acquisitions  subject to availability of attractive assets on acceptable terms 
since  we have completed numerous acquisitions for an aggregate purchase price of approximately billion 
in addition  from time to time we have sold assets that are no longer considered essential to our operations 
following is a brief description of major acquisitions and dispositions that have occurred since our initial public offering in november shell west texas assets on august   we acquired interests in approximately  miles of gathering and mainline crude oil pipelines and approximately million barrels net to our interest of above ground crude oil terminalling and storage assets in west texas from shell pipeline company lp and equilon enterprises llc the shell acquisition 
the primary assets included in the transaction are interests in the basin pipeline system basin system  the permian basin gathering system permian basin system and the rancho pipeline system rancho system 
the total purchase price of million consisted of i million in cash  which was borrowed under our revolving credit facility  ii approximately million related to the settlement of pre existing accounts receivable and inventory balances and iii approximately million of estimated transaction and closing costs 
the acquired assets are primarily fee based mainline crude oil pipeline transportation assets that gather crude oil in the permian basin and transport that crude oil to major market locations in the mid continent and gulf coast regions 
the acquired assets complement our existing asset infrastructure in west texas and represent a transportation link to cushing  oklahoma  where we provide storage and terminalling services 
in addition  we believe that the basin system is poised to benefit from potential shut downs of refineries and other pipelines due to the shifting market dynamics in the west texas area 
as was contemplated at the time of the acquisition  the rancho system will be taken out of service in march  pursuant to the terms of its operating agreement 
see pipeline operations pipeline assets southwest us rancho pipeline system 
canadian expansion in early  we articulated to the financial community our intent to establish a strong canadian operation that substantially mirrors our operations in the united states 
after evaluating the marketplace and analyzing potential opportunities  we consummated the two transactions detailed below in the combination of these assets  an established fee based pipeline transportation business and a rapidly growing  entrepreneurial gathering and marketing business  allowed us to optimize both businesses and establish a solid foundation for future growth in canada 
canpet energy group  inc in july  we purchased substantially all of the assets of canpet energy group inc  a calgary based canadian crude oil and lpg marketing company  for approximately million plus million for additional inventory owned by canpet 
approximately million of the purchase price  payable in common units  was deferred subject to various performance standards being met

west texas gathering system in july  we completed the acquisition of the west texas gathering system from chevron pipe line company for approximately million  including transaction costs 
financing for the amounts paid at closing was provided by a draw under a previous credit facility 
the assets acquired include approximately miles of crude oil mainlines  approximately miles of associated gathering and lateral lines  and approximately million barrels of tankage located along the system 
scurlock permian in may  we completed the acquisition of scurlock permian llc scurlock and certain other pipeline assets from marathon ashland petroleum llc 
including working capital adjustments and closing and financing costs  the cash purchase price was approximately million 
financing for the acquisition was provided through million of borrowings and the sale of million class b common units to our former general partner for total cash consideration of million 
scurlock  previously a wholly owned subsidiary of marathon ashland petroleum  was engaged in crude oil transportation  gathering and marketing 
the assets acquired included approximately  miles of active pipelines  numerous storage terminals and a fleet of trucks 
the largest asset consisted of an approximately mile pipeline and gathering system located in the spraberry trend in west texas that extends into andrews  glasscock  martin  midland  regan and upton counties  texas 
the assets we acquired also included approximately one million barrels of crude oil linefill 
ongoing acquisition activities consistent with our business strategy  we are continuously engaged in discussions with potential sellers regarding the possible purchase by us of midstream crude oil assets 
such acquisition efforts involve participation by us in processes that have been made public  involve a number of potential buyers and are commonly referred to as auction processes  as well as situations where we believe we are the only party or one of a very limited number of potential buyers in negotiations with the potential seller 
in connection with these activities  we routinely incur third party costs  which are capitalized and deferred pending final outcome of the transaction 
deferred costs associated with successful transactions are capitalized as part of the transaction  while deferred costs associated with unsuccessful transactions are expensed at the time of such final determination 
we can give you no assurance that our current or future acquisition efforts will be successful or that any such acquisition will be completed on terms considered favorable to us 
all american pipeline linefill sale and asset disposition in march  we sold to a unit of el paso corporation for million the segment of the all american pipeline that extends from emidio  california to mccamey  texas 
except for minor third party volumes  one of our subsidiaries  plains marketing  lp  was the sole shipper on this segment of the pipeline since its predecessor acquired the line from the goodyear tire rubber company in july we realized net proceeds of approximately million after the associated transaction costs and estimated costs to remove equipment 
we used the proceeds from the sale to reduce outstanding debt 
we recognized a gain of approximately million in connection with the sale 
we had suspended shipments of crude oil on this segment of the pipeline in november at that time  we owned approximately million barrels of crude oil in the segment of the pipeline 
we sold this crude oil from november to february for net proceeds of approximately million  which were used for working capital purposes 
we recognized an aggregate gain of approximately million  of which approximately million was recognized in in connection with the sale of the linefill 
description of segments and associated assets our business activities are conducted through two primary segments  pipeline operations  which for the year ended comprised approximately of our earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization ebitda  and gathering  marketing  terminalling and storage operations  which comprised the remaining 
our operations are conducted in approximately states in the united states and three provinces in canada 
the majority of our operations are conducted in texas  oklahoma  california  louisiana and in the canadian provinces of alberta and saskatchewan 
following is a description of the activities and assets for each of our business segments pipeline operations we own and operate over  miles of gathering and mainline crude oil pipelines located throughout the united states and canada 
our activities from pipeline operations generally consist of transporting crude oil for a fee  third party leases of pipeline capacity  barrel exchanges and buy sell arrangements 
substantially all of our pipeline systems are operated from one of two central control rooms with computer systems designed to continuously monitor real time operational data  including measurement of crude oil quantities injected in and delivered through the pipelines  product flow rates and pressure and temperature variations 
this monitoring and measurement technology allows us to efficiently batch differing crude oil types with varying characteristics through the pipeline systems 
the systems are designed to enhance leak detection capabilities  sound automatic alarms in the event of operational conditions outside of pre established parameters and provide for remote controlled shut down of pump stations on the pipeline systems 
pump stations  storage facilities and meter measurement points along the pipeline systems are linked by telephone  microwave  satellite or radio communication systems for remote monitoring and control  which reduces our requirement for full time site personnel at most of these locations 
we perform scheduled maintenance on all of our pipeline systems and make repairs and replacements when necessary or appropriate 
we attempt to control corrosion of the mainlines through the use of corrosion inhibiting chemicals injected into the crude stream  external coatings and anode bed based or impressed current cathodic protection systems 
maintenance facilities containing equipment for pipe repairs  spare parts and trained response personnel are strategically located along the pipelines and in concentrated operating areas 
we believe that all of our pipelines have been constructed and are maintained in all material respects in accordance with applicable federal  state and local laws and regulations  standards prescribed by the american petroleum institute and accepted industry practice

western us all american pipeline system 
the segment of the all american pipeline that we retained following the sale of the line segment to el paso is a common carrier crude oil pipeline system that transports crude oil produced from certain outer continental shelf  or ocs  fields offshore california to locations in california 
see major acquisitions and dispositions all american pipeline linefill sale and asset disposition 
this segment is subject to tariff rates regulated by the ferc 
we own and operate the segment of the system that extends approximately miles along the california coast from las flores to gaviota inch diameter pipe and continues from gaviota approximately miles to our station in emidio  california inch pipe 
between gaviota and our emidio station  the all american pipeline interconnects with our san joaquin valley  or sjv  gathering system as well as various third party intrastate pipelines  including the unocap pipeline system  the equilon pipeline system and the pacific pipeline 
the all american pipeline currently transports ocs crude oil received at the onshore facilities of the santa ynez field at las flores and the onshore facilities of the point arguello field located at gaviota 
exxonmobil  which owns all of the santa ynez production  and plains exploration and production company pxp and other producers  which together own approximately of the point arguello production  have entered into transportation agreements committing to transport all of their production from these fields on the all american pipeline 
these agreements  which expire in august  provide for a minimum tariff with annual escalations based on specific composite indices 
the producers from the point arguello field who do not have contracts with us have no other means of transporting their production and  therefore  ship their volumes on the all american pipeline at the posted tariffs 
volumes attributable to pxp are purchased and sold to a third party under our marketing agreement with pxp before such volumes enter the all american pipeline 
see item certain relationships and related transactions transactions with related parties general 
the third party pays the same tariff as required in the transportation agreements 
at december   the tariffs averaged per barrel 
the agreements do not require these owners to transport a minimum volume 
a significant portion of our gross margin is derived from pipeline transportation margins associated with these two fields 
for the year ended december   approximately million  or  of our gross margin was attributable to the santa ynez field and approximately million  or was attributable to the point arguello field 
the relative contribution to our gross margin from these fields has decreased from approximately in the second half of to in  as the partnership has grown and diversified through acquisitions and organic expansions and as a result of declines in volumes produced and transported from these fields  offset somewhat by an increase in pipeline tariffs 
over the last several years  transportation volumes received from the santa ynez and point arguello fields have declined from  and  average daily barrels  respectively  in to  and  average daily barrels  respectively  for the year ended december  we expect that there will continue to be natural production declines from each of these fields as the underlying reservoirs are depleted 
a  barrel per day decline in volumes shipped from these fields would result in a decrease in annual pipeline tariff revenues of approximately million  based on an annual tariff of per barrel

gathering  marketing  terminalling and storage operations the combination of our gathering and marketing operations and our terminalling and storage operations provides a counter cyclical balance that has a stabilizing effect on our operations and cash flow 
the strategic use of our terminalling and storage assets in conjunction with our gathering and marketing operations provides us with the flexibility to optimize margins irrespective of whether a strong or weak market exists 
following is a description of our activities with respect to this segment 
gathering and marketing operations crude oil 
the majority of our gathering and marketing activities are in the geographic locations previously discussed 
these activities include purchasing crude oil from producers at the wellhead and in bulk from aggregators at major pipeline interconnects and trading locations  transporting this crude oil on our own proprietary gathering assets or  when necessary or cost effective  assets owned and operated by third parties  exchanging this crude oil for another grade of crude oil or at a different geographic location  as appropriate  in order to maximize margins or meet contract delivery requirements  and marketing crude oil to refiners or other resellers 
we purchase crude oil from many independent producers and believe that we have established broad based relationships with crude oil producers in our areas of operations 
gathering and marketing activities involve relatively large volumes of transactions with lower margins compared to pipeline and terminalling and storage operations 
the following table shows the average daily volume of our lease gathering and bulk purchases from through year ended december  barrels in thousands lease gathering purchases bulk purchases total volumes prior period volume amounts have been adjusted i so that volumes associated with acquisitions represent weighted average daily amounts during the year of acquisition  and ii for consistency of comparison between years 
crude oil purchases 
we purchase crude oil from producers under contracts that range in term from a thirty day evergreen to three years 
in a typical producer s operation  crude oil flows from the wellhead to a separator where the petroleum gases are removed 
after separation  the crude oil is treated to remove water  sand and other contaminants and is then moved into the producer s on site storage tanks 
when the tank is full  the producer contacts our field personnel to purchase and transport the crude oil to market 
we utilize our truck fleet and gathering pipelines and third party pipelines  trucks and barges to transport the crude oil to market 
we own or lease approximately trucks used for gathering crude oil 
we have a marketing agreement with plains resources  under which we are the exclusive marketer and purchaser for all of plains resources equity crude oil production including its subsidiaries that conduct exploration and production activities 
the marketing agreement provides that we will purchase for resale at market prices all of plains resources equity crude oil production  for which we charge a fee of per barrel 
this fee will be adjusted every three years based upon then existing market conditions 
the marketing agreement will terminate upon a change of control of plains resources or our general partner 
in november  the marketing agreement automatically extended for an additional three year period 
on december   plains resources completed a spin off of one of its subsidiaries  pxp  to its shareholders 
pxp is a successor participant to this marketing agreement 
see item certain relationships and related transactions transactions with related parties general 
bulk purchases 
in addition to purchasing crude oil at the wellhead from producers  we purchase crude oil in bulk at major pipeline terminal locations 
this oil is transported from the wellhead to the pipeline by major oil companies  large independent producers or other gathering and marketing companies 
we purchase crude oil in bulk when we believe additional opportunities exist to realize margins further downstream in the crude oil distribution chain 
the opportunities to earn additional margins vary over time with changing market conditions 
accordingly  the margins associated with our bulk purchases will fluctuate from period to period 
crude oil sales 
the marketing of crude oil is complex and requires detailed current knowledge of crude oil sources and end markets and a familiarity with a number of factors including grades of crude oil  individual refinery demand for specific grades of crude oil  area market price structures for the different grades of crude oil  location of customers  availability of transportation facilities and timing and costs including storage involved in delivering crude oil to the appropriate customer 
we sell our crude oil to major integrated oil companies  independent refiners and other resellers in various types of sale and exchange transactions  at market prices for terms ranging from one month to three years 
we establish a margin for crude oil we purchase by selling crude oil for physical delivery to third party users  such as independent refiners or major oil companies  or by entering into a future delivery obligation with respect to futures contracts on the nymex and over the counter 
through these transactions  we seek to maintain a position that is substantially balanced between crude oil purchases and sales and future delivery obligations 
from time to time  we enter into various types of sale and exchange transactions including fixed price delivery contracts  floating price collar arrangements  financial swaps and crude oil futures contracts as hedging devices 
except for pre defined inventory positions  our policy is generally to purchase only crude oil for which we have a market  to structure our sales contracts so that crude oil price fluctuations do not materially affect the gross margin we receive  and to not acquire and hold crude oil  futures contracts or other derivative products for the purpose of speculating on crude oil price changes that might expose us to indeterminable losses 
see crude oil volatility  counter cyclical balance  risk management 
in november  we discovered that this policy was violated  and we incurred million in unauthorized trading losses  including estimated associated costs and legal expenses 
in  we recognized an additional million charge related to the settlement of litigation for an amount in excess of established reserves 
see unauthorized trading losses 
crude oil exchanges 
we pursue exchange opportunities to enhance margins throughout the gathering and marketing process 
when opportunities arise to increase our margin or to acquire a grade of crude oil that more closely matches our physical delivery requirement or the preferences of our refinery customers  we exchange physical crude oil with third parties 
these exchanges are effected through contracts called exchange or buy sell agreements 
through an exchange agreement  we agree to buy crude oil that differs in terms of geographic location  grade of crude oil or physical delivery schedule from crude oil we have available for sale 
generally  we enter into exchanges to acquire crude oil at locations that are closer to our end markets  thereby reducing transportation costs and increasing our margin 
we also exchange our crude oil to be physically delivered at a later date  if the exchange is expected to result in a higher margin net of storage costs  and enter into exchanges based on the grade of crude oil  which includes such factors as sulfur content and specific gravity  in order to meet the quality specifications of our physical delivery contracts 
producer services 
crude oil purchasers who buy from producers compete on the basis of competitive prices and highly responsive services 
through our team of crude oil purchasing representatives  we maintain ongoing relationships with producers in the united states and canada 
we believe that our ability to offer high quality field and administrative services to producers is a key factor in our ability to maintain volumes of purchased crude oil and to obtain new volumes 
field services include efficient gathering capabilities  availability of trucks  willingness to construct gathering pipelines where economically justified  timely pickup of crude oil from tank batteries at the lease or production point  accurate measurement of crude oil volumes received  avoidance of spills and effective management of pipeline deliveries 
accounting and other administrative services include securing division orders statements from interest owners affirming the division of ownership in crude oil purchased by us  providing statements of the crude oil purchased each month  disbursing production proceeds to interest owners  and calculation and payment of ad valorem and production taxes on behalf of interest owners 
in order to compete effectively  we must maintain records of title and division order interests in an accurate and timely manner for purposes of making prompt and correct payment of crude oil production proceeds  together with the correct payment of all severance and production taxes associated with such proceeds 
liquefied petroleum gas and other petroleum products 
we also gather and market lpg and other petroleum products throughout the united states and canada  concentrated primarily in washington  california  kansas  michigan  texas  montana  nebraska and the canadian provinces of alberta and ontario 
these activities include purchasing lpg primarily propane and butane from producers at gas plants and in bulk at major pipeline terminal points and storage locations  transporting the lpg via common carrier pipelines  railcars and trucks to our own terminals and third party facilities for subsequent resale by them to retailers and other wholesale customers  and exchanging product to other locations to maximize margins and or to meet contract delivery requirements 
we purchase lpg from numerous producers and have established long term  broad based relationships with lpg producers in our areas of operation 
we purchase lpg directly from gas plants  major pipeline terminals and storage locations 
gathering and marketing activities for lpg typically consist of smaller volumes and generally higher margin per barrel transactions relative to crude oil 
lpg purchases 
we purchase lpg from producers  refiners  and other lpg marketing companies under contracts that range from immediate delivery to one year in term 
in a typical producer s or refiner s operation  lpg that is produced at the gas plant or refinery is fractionated into various components including propane and butane and then purchased by us for movement via tank truck  railcar or pipeline 
in addition to purchasing lpg at gas plants or refineries  we also purchase lpg in bulk at major pipeline terminal points and storage facilities from major oil companies  large independent producers or other lpg marketing companies 
we purchase lpg in bulk when we believe additional opportunities exist to realize margins further downstream in our lpg distribution chain 
the opportunities to earn additional margins vary over time with changing market conditions 
accordingly  the margins associated with our bulk purchases will fluctuate from period to period 
lpg sales 
the marketing of lpg is complex and requires detailed current knowledge of lpg sources and end markets and a familiarity with a number of factors including the various modes and availability of transportation  area market prices and timing and costs of delivering lpg to customers 
we sell lpg primarily to industrial end users and retailers  and limited volumes to other marketers 
propane is sold to small independent retailers who then transport the product via bobtail truck to residential consumers for home heating and to some light industrial users such as forklift operators 
butane is used by refiners for gasoline blending and as a diluent for the movement of conventional heavy oil production 
butane demand for use as heavy oil diluent has increased as supplies of canadian condensate have declined 
we establish a margin for propane by transporting it in bulk  via various transportation modes  to our controlled terminals where we deliver the propane to our retailer customers for subsequent delivery to their individual heating customers 
we also create margin by selling propane for future physical delivery to third party users  such as retailers and industrial users 
through these transactions  we seek to maintain a position that is substantially balanced between propane purchases and sales and future delivery obligations 
from time to time  we enter into various types of sale and exchange transactions including floating price collar arrangements  financial swaps and crude oil and lpg related futures contracts as hedging devices 
except for pre defined inventory positions  our policy is generally to purchase only lpg for which we have a market  and to structure our sales contracts so that lpg spot price fluctuations do not materially affect the gross margin we receive 
margin is created on the butane purchased by delivering large volumes during the short refinery blending season through the use of our extensive leased railcar fleet and the use of third party storage facilities 
we also create margin on butane by capturing the difference in price between condensate and butane when butane is used to replace condensate as a diluent for the movement of canadian heavy oil production 
while we seek to maintain a position that is substantially balanced within our lpg activities  as a result of production  transportation and delivery variances as well as logistical issues associated with inclement weather conditions  from time to time we experience net unbalanced positions for short periods of time 
in connection with managing these positions and maintaining a constant presence in the marketplace  both necessary for our core business  our policies provide that any net imbalance may not exceed  barrels 
these activities are monitored independently by our risk management function and must take place within predefined limits and authorizations 
lpg exchanges 
we pursue exchange opportunities to enhance margins throughout the gathering and marketing process 
when opportunities arise to increase our margin or to acquire a volume of lpg that more closely matches our physical delivery requirement or the preferences of our customers  we exchange physical lpg with third parties 
these exchanges are effected through contracts called exchange or buy sell agreements 
through an exchange agreement  we agree to buy lpg that differs in terms of geographic location  type of lpg or physical delivery schedule from lpg we have available for sale 
generally  we enter into exchanges to acquire lpg at locations that are closer to our end markets in order to meet the delivery specifications of our physical delivery contracts 
credit 
our merchant activities involve the purchase of crude oil for resale and require significant extensions of credit by our suppliers of crude oil 
in order to assure our ability to perform our obligations under crude oil purchase agreements  various credit arrangements are negotiated with our crude oil suppliers 
such arrangements include open lines of credit directly with us  and standby letters of credit issued under our letter of credit facility 
when we market crude oil  we must determine the amount  if any  of the line of credit to be extended to any given customer 
we manage our exposure to credit risk through credit analysis  credit approvals  credit limits and monitoring procedures 
if we determine that a customer should receive a credit line  we must then decide on the amount of credit that should be extended 
since our typical sales transactions can involve tens of thousands of barrels of crude oil  the risk of nonpayment and nonperformance by customers is a major consideration in our business 
we believe our sales are made to creditworthy entities or entities with adequate credit support 
we also have credit risk with respect to our sales of lpg  however  because our sales are typically in relatively small amounts to individual customers  we do not believe that we have material concentration of credit risk 
typically  we enter into annual contracts to sell lpg on a forward basis  as well as sell lpg on a current basis to local distributors and retailers 
in certain cases our customers prepay for their purchases  in amounts ranging from per gallon to of their contracted amounts 
generally  sales of lpg are settled within days of the date of invoice 
during  announcements of business failures  revelations of material misrepresentations and related financial restatements adversely affected several companies within the energy industry  resulting in a rapid deterioration in credit ratings 
see item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations liquidity and capital resources contingencies recent disruptions in industry credit markets 
terminalling and storage operations we own approximately million barrels of terminalling and storage assets  including tankage associated with our pipeline and gathering systems 
our storage and terminalling operations increase our margins in our business of purchasing and selling crude oil and also generate revenue through a combination of storage and throughput charges to third parties 
storage fees are generated when we lease tank capacity to third parties 
terminalling fees  also referred to as throughput fees  are generated when we receive crude oil from one connecting pipeline and redeliver crude oil to another connecting carrier in volumes that allow the refinery to receive its crude oil on a ratable basis throughout a delivery period 
both terminalling and storage fees are generally earned from refiners and gatherers that segregate or custom blend crudes for refining feedstocks  pipeline operators  refiners or traders that need segregated tankage for foreign cargoes  traders who make or take delivery under nymex contracts  and producers and resellers that seek to increase their marketing alternatives 
the tankage that is used to support our arbitrage activities positions us to capture margins in a contango market when the oil prices for future deliveries are higher than the current prices or when the market switches from contango to backwardation when the oil prices for future deliveries are lower than the current prices 
see crude oil volatility  counter cyclical balance  risk management 
our most significant terminalling and storage asset is our cushing terminal located at the cushing interchange 
the cushing interchange is one of the largest wet barrel trading hubs in the us and the delivery point for crude oil futures contracts traded on the nymex 
the cushing terminal has been designated by the nymex as an approved delivery location for crude oil delivered under the nymex light sweet crude oil futures contract 
as the nymex delivery point and a cash market hub  the cushing interchange serves as a primary source of refinery feedstock for the midwest refiners and plays an integral role in establishing and maintaining markets for many varieties of foreign and domestic crude oil 
our cushing terminal was constructed in to capitalize on the crude oil supply and demand imbalance in the midwest 
the cushing terminal is also used to support and enhance the margins associated with our merchant activities relating to our lease gathering and bulk purchasing activities 
see gathering and marketing operations bulk purchases 
in  we completed our million barrel phase i expansion project  which increased the facility s total storage capacity to million barrels 
on july   we placed in service approximately million barrels of tank capacity associated with our phase ii expansion of the cushing terminal  raising the facility s total storage capacity to approximately million barrels 
in january  we placed in service our million barrel phase iii expansion 
the phase ii and iii expansions increased the capacity of the cushing terminal by approximately to a total of approximately million barrels 
the cushing terminal now consists of fourteen  barrel tanks  four  barrel tanks and twelve  barrel tanks  all of which are used to store and terminal crude oil 
the cushing terminal also includes a pipeline manifold and pumping system that has an estimated throughput capacity of approximately  barrels per day 
the cushing terminal is connected to the major pipelines and other terminals in the cushing interchange through pipelines that range in size from inches to inches in diameter 
the cushing terminal is designed to serve the needs of refiners in the midwest 
in order to service an expected increase in the volumes as well as the varieties of foreign and domestic crude oil projected to be transported through the cushing interchange  we incorporated certain attributes into the design of the cushing terminal including multiple  smaller tanks to facilitate simultaneous handling of multiple crude varieties in accordance with normal pipeline batch sizes  dual header systems connecting most tanks to the main manifold system to facilitate efficient switching between crude grades with minimal contamination  bottom drawn sumps that enable each tank to be efficiently drained down to minimal remaining volumes to minimize crude oil contamination and maintain crude oil integrity during changes of service  mixer s on each tank to facilitate blending crude oil grades to refinery specifications  and a manifold and pump system that allows for receipts and deliveries with connecting carriers at their maximum operating capacity 
as a result of incorporating these attributes into the design of the cushing terminal  we believe we are favorably positioned to serve the needs of midwest refiners to handle an increase in the number of varieties of crude oil transported through the cushing interchange 
the pipeline manifold and pumping system of our cushing terminal is designed to support more than million barrels of tank capacity and we have sufficient land holdings in and around the cushing interchange on which to construct additional tankage 
our tankage in cushing ranges in age from brand new to approximately years old and the average age is approximately years old 
in contrast  we estimate that of the approximately million barrels of remaining tanks in cushing owned by third parties  the average age is approximately years and of that  approximately million barrels has an average age of over years 
we believe that provides us with a competitive advantage over our competitors 
in addition  we believe that we are well positioned to accommodate construction of replacement tankage that may be required as a result of the imposition of stricter regulatory standards and related attrition among our competitors tanks in connection with the requirements of api see regulation pipeline and storage regulation 
our cushing terminal also incorporates numerous environmental and operational safeguards 
we believe that our terminal is the only one at the cushing interchange in which each tank has a secondary liner the equivalent of double bottoms  leak detection devices and secondary seals 
the cushing terminal is the only terminal at the cushing interchange equipped with aboveground pipelines 
like the pipeline systems we operate  the cushing terminal is operated by a computer system designed to monitor real time operational data and each tank is cathodically protected 
in addition  each tank is equipped with an audible and visual high level alarm system to prevent overflows  a double seal floating roof designed to minimize air emissions and prevent the possible accumulation of potentially flammable gases between fluid levels and the roof of the tank  and a foam dispersal system that  in the event of a fire  is fed by a fully automated fire water distribution network 
the following table sets forth throughput volumes for our terminalling and storage operations and quantity of tankage leased to third parties for our cushing terminal from through year ended december  barrels in thousands throughput volumes average daily volumes storage leased to third parties average monthly volumes the level of tankage at cushing that we allocate for our arbitrage activities and therefore is not available for lease to third parties varies throughout crude oil price cycles 
crude oil volatility  counter cyclical balance  risk management crude oil prices have historically been very volatile and cyclical  with nymex benchmark prices ranging from as high as per barrel to as low as per barrel over the last years 
gross margin from terminalling and storage activities is dependent on the throughput volume of crude oil stored  capacity leased to third parties  capacity that we use for our own activities  and the level of other fees generated at our terminalling and storage facilities 
gross margin from our gathering and marketing activities is dependent on our ability to sell crude oil at a price in excess of our aggregate cost 
although margins may be affected during transitional periods  these operations are not directly affected by the absolute level of crude oil prices  but are affected by overall levels of supply and demand for crude oil and relative fluctuations in market related indices 
during periods when supply exceeds the demand for crude oil  the market for crude oil is often in contango  meaning that the price of crude oil for future deliveries is higher than current prices 
a contango market has a generally negative impact on marketing margins  but is favorable to the storage business  because storage owners at major trading locations such as the cushing interchange can simultaneously purchase production at current prices for storage and sell at higher prices for future delivery 
when there is a higher demand than supply of crude oil in the near term  the market is backwardated  meaning that the price of crude oil for future deliveries is lower than current prices 
a backwardated market has a positive impact on marketing margins because crude oil gatherers can capture a premium for prompt deliveries 
in this environment  there is little incentive to store crude oil as current prices are above future delivery prices 
the periods between a backwardated market and a contango market are referred to as transition periods 
depending on the overall duration of these transition periods  how we have allocated our assets to particular strategies and the time length of our crude oil purchase and sale contracts and storage lease agreements  these transition periods may have either an adverse or beneficial affect on our aggregate gross margin 
a prolonged transition from a backwardated market to a contango market  or vice versa essentially a market that is neither in pronounced backwardation nor contango  represents the most difficult environment for our gathering  marketing  terminalling and storage activities 
when the market is in contango  we will use our tankage to improve our gathering margins by storing crude oil we have purchased for delivery in future months that are selling at a higher price 
in a backwardated market  we use and lease less storage capacity but increased marketing margins provide an offset to this reduced cash flow 
we believe that the combination of our terminalling and storage activities and gathering and marketing activities provides a counter cyclical balance that has a stabilizing effect on our operations and cash flow 
references to counter cyclical balance elsewhere in this report are referring to this relationship between our terminalling and storage activities and our gathering and marketing activities in transitioning crude oil markets 
as use of the financial markets for crude oil has increased by producers  refiners  utilities and trading entities  risk management strategies  including those involving price hedges using nymex futures contracts and derivatives  have become increasingly important in creating and maintaining margins 
such hedging techniques require significant resources dedicated to managing these positions 
our risk management policies and procedures are designed to monitor both nymex and over the counter positions and physical volumes  grades  locations and delivery schedules to ensure that our hedging activities are implemented in accordance with such policies 
we have a risk management function that has direct responsibility and authority for our risk policies  our trading controls and procedures and certain other aspects of corporate risk management 
our policy is to purchase only crude oil for which we have a market  and to structure our sales contracts so that crude oil price fluctuations do not materially affect the gross margin we receive 
except for inventory transactions not to exceed  barrels  we do not acquire and hold crude oil futures contracts or other derivative products for the purpose of speculating on crude oil price changes that might expose us to indeterminable losses 
as a result of production and delivery variances associated with our lease purchase activities  from time to time we experience net unbalanced positions 
in connection with managing these positions and maintaining a constant presence in the marketplace  both necessary for our core business  we engage in this controlled trading program for up to  barrels 
this activity is monitored independently by our risk management function and must take place within predefined limits and authorizations 
in order to hedge margins involving our physical assets and manage risks associated with our crude oil purchase and sale obligations  we use derivative instruments  including regulated futures and options transactions  as well as over the counter instruments 
in analyzing our risk management activities  we draw a distinction between enterprise level risks and trading related risks 
enterprise level risks are those that underlie our core businesses and may be managed based on whether there is value in doing so 
conversely  trading related risks the risks involved in trading in the hopes of generating an increased return are not inherent in the core business  rather  those risks arise as a result of engaging in the trading activity 
we have a risk management committee that approves all new risk management strategies through a formal process 
with the partial exception of the limited  barrel program  our approved strategies are intended to mitigate enterprise level risks that are inherent in our core businesses of crude oil gathering and marketing and storage 
similarly  while we seek to maintain a position that is substantially balanced within our lpg activities  as a result of production  transportation and delivery variances as well as logistical issues associated with inclement weather conditions  from time to time we experience net unbalanced positions for short periods of time 
in connection with managing these positions and maintaining a constant presence in the marketplace  both necessary for our core business  our policies provide that any net imbalance may not exceed  barrels 
these activities are monitored independently by our risk management function and must take place within predefined limits and authorizations 
although the intent of our risk management strategies is to hedge our margin  not all of our derivatives qualify for hedge accounting 
in such instances  changes in the fair values of these derivatives will receive mark to market treatment in current earnings  and result in greater potential for earnings volatility than in the past 
this accounting treatment is discussed further in note summary of significant accounting policies in the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
geographic data see note operating segments in the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
customers see note major customers and concentration of credit risk in the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
competition competition among pipelines is based primarily on transportation charges  access to producing areas and demand for the crude oil by end users 
we believe that high capital requirements  environmental considerations and the difficulty in acquiring rights of way and related permits make it unlikely that competing pipeline systems comparable in size and scope to our pipeline systems will be built in the foreseeable future 
however  to the extent there are already third party owned pipelines with excess capacity in the vicinity of our operations  we will be exposed to significant competition based on the incremental cost of moving an incremental barrel of crude oil 
we face intense competition in our gathering  marketing  terminalling and storage operations 
our competitors include other crude oil pipeline companies  the major integrated oil companies  their marketing affiliates and independent gatherers  brokers and marketers of widely varying sizes  financial resources and experience 
some of these competitors have capital resources many times greater than ours  and control greater supplies of crude oil 
regulation our operations are subject to extensive regulations 
we estimate that we are subject to regulatory oversight by over federal  state  provincial and local departments and agencies  many of which are authorized by statute to issue and have issued laws and regulations binding on the oil pipeline industry  related businesses and individual participants 
the failure to comply with such rules and regulations can result in substantial penalties 
the regulatory burden on our operations increases our cost of doing business and  consequently  affects our profitability 
however  except for certain exemptions that apply to smaller companies  we do not believe that we are affected in a significantly different manner by these laws and regulations than are our competitors 
due to the myriad of complex federal  state  provincial and local regulations that may affect us  directly or indirectly  you should not rely on the following discussion of certain laws and regulations as an exhaustive review of all regulatory considerations affecting our operations 
pipeline and storage regulation some of our petroleum pipelines and storage tanks in the united states are subject to regulation by the us department of transportation dot with respect to the design  installation  testing  construction  operation  replacement and management of pipeline and tank facilities 
in addition  we must permit access to and copying of records  and must make certain reports available and provide information as required by the secretary of transportation 
comparable regulation exists in canada and in some states in which we conduct intrastate common carrier or private pipeline operations 
pipeline safety issues are currently receiving significant attention in various political and administrative arenas at both the state and federal levels 
for example  recent federal rule changes require pipeline operators to develop and maintain a written qualification program for individuals performing covered tasks on pipeline facilities  and establish pipeline integrity management programs 
in particular  during  the dot adopted new regulations requiring operators of interstate pipelines to develop and follow an integrity management program that provides for continual assessment of the integrity of all pipeline segments that could affect so called high consequence areas  including high population areas  areas that are sources of drinking water  ecological resource areas that are unusually sensitive to environmental damage from a pipeline release  and commercially navigable waterways 
segments of our pipelines are located in high consequence areas 
the dot rule requires us to evaluate pipeline conditions by means of periodic internal inspection  pressure testing  or other equally effective assessment means  and to correct identified anomalies 
if  as a result of our evaluation process  we determine that there is a need to provide further protection to high consequence areas  then we will be required to implement additional spill prevention  mitigation and risk control measures for our pipelines  including enhanced damage prevention programs  corrosion control program improvements  leak detection system enhancements  installation of emergency flow restricting devices  and emergency preparedness improvements 
the dot rule also requires us to evaluate and  as necessary  improve our management and analysis processes for integrating available integrity related data relating to our pipeline segments and to remediate potential problems found as a result of the required assessment and evaluation process 
based on currently available information  we estimate that the costs to implement this program will average approximately million per year in and such amounts incorporate approximately million per year associated with the assets acquired in the shell acquisition 
although we believe that our pipeline operations are in substantial compliance with applicable regulatory requirements  these requirements increase the potential for incurring significant expenses if additional safety requirements are imposed that exceed our current pipeline control system capabilities 
we will continue to refine our estimates as data from initial assessments are collected 
the dot has adopted api as the standard for the inspection  repair  alteration and reconstruction of existing crude oil storage tanks subject to dot jurisdiction approximately of our million barrels 
api requires regularly scheduled inspection and repair of tanks remaining in service 
full compliance is required by we have commenced our compliance activities and  based on currently available information  we estimate that we will spend approximately million per year in and in connection with these activities 
such amounts incorporate the costs associated with the assets acquired in the shell acquisition 
we will continue to refine our estimates as data from initial assessments are collected 
states are largely preempted by federal law from regulating pipeline safety but may assume responsibility for enforcing federal intrastate pipeline regulations and inspection of intrastate pipelines 
in practice  states vary considerably in their authority and capacity to address pipeline safety 
we do not anticipate any significant problems in complying with applicable state laws and regulations in those states in which we operate 
in the wake of the september  terrorist attacks on the united states  the dot has developed a security guidance document and has issued a security circular that defines critical pipeline facilities and appropriate countermeasures for protecting them  and explains how dot plans to verify that operators have taken appropriate action to implement satisfactory security procedures and plans 
using the guidelines provided by the dot  we have specifically identified certain of our facilities as dot critical facilities and therefore potential terrorist targets 
in compliance with dot guidance  we are performing vulnerability analyses on such facilities 
additional security measures and procedures may be adopted or implemented upon completion of these analyses  and any such measures or procedures have the potential for increasing our costs of doing business 
regardless of the steps taken to increase security  however  we cannot assure you that our facilities will not become the subject of a terrorist attack

transportation regulation general interstate regulation 
our interstate common carrier pipeline operations are subject to rate regulation by the ferc under the interstate commerce act 
the interstate commerce act requires that tariff rates for petroleum pipelines  which includes crude oil  as well as refined product and petrochemical pipelines  be just and reasonable and non discriminatory 
state regulation 
our intrastate pipeline transportation activities are subject to various state laws and regulations  as well as orders of regulatory bodies 
canadian regulation 
our canadian pipeline assets are subject to regulation by the neb and by provincial agencies 
with respect to a pipeline over which it has jurisdiction  each of these agencies has the power  upon application by a third party  to determine the rates we are allowed to charge for transportation on  and set other terms of access to  such pipeline 
in such circumstances  if the relevant regulatory agency determines that the applicable terms and conditions of service are not just and reasonable  the agency can amend the offending provisions of an existing transportation contract 
energy policy act of and subsequent developments 
in october  congress passed the energy policy act of  which among other things  required the ferc to issue rules establishing a simplified and generally applicable ratemaking methodology for petroleum pipelines and to streamline procedures in petroleum pipeline proceedings 
the ferc responded to this mandate by issuing several orders  including order no 
beginning january   order no 
enables petroleum pipelines to change their rates within prescribed ceiling levels that are tied to an inflation index 
rate increases made pursuant to the indexing methodology are subject to protest  but such protests must show that the portion of the rate increase resulting from application of the index is substantially in excess of the pipeline s increase in costs 
if the indexing methodology results in a reduced ceiling level that is lower than a pipeline s filed rate  order no 
requires the pipeline to reduce its rate to comply with the lower ceiling 
a pipeline must  as a general rule  utilize the indexing methodology to change its rates 
the ferc  however  retained cost of service ratemaking  market based rates  and settlement as alternatives to the indexing approach  which alternatives may be used in certain specified circumstances 
the energy policy act deemed petroleum pipeline rates in effect for the day period ending on the date of enactment of the energy policy act or that were in effect on the th day preceding enactment and had not been subject to complaint  protest or investigation during the day period to be just and reasonable under the interstate commerce act 
generally  complaints against such grandfathered rates may only be pursued if the complainant can show either that a substantial change in the economic circumstances or the nature of the services has occurred since enactment or that a provision of the tariff is unduly discriminatory or preferential 
in a proceeding involving lakehead pipe line company  limited partnership opinion no 
 the ferc concluded that there should not be a corporate income tax allowance built into a petroleum pipeline s rates to reflect income attributable to noncorporate partners because noncorporate partners  unlike corporate partners  do not pay a corporate income tax 
on january   the ferc issued opinion no 
in a proceeding involving sfpp  lp  which  among other things  affirmed opinion no 
s determination that there should not be a corporate income tax allowance built into a petroleum pipeline s rates to reflect income attributable to noncorporate partners 
additionally  on rehearing of opinion no 
 the ferc affirmed its position regarding appropriate income tax allowance 
petitions for review of opinion no 
and subsequent ferc opinions in that case are before the dc circuit court of appeals  but some issues are being held in abeyance pending ferc action on certain requests 
once the rehearing process is completed  the ferc s position on the income tax allowance and on other rate issues could be subject to judicial review 
our pipelines 
the ferc generally has not investigated rates on its own initiative when those rates have not been the subject of a protest or complaint by a shipper 
substantially all of our gross margins on transportation are produced by rates that are either grandfathered or set by agreement of the parties 
rates for ocs crude are set by transportation agreements with shippers that do not expire until and provide for a minimum tariff with the potential for annual escalation 
the ferc has twice approved the agreed ocs rates  although application of the indexing method would have required their reduction 
when these ocs agreements expire in  they will be subject to renegotiation or to any of the other methods for establishing rates under order no 
as a result  we believe that the rates now in effect can be sustained  although no assurance can be given that the rates currently charged would ultimately be upheld if challenged 
trucking regulation we operate a fleet of trucks to transport crude oil and oilfield materials as a private  contract and common carrier 
we are licensed to perform both intrastate and interstate motor carrier services 
as a motor carrier  we are subject to certain safety regulations issued by the department of transportation 
the trucking regulations cover  among other things  driver operations  maintaining log books  truck manifest preparations  the placement of safety placards on the trucks and trailer vehicles  drug and alcohol testing  safety of operation and equipment  and many other aspects of truck operations 
we are also subject to the occupational safety and health act  as amended osha  with respect to our trucking operations 
our trucking assets in canada are subject to regulation by provincial agencies in the provinces in which they are operated 
these regulatory agencies do not set freight rates  but do establish and administer rules and regulations relating to other matters including equipment and driver licensing  equipment inspection  hazardous materials and safety 
cross border regulation as a result of our canadian acquisitions and cross border activities  we are subject to regulatory matters including export licenses  tariffs  canadian and us customs and tax issues and toxic substance certifications 
regulations include the short supply controls of the export administration act  the north american free trade agreement and the toxic substances control act 
violations of these license  tariff and tax reporting requirements could result in the imposition of significant administrative  civil and criminal penalties 
furthermore  the failure to comply with us  canadian  state and local tax requirements could lead to the imposition of additional taxes  interest and penalties 
environmental  health and safety regulation general numerous federal  state and local laws and regulations governing the discharge of materials into the environment  or otherwise relating to the protection of the environment  affect our operations and costs 
in particular  our activities in connection with storage and transportation of crude oil and other liquid hydrocarbons and our use of facilities for treating  processing or otherwise handling hydrocarbons and wastes are subject to stringent environmental laws and regulations 
as with the industry generally  compliance with existing and anticipated laws and regulations increases our overall cost of business  including our capital costs to construct  maintain and upgrade equipment and facilities 
although these regulations affect our capital expenditures and earnings  we believe that they do not affect our competitive position because our competitors that comply with such laws and regulations are similarly affected 
environmental laws and regulations have historically been subject to change  and we are unable to predict the ongoing cost to us of complying with these laws and regulations or the future impact of such laws and regulations on our operations 
violation of environmental laws and regulations and any associated permits can result in the imposition of significant administrative  civil and criminal penalties  injunctions and construction bans or delays 
a discharge of petroleum hydrocarbons or hazardous substances into the environment could  to the extent such event is not insured  subject us to substantial expense  including both the cost to comply with applicable laws and regulations and claims made by neighboring landowners and other third parties for personal injury and property damage 
water the oil pollution act  as amended opa  was enacted in and amends provisions of the federal water pollution control act of  as amended fwpca  and other statutes as they pertain to prevention and response to oil spills 
the opa subjects owners of facilities to strict  joint and potentially unlimited liability for containment and removal costs  natural resource damages  and certain other consequences of an oil spill  where such spill is into navigable waters  along shorelines or in the exclusive economic zone of the us the opa establishes a liability limit of million for onshore facilities  however  a party cannot take advantage of this liability limit if the spill is caused by gross negligence or willful misconduct or resulted from a violation of a federal safety  construction  or operating regulation 
if a party fails to report a spill or cooperate in the cleanup  the liability limits likewise do not apply 
in the event of an oil spill into navigable waters  substantial liabilities could be imposed upon us 
states in which we operate have also enacted similar laws 
regulations have been or are currently being developed under opa and state laws that may also impose additional regulatory burdens on our operations 
we believe that we are in substantial compliance with applicable opa requirements 
the fwpca imposes restrictions and strict controls regarding the discharge of pollutants into navigable waters 
permits must be obtained to discharge pollutants into state and federal waters 
the fwpca imposes substantial potential liability for the costs of removal  remediation and damages 
we believe that compliance with existing permits and compliance with foreseeable new permit requirements will not have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations 
some states maintain groundwater protection programs that require permits for discharges or operations that may impact groundwater conditions 
we believe that we are in substantial compliance with these state requirements 
air emissions our operations are subject to the federal clean air act  as amended  and comparable state  local and provincial statutes 
we believe that our operations are in substantial compliance with these statutes in all areas in which we operate 
amendments to the federal clean air act enacted in the federal clean air act amendments as well as recent or soon to be adopted changes to state implementation plans for controlling air emissions in regional non attainment areas require or will require most industrial operations in the us to incur capital expenditures in order to meet air emission control standards developed by the us environmental protection agency the epa and state environmental agencies 
the federal clean air act amendments also imposed an operating permit requirement for major sources of air emissions title v permits  which applies to some of our facilities 
we will be required to incur certain capital expenditures in the next several years for air pollution control equipment in connection with obtaining or maintaining permits and approvals addressing air emission related issues 
although we can give no assurances  we believe on going compliance with the federal clean air act amendments will not have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations 
solid waste we generate wastes  including hazardous wastes  that are subject to the requirements of the federal resource conservation and recovery act rcra and comparable state statutes 
the epa is considering the adoption of stricter disposal standards for non hazardous wastes  including oil and gas wastes 
we are not currently required to comply with a substantial portion of the rcra requirements because our operations generate minimal quantities of hazardous wastes 
however  it is possible that additional wastes  which could include wastes generated by our operations that are currently classified as non hazardous wastes  will in the future be designated as hazardous wastes 
hazardous wastes are subject to more rigorous and costly disposal requirements than are non hazardous wastes 
such changes in the regulations could result in additional capital expenditures or operating expenses for us as well as the industry in general 
hazardous substances the comprehensive environmental response  compensation and liability act  as amended cercla  also known as superfund  and comparable state laws impose liability  without regard to fault or the legality of the original act  on certain classes of persons that contributed to the release of a hazardous substance into the environment 
these persons include the owner or operator of the site or sites where the release occurred and companies that disposed of  or arranged for the disposal of  the hazardous substances found at the site 
under cercla  such persons may be subject to joint and several liability for the costs of cleaning up the hazardous substances that have been released into the environment  for damages to natural resources  and for the costs of certain health studies 
cercla also authorizes the epa and  in some instances  third parties to act in response to threats to the public health or the environment and to seek to recover the costs they incur from the responsible classes of persons 
it is not uncommon for neighboring landowners and other third parties to file claims for personal injury and property damage allegedly caused by hazardous substances or other pollutants released into the environment 
in the course of our ordinary operations  we may generate waste that falls within cercla s definition of a hazardous substance 
we may be jointly and severally liable under cercla for all or part of the costs required to clean up sites at which such hazardous substances have been disposed of or released into the environment 
we currently own or lease  and have in the past owned or leased  properties where hydrocarbons are being or have been handled 
although we have utilized operating and disposal practices that were standard in the industry at the time  waste hydrocarbons or other wastes may have been disposed of or released on or under the properties owned or leased by us or on or under other locations where these wastes have been taken for disposal 
in addition  many of these properties have been operated by third parties whose treatment and disposal or release of hydrocarbons or other wastes was not under our control 
these properties and wastes disposed thereon may be subject to cercla  rcra and analogous state laws 
under such laws  we could be required to remove or remediate previously disposed wastes including wastes disposed of or released by prior owners or operators  to clean up contaminated property including contaminated groundwater or to perform remedial plugging operations to prevent future contamination 
we are currently involved in remediation activities at a number of sites  which involve potentially significant expense 
see environmental remediation 
osha we are subject to the requirements of osha  and comparable state statutes that regulate the protection of the health and safety of workers 
in addition  the osha hazard communication standard requires that certain information be maintained about hazardous materials used or produced in operations and that this information be provided to employees  state and local government authorities and citizens 
we believe that our operations are in substantial compliance with osha requirements  including general industry standards  record keeping requirements and monitoring of occupational exposure to regulated substances 
endangered species act the federal endangered species act  as amended esa  restricts activities that may affect endangered species or their habitats 
although certain of our facilities are in areas that may be designated as habitat for endangered species  we believe that we are in substantial compliance with the esa 
however  the discovery of previously unidentified endangered species could cause us to incur additional costs or operation restrictions or bans in the affected area 
hazardous materials transportation requirements the dot regulations affecting pipeline safety require pipeline operators to implement measures designed to reduce the environmental impact of oil discharge from onshore oil pipelines 
these regulations require operators to maintain comprehensive spill response plans  including extensive spill response training for pipeline personnel 
in addition  dot regulations contain detailed specifications for pipeline operation and maintenance 
we believe our operations are in substantial compliance with such regulations 
see regulation pipeline and storage regulation 
environmental remediation in connection with our acquisition of scurlock permian  we identified a number of areas of potential environmental exposure 
under the terms of our acquisition agreement  marathon ashland is fully indemnifying us for areas of environmental exposure which were identified at the time of the acquisition  including any and all liabilities associated with two superfund sites at which it is alleged scurlock permian deposited waste oils as well as any potential liability for hydrocarbon soil and water contamination at a number of scurlock permian facilities 
for environmental liabilities which were not identified at the time of the acquisition but which occurred prior to the closing  we have agreed to pay the costs relating to matters that are under  our liabilities relating to matters discovered prior to may and that exceed  is currently limited to an aggregate of million  with marathon ashland indemnifying us for any excess amounts 
marathon ashland s indemnification obligations for identified sites extend indefinitely while its obligations for non identified sites extend to matters discovered within four years of the date of acquisition may  of scurlock permian 
in connection with our acquisition of murphy oil company ltd 
s midstream operations in canada  we identified a limited number of environmental deficiencies during due diligence 
under the terms of our acquisition agreement  murphy  at its sole cost and expense  agreed to remediate to the minimum standards required by applicable environmental law the identified environmental deficiencies 
for environmental deficiencies that were not identified at the time of acquisition  but which occurred prior to closing  and were identified to murphy prior to january   we have agreed to be responsible up to an aggregate amount of  thereafter  murphy oil company ltd  agreed to remain solely responsible for the costs to remediate that exceed  for each environmental deficiency for a total of not more than ten environmental deficiencies as chosen by us 
except for the environmental deficiencies identified at the time of acquisition  murphy s maximum liability for environmental deficiencies identified post acquisition cannot exceed million 
in connection with our acquisition of the west texas gathering system  we agreed to be responsible for pre acquisition environmental liabilities up to an aggregate amount of million  while chevron pipe line company agreed to remain solely responsible for liabilities discovered prior to july that exceed this million threshold 
based on our investigations of the assets acquired from marathon ashland  murphy and chevron  we have identified several sites that exceed the threshold limitations under the various indemnities 
although we have not yet determined the total cost of remediation of these sites  we believe our indemnification arrangements should prevent such costs from having a material adverse effect on our financial condition  results of operations or cash flows 
in connection with the shell acquisition in  shell purchased an environmental insurance policy covering known and unknown environmental matters under which we are a named beneficiary 
the policy has a  deductible per site and an aggregate coverage limit of million and expires in other assets we have acquired or will acquire in the future may have environmental remediation liabilities for which we are not indemnified 
we may experience future releases of crude oil into the environment from our pipeline and storage operations  or discover releases that were previously unidentified 
although we maintain an extensive inspection program designed to prevent and  as applicable  to detect and address such releases promptly  damages and liabilities incurred due to any future environmental releases from our assets may substantially affect our business 
operational hazards and insurance a pipeline  terminal or other facilities may experience damage as a result of an accident or natural disaster 
these hazards can cause personal injury and loss of life  severe damage to and destruction of property and equipment  pollution or environmental damage and suspension of operations 
we maintain insurance of various types that we consider adequate to cover our operations and properties 
the insurance covers all of our assets in amounts considered reasonable 
the insurance policies are subject to deductibles that we consider reasonable and not excessive 
our insurance does not cover every potential risk associated with operating pipelines  terminals and other facilities including the potential loss of significant revenues 
consistent with insurance coverage generally available to the industry  our insurance policies provide limited coverage for losses or liabilities relating to pollution  with broader coverage for sudden and accidental occurrences 
the events of september   and their overall effect on the insurance industry have adversely impacted the availability and cost of coverage 
due to these events  insurers have excluded acts of terrorism and sabotage from our insurance policies 
on certain of our key assets  we have purchased a separate insurance policy for acts of terrorism and sabotage 
since the terrorist attacks  the united states government has issued numerous warnings that energy assets including our nation s pipeline infrastructure may be future targets of terrorist organizations 
these developments expose our operations and assets to increased risks 
the dot has developed a security guidance document and has issued a security circular that defines critical pipeline facilities and appropriate countermeasures for protecting them  and explains how dot plans to verify that operators have taken appropriate action to implement satisfactory security procedures and plans 
using the guidelines provided by the dot  we have specifically identified certain of our facilities as dot critical facilities and therefore potential terrorist targets 
in compliance with dot guidance  we are performing vulnerability analyses on such facilities 
upon completion of such analyses  we will institute as appropriate any indicated security measures or procedures that are not already in place 
we cannot assure you that these or any other security measures would protect our facilities from a concentrated attack 
any future terrorist attacks on our facilities  those of our customers and  in some cases  those of our competitors  could have a material adverse effect on our business  whether insured or not 
the occurrence of a significant event not fully insured or indemnified against  or the failure of a party to meet its indemnification obligations  could materially and adversely affect our operations and financial condition 
we believe that we are adequately insured for public liability and property damage to others with respect to our operations 
with respect to all of our coverage  no assurance can be given that we will be able to maintain adequate insurance in the future at rates we consider reasonable 
title to properties and rights of way we believe that we have satisfactory title to all of our assets 
although title to such properties are subject to encumbrances in certain cases  such as customary interests generally retained in connection with acquisition of real property  liens related to environmental liabilities associated with historical operations  liens for current taxes and other burdens and minor easements  restrictions and other encumbrances to which the underlying properties were subject at the time of acquisition by our predecessor or us  we believe that none of these burdens will materially detract from the value of such properties or from our interest therein or will materially interfere with their use in the operation of our business 
substantially all of our pipelines are constructed on rights of way granted by the apparent record owners of such property and  in some instances  such rights of way are revocable at the election of the grantor 
in many instances  lands over which rights of way have been obtained are subject to prior liens that have not been subordinated to the right of way grants 
in some cases  not all of the apparent record owners have joined in the right of way grants  but in substantially all such cases  signatures of the owners of majority interests have been obtained 
we have obtained permits from public authorities to cross over or under  or to lay facilities in or along water courses  county roads  municipal streets and state highways  and in some instances  such permits are revocable at the election of the grantor 
we have also obtained permits from railroad companies to cross over or under lands or rights of way  many of which are also revocable at the grantor s election 
in some cases  property for pipeline purposes was purchased in fee 
all of the pump stations are located on property owned in fee or property under long term leases 
in certain states and under certain circumstances  we have the right of eminent domain to acquire rights of way and lands necessary for our common carrier pipelines 
some of the leases  easements  rights of way  permits and licenses transferred to us  upon our formation in and in connection with acquisitions we have made since that time  required the consent of the grantor to transfer such rights  which in certain instances is a governmental entity 
we believe that we have obtained such third party consents  permits and authorizations as are sufficient for the transfer to us of the assets necessary for us to operate our business in all material respects as described in this report 
with respect to any consents  permits or authorizations that have not yet been obtained  we believe that such consents  permits or authorizations will be obtained within a reasonable period  or that the failure to obtain such consents  permits or authorizations will have no material adverse effect on the operation of our business 
employees to carry out our operations  our general partner or its affiliates employed approximately  employees at december  none of the employees of our general partner were represented by labor unions  and our general partner considers its employee relations to be good 
summary of tax considerations the tax consequences of ownership of common units depends in part on the owner s individual tax circumstances 
however  the following is a brief summary of material tax consequences of owning and disposing of common units 
partnership status  cash distributions we are classified for federal income tax purposes as a partnership based upon our meeting certain requirements imposed by the internal revenue code the code  which we must meet each year 
the owners of common units are considered partners in the partnership so long as they do not loan their common units to others to cover short sales or otherwise dispose of those units 
accordingly  we pay no federal income taxes  and a common unitholder is required to report on the unitholder s federal income tax return the unitholder s share of our income  gains  losses and deductions 
in general  cash distributions to a common unitholder are taxable only if  and to the extent that  they exceed the tax basis in the common units held 
partnership allocations in general  our income and loss is allocated to the general partner and the unitholders for each taxable year in accordance with their respective percentage interests in the partnership including  with respect to the general partner  its incentive distribution right  as determined annually and prorated on a monthly basis and subsequently apportioned among the general partner and the unitholders of record as of the opening of the first business day of the month to which they relate  even though unitholders may dispose of their units during the month in question 
a unitholder is required to take into account  in determining federal income tax liability  the unitholder s share of income generated by us for each taxable year of the partnership ending within or with the unitholder s taxable year  even if cash distributions are not made to the unitholder 
as a consequence  a unitholder s share of our taxable income and possibly the income tax payable by the unitholder with respect to such income may exceed the cash actually distributed to the unitholder by us 
at any time distributions are made on the common units in excess of distributions on the subordinated units  or incentive distributions are made to the general partner  gross income will be allocated to the recipient to the extent of those distributions 
basis of common units a unitholder s initial tax basis for a common unit is generally the amount paid for the common unit 
a unitholder s basis is generally increased by the unitholder s share of our income and decreased  but not below zero  by the unitholder s share of our losses and distributions 
limitations on deductibility of partnership losses in the case of taxpayers subject to the passive loss rules generally  individuals and closely held corporations  any partnership losses are only available to offset future income generated by us and cannot be used to offset income from other activities  including passive activities or investments 
any losses unused by virtue of the passive loss rules may be fully deducted if the unitholder disposes of all of the unitholder s common units in a taxable transaction with an unrelated party 
section election we have made the election provided for by section of the code  which will generally result in a unitholder being allocated income and deductions calculated by reference to the portion of the unitholder s purchase price attributable to each asset of the partnership 
disposition of common units a unitholder who sells common units will recognize gain or loss equal to the difference between the amount realized and the adjusted tax basis of those common units 
a unitholder may not be able to trace basis to particular common units for this purpose 
thus  distributions of cash from us to a unitholder in excess of the income allocated to the unitholder will  in effect  become taxable income if the unitholder sells the common units at a price greater than the unitholder s adjusted tax basis even if the price is less than the unitholder s original cost 
moreover  a portion of the amount realized whether or not representing gain will be ordinary income 
foreign  state  local and other tax considerations in addition to federal income taxes  unitholders will likely be subject to other taxes  such as foreign  state and local income taxes  unincorporated business taxes  and estate  inheritance or intangible taxes that are imposed by the various jurisdictions in which a unitholder resides or in which we do business or own property 
we own property and conduct business in five provinces in canada as well as in most states in the united states 
all but four of those states and all of the provinces currently impose a personal income tax that would generally require a unitholder to file a return and pay taxes in that state or province  as well as in canada 
of the states in which we primarily do business  only texas does not have a personal income tax 
in certain states  tax losses may not produce a tax benefit in the year incurred if  for example  we have no income from sources within that state and also may not be available to offset income in subsequent taxable years 
some states may require us  or we may elect  to withhold a percentage of income from amounts to be distributed to a unitholder 
withholding  the amount of which may be more or less than a particular unitholder s income tax liability owed to the state  may not relieve the nonresident unitholder from the obligation to file an income tax return 
amounts withheld may be treated as if distributed to unitholders for purposes of determining the amounts distributed by us 
it is the responsibility of each prospective unitholder to investigate the legal and tax consequences  under the laws of canada and those states and localities  of the unitholder s investment in us 
further  it is the responsibility of each unitholder to file all us federal  canadian  state  provincial and local tax returns that may be required of the unitholder 
ownership of common units by tax exempt organizations and certain other investors an investment in common units by tax exempt organizations including iras and other retirement plans  regulated investment companies mutual funds and foreign persons raises issues unique to such persons 
virtually all of our income allocated to a unitholder that is a tax exempt organization is unrelated business taxable income and  thus  is taxable to such a unitholder 
furthermore  no significant amount of our gross income is qualifying income for purposes of determining whether a unitholder will qualify as a regulated investment company  and a unitholder who is a nonresident alien  foreign corporation or other foreign person is regarded as being engaged in a trade or business in the united states as a result of ownership of a common unit and  thus  is required to file federal income tax returns and to pay tax on the unitholder s share of our taxable income 
finally  distributions to foreign unitholders are subject to federal income tax withholding 
tax shelter registration the code generally requires that tax shelters be registered with the secretary of the treasury 
we are registered as a tax shelter with the secretary of the treasury 
our tax shelter registration number is issuance of the registration number does not indicate that an investment in the partnership or the claimed tax benefits have been reviewed  examined or approved by the internal revenue service 
unauthorized trading loss background in november  we discovered that a former employee had engaged in unauthorized trading activity  resulting in losses of approximately million  which includes associated costs and legal expenses 
a full investigation into the unauthorized trading activities by outside legal counsel and independent accountants and consultants determined that the vast majority of the losses occurred from march through november  and the impact warranted a restatement of previously reported financial information for and approximately million of the unauthorized trading losses was recognized in and the remainder in in  we recognized an additional million charge for settlement of litigation related to the unauthorized trading losses 
normally  as we purchase crude oil  we establish a margin by selling crude oil for physical delivery to third parties  or by entering into future delivery obligations with respect to futures contracts 
the employee in question violated our policy of maintaining a substantially balanced position between purchases and sales or future delivery obligations by negotiating one side of a transaction without negotiating the other  leaving the position open 
the trader concealed his activities by hiding open trading positions  by rolling open positions forward using off market  inter month transactions  and by providing to counter parties forged documents that purported to authorize such transactions 
an inter month transaction is one in which the receipt and delivery of crude oil are scheduled in different months 
an off market transaction is one in which the price is higher or lower than the prices available in the market on the day of the transaction 
by matching one side of an inter month transaction with an open position  and using off market pricing to match the pricing of the open position  the trader could present documentation showing both a purchase and a sale  creating the impression of compliance with our policy 
the offsetting side of the inter month transaction became a new  hidden open position 
investigation  enhancement of procedures upon discovery of the violation and related losses  we engaged an outside law firm to lead the investigation of the unauthorized trading activities 
the law firm retained specialists from an independent accounting firm to assist in the investigation 
in parallel effort with the investigation mentioned above  the role of the accounting firm specialists was expanded to include reviewing and making recommendations for enhancement of our systems  policies and procedures 
as a result  we have developed and adopted a written policy document and manual of procedures designed to enhance our processes and procedures and improve our ability to detect any activity that might occur at an early stage 
see gathering  marketing  terminalling and storage operations crude oil volatility  counter cyclical balance  risk management 
to specifically address the methods used by the trader to conceal the unauthorized trading  in january  we sent a notice to each of our material counter parties that no person at plains all american pipeline  lp was authorized to enter into off market transactions 
in addition  we have taken the following actions we have communicated our hedging and trading strategies and risk tolerance to our traders by more clearly and specifically defining approved strategies and risk limits in our written procedures 
our procedures include i more comprehensive and frequent reporting that will allow our officers to evaluate risk positions in greater detail  and ii enhanced procedures to check compliance with these reporting requirements and to confirm that trading activity was conducted within guidelines 
the procedures provide a system to educate each employee who is involved  directly or indirectly  in our crude oil transaction activities with respect to policies and procedures  and impose an obligation to notify the risk manager directly of any questionable transactions or failure of others to adhere to the policies  practices and procedures 
finally  following notification to each of our material counter parties that off market trading is against our policy and that any written evidence to the contrary is unauthorized and false  the risk manager and our other representatives have communicated our policies and enhanced procedures to our counter parties to advise them of the information we will routinely require from them to assure timely recording and confirmation of trades 
we can give no assurance that the above steps will serve to detect and prevent all violations of our trading policy  however  we believe that such steps substantially reduce the possibility of a recurrence of unauthorized trading activities  and that any unauthorized trading that does occur would be detected before any material loss could develop 
effects of the loss the unauthorized trading and associated losses resulted in a default of certain covenants under our then existing credit facilities and significant short term cash and letter of credit requirements 
in december  we executed amended credit facilities and obtained default waivers from all of our lenders 
we paid approximately million to our lenders in connection with the amended credit facilities 
in connection with the amendments  our former general partner loaned us approximately million 
on may   we entered into new credit agreements to refinance our existing debt and repay the million owed to our former general partner 
the new credit agreements also provided us with additional flexibility for working capital  capital expenditures and other general corporate purposes 
at closing  we had million outstanding under a senior secured revolving credit facility 
we also had at closing letters of credit of approximately million and borrowings of approximately million outstanding under a separate senior secured letter of credit and borrowing facility 
we have since refinanced the credit facilities we entered into on may  see item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations liquidity and capital resources credit facilities and long term debt 
in the period immediately following the disclosure of the unauthorized trading losses  a significant number of our suppliers and trading partners reduced or eliminated the open credit previously extended to us 
consequently  the amount of letters of credit we needed to support the level of our crude oil purchases then in effect increased significantly 
in addition  the cost of letters of credit increased under our credit facility 
some of our purchase contracts were terminated 
we believe that by the year  the effects of the loss on our cost of credit and operations were minimal and the requirement for us to issue letters of credit was reduced to levels lower than existed before the unauthorized trading loss 
after the public announcement of the trading losses  class action lawsuits were filed against us and plains resources 
derivative lawsuits were also filed 
all of the cases have been settled and paid

item legal proceedings export license matter 
in our gathering and marketing activities  we import and export crude oil from and to canada 
exports of crude oil are subject to the short supply controls of the export administration regulations ear and must be licensed by the bureau of industry and security the bis of the us department of commerce 
we have determined that we may have exceeded the quantity of crude oil exports authorized by previous licenses 
export of crude oil in excess of the authorized amounts is a violation of the ear 
on october   we submitted to the bis an initial notification of voluntary disclosure 
the bis subsequently informed us that we could continue to export while previous exports were under review 
we applied for and have received a new license allowing for exports of volumes more than adequately reflecting our anticipated needs 
at this time  we have received no indication whether the bis intends to charge us with a violation of the ear or  if so  what penalties would be assessed 
as a result  we cannot estimate the ultimate impact of these potential violations 
other 
we  in the ordinary course of business  are a claimant and or a defendant in various other legal proceedings 
we do not believe that the outcome of these other legal proceedings  individually and in the aggregate  will have a materially adverse effect on our financial condition  results of operations or cash flows

on february   the market price for the common units was per unit and there were approximately  record holders and beneficial owners held in street name 
the following table sets forth high and low sales prices for the common units and the cash distributions paid per common unit for the periods indicated common unit price range cash distributions high low st quarter nd quarter rd quarter th quarter st quarter nd quarter rd quarter th quarter the class b common units are pari passu with common units with respect to quarterly distributions  and are convertible into common units upon approval of a majority of the common unitholders 
the class b unitholders may request that we call a meeting of common unitholders to consider approval of the conversion of class b units into common units 
if the approval of a conversion by the common unitholders is not obtained within days of a request  each class b unitholder will be entitled to receive distributions  on a per unit basis  equal to of the amount of distributions paid on a common unit  with such distribution right increasing to if such approval is not secured within days after the end of the day period 
except for the vote to approve the conversion  the class b units have the same voting rights as the common units 
as of february   there was one class b unitholder 
we have also issued and outstanding  subordinated units  for which there is no established public trading market 
cash distribution policy we distribute on a quarterly basis all of our available cash 
available cash generally means  for any of our fiscal quarters  all cash on hand at the end of the quarter less the amount of cash reserves that is necessary or appropriate in the reasonable discretion of our general partner to provide for the proper conduct of our business  comply with applicable law  any of our debt instruments or other agreements  or provide funds for distributions to unitholders and our general partner for any one or more of the next four quarters 
minimum quarterly distributions are for each full fiscal quarter 
distributions of available cash to the holders of subordinated units are subject to the prior rights of the holders of common units to receive the minimum quarterly distributions for each quarter during the subordination period  and to receive any arrearages in the distribution of minimum quarterly distributions on the common units for prior quarters during the subordination period 
in addition to distributions on its general partner interest  our general partner is entitled to receive incentive distributions if the amount we distribute with respect to any quarter exceeds levels specified in our partnership agreement 
under the quarterly incentive distribution provisions  generally our general partner is entitled  without duplication  to of amounts we distribute in excess of per unit  of the amounts we distribute in excess of per unit and of amounts we distribute in excess of per unit

conversion of subordinated units the subordination period will end if certain financial tests contained in the partnership agreement are met for three consecutive four quarter periods the testing period  but no sooner than december  during the first quarter after the end of the subordination period  all of the subordinated units will convert into common units 
early conversion of a portion of the subordinated units may occur if the testing period is satisfied before december  we are now in the testing period and  if we continue to meet the requirements  of the subordinated units will convert into common units in the fourth quarter of and the remainder will convert in the first quarter of our ability to meet these requirements is subject to a number of economic and operational contingencies

item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion of our financial condition and results of our operations should be read in conjunction with our historical consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes 
for more detailed information regarding the basis of presentation for the following financial information  see the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
overview plains all american pipeline  lp is a delaware limited partnership the partnership formed in september of on november   we completed our initial public offering ipo and the transactions whereby we became the successor to the midstream crude oil business and assets of plains resources inc and its wholly owned subsidiaries plains resources 
immediately after our ipo  plains resources inc owned of our general partner interest and an overall effective ownership in the partnership of including its general partner interest and common and subordinated units owned 
as discussed below  plains resources effective ownership interest in the partnership has been reduced substantially 
in may  senior management and a group of financial investors entered into a transaction with plains resources to acquire majority control of our general partner and a majority of the outstanding subordinated units 
the transaction closed in june and  for purposes of this report  is referred to as the general partner transition 
as a result of this transaction and subsequent equity offerings  plains resources overall effective ownership has been reduced to approximately 
see item security ownership of certain beneficial owners and management 
in addition  certain officers of the general partner who previously were also officers of plains resources terminated their affiliation with plains resources and as a result now devote of their efforts to the management of the partnership 
our operations are conducted directly and indirectly through our operating subsidiaries  plains marketing  lp  all american pipeline  lp and plains marketing canada  lp we are engaged in interstate and intrastate crude oil pipeline transportation as well as gathering  marketing  terminalling and storage of crude oil and liquefied petroleum gas lpg 
we own an extensive network in the united states and canada of pipeline transportation  storage and gathering assets in key oil producing basins and at major market hubs 
our operations are conducted primarily in texas  oklahoma  california  louisiana and the canadian provinces of alberta and saskatchewan and consist of two operating segments i pipeline operations and ii gathering  marketing  terminalling and storage operations 
our operating segments are discussed further in the results of operations section below 
acquisitions we completed a number of acquisitions in and that have impacted the results of operations and liquidity discussed herein 
the following acquisitions were accounted for  and the purchase price was allocated  in accordance with the purchase method of accounting 
we adopted statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 business combinations in and followed the provisions of that statement for all business combinations initiated after june  our ongoing acquisition activity is discussed further in liquidity and capital resources below 
shell west texas assets on august   we acquired interests in approximately  miles of gathering and mainline crude oil pipelines and approximately million barrels net to our interest of above ground crude oil terminalling and storage assets in west texas from shell pipeline company lp and equilon enterprises llc the shell acquisition 
the primary assets included in the transaction are interests in the basin pipeline system  the permian basin gathering system and the rancho pipeline system 
the total purchase price of million consisted of i million in cash  which was borrowed under our revolving credit facility  ii approximately million related to the settlement of pre existing accounts receivable and inventory balances and iii approximately million of estimated transaction and closing costs 
the entire purchase price was allocated to property and equipment 
we are in the process of evaluating certain estimates made in the purchase price allocation  including costs associated with the shutdown of the rancho pipeline system  thus the allocation is subject to refinement 
the acquired assets are primarily fee based mainline crude oil pipeline transportation assets that gather crude oil in the permian basin and transport the crude oil to major market locations in the mid continent and gulf coast regions 
the permian basin has long been one of the most stable crude oil producing regions in the united states  dating back to the s 
the acquired assets complement our existing asset infrastructure in west texas and represent a transportation link to cushing  oklahoma  where we provide storage and terminalling services 
in addition  we believe that the basin pipeline system is poised to benefit from potential shut downs of refineries and other pipelines due to the shifting market dynamics in the west texas area 
the rancho pipeline system will be taken out of service in march  pursuant to the operating agreement 
see items and business and properties pipeline operations pipeline assets southwest us rancho pipeline system 
for more information on this transaction  as well as historical financial information on the businesses acquired and pro forma financial information reflecting the acquisition of the businesses  please refer to our form k dated august   which was filed with the securities and exchange commission 
coast energy group and lantern petroleum in march  we completed the acquisition of substantially all of the domestic crude oil pipeline  gathering and marketing assets of coast energy group and lantern petroleum  divisions of cornerstone propane partners  lp  for approximately million in cash net of liabilities assumed and transaction costs the cornerstone acquisition 
the principal assets acquired are located in west texas and include several gathering lines  crude oil contracts and a small truck and trailer fleet 
the acquired assets serve to expand our core market in west texas and give us access to more volumes in the area 
butte pipe line company in february  we acquired an approximate equity interest in butte pipe line company from murphy ventures  a subsidiary of murphy oil corporation the butte acquisition 
the total cost of the acquisition  including various transaction and related expenses  was approximately million 
butte pipe line company owns the mile butte pipeline system  principally a mainline system  that runs from baker  montana to guernsey  wyoming 
the butte pipeline is connected to the poplar pipeline system  which in turn is connected to the wascana pipeline system  which is wholly owned by us 
we believe these pipeline systems will play an important role in moving increasing volumes of canadian crude oil into markets in the united states 
wapella pipeline system in december  we consummated the acquisition of the wapella pipeline system from private investors for approximately million  including transaction costs the wapella acquisition 
the entire purchase price was allocated to property and equipment 
the system is located in southeastern saskatchewan and southwestern manitoba and further expands our market in canada 
in  the wapella pipeline system delivered approximately  barrels per day of crude oil to the enbridge pipeline at cromer  manitoba 
the acquisition also includes approximately  barrels of crude oil storage capacity located along the system  as well as a truck terminal 
canpet energy group in july  we acquired the assets of canpet energy group inc  a calgary based canadian crude oil and lpg marketing company the canpet acquisition  for approximately million plus excess inventory at the closing date of approximately million 
approximately million of the purchase price  payable in common units  was deferred subject to various performance standards being met 
in addition  an amount will be paid equivalent to the distributions that would have been paid on the common units had they been outstanding since the acquisition was consummated 
see note partners capital and distributions in the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
at the time of the acquisition  canpet s activities consisted of gathering approximately  barrels per day of crude oil and marketing an average of approximately  barrels per day of natural gas liquids 
the principal assets acquired include a crude oil handling facility  a  barrel tank facility  lpg facilities  existing business relationships and operating inventory 
the acquired assets are part of our establishment of a canadian operation that substantially mirrors our operations in the united states 
the purchase price  as adjusted post closing  was allocated as follows in millions inventory goodwill intangible assets contracts pipeline linefill crude oil gathering  terminalling and other assets total murphy oil company ltd 
midstream operations in may  we completed the acquisition of substantially all of the canadian crude oil pipeline  gathering  storage and terminalling assets of murphy oil company ltd 
for approximately million in cash million after post closing adjustments  including financing and transaction costs the murphy acquisition 
initial financing for the acquisition was provided through borrowings under our credit facilities 
the purchase price included million for excess inventory in the pipeline systems 
the principal assets acquired include approximately miles of crude oil and condensate mainlines including dual lines on which condensate is shipped for blending purposes and blended crude is shipped in the opposite direction and associated gathering and lateral lines  approximately million barrels of crude oil storage and terminalling capacity located primarily in kerrobert  saskatchewan  approximately  barrels of pipeline linefill and tank inventories  and trailers used primarily for crude oil transportation 
the acquired assets are part of our establishment of a canadian operation that substantially mirrors our operations in the united states 
murphy agreed to continue to transport production from fields previously delivering crude oil to these pipeline systems  under a long term contract 
at the time of acquisition  these volumes averaged approximately  barrels per day 
total volumes transported on the pipeline system in were approximately  barrels per day of light  medium and heavy crudes  as well as condensate 
the purchase price  as adjusted post closing  was allocated as follows in millions crude oil pipeline  gathering and terminal assets pipeline linefill net working capital items other property and equipment other assets  including debt issue costs total critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  as well as the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities  at the date of the financial statements 
such estimates and assumptions also affect the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
although we believe these estimates are reasonable  actual results could differ from these estimates 
the critical accounting policies that we have identified are discussed below 
depreciation  amortization and impairment of long lived assets we calculate our depreciation and amortization based on estimated useful lives and salvage values of our assets 
when assets are put into service  we make estimates with respect to useful lives that we believe are reasonable 
however  subsequent events could cause us to change our estimates  thus impacting the future calculation of depreciation and amortization 
additionally  we assess our long lived assets for possible impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the assets may not be recoverable 
such indicators include changes in our business plans  a change in the extent or manner in which a long lived asset is being used or in its physical condition  or a current expectation that  more likely than not  a long lived asset will be sold or otherwise disposed of significantly before the end of its previously estimated useful life 
if the carrying value of an asset exceeds the future undiscounted cash flows expected from the asset  an impairment charge would be recorded for the excess of the carrying value of the asset over its fair value 
determination as to whether and how much an asset is impaired would necessarily involve numerous management estimates 
any impairment reviews and calculations would be based on assumptions that are consistent with our business plans and long term investment decisions 
allowance for doubtful accounts receivable we routinely review our receivable balances to identify past due amounts and analyze the reasons such amounts have not been collected 
in many instances  such uncollected amounts involve billing delays and discrepancies or disputes as to the appropriate price  volumes or quality of crude oil delivered  received or exchanged 
we also attempt to monitor changes in the creditworthiness of our customers as a result of developments related to each customer  the industry as a whole and the general economy 
based on these analyses  we have established an allowance for doubtful accounts receivable and consider the reserve adequate  however  there is no assurance that actual amounts will not vary significantly from estimated amounts 
revenue and expense accruals we routinely make accruals for both revenues and expenses due to the timing of compiling billing information  receiving third party information and reconciling our records with those of third parties 
in situations where we are required to make mark to market estimates pursuant to sfas  the estimates of gains or losses at a particular period end do not reflect the end results of particular transactions  and will most likely not reflect the actual gain or loss at the conclusion of a transaction 
we reflect estimates for these items based on our internal records and information from third parties 
a portion of the estimates we use are based on internal models or models of third parties because they are not quoted on a national market 
additionally  values may vary among different models and may not be reflective of the price at which they can be settled due to the lack of a liquid market 
we believe our estimates for these items are reasonable  but there is no assurance that actual amounts will not vary significantly from estimated amounts 
liability and contingency accruals we accrue reserves for contingent liabilities including  but not limited to  environmental remediation and potential legal claims 
accruals are made when our assessment indicates that it is probable that a liability has occurred and the amount of liability can be reasonably estimated 
our estimates are based on all known facts at the time and our assessment of the ultimate outcome 
these estimates will be increased or decreased as additional information is obtained or resolution is achieved 
determination of fair value of assets and liabilities acquired and identification of associated goodwill and intangible assets in conjunction with each acquisition  we must allocate the cost of the acquired entity to the assets and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values at the date of acquisition 
we also estimate the amount of transaction costs that will be incurred in connection with each acquisition 
as additional information becomes available  we may adjust the original estimates within a short time subsequent to the acquisition 
in addition  in conjunction with the recent adoption of sfas  we are required to recognize intangible assets separately from goodwill 
goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives are not amortized but instead are periodically assessed for impairment 
the impairment testing entails estimating future net cash flows relating to the asset  based on management s estimate of market conditions including pricing  demand  competition  operating costs and other factors 
intangible assets with finite lives are amortized over the estimated useful life determined by management 
determining the fair value of assets and liabilities acquired  as well as intangible assets that relate to such items as relationships  contracts  and industry expertise involves professional judgment and is ultimately based on acquisition models and management s assessment of the value of the assets acquired 
we believe our estimates for these items are reasonable  but there is no assurance that actual amounts will not vary significantly from estimated amounts 
results of operations analysis of three years ended december  our operating results were impacted by acquisitions made during and these acquisitions include the assets acquired in the shell acquisition  which are included in our results of operations as of august   and the murphy and canpet acquisitions  which are included in our results of operations as of april  and july   respectively 
we reported net income for the year ended december   of million on total revenues of billion compared to net income for the same period in and of million and million on total revenues of billion and billion  respectively 
when we evaluate our results for performance against expectations  public guidance and trend analysis  we exclude the impact of sfas resulting from i derivatives characterized as fair value hedges  ii derivatives that do not qualify for hedge accounting and iii the portion of cash flow hedges that is not highly effective in offsetting changes in cash flows of hedged items 
the majority of these instruments serve as economic hedges which offset future physical positions not reflected in current results 
therefore  the sfas adjustment to net income is not a complete depiction of the economic substance of the transaction  as it only represents the derivative side of these transactions and does not take into account the offsetting physical position 
also  the impact will vary from quarter to quarter based on market prices at the end of the quarter 
in addition  we exclude the impact of other unusual or nonrecurring items within each period 
the following table reconciles our reported net income to our net income before unusual or nonrecurring items and the impact of sfas in millions year ended december  reported net income write off of deferred acquisition related costs noncash reserve for potential environmental obligations noncash mark to market inventory charge noncash compensation expense gain on sale of assets gain on interest rate swap extraordinary loss on early extinguishment of debt unauthorized trading losses and related expenses noncash reserve for receivables noncash amortization of debt issues cost noncash cumulative effect of accounting change noncash sfas adjustment net income before unusual or nonrecurring items and the impact of sfas our operations consist of two operating segments pipeline operations engages in interstate and intrastate crude oil pipeline transportation and certain related merchant activities  and gathering  marketing  terminalling and storage operations engages in purchases and resales of crude oil and lpg at various points along the distribution chain and the operation of certain terminalling and storage assets 
a discussion of the results of operations of each segment follows 
pipeline operations we own and operate over  miles of gathering and mainline crude oil pipelines located throughout the united states and canada 
our activities from pipeline operations generally consist of transporting volumes of crude oil for a fee  third party leases of pipeline capacity  barrel exchanges and buy sell arrangements 
we also use our pipelines in our merchant activities conducted under our gathering and marketing business 
tariffs and other fees on our pipeline systems vary by receipt point and delivery point 
the gross margin generated by our tariff and other fee related activities depends on the volumes transported on the pipeline and the level of the tariff and other fees charged as well as the fixed and variable costs of operating the pipeline 
gross margin from our pipeline capacity leases  barrel exchanges and buy sell arrangements generally reflect a negotiated amount 
the following table sets forth our operating results from our pipeline operations segment for the periods indicated year ended december  operating results in millions revenues including intersegment gross margin general and administrative expenses gross profit average daily volumes thousands of barrels per day tariff activities all american basin other domestic canada merchant margin activities total general and administrative g a expenses reflect direct costs attributable to each segment and an allocation of other g a expenses to the segments based on the business activities that existed at that time 
for comparison purposes  we have reclassified g a expenses by segment for and to conform to the refined presentation used in the proportional allocations by segment will continue to be based on the business activities that exist during each period 
volumes associated with acquisitions represent weighted average daily amounts during the year of acquisition 
volume information has been adjusted for consistency of comparison with presentation 
as discussed above  we have completed a number of acquisitions in and that have impacted the results of operations herein 
the following table adjusts our total average daily volumes for acquisitions made in each period for comparison purposes year ended december  barrels in thousands total average daily volumes less volumes from acquisitions acquisitions total adjusted average daily volumes volumes associated with acquisitions represent weighted average daily amounts during the year of acquisition 
the acquisitions include the shell acquisition and butte acquisition 
the acquisitions includes the murphy acquisition and other minor acquisitions 
the increase in average daily volumes from to is primarily due to the inclusion of the murphy acquisition for a full year in compared to only a portion of the year in adjusted average daily volumes transported on our pipelines increased approximately  barrels per day for the year ended december  as compared to the year ended december  the increase was primarily due to higher volumes from our merchant activities partially offset by an approximate  barrel per day decrease in our all american tariff volumes attributable to california outer continental shelf ocs production and various small decreases on other domestic pipelines 
volumes from the santa ynez and point arguello fields  both offshore california  have steadily declined from through a  barrel per day decline in volumes shipped from these fields would result in a decrease in annual pipeline tariff revenues of approximately million  based on the average tariff rate 
adjusted average daily volumes transported on our pipelines increased approximately  barrels per day for the year ended december  as compared to the year ended december  the increase was primarily related to increases in the volumes transported on the west texas gathering system and various other domestic pipelines partially offset by an approximate  barrel per day decrease in our all american tariff volumes attributable to california ocs production 
as discussed above  the revenues from our pipeline operations are comprised of pipeline margin revenue from our merchant activities and tariff and fee revenues from volumes transported on our pipelines 
tariffs are typically indexed to the producer price index 
the following table details our pipeline operations revenues and adjusts our tariff and fee revenue for acquisitions made in each period for comparison purposes year ended december  in millions pipeline margin revenue tariff and fee revenue total pipeline operations revenue adjustments to tariff and fee revenue for acquisitions tariff and fee revenue less revenue from acquisitions acquisitions total adjusted tariff and fee revenue the increase in revenue from to is primarily due to the inclusion of the murphy acquisition for a full year in and increases in the tariffs of certain pipeline systems acquired in the murphy acquisition 
pipeline margin revenues from our merchant activities were approximately million for the year ended december  compared to million and million for the years ending december  and  respectively 
the increase in revenues over the prior year period is primarily related to our merchant activities on our san joaquin valley gathering system 
this increase was related to both increased volumes and higher average prices on our buy sell arrangements in the period 
however  this business is a margin business and although revenues and cost of sales are impacted by the absolute level of crude oil prices  crude oil prices have a limited impact on gross margin 
similarly  the decrease in revenues from our merchant activities for the year ended december  from the year ended december  was related to our merchant activities on our san joaquin valley gathering system 
the decrease in this period was related to lower volumes of buy sell arrangements coupled with lower average prices on those arrangements in the period compared to the period  as well as a decrease in activity due to the sale of a segment of the all american pipeline in march adjusted tariff and fee revenue was relatively flat for all of the comparable periods as the decrease in volumes attributable to ocs production was offset in each period by other increases  including increases in the tariffs for ocs volumes transported 
gross margin from pipeline operations was million for the year ended december  compared to million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the increase of approximately million in over resulted primarily from our tariff and fee related activities and was due to the following offsetting items increased volumes on our us pipelines resulting from the businesses acquired during increased volumes on our canadian pipelines due to the inclusion of the pipelines results for the entire period compared to only a portion of a decrease in our volumes attributable to california ocs production that was generally offset with an increase in the tariff per barrel of ocs production transported an increase in operating expenses to million in the period from million in the period 
the increase in operating expenses was primarily related to the acquisition of various businesses in and late and the inclusion of the results of the murphy acquisition for all of compared to only a portion of operating expense for the period also includes a million noncash charge associated with the establishment of a liability for potential cleanup of environmental conditions associated with our acquisitions 
we reassessed the previous investigations and completed environmental studies during  and remediation activities are on going 
this amount is approximately equal to the threshold amounts the partnership must incur before the sellers indemnities take effect 
in many cases  the actual cash expenditures may not occur for ten years 
the increase in pipeline gross margin of million in the period compared to the period is primarily attributable to increased margin from our tariff and fee related activities 
the increase in our tariff and fee related activities were primarily due to the impact of the canadian acquisitions 
excluding the canadian acquisitions  gross margin from pipeline operations would have increased approximately  due to slightly higher volumes and tariffs  while maintaining operating expenses at a fairly constant level 
general and administrative expense g a includes the costs directly associated with the segment  as well as a portion of corporate overhead costs considered allocable 
see other income and expenses unallocated g a expense 
g a expense related to our pipeline operations was million for the year ended december  compared to million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the increase in g a expense of approximately million in the period was partially due to increased costs from the assets acquired in the canadian acquisitions due to the inclusion of those assets for the entire period compared to only a portion of g a expense related to pipeline operations decreased approximately million in the year ended december  from the year ended december  the decrease was primarily related to lower reserves for potentially uncollectible receivables included in g a in the period 
this decrease was partially offset by g a expense of approximately million from the assets acquired in the canadian acquisition and increased personnel costs associated with the general partner transition 
gathering  marketing  terminalling and storage operations our revenues from gathering and marketing activities reflect the sale of gathered and bulk purchased barrels plus the sale of additional barrels exchanged through buy sell arrangements entered into to enhance the margins of the gathered and bulk purchased crude oil 
gross margin from our gathering and marketing activities is dependent on our ability to sell crude oil at a price in excess of our aggregate cost 
these operations are margin businesses  and are not directly affected by the absolute level of crude oil prices  but are affected by overall levels of supply and demand for crude oil and fluctuations in market related indices 
accordingly  an increase or decrease in revenues is not necessarily an indication of segment performance 
we own and operate approximately million barrels of above ground crude oil terminalling and storage facilities  including a crude oil terminalling and storage facility at cushing  oklahoma 
cushing  which we refer to as the cushing interchange  is one of the largest crude oil market hubs in the united states and the designated delivery point for new york mercantile exchange  or nymex  crude oil futures contracts 
terminals are facilities where crude oil is transferred to or from storage or a transportation system  such as a pipeline  to another transportation system  such as trucks or another pipeline 
the operation of these facilities is called terminalling 
gross margin from terminalling and storage activities is dependent on the throughput volumes  the volume of crude oil stored and the level of fees generated from our terminalling and storage services 
we also use our storage tanks to counter cyclically balance our gathering and marketing operations and to execute different hedging strategies to stabilize margins and reduce the negative impact of crude oil market volatility 
during periods when supply exceeds the demand for crude oil  the market for crude oil is often in contango  meaning that the price of crude oil for future deliveries is higher than current prices 
a contango market has a generally negative impact on marketing margins  but is favorable to the storage business  because storage owners at major trading locations such as the cushing interchange can simultaneously purchase production at current prices for storage and sell at higher prices for future delivery 
when there is a higher demand than supply of crude oil in the near term  the market is backward  meaning that the price of crude oil for future deliveries is lower than current prices 
a backwardated market has a positive impact on marketing margins because crude oil gatherers can capture a premium for prompt deliveries 
in this environment  there is little incentive to store crude oil  as current prices are above future delivery prices 
we believe that the combination of our terminalling and storage activities and gathering and marketing activities provides a counter cyclical balance that has a stabilizing effect on our operations and cash flow 
we establish a margin by selling crude oil for physical delivery to third party users  such as independent refiners or major oil companies  or by entering into a future delivery obligation with respect to futures contracts on the nymex and over the counter 
through these transactions  we establish on a monthly basis a position that is substantially balanced between crude oil purchases and sales and future delivery obligations 
we purchase crude oil on both a fixed and floating price basis 
as fixed price barrels are purchased  we enter into sales arrangements with refiners  trade partners or on the nymex  which establishes a margin and protects us against future price fluctuations 
when floating price barrels are purchased  we match those contracts with similar type sales agreements with our customers  or likewise establish a hedge position using the nymex futures market 
from time to time  we enter into arrangements that expose us to basis risk 
basis risk occurs when crude oil is purchased based on a crude oil specification and location that differs from the countervailing sales arrangement 
in order to protect profits involving our physical assets and to manage risks associated with our crude purchase obligations  we use derivative instruments 
except for pre defined inventory transactions as discussed below  our policy is only to purchase crude oil for which we have a market and to structure our sales contracts so that crude oil price fluctuations do not materially affect the gross margin which we receive 
in november  we discovered that this policy was violated 
see items and business and properties unauthorized trading losses 
except for crude oil inventory transactions that do not exceed  barrels  we do not acquire and hold crude oil futures contracts or other derivative products for the purpose of speculating on crude oil price changes that might expose us to indeterminable losses 
similarly  while we seek to maintain a position that is substantially balanced within our lpg activities  as a result of production  transportation and delivery variances as well as logistical issues associated with inclement weather conditions  from time to time we experience net unbalanced positions for short periods of time 
in connection with managing these positions and maintaining a constant presence in the marketplace  both necessary for our core business  our policies provide that any net imbalance may not exceed  barrels 
these activities are monitored independently by our risk management function and must take place within predefined limits and authorizations 
the following table sets forth our operating results from our gathering  marketing  terminalling and storage operations segment for the periods indicated year ended december  operating results in millions revenues gross margin general and administrative expenses gross profit average daily volumes thousands of barrels per day lease gathering bulk purchases total terminal throughput storage leased to third parties  monthly average volumes g a expenses reflect direct costs attributable to each segment and an allocation of other expenses to the segments based on the business activities that existed at that time 
for comparison purposes  we have reclassified g a expenses by segment for all periods presented to conform to the refined presentation used in the proportional allocations by segment will continue to be based on the business activities that exist during each period 
volumes associated with acquisitions represent weighted average daily amounts during the year of acquisition 
throughput and storage amounts for cushing facility 
the level of tankage at cushing that we allocate for our arbitrage activities and therefore is not available for lease to third parties varies throughout crude oil price cycles 
average daily volumes of crude oil gathered from producers  using our assets or third party assets  totaled approximately  barrels per day for the year ended december  compared to  barrels per day and  barrels per day for the years ended december  and  respectively 
average daily volumes of crude oil purchased in bulk  primarily at major trading locations  for each of the three years in the period ending december   totaled approximately  barrels per day   barrels per day and  barrels per day  respectively 
storage leased to third parties at our cushing terminal decreased to an average of million barrels per month for the year ended december  from an average of million barrels per month and million barrels per month in the years ended december  and  respectively 
average storage leased to third parties decreased during the period as we used an increased amount of our capacity for our own account due to contango market activities and our hedging strategies in the current year period 
a contango market exists when oil prices for future deliveries are higher than current prices thereby making it profitable to store crude oil for future delivery 
terminal throughput volumes at our cushing terminal averaged approximately   and  barrels per day for the years ended december   and  respectively 
revenues from our gathering  marketing  terminalling and storage operations in each of the three years in the period ended december  totaled approximately billion  billion and billion  respectively 
the increase in resulted from higher average volumes from our canadian and us operations 
revenues from our canadian operations were approximately billion for the period compared to billion in the increase was primarily related to the inclusion of the canpet acquisition for all of compared to only a portion of this resulted in an increase in gathered volumes of approximately  barrels per day and bulk purchases of approximately  barrels per day over the period 
the remaining increase was primarily related to higher us volumes during the average nymex settlement price for crude oil was per barrel in compared to per barrel in the increase in as compared to was primarily due to the impact of the canadian acquisitions offset by lower oil prices in the period 
the average nymex settlement price for crude oil was per barrel in as noted previously  revenues are also impacted by buy sell arrangements entered into to enhance the margins of our lease gathered and bulk purchased barrels 
we have not included the volumes associated with these buy sell arrangements 
gross margin from gathering  marketing  terminalling and storage operations totaled approximately million in the year ended december  compared to approximately million and million in the years ended december  and  respectively 
as discussed above  we exclude the impact of sfas and other unusual or nonrecurring items when evaluating our results 
the table below reconciles our reported gross margin for the segment to gross margin before unusual or nonrecurring items and the impact of sfas adjusted gross margin 
included in the reconciling items below is a million noncash writedown of operating crude oil inventory in the fourth quarter of to reflect prices at december  see note summary of significant accounting policies in the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
additionally  in  we recognized a million charge for the settlement of litigation related to the unauthorized trading by a former employee

the decrease in adjusted gross margin in as compared to the period is primarily attributable to a relatively weak environment for gathering and marketing due to market conditions 
the market conditions during were favorable for gathering and marketing margins 
g a includes the costs directly associated with the segment  as well as a portion of corporate overhead costs considered allocable 
see other income and expenses unallocated g a expense 
g a expense related to our gathering  marketing  terminalling and storage operations was million for the year ended december  compared to million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the increase in g a expense of approximately million in the period was primarily due to increased costs of million from the assets acquired in the canadian acquisition due to the inclusion of those assets for the entire period compared to only a portion of partially offset by decreased g a of million from our domestic operations 
this decrease was partially related to a reduction in accounting and consulting costs in the period from those that had been incurred in the period 
g a expense related to gathering  marketing  terminalling and storage operations increased approximately million for the year ended december  from the year ended december  the increase was primarily related to costs of approximately million from the assets acquired in the canadian acquisition and increased personnel costs associated with the general partner transition partially offset by lower reserves for potentially uncollectible receivables included in g a in the period 
other income and expenses unallocated g a expenses 
total g a expenses were million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
we have included in the above segment discussion the g a expense for each of these years that were attributable to our segments 
during  we incurred charges that were not attributable to a segment of million related to the write off of deferred acquisition related costs 
see outlook ongoing acquisition activities 
during and  we incurred charges that were not attributable to a segment of million and million  respectively  related to incentive compensation paid to certain officers and key employees of plains resources and its affiliates 
in in connection with our ipo and  plains resources granted certain officers and key employees of the former general partner the right to earn ownership in a portion of our common units owned by it 
these rights provided for a three year vesting period  subject to distributions being paid on the common and subordinated units 
in connection with the general partner transition in  certain equity interests previously granted to management and outside directors vested  resulting in a charge to our income of approximately million  of which plains resources funded approximately 
approximately million of the charge and all of the charge were noncash and were not allocated to a segment 
depreciation and amortization 
depreciation and amortization expense was million for the year ended december  compared to million and million for the periods ended december  and  respectively 
excluding depreciation expense of million related to the assets acquired in the shell acquisition  depreciation and amortization expense would have been approximately million for the period 
approximately million of the million increase in the adjusted depreciation and amortization for the period is related to the inclusion of the assets acquired in the canadian acquisition for the entire period compared to only a portion of the remainder of the increase is related to an increase in debt issue costs related to the amendment of our credit facilities during and late  the sale of senior notes in september  and the completion of various capital expansion projects 
depreciation and amortization expense for the period includes million related to nonrecurring amortization of debt issue costs associated with credit facilities put in place during the fourth quarter of  subsequent to the unauthorized trading losses 
excluding this nonrecurring cost  depreciation and amortization would have been approximately million for the period 
the increase of million in from the adjusted depreciation and amortization expense is primarily related to the assets acquired in the canadian acquisition 
interest expense 
interest expense was million for the year ended december  compared to million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
interest expense was relatively flat in the period as compared to the prior year due to the impact of higher debt levels and commitment fees offset by lower average interest rates and the capitalization of interest 
the overall increased average debt balance in is due to the portion of the shell acquisition in august which was not refinanced with the issuance of equity 
see liquidity and capital resources liquidity 
during the third quarter of  we issued a million senior secured term b loan  the proceeds of which were used to reduce borrowings under the revolver 
as such  our commitment fees on our revolver increased as they are based on unused availability 
the lower interest rates in are due to a decrease in libor and prime rates in the current year 
in addition  approximately million of interest expense was capitalized during  in conjunction with expansion construction on our cushing terminal compared to approximately million in the period 
interest expense was slightly higher in the period as compared to the period primarily due to higher average debt balances  partially offset by lower average interest rates 
gain on sale of assets 
in march  we sold to a unit of el paso corporation for million the segment of the all american pipeline that extends from emidio  california to mccamey  texas 
except for minor third party volumes  one of our subsidiaries  plains marketing  lp  had been the sole shipper on this segment of the pipeline since its predecessor acquired the line from the goodyear tire rubber company in july we realized net proceeds of approximately million after the associated transaction costs and estimated costs to remove equipment 
we used the proceeds from the sale to reduce outstanding debt 
we recognized a gain of approximately million in connection with the sale 
we suspended shipments of crude oil on this segment of the pipeline in november at that time  we owned approximately million barrels of crude oil in the segment of the pipeline 
we sold this crude oil from november to february for net proceeds of approximately million  which were used for working capital purposes 
we recognized gains of approximately million in in connection with the sale of the linefill 
early extinguishment of debt 
during  we recognized extraordinary losses  consisting primarily of unamortized debt issue costs  totaling million related to the permanent reduction of the all american pipeline  lp term loan facility and the refinancing of our credit facilities 
in addition  interest and other income for the year ended december   includes million of previously deferred gains from terminated interest rate swaps as a result of debt extinguishment 
outlook ongoing acquisition activities 
consistent with our business strategy  we are continuously engaged in discussions with potential sellers regarding the possible purchase by us of midstream crude oil assets 
such acquisition efforts involve participation by us in processes that have been made public  involve a number of potential buyers and are commonly referred to as auction processes  as well as situations where we believe we are the only party or one of a very limited number of potential buyers in negotiations with the potential seller 
in connection with these activities  we routinely incur third party costs  which are capitalized and deferred pending final outcome of the transaction 
deferred costs associated with successful transactions are capitalized as part of the transaction  while deferred costs associated with unsuccessful transactions are expensed at the time of such final determination 
we can give you no assurance that our current or future acquisitions efforts will be successful or that any such acquisition will be completed on terms considered favorable to us 
we were very active in in evaluating several potential acquisitions and an unusually high level of internal and external resources were devoted to that effort 
we were unsuccessful in our pursuit of several sizable acquisition opportunities that were evaluated on an auction basis and also one negotiated transaction that had nearly advanced to the execution stage when it was abruptly terminated by the seller 
as a result  our fourth quarter results reflect a million charge to g a expenses associated with the third party costs of these unsuccessful transactions 
at december   the remaining balance of deferred acquisition related costs pending final outcome was not material 
shutdown of rancho pipeline system 
the rancho pipeline system agreement dated november   pursuant to which the system was constructed and operated  terminates in march upon termination  the agreement requires the owners to take the pipeline system  in which we own an approximate interest  out of service 
accordingly  we have notified our shippers that we will not accept nominations for movements after february  as contemplated at the time of the shell acquisition  plans are currently under way to purge and idle portions of the pipeline system subject to final determination of the disposition of the system 
during  total volumes shipped from west texas to the gulf coast ship channel on the rancho system approximated  barrels per day 
since acquiring the pipeline in  these volumes averaged approximately  barrels per day 
we estimate that the shut down of rancho initially will have a negative influence on operating results in the first and second quarters of as we take the line out of service and deal with logistical issues 
once the pipeline is shut down  these volumes become candidates for shipment on the basin system  which we operate and in which we own an approximate interest 
we estimate that increased movements on the basin system will substantially offset the adverse impact on our operating results 
ferc notice of proposed rulemaking 
on august   the federal energy regulatory commission ferc issued a notice of proposed rulemaking that  if adopted  would amend its uniform systems of accounts for oil pipeline companies with respect to participation of a ferc regulated subsidiary in the cash management arrangement of its non ferc regulated parent 
although it appears that  if adopted  the rule may affect the way in which we manage cash  we believe that the incremental costs will not be significant 
sarbanes oxley act and new sec rules 
several regulatory and legislative initiatives were introduced in in response to developments during and regarding accounting issues at large public companies  resulting disruptions in the capital markets and ensuing calls for action to prevent repetition of those events 
we support the actions called for under these initiatives and believe these steps will ultimately be successful in accomplishing the stated objectives 
however  implementation of reforms in connection with these initiatives will add to the costs of doing business for all publicly traded entities  including the partnership 
these costs will have an adverse impact on future income and cash flow  especially in the near term as legal  financial and consultant costs are incurred to analyze the new requirements  formalize current practices and implement required changes to ensure that we maintain compliance with these new rules 
we are not able to estimate the magnitude of increase in our costs that will result from such reforms 
vesting of unit grants under ltip and conversion of subordinated units 
in connection with our public offering in  our general partner established a long term incentive plan  which permits the grant of restricted units and unit options covering an aggregate of approximately million units 
grants of approximately million restricted units and no unit options are outstanding under the plan 
a restricted unit grant entitles the grantee to receive a common unit upon the vesting of the restricted unit 
subject to additional vesting requirements  restricted units may vest in the same proportion as the conversion of our outstanding subordinated units into common units 
certain of the restricted unit grants contain additional vesting requirements tied to the partnership achieving targeted distribution thresholds  generally  and per unit  in equal proportions 
under generally accepted accounting principles  we are required to recognize an expense when the financial tests for conversion of subordinated units and required distribution levels are met 
the financial tests involve gaap accounting concepts as well as complex and esoteric cash receipts and disbursement concepts that are indexed to the minimum quarterly distribution rate of per limited partner unit 
because of this complexity  it is difficult to forecast when the vesting of these restricted units will occur 
however  at the current annualized distribution level of per unit  assuming the subordination conversion test is met  the costs associated with the vesting of up to approximately  units would be incurred or accrued in the second half of or the first quarter of at an annualized distribution level of to  the number of units would be approximately  at an annualized distribution level at or above  the number of units would be approximately  we are currently planning to issue units to satisfy the first  vested and delivered after any units withheld for taxes and to purchase units in the open market to satisfy any vesting obligations in excess of that amount 
issuance of units would result in a non cash compensation expense  while a purchase of units would result in a cash charge to compensation expense 
in addition  the company match portion of payroll taxes  plus the value of any units withheld for taxes  would result in a cash charge 
the amount of the charge to expense will depend on the unit price on the date vesting occurs 
liquidity and capital resources liquidity cash generated from operations and our credit facilities are our primary sources of liquidity 
at december   we had a working capital deficit of approximately million  approximately million of availability under our revolving credit facility and million of availability under the letter of credit and hedged inventory facility 
usage of the credit facilities is subject to compliance with covenants 
in the past  we have generally maintained a positive working capital position 
during  we reduced our working capital  primarily through the i collection of accounts receivable and certain prepayments and the application of those proceeds to reduce long term borrowings  and ii shifting a portion of our borrowings to finance certain contango inventory and lpg purchase requirements from long term revolving credit facilities to our hedged inventory and letter of credit facility 
the hedged inventory and letter of credit facility requires reduction in outstanding amounts at the time proceeds from the sale of the inventory are collected 
accordingly  amounts drawn under this facility are reflected as a current liability for hedged inventory expected to be sold within one year 
in addition  approximately million of the company s net liability under sfas is reflected as current 
with respect to collections referred to in i above  during  we collected a net amount of approximately million of amounts that had been outstanding primarily since and in addition  as of december   to reduce credit risk  we had received approximately million of payments related to december business 
typically  accounts receivable are collected within thirty days following the month of business 
see contingencies recent disruptions in industry credit markets 
we funded the purchase of the shell acquisition on august   with funds drawn on our revolving credit facilities 
later in august  we completed a public offering of  common units priced at per unit 
net proceeds from the offering  including our general partner s proportionate capital contribution and expenses associated with the offering  were approximately million and were used to pay down our revolving credit facilities 
during september  we completed the sale of million of senior notes due in october  which generated net proceeds of million that we used to pay down our revolving credit facilities 
see credit facilities and long term debt 
we believe that we have sufficient liquid assets  cash from operations and borrowing capacity under our credit agreements to meet our financial commitments  debt service obligations  contingencies and anticipated capital expenditures 
however  we are subject to business and operational risks that could adversely affect our cash flow 
a material decrease in our cash flows would likely produce a corollary adverse effect on our borrowing capacity 
cash flows cash flows for the years ended december   and were as follows year ended december  in millions cash provided by used in operating activities investing activities financing activities operating activities 
net cash provided by operating activities for the year ended december  was million as compared to cash used in operating activities of million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
approximately million of the increase is due to an increase in net income  predominantly related to our acquisitions completed in april and july and august the remainder of the increase is due to changes in working capital items related to the following i the collection of amounts related to prior year balances as discussed above in liquidity and further below in contingencies recent disruptions in industry credit markets  ii the collection of prepayments due to the increase in credit risk associated with certain counter parties  and iii the sale of hedged crude oil inventory purchased in and and the correlated changes in accounts receivable and accounts payable 
in addition to the hedged inventory transactions having a positive effect on cash provided by operating activities for the year ended december   similar transactions had a negative effect on the year ended december  as the inventory was being purchased and stored  thus resulting in an even larger variance when comparing the two periods 
net cash used in operating activities in is primarily attributable to inventory purchased and stored in our facilities for sale and delivery at a later date 
excluding these inventory purchases  cash provided by operating activities was approximately million in except for minor amounts  the inventory has been hedged against future price risk by using nymex transactions and fixed price sales contracts 
net cash used in operating activities in resulted primarily from the unauthorized trading losses 
the losses were partially offset by increased margins due to the scurlock and west texas gathering system acquisitions 
investing activities 
net cash used in investing activities in includes the payment of million related to the shell acquisition and related transaction costs  million for the butte acquisition and million for the cornerstone acquisition 
investing activities also includes million of capital expenditures related to the cushing expansion  the construction of the marshall terminal in canada and other capital projects 
net cash used in investing activities in included million for the canadian acquisitions and million primarily for other expansion and acquisition projects 
net cash provided by investing activities for included approximately million of proceeds from the sale of the all american pipeline and pipeline linefill offset by approximately million of capital expenditures 
capital expenditures for included approximately million for expansion capital and million for maintenance capital 
financing activities 
cash provided by financing activities in consisted of approximately million of net proceeds from the issuance of common units and senior unsecured notes  used primarily to fund capital projects and acquisitions and pay down outstanding balances on the revolving credit facility 
net repayments of our short term and long term revolving credit facilities during were million 
in addition  million of distributions were paid to unitholders and the general partner during the year ended december  cash provided by financing activities in consisted primarily of net short term and long term borrowings of million  proceeds from the issuance of common units of million  the payment of million in distributions to unitholders and the payment of million in financing costs 
cash used in financing activities in consisted primarily of net short term and long term payments of million  the repayment of subordinated debt of million to our former general partner and distributions to unitholders of million 
cash used to reduce the debt primarily came from the asset sales discussed above 
cash used to repay the million of subordinated debt to our former general partner came from our revolving credit facility  which was refinanced in may universal shelf we have filed with the securities and exchange commission a universal shelf registration statement that  subject to effectiveness at the time of use  allows us to issue from time to time up to an aggregate of million of debt or equity securities 
at december   we have approximately million of remaining availability under this registration statement 
credit facilities and long term debt during september  we completed the sale of million of senior notes due in october the notes were issued by us and a owned finance subsidiary neither of which have independent assets or operations at a discount of million  resulting in an effective interest rate of 
interest payments are due on april and october of each year 
the notes are fully and unconditionally guaranteed  jointly and severally  by all of our existing owned subsidiaries  except for subsidiaries which are minor 
during  we amended our credit facilities to remove a condition requiring us to obtain lender approval before making any acquisition greater than million and to accommodate the increased activity level associated with the expanded asset base  while preserving our ability to pursue additional acquisitions 
as amended during and giving effect to the third quarter capital raising activities  our credit facilities consist of a million senior secured letter of credit and hedged inventory facility with current lender commitments totaling million  and a million senior secured revolving credit and term loan facility  each of which is secured by substantially all of our assets 
the terms of our credit facilities enable us to expand the commitments under the letter of credit and hedged inventory facility from million to million without additional approval from existing lenders 
the revolving credit and term loan facility consists of a million domestic revolving facility with a million letter of credit sublimit  a million canadian revolving facility with a million letter of credit sublimit  a million term loan  and a million term b loan 
the facilities have final maturities as follows as to the million senior secured letter of credit and hedged inventory facility and the aggregate million domestic and canadian revolver portions  in april  as to the million term loan  in may  and as to the million term b loan  in september our credit facilities and the indenture governing the senior notes contain cross default provisions 
our credit facilities prohibit distributions on  or purchases or redemptions of  units if any default or event of default is continuing 
in addition  the agreements contain various covenants limiting our ability to  among other things incur indebtedness  engage in transactions with affiliates  grant liens  enter into prohibited contracts  and sell assets  enter into a merger or consolidation 
make investments  our credit facilities treat a change of control as an event of default and also require us to maintain a current ratio as defined of at least to  a debt coverage ratio which will not be greater than to on all outstanding debt and to on secured debt  an interest coverage ratio that is not less than to  and a debt to capital ratio of not greater than to through march   and to at any time thereafter 
for covenant compliance purposes  letters of credit and borrowings under the letter of credit and hedged inventory facility are excluded when calculating the debt coverage and debt to capital ratios 
additionally  under the covenants  unborrowed availability under the million domestic and canadian revolving credit facilities is added to working capital to calculate the current ratio for compliance purposes 
at december   unborrowed availability was approximately for purposes of calculating the current ratio 
a default under our credit facilities would permit the lenders to accelerate the maturity of the outstanding debt and to foreclose on the assets securing the credit facilities 
as long as we are in compliance with our credit agreements  they do not restrict our ability to make distributions of available cash as defined in our partnership agreement 
we are currently in compliance with the covenants contained in our credit facilities and senior notes credit agreements 
the amended facility permits us to issue up to an aggregate of million of senior unsecured debt that has a maturity date extending beyond the maturity date of the existing credit facility  and provides a mechanism to reduce the amount of the domestic revolving credit facility 
the foregoing description of the credit facility incorporates the reduction associated with the million senior note offering completed in september depending on the amount of additional senior indebtedness incurred  the domestic revolving credit facility will be reduced by an amount equating to to of any incremental indebtedness up to the aggregate million limitation 
the average life of our debt capitalization at december   was approximately years 
at the end of the year we had approximately million outstanding under our million of revolving credit facilities that mature in  approximately million of senior secured term loans with final maturity dates in and and million of senior notes which mature in we have classified the million of term loan payments due in as long term due to our intent and ability to refinance those maturities using the revolving facility 
term loan payments are as follows in millions calendar year payment total we manage our exposure to increasing interest rates 
based on december   debt balances  floating rate indexes at the end of january  our credit spread under our credit facilities and the combination of our fixed rate debt and current interest rate hedges  the average interest rate was approximately  excluding non use and facilities fees  which will vary based on usage and outstanding balance 
based on current amounts outstanding  we estimate these fees will average approximately million per year 
we have locked in interest rates excluding the credit spread under the credit facilities for approximately of our total debt for the next year  for the next four years and for the next ten years 
contingencies recent disruptions in industry credit markets 
as a result of business failures  revelations of material misrepresentations and related financial restatements by several large  well known companies in various industries during and  there have been significant disruptions and extreme volatility in the financial markets and credit markets 
because of the credit intensive nature of the energy industry and troubling disclosures by several large  diversified energy companies  the energy industry has been especially impacted by these developments  with the rating agencies downgrading a number of large  energy related companies 
accordingly  in this environment we are exposed to an increased level of direct and indirect counterparty credit and performance risk 
the majority of our credit extensions and therefore our accounts receivable relate to our gathering and marketing activities that can generally be described as high volume and low margin activities  in many cases involving complex exchanges of crude oil volumes 
in transacting business with our counterparties  we must determine the amount  if any  of open credit lines to extend to our counterparties and the form and amount of financial performance assurances we may require 
as a result of these developments  during we modified our ongoing credit arrangements with certain counterparties  reducing or eliminating the amount of open credit we extend and requiring prepayments or standby letters of credit for business activities that exceed these revised credit limits 
the vast majority of our accounts receivable settle monthly and any collection delays generally involve discrepancies or disputes as to the appropriate price  volume or quality of crude oil delivered or exchanged and associated billing delays 
at december   approximately of our net accounts receivables included in current assets are less than days past scheduled invoice date 
the majority of the remaining and the balance of accounts receivable classified as long term relate to monthly periods leading up to and immediately following the disclosure of unauthorized trading losses that we experienced in late such balances are subject to ongoing reconciliations primarily to resolve discrepancies associated with pricing  volumes  quality or crude oil exchange imbalances 
following the unauthorized trading loss disclosure  a significant number of our suppliers and trading partners temporarily reduced or eliminated our open credit and demanded payments or withheld payments due us before disputed amounts or discrepancies were reconciled in accordance with customary industry practices 
because these matters also arose in the midst of various software systems conversions and acquisition integration activities  our effort to resolve outstanding claims and discrepancies has included reprocessing and integrating historical information on numerous software platforms 
during  significant  concerted effort was directed to resolving these matters in an ongoing effort to bring substantially all receivable balances to within sixty days of scheduled invoice date 
as a result of this effort  the aggregate balance of all account receivable balances greater than sixty days past scheduled invoice date at december  was reduced by approximately and the balance of our accounts receivable included in current assets that were less than days past scheduled invoice date improved to at december  from at december  based on the work performed to date  we believe net receivable balances greater than sixty days past scheduled invoice date are collectible or subject to offsets and consider our reserves adequate 
however  in the event our counterparties experience an unanticipated deterioration in their credit worthiness  any addition to existing reserves or write offs in excess of such reserves would result in a noncash charge to earnings 
we do not believe any such charge would have a material effect on our cash flow or liquidity 
to date  these market disruptions have not had a material adverse impact on our activities or on obtaining open credit for our account with counterparties 
in february standard and poor s upgraded our corporate credit rating to investment grade  assigning us a rating of bbb  stable outlook 
in september  moody s investor services upgraded our senior implied credit rating to ba  stable outlook 
you should note that a credit rating is not a recommendation to buy  sell  or hold securities  and may be subject to revision or withdrawal at any time 
export license matter 
in our gathering and marketing activities  we import and export crude oil from and to canada 
exports of crude oil are subject to the short supply controls of the export administration regulations ear and must be licensed by the bureau of industry and security the bis of the us department of commerce 
we have determined that we may have exceeded the quantity of crude oil exports authorized by previous licenses 
export of crude oil in excess of the authorized amounts is a violation of the ear 
on october   we submitted to the bis an initial notification of voluntary disclosure 
the bis subsequently informed us that we could continue to export while previous exports were under review 
we applied for and have received a new license allowing for exports of volumes more than adequately reflecting our anticipated needs 
at this time  we have received no indication whether the bis intends to charge us with a violation of the ear or  if so  what penalties would be assessed 
as a result  we cannot estimate the ultimate impact of these potential violations 
pipeline and storage regulation 
we are subject to the us department of transportation s the dot s pipeline integrity rules  which require continual assessment of pipeline segments that could affect high consequence areas 
our compliance costs will vary from year to year based on the assessment priority placed on particular line segments 
based on currently available information  we estimate that such costs will average approximately million per year in and such amounts incorporate approximately million per year associated with assets acquired in the shell acquisition 
we will continue to refine our estimates as data from initial assessments is collected 
see items and business and properties regulation pipeline and storage regulation 
the dot has adopted api as the standard for the inspection  repair  alteration and reconstruction of existing crude oil storage tanks subject to dot jurisdiction approximately of our million barrels 
api requires regularly scheduled inspection and repair of tanks remaining in service 
full compliance is required by we have commenced our compliance activities under the standard and  based on currently available information  we estimate that we will spend approximately million per year in and in connection with these activities 
such amounts incorporate costs associated with assets acquired in the shell acquisition 
we will continue to refine our estimates as data from initial assessments is collected 
other 
a pipeline  terminal or other facilities may experience damage as a result of an accident or natural disaster 
these hazards can cause personal injury and loss of life  severe damage to and destruction of property and equipment  pollution or environmental damage and suspension of operations 
we maintain insurance of various types that we consider adequate to cover our operations and properties 
the insurance covers all of our assets in amounts considered reasonable 
the insurance policies are subject to deductibles that we consider reasonable and not excessive 
our insurance does not cover every potential risk associated with operating pipelines  terminals and other facilities  including the potential loss of significant revenues 
consistent with insurance coverage generally available to the industry  our insurance policies provide limited coverage for losses or liabilities relating to pollution  with broader coverage for sudden and accidental occurrences 
the events of september   and their overall effect on the insurance industry has had an adverse impact on availability and cost of coverage 
due to these events  insurers have excluded acts of terrorism and sabotage from our insurance policies 
on certain of our key assets  we purchased a separate insurance policy for acts of terrorism and sabotage 
since the terrorist attacks  the united states government has issued numerous warnings that energy assets including our nation s pipeline infrastructure may be future targets of terrorist organizations 
these developments expose our operations and assets to increased risks 
the dot has developed a security guidance document and has issued a security circular that defines critical pipeline facilities and appropriate countermeasures for protecting them  and explains how dot plans to verify that operators have taken appropriate action to implement satisfactory security procedures and plans 
using the guidelines provided by the dot  we have specifically identified certain of our facilities as dot critical facilities and therefore potential terrorist targets 
in compliance with dot guidance  we are performing vulnerability analyses on such facilities 
upon completion of such analyses  we will institute as appropriate any indicated security measures or procedures that are not already in place 
we cannot assure you that these or any other security measures would protect our facilities from a concentrated attack 
any future terrorist attacks on our facilities  those of our customers and  in some cases  those of our competitors  could have a material adverse effect on our business whether insured or not 
the occurrence of a significant event not fully insured or indemnified against  or the failure of a party to meet its indemnification obligations  could materially and adversely affect our operations and financial condition 
we believe that we are adequately insured for public liability and property damage to others with respect to our operations 
with respect to all of our coverage  no assurance can be given that we will be able to maintain adequate insurance in the future at rates we consider reasonable 
we may experience future releases of crude oil into the environment from our pipeline and storage operations  or discover past releases that were previously unidentified 
although we maintain an inspection program designed to prevent and  as applicable  to detect and address such releases promptly  damages and liabilities incurred due to any such environmental releases from our assets may substantially affect our business 
capital requirements we have made and will continue to make capital expenditures for acquisitions and expansion and maintenance capital 
historically  we have financed these expenditures primarily with cash generated by operations  credit facility borrowings  the issuance of senior unsecured notes and the sale of additional common units 
we expect to spend approximately million on expansion capital projects during this includes approximately million for one acquisition that we closed in the first quarter of and two additional acquisitions currently being negotiated which  if consummated  are expected to close in march or april of the assets acquired in the transaction that closed in the first quarter consist of a mile crude oil pipeline system and approximately  barrels of crude oil storage capacity 
we plan to replace approximately miles of existing pipe on this pipeline and to build a twelve mile extension of the system to connect to our terminal in cushing 
approximately million of costs related to this acquisition will not be incurred until our expansion capital estimate also includes costs for various internal expansion projects and approximately million to construct crude oil gathering and transmission lines in west texas 
we also estimate we will spend approximately million in maintenance capital during in addition  we anticipate increasing our share of the crude oil linefill in the basin pipeline throughout  potentially adding as much as one million barrels as we expand our shipment activities on this pipeline 
the cost to purchase this linefill will depend on market conditions at the time of purchase 
commitments the following table reflects our long term non cancelable contractual obligations as of december  in millions contractual obligations thereafter total long term debt including current maturities operating leases total contractual cash obligations operating leases are primarily for office rent and trucks used in our gathering activities 
other than the amounts reflected above for operating leases  we have no other financing arrangements that are not reflected on the consolidated balance sheet 
as is common within the industry  we have entered into various operational commitments and agreements related to pipeline operations and to the marketing  transportation  terminalling and storage of crude oil 
we believe that such commitments will be met without a material adverse effect on our financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
we will distribute of our available cash within days after the end of each quarter to unitholders of record and to our general partner 
available cash is generally defined as all cash and cash equivalents on hand at the end of the quarter less reserves established by our general partner for future requirements 
minimum quarterly distributions are per unit for each full fiscal quarter 
distributions of available cash to the holders of subordinated units are subject to the prior rights of the holders of common units to receive the minimum quarterly distributions for each quarter during the subordination period  and to receive any arrearages in the distribution of minimum quarterly distributions on the common units for prior quarters during the subordination period 
there were no arrearages on common units at december  on february   we paid a cash distribution of per unit on all outstanding units 
the total distribution paid was approximately million  with approximately million paid to our common unitholders  million paid to our subordinated unitholders and million paid to our general partner for its general partner million and incentive distribution interests million 
our general partner is entitled to incentive distributions if the amount we distribute with respect to any quarter exceeds levels specified in our partnership agreement 
under the quarterly incentive distribution provisions  our general partner is entitled  without duplication  to of amounts we distribute in excess of per limited partner unit  of amounts we distribute in excess of per limited partner unit and of amounts we distribute in excess of per limited partner unit 
see item certain relationships and related transactions our general partner 
in connection with our crude oil marketing  we provide certain purchasers and transporters with irrevocable standby letters of credit to secure our obligation for the purchase of crude oil 
our liabilities with respect to these purchase obligations are recorded in accounts payable on our balance sheet in the month the crude oil is purchased 
generally  these letters of credit are issued for up to seventy day periods and are terminated upon completion of each transaction 
at december   we had outstanding letters of credit of approximately million 
these letters of credit are secured by our crude oil inventory and accounts receivable 
related party transactions we have a long term agreement with plains resources including its subsidiaries that conduct exploration and production activities pursuant to which we purchase for resale at market prices all of plains resources equity crude oil production for a fee of per barrel 
in november  the agreement automatically extended for three years 
the fee is subject to adjustment every three years based on then existing market conditions 
for the years ended december   and  we paid approximately million  million and million  respectively for plains resources production and recognized gross margin of approximately million  million and million 
on december   plains resources completed a spin off of one of its subsidiaries  plains exploration and production pxp  to its shareholders 
pxp is a successor participant to this marketing agreement 
recent accounting pronouncements in december  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued sfas no 
accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure 
sfas provides alternative methods of transition for a voluntary change to the fair value based method of accounting for stock based employee compensation 
in addition  sfas amends the disclosure requirements of sfas in both annual and interim financial statements 
sfas is effective for financial statements for fiscal years ending after december   and financial reports containing condensed financial statements for interim periods beginning after december  our general partner has stock based employee compensation plans see notes and 
these plans are accounted for under the fair value method as described in sfas therefore  we do not believe that the adoption of this statement will have a material effect on either our financial position  results of operations  cash flows or disclosure requirements 
in october  the emerging issues task force eitf reached consensus on certain issues in eitf issue no 
 recognition and reporting of gains and losses on energy trading contracts under issues no 
and the consensus reached included i rescinding eitf and ii the requirement that mark to market gains and losses on trading contracts whether realized or unrealized and whether financially or physically settled be shown net in the income statement using the indicators identified in issue no 
the eitf provided guidance that  beginning on october   all new contracts that would have been accounted for under eitf should no longer be marked to market through earnings unless such contracts fall within the scope of sfas all of the contracts that we have accounted for under eitf fall within the scope of sfas and therefore will continue to be marked to market through earnings under the provisions of that rule 
therefore  the adoption of this rule did not have a material effect on either our financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
in june  the fasb issued sfas no 
accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities 
sfas requires that a liability for a cost associated with an exit or disposal activity be recognized when the obligation is incurred rather than at the date of the exit plan 
this statement is effective for exit or disposal activities that are initiated after december  we have not initiated exit or disposal activities that are subject to this statement and thus do not believe that the adoption of sfas will have a material effect on either our financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
in april  the fasb issued sfas no 
 rescission of fasb statements no 
  and  amendment of fasb statement no 
 and technical corrections 
sfas rescinds  updates  clarifies and simplifies existing accounting pronouncements 
among other things  sfas rescinds sfas  which required all gains and losses from extinguishment of debt to be aggregated and  if material  classified as an extraordinary item  net of related income tax effect 
under sfas  the criteria in accounting principles board no 
will now be used to classify those gains and losses 
the adoption of this and the remaining provisions of sfas did not have a material effect on our financial position or results of operations 
however  any future extinguishments of debt may impact income from continuing operations 
in june  the fasb issued sfas no 
asset retirement obligations 
sfas establishes accounting requirements for retirement obligations associated with tangible long lived assets  including the time of the liability recognition  initial measurement of the liability  allocation of asset retirement cost to expense  subsequent measurement of the liability and financial statement disclosures 
sfas requires that the cost for asset retirement should be capitalized as part of the cost of the related long lived asset and subsequently allocated to expense using a systematic and rational method 
effective january   we adopted sfas  as required 
determination of the amounts to be recognized upon adoption is based upon numerous estimates and assumptions  including future retirement costs  future inflation rates and the credit adjusted risk free interest rate 
the majority of our assets  primarily related to our pipeline operations segment  have obligations to perform removal and or remediation activities when the asset is retired 
however  the fair value of the asset retirement obligations cannot be reasonably estimated  as the settlement dates are indeterminate 
we will record such asset retirement obligations in the period in which we determine the settlement dates 
the cumulative effect of adopting this statement will not have a material impact on our financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
risk factors related to our business the level of our profitability is dependent upon an adequate supply of crude oil from fields located offshore and onshore california 
production from these offshore fields has experienced substantial production declines since a significant portion of our gross margin is derived from pipeline transportation margins associated with the santa ynez and point arguello fields located offshore california 
we expect that there will continue to be natural production declines from each of these fields as the underlying reservoirs are depleted 
a  barrel per day decline in volumes shipped from these fields would result in a decrease in annual pipeline tariff revenues of approximately million 
in addition  any production disruption from these fields due to production problems  transportation problems or other reasons would have a material adverse effect on our business 
potential future acquisitions and expansions  if any  may affect our business by substantially increasing the level of our indebtedness and contingent liabilities and increasing our risks of being unable to effectively integrate these new operations 
from time to time  we evaluate and acquire assets and businesses that we believe complement our existing assets and businesses 
the shell acquisition represents a significant acquisition for us and  as a result  we may encounter difficulties integrating this acquisition with our existing business and our other recent acquisitions and successfully managing the rapid growth we expect to experience from these acquisitions 
acquisitions may require substantial capital or the incurrence of substantial indebtedness 
if we consummate any future acquisitions  our capitalization and results of operations may change significantly  and you will not have the opportunity to evaluate the economic  financial and other relevant information that we will consider in determining the application of these funds and other resources 
our crude oil marketing business requires extensive credit risk management that may not be adequate to protect against customer nonpayment 
as a result of business failures  revelations of material misrepresentations and related financial restatements by several large  well known companies in various industries over the past year  there have been significant disruptions and extreme volatility in the financial markets and credit markets 
because of the credit intensive nature of the energy industry and troubling disclosures by several large  diversified energy companies  the energy industry has been especially impacted by these developments  with the rating agencies downgrading a number of large  energy related companies 
accordingly  in this environment we are exposed to an increased level of direct and indirect counter party credit and performance risk 
there can be no assurance that we have adequately assessed the credit worthiness of our existing or future counter parties or that there will not be an unanticipated deterioration in their credit worthiness  which could have an adverse impact on us 
the profitability of our pipeline operations depends on the volume of crude oil shipped by third parties 
third party shippers generally do not have long term contractual commitments to ship crude oil on our pipelines 
a decision by a shipper to substantially reduce or cease to ship volumes of crude oil on our pipelines could cause a significant decline in our revenues 
for example  an average  barrel per day variance in the basin pipeline system  the primary asset we acquired from shell  equivalent to an approximate volume variance on that pipeline system  would result in an approximate million change in annualized gross margin 
in  we suffered a large loss from unauthorized crude oil trading by a former employee 
a loss of this kind could occur again in the future in spite of our best efforts to prevent it 
generally  it is our policy that as we purchase crude oil  we establish a margin by selling crude oil for physical delivery to third party users  such as independent refiners or major oil companies  or by entering into a future delivery obligation under futures contracts on the nymex and over the counter 
through these transactions  we seek to maintain a position that is substantially balanced between purchases  on the one hand  and sales or future delivery obligations  on the other hand 
our policy is not to acquire and hold crude oil  futures contracts or derivative products for the purpose of speculating on price changes 
we discovered in november that this policy was violated by one of our former employees  which resulted in aggregate losses of approximately million  including estimated costs and legal expenses 
we have taken steps within our organization to enhance our processes and procedures to prevent future unauthorized trading 
we cannot assure you  however  that these steps will detect and prevent all violations of our trading policies and procedures  particularly if deception or other intentional misconduct is involved 
the success of our business strategy to increase and optimize throughput on our pipeline and gathering assets is dependent upon our securing additional supplies of crude oil 
our operating results are dependent upon securing additional supplies of crude oil from increased production by oil companies and aggressive lease gathering efforts 
the ability of producers to increase production is dependent on the prevailing market price of oil  the exploration and production budgets of the major and independent oil companies  the depletion rate of existing reservoirs  the success of new wells drilled  environmental concerns  regulatory initiatives and other matters beyond our control 
there can be no assurance that production of crude oil will rise to sufficient levels to cause an increase in the throughput on our pipeline and gathering assets 
our operations are dependent upon demand for crude oil by refiners in the midwest and on the gulf coast 
any decrease in this demand could adversely affect our business 
demand also depends on the ability and willingness of shippers having access to our transportation assets to satisfy their demand by deliveries through those assets  and any decrease in this demand could adversely affect our business 
demand for crude oil is dependent upon the impact of future economic conditions  fuel conservation measures  alternative fuel requirements  governmental regulation or technological advances in fuel economy and energy generation devices  all of which could reduce demand 
we face intense competition in our terminalling and storage activities and gathering and marketing activities 
our competitors include other crude oil pipelines  the major integrated oil companies  their marketing affiliates  and independent gatherers  brokers and marketers of widely varying sizes  financial resources and experience 
some of these competitors have capital resources many times greater than ours and control greater supplies of crude oil 
the profitability of our gathering and marketing activities depends primarily on the volumes of crude oil we purchase and gather 
to maintain the volumes of crude oil we purchase  we must continue to contract for new supplies of crude oil to offset volumes lost because of natural declines in crude oil production from depleting wells or volumes lost to competitors 
replacement of lost volumes of crude oil is particularly difficult in an environment where production is low and competition to gather available production is intense 
generally  because producers experience inconveniences in switching crude oil purchasers  such as delays in receipt of proceeds while awaiting the preparation of new division orders  producers typically do not change purchasers on the basis of minor variations in price 
thus  we may experience difficulty acquiring crude oil at the wellhead in areas where there are existing relationships between producers and other gatherers and purchasers of crude oil 
we estimate that a  barrel per day decrease in barrels gathered by us would have an approximate  per year negative impact on gross margin 
this impact is based on a reasonable margin throughout various market conditions 
actual margins vary based on the location of the crude oil  the strength or weakness of the market and the grade or quality of crude oil 
we are exposed to the credit risk of our customers in the ordinary course of our gathering and marketing activities 
in those cases where we provide division order services for crude oil purchased at the wellhead  we may be responsible for distribution of proceeds to all parties 
in other cases  we pay all of or a portion of the production proceeds to an operator who distributes these proceeds to the various interest owners 
these arrangements expose us to operator credit risk  and there can be no assurance that we will not experience losses in dealings with other parties 
our operations are subject to federal and state environmental and safety laws and regulations relating to environmental protection and operational safety 
our pipeline  gathering  storage and terminalling facilities operations are subject to the risk of incurring substantial environmental and safety related costs and liabilities 
these costs and liabilities could arise under increasingly strict environmental and safety laws  including regulations and enforcement policies  or claims for damages to property or persons resulting from our operations 
if we were not able to recover such resulting costs through insurance or increased tariffs and revenues  our cash flows and results of operations could be materially impacted 
the transportation and storage of crude oil results in a risk that crude oil and other hydrocarbons may be suddenly or gradually released into the environment  potentially causing substantial expenditures for a response action  significant government penalties  liability to government agencies for natural resources damages  liability to private parties for personal injury or property damages  and significant business interruption 
our canadian pipeline assets are subject to federal and provincial regulation 
our canadian pipeline assets are subject to regulation by the national energy board and by provincial agencies 
with respect to a pipeline over which it has jurisdiction  each of these agencies has the power to determine the rates we are allowed to charge for transportation on such pipeline 
the extent to which regulatory agencies can override existing transportation contracts has not been fully decided 
our pipeline systems are dependent upon their interconnections with other crude oil pipelines to reach end markets 
reduced throughput on these interconnecting pipelines as a result of testing  line repair  reduced operating pressures or other causes could result in reduced throughput on our pipeline systems that would adversely affect our profitability 
our tax treatment depends on our status as a partnership for federal income tax purposes  as well as our not being subject to entity level taxation by states 
if the irs treats us as a corporation or we become subject to entity level taxation for state tax purposes  it would substantially reduce distributions to our unitholders and our ability to make payments on our debt securities 
the after tax economic benefit of an investment in the common units depends largely on our being treated as a partnership for federal income tax purposes 
if we were classified as a corporation for federal income tax purposes  we would pay federal income tax on our income at the corporate rate 
some or all of the distributions made to unitholders would be treated as dividend income  and no income  gains  losses or deductions would flow through to unitholders 
treatment of us as a corporation would cause a material reduction in the anticipated cash flow and after tax return to the unitholders  likely causing a substantial reduction in the value of the common units 
moreover  treatment of us as a corporation would materially and adversely affect our ability to make payments on our debt securities 
in addition  because of widespread state budget deficits  several states are evaluating ways to subject partnerships to entity level taxation through the imposition of state income  franchise or other forms of taxation 
if any state were to impose a tax upon us as an entity  the cash available for distribution to you would be reduced 
the partnership agreement provides that  if a law is enacted or existing law is modified or interpreted in a manner that subjects us to taxation as a corporation or otherwise subjects us to entity level taxation for federal  state or local income tax purposes  then the minimum quarterly distribution and the target distribution levels will be decreased to reflect that impact on us 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk s we are exposed to various market risks  including volatility in i crude oil and lpg commodity prices  ii interest rates and iii currency exchange rates 
we utilize various derivative instruments to manage such exposure 
our risk management policies and procedures are designed to monitor interest rates  currency exchange rates  nymex and over the counter positions  and physical volumes  grades  locations and delivery schedules to ensure our hedging activities address our market risks 
we have a risk management function that has direct responsibility and authority for our risk policies and our trading controls and procedures and certain aspects of corporate risk management 
to hedge the risks discussed above we engage in price risk management activities that we categorize by the risks we are hedging 
the following discussion addresses each category of risk 
commodity price risk we hedge our exposure to price fluctuations with respect to crude oil and lpg in storage  and expected purchases  sales and transportation of these commodities 
the derivative instruments utilized consist primarily of futures and option contracts traded on the new york mercantile exchange and over the counter transactions  including crude oil swap and option contracts entered into with financial institutions and other energy companies see note to our consolidated financial statements for a discussion of the mitigation of credit risk 
our policy is to purchase only crude oil for which we have a market  and to structure our sales contracts so that crude oil price fluctuations do not materially affect the gross margin we receive 
except for inventory transactions that generally do not exceed approximately  barrels  we do not enter into derivative transactions for speculative trading purposes 
similarly  while we seek to maintain a position that is substantially balanced within our lpg activities  as a result of production  transportation and delivery variances as well as logistical issues associated with inclement weather conditions  from time to time we experience net unbalanced positions for short periods of time 
in connection with managing these positions and maintaining a constant presence in the marketplace  both necessary for our core business  our policies provide that any net imbalance may not exceed  barrels 
these activities are monitored independently by our risk management function and must take place within predefined limits and authorizations 
see items and business and properties crude oil volatility  counter cyclical balance  risk management 
as a result of production and delivery variances associated with our lease purchase activities  from time to time we experience net unbalanced positions 
in connection with managing these positions and maintaining a constant presence in the marketplace  both necessary for our core business  we engage in this controlled trading program for up to  barrels 
this activity is monitored independently by our risk management function and must take place within predefined limits and authorizations 
in order to hedge margins involving our physical assets and manage risks associated with our crude oil purchase and sale obligations  we use derivative instruments  including regulated futures and options transactions  as well as over the counter instruments 
in analyzing our risk management activities  we draw a distinction between enterprise level risks and trading related risks 
enterprise level risks are those that underlie our core businesses and may be managed based on whether there is value in doing so 
conversely  trading related risks the risks involved in trading in the hopes of generating an increased return are not inherent in the core business  rather  those risks arise as a result of engaging in the trading activity 
we have a risk management committee that approves all new risk management strategies through a formal process 
with the partial exception of the limited  barrel program  our approved strategies are intended to mitigate enterprise level risks that are inherent in our core businesses of gathering and marketing and storage 
although the intent of our risk management strategies is to hedge our margin  not all of our derivatives qualify for hedge accounting 
in such instances  changes in the fair values of these derivatives will receive mark to market treatment in current earnings  and result in greater potential for earnings volatility than in the past 
this accounting treatment is discussed further under note summary of significant accounting policies in the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
all of our open commodity price risk derivatives at december  were categorized as non trading 
the fair value of these instruments and the change in fair value that would be expected from a percent price decrease are shown in the table below in millions fair value effect of price decrease crude oil futures contracts swaps and options contracts lpg futures contracts swaps and options contracts the fair values of the futures contracts are based on quoted market prices obtained from the nymex 
the fair value of the swaps and option contracts are estimated based on quoted prices from various sources such as independent reporting services  industry publications and brokers 
these quotes are compared to the contract price of the swap  which approximates the gain or loss that would have been realized if the contracts had been closed out at year end 
for positions where independent quotations are not available  an estimate is provided  or the prevailing market price at which the positions could be liquidated is used 
the assumptions in these estimates as well as the source is maintained by the independent risk control function 
all hedge positions offset physical positions exposed to the cash market  none of these offsetting physical positions are included in the above table 
price risk sensitivities were calculated by assuming an across the board percent decrease in price regardless of term or historical relationships between the contractual price of the instruments and the underlying commodity price 
in the event of an actual percent change in prompt month crude prices  the fair value of our derivative portfolio would typically change less than that shown in the table due to lower volatility in out month prices 
interest rate risk we utilize both fixed and variable rate debt  and are exposed to market risk due to the floating interest rates on our credit facilities and our term loans 
therefore  we utilize interest rate swaps and collars to hedge interest obligations on specific debt issuances  including anticipated debt issuances 
the table below presents principal payments and the related weighted average interest rates by expected maturity dates for variable rate debt outstanding at december  the senior notes issued during are fixed rate notes and thus are not subject to market risk 
our variable rate debt bears interest at libor or prime plus the applicable margin 
the average interest rates presented below are based upon rates in effect at december  the carrying values of the variable rate instruments in our credit facilities approximate fair value primarily because interest rates fluctuate with prevailing market rates dollars in millions 
expected year of maturity thereafter total liabilities short term debt and current maturities of long term debt variable rate average interest rate long term debt variable rate average interest rate interest rate swaps  collars and treasury locks are used to hedge underlying interest payment obligations 
we estimate the fair value of these instruments based on current termination values 
these instruments hedge interest rates on specific debt issuances and qualify for hedge accounting 
the interest rate differential is reflected as an adjustment to interest expense over the life of the instruments 
the table shown below summarizes the fair value of our interest rate swaps and treasury lock by the year of maturity in millions year of maturity total interest rate swaps treasury lock total the instruments outstanding at december   consist of interest rate swaps and a treasury lock with an aggregate notional principal amount of million 
the interest rate swaps are based on libor rates and provide for a libor rate of for a million notional principal amount expiring october  and a libor rate of for a million notional principal amount expiring march interest on the underlying debt being hedged is based on libor plus a margin 
during  we entered into a treasury lock in anticipation of the issuance of our senior notes due october and potential subsequent add on thereto 
a treasury lock is a financial derivative instrument that enables the company to lock in the us treasury note rate 
the treasury lock has a notional principal amount of million and an effective interest rate of and matures in january  in january   the treasury lock maturity was extended to march  with an effective interest rate of 
currency exchange risk our cash flow stream relating to our canadian operations is based on the us dollar equivalent of such amounts measured in canadian dollars 
assets and liabilities of our canadian subsidiaries are translated to us dollars using the applicable exchange rate as of the end of a reporting period 
revenues  expenses and cash flow are translated using the average exchange rate during the reporting period 
since substantially all of our canadian business is conducted in canadian dollars  we use certain financial instruments to minimize the risks of changes in the exchange rate 
these instruments include forward exchange contracts  forward extra option contracts and cross currency swaps 
additionally  at december   million million canadian based on a canadian us dollar exchange rate of of our long term debt was denominated in canadian dollars 
all of the financial instruments utilized are placed with large creditworthy financial institutions 
at december   we had forward exchange contracts and forward extra option contracts that allow us to exchange million canadian for at least million us quarterly during based on a us dollar exchange rate of 
at december   we also had cross currency swap contracts for an aggregate notional principal amount of million effectively converting this amount of our senior secured term loan of the total from us dollars to million of canadian dollar debt based on a canadian us dollar exchange rate of 
the terms of this contract mirror the term loan  matching the amortization schedule and final maturity in may we estimate the fair value of these instruments based on current termination values
