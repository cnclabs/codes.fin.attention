we are marketing periostat and other pharmaceutical products to the dental and dermatology communities through our own professional pharmaceutical sales force of approximately sales representatives and managers 
pursuant to an exclusive license and marketing agreement with atrix laboratories  inc  we began  in october  to actively market atrix s proprietary dental products  atridox r and atrisorb freeflow r  and  in february  atrisorb d r  to the united states dental market

critical accounting policies and estimates management s discussion and analysis of its financial position and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make judgments and estimates that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
management believes the critical accounting policies and areas that require the most significant judgments and estimates to be used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements pertain to revenue recognition 
we recognize product sales revenue upon shipment  net of estimated returns  provided that collection is determined to be probable and no significant obligations remain 
sales revenue from our customers is subject to agreements allowing limited rights of return  rebates and price protection 
accordingly  we reduce revenue recognized for estimated future returns  rebates and price protection at the time the related revenue is recorded 
the estimates for returns are adjusted periodically based upon historical rates of returns  inventory levels in the distribution channel and other related factors 
while management believes it can make reliable estimates for these matters  unsold products in these distribution channels may be exposed to expiration 
accordingly  it is possible that these estimates will change in the future or that the actual amounts could vary materially from our estimates and that the amounts of such changes could impact our results of operations  financial condition and our business 
our contract revenues are fee based arrangements where revenue is earned as prescriptions are written 
accordingly  since we never take title to the product being promoted  no significant obligations exist beyond the point that revenue is recognized 
since our inception  a portion of our revenue has been generated from license and distribution agreements for our products 
we recognize nonrefundable signing or license fees that are not dependent on future performance under these agreements as revenue when received and over the term of the arrangement if we have continuing performance obligations 
any amounts deferred are amortized to revenue over the expected performance period of each underlying agreement 
the expected performance period is based on management s best estimate and is subject to change based on current market conditions 
deferred revenue represents the portion of up front license payments received that has not been earned 
milestone revenue from licensing arrangements is recognized upon completion of the milestone event or requirement if it represents the achievement of a significant step in the research  development or regulatory process

on february   we entered into an equity line arrangement under the terms of a common stock purchase agreement with kingsbridge capital limited 
under the terms of the agreement  as amended  we committed to draw down on this equity line  an amount aggregating at least million in registered shares of common stock prior to october   of which we had drawn down an aggregate of million as of such date 
the equity line provided for the sale of up to million in registered shares of our common stock to kingsbridge

additionally  in connection with the consummation of the equity line and pursuant to the terms of a warrant agreement executed by us  we issued kingsbridge a warrant to purchase  shares of our common stock at an exercise price of per share 
the conversion price of our series d preferred stock was not reduced as a result of such issuance 
such warrant became exercisable as of august   and will expire on august  we have registered the shares of our common stock which may be issued by us upon any exercise of the warrant by kingsbridge under a shelf registration statement on form s at december   we had cash and cash equivalents of approximately million  an increase of million from the million balance at december  in accordance with investment guidelines approved by our board of directors  cash balances in excess of those required to fund operations have been invested in short term united states treasury securities and commercial paper with a credit rating no lower than a p our working capital at december  was million  an increase of  from million at december  during we generated million in cash from our operating activities principally from net income of  and improvements in our accounts receivable collections and larger accruals

prior to the third quarter of  we historically have had negative cash flows from operations and have used the net proceeds of public and private placements of our equity to fund operations 
we currently believe that projected increases in sales of our united states marketed products in combination with contract and license revenues  working capital at december  and available cash inflows from our revolving credit facility with silicon valley bank will allow us to fund our operations  capital expenditures and preferred stock dividend requirements into at this time  however  we cannot accurately predict the effect of certain developments on future product sales such as the degree of market acceptance of our products and technology  competition  the effectiveness of our sales and marketing efforts and the outcome of our research and development to demonstrate the utility of periostat in indications beyond those already included in the fda approved label 
contract and license revenues include receipts from co promotion agreements and performance milestones 
the continuation of any of these agreements is subject to the achievement of certain milestones and to periodic review by the parties involved 
we believe that other key factors that could affect our internal and external sources of cash are o revenues and margins from sales of periostat and other products and contracted services  o the success of our dermatology franchise  o the success of our pre clinical  clinical and development programs  o the receptivity of the capital markets to future financings  o our ability to enter into additional strategic collaborations and to maintain existing and new collaborations and the success of such collaborations  and o our ability to meet the covenant requirements under our revolving credit facility 
contractual obligations our major outstanding contractual obligations relate to cash dividends on our outstanding series d preferred stock  operating leases for our office space and other contractual commitments with our marketing partners for certain selling and promotional expenses associated with the products we are currently detailing 
additionally  we also expect to make certain inventory purchases from our contract manufacturer of periostat  guaranteed by our irrevocable letter of credit with silicon valley bank
