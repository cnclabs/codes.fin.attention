item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations marathon oil corporation marathon  formerly usx corporation  is engaged in worldwide exploration and production of crude oil and natural gas  domestic refining  marketing and transportation of crude oil and petroleum products primarily through its percent owned subsidiary  marathon ashland petroleum llc map  and other energy related businesses 
the management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes to consolidated financial statements 
prior to december   marathon had two outstanding classes of common stock usx marathon group common stock  which was intended to reflect the performance of marathon s energy business  and usx u 
s 
steel group common stock steel stock  which was intended to reflect the performance of marathon s steel business 
on december   usx corporation disposed of its steel business through a tax free distribution of the common stock of its wholly owned subsidiary united states steel corporation united states steel to holders of steel stock in exchange for all outstanding shares of steel stock on a one for one basis the separation and changed its name to marathon oil corporation 
certain sections of management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations include forward looking statements concerning trends or events potentially affecting the businesses of marathon 
these statements typically contain words such as anticipates  believes  estimates  expects  targets or similar words indicating that future outcomes are uncertain 
in accordance with safe harbor provisions of the private securities litigation reform act of  these statements are accompanied by cautionary language identifying important factors  though not necessarily all such factors  which could cause future outcomes to differ materially from those set forth in the forward looking statements 
for additional risk factors affecting the businesses of marathon  see disclosures regarding forward looking statements on page unless specifically noted  amounts for map do not reflect any reduction for the percent interest held by ashland inc ashland 
management s discussion and analysis of critical accounting estimates the preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at year end and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the year 
actual results could differ from the estimates and assumptions used 
certain accounting estimates are considered to be critical a if such estimates require assumptions about matters that are dependent on events remote in time that may or may not occur  are not capable of being readily calculated from generally accepted methodologies  or cannot be derived with some degree of precision from available data and b if different estimates that reasonably could have been used or changes in the estimate that are reasonably likely to occur would have had a material impact on the presentation of financial condition  changes in financial condition or results of operations 
estimated net recoverable quantities of oil and gas marathon uses the successful efforts method of accounting for its oil and gas producing activities 
the successful efforts method inherently relies upon the estimation of proved reserves  both developed and undeveloped 
the existence and the estimated amount of proved reserves affects  among other things  whether or not certain costs are capitalized or expensed  the amount and timing of costs depleted or amortized into income and the presentation of supplemental information on oil and gas producing activities 
both the expected future cash flows to be generated by oil and gas producing properties and the expected future taxable income available to realize the value of deferred tax assets  which are discussed further below  rely in part on estimates of net recoverable quantities of oil and gas 
marathon s estimation of net recoverable quantities of oil and gas is a highly technical process performed primarily by in house reservoir engineers and geoscience professionals 
the actual recoverability of hydrocarbons can vary from estimated amounts 
due to the inherent uncertainties and the limited nature of reservoir data  estimates of net recoverable quantities of oil and gas are subject to potentially substantial changes  either positively or negatively  as additional information becomes available and as contractual  economic and political conditions change 

table of contents expected future cash flows generated by certain oil and gas producing properties marathon must estimate the expected future cash flows to be generated by its oil and gas producing properties in order to evaluate the possible need to impair the carrying value of those properties 
an impairment of any one of marathon s three largest fields could have a material impact on the presentation of financial condition  changes in financial condition or results of operations 
those fields the alba field offshore equatorial guinea  the yates field in west texas and the brae area complex offshore the united kingdom comprise approximately percent of marathon s total proved oil and gas reserves 
the expected future cash flows from these properties require assumptions about matters such as the prevailing level of future oil and gas prices  estimated recoverable quantities of oil and gas  expected field performance and the political environment in the host country 
long lived assets held and used in operations must be impaired when the carrying value is not recoverable and exceeds the fair value 
recoverability of the carrying value is determined by comparison with the undiscounted expected future cash flows to be generated by those assets 
as of december   no impairment in the value of the alba field or the brae area complex was indicated 
marathon s interest in the yates field is held through its investment in mkm partners lp  which is accounted for under the equity method 
equity method investments must be impaired when a loss in value occurs that is other than a temporary decline 
as of december   no impairment in the value of mkm partners lp was indicated 
expected future taxable income marathon must estimate its expected future taxable income in order to assess the realizability of its deferred income tax assets 
as of december   marathon reported net deferred tax assets of billion  which represented gross assets of billion net of valuation allowances of million 
numerous assumptions are inherent in the estimation of future taxable income  including assumptions about matters that are dependent on future events  such as future operating conditions particularly as related to prevailing oil and gas prices and future financial conditions 
the estimates and assumptions used in determining future taxable income are consistent with those used in marathon s internal budgets  forecasts and strategic plans 
in determining its overall estimated future taxable income for purposes of assessing the need for additional valuation allowances  marathon considers proved and risk adjusted probable and possible reserves related to its existing producing properties  as well as estimated quantities of oil and gas related to undeveloped discoveries if  in the judgment of marathon management  it is likely that development plans will be approved in the foreseeable future 
in assessing the propriety of releasing an existing valuation allowance  marathon considers the preponderance of evidence concerning the realization of the deferred tax asset 
additionally  marathon must consider any prudent and feasible tax planning strategies that might minimize the amount of deferred tax liabilities recognized or the amount of any valuation allowance recognized against deferred tax assets  if management has the ability to implement these strategies and the expectation of implementing these strategies if the forecasted conditions actually occurred 
the principal tax planning strategy available to marathon relates to the permanent reinvestment of the earnings of foreign subsidiaries 
assumptions related to the permanent reinvestment of the earnings of foreign subsidiaries are reconsidered annually to give effect to changes in marathon s portfolio of producing properties and in its tax profile 
marathon s deferred tax assets include million relating to norwegian net operating loss carryforwards nols 
marathon has established a valuation allowance of million against these nols 
currently marathon generates income from the heimdal and vale fields in the norwegian north sea 
marathon acquired additional interests in norway in and these interests currently have no proved reserves and generate no income  although some interests hold undeveloped discoveries 
to the extent that these newly acquired interests demonstrate the capability to generate future taxable income  marathon may be able to release some or all of its million valuation allowance in future periods 
net realizable value of receivables from united states steel as described further in management s discussion and analysis of financial condition  cash flows and liquidity obligations associated with the separation of united states steel on page  marathon remains obligated primarily or contingently for certain debt and other financial arrangements for which united states steel has assumed responsibility for repayment under the terms of the separation 
as of december   
table of contents marathon has reported receivables from united states steel of million  representing the amount of principal and accrued interest on marathon debt for which united states steel has assumed responsibility for repayment 
marathon must assess the realizability of these receivables  based on its expectations of united states steel s ability to satisfy its obligations 
in order to make this assessment  marathon must rely on public information about united states steel 
as of december   marathon has judged the entire receivable to be realizable 
marathon may continue to be exposed to the risk of nonpayment by united states steel on a significant portion of this receivable until december  of the million  million  or percent  relates to industrial revenue bonds that are due in or later 
the financial matters agreement between marathon and united states steel provides that  on or before the tenth anniversary of the separation  which is december   united states steel will provide for marathon s discharge from any remaining liability under any of the assumed industrial revenue bonds 
as of december   marathon s cash adjusted debt to capital ratio which includes debt for which united states steel has assumed responsibility for repayment was percent 
the assessment of marathon s liquidity and capital resources may be impacted by expectations concerning united states steel s ability to satisfy its obligations 
for instance  if the debt for which united states steel has assumed responsibility for repayment were excluded from the computation  marathon s cash adjusted debt to capital ratio as of december  would have been approximately percent 
on the other hand  if the receivable from united states steel had been written off as unrealizable  the cash adjusted debt to capital ratio as of december  would have been approximately percent 
if united states steel were not able to satisfy its obligations  other adjustments in addition to the write off of the receivable may be necessary 
net realizable value of inventories generally accepted accounting principles require that inventories be carried at lower of cost or market 
accordingly  when the cost basis of marathon s inventories of liquid hydrocarbons and refined petroleum products exceed market value  marathon establishes an inventory market valuation imv reserve to reduce the cost basis of its inventories to net realizable value 
adjustments to the imv reserve result in noncash charges or credits to income from operations 
when marathon oil company was acquired in march  prices of liquid hydrocarbons and refined petroleum products were at historically high levels 
in applying the purchase method of accounting  inventories of liquid hydrocarbons and refined petroleum products were revalued by reference to current prices at the time of acquisition 
this became the new lifo cost basis of the inventories 
when marathon acquired the crude oil and refined petroleum product inventories associated with ashland s rm t operations on january   marathon established a new lifo cost basis for those inventories 
the acquisition cost of these inventories lowered the overall average cost of the combined rm t inventories 
as a result  the price threshold at which an imv reserve will be recorded was also lowered 
since the prices of liquid hydrocarbons and refined petroleum products do not correlate perfectly  there is no absolute price threshold below which an imv adjustment will be recognized 
however  generally  marathon will establish an imv reserve when crude oil prices fall below per barrel 
as of december   no imv reserve had been recognized 
contingent liabilities marathon accrues contingent liabilities for income and other tax deficiencies  environmental remediation  product liability claims and litigation claims when such contingencies are probable and estimable 
these contingent obligations are assessed regularly by marathon s in house legal counsel 
in certain circumstances  outside legal counsel is utilized 
for additional information on contingent liabilities  see management s discussion and analysis of environmental matters  litigation and contingencies on page pensions and other postretirement benefit obligations accounting for these benefits involves assumptions related to the appropriate discount rate for measuring the present value of plan obligations  the expected rates of return on plan assets  the rate of future increases in 
table of contents compensation levels and health care cost projections 
marathon develops its demographics and utilizes the work of outside actuaries to assist in the measurement of these obligations 
effective december   marathon revised the actuarial assumptions related to its pension and other postretirement benefit plans 
the discount rate was lowered from percent to percent 
the expected rate of return on plan assets was reduced from percent to percent 
the annual rate of increase in per capita cost of covered health care benefits was increased from percent to percent 
based on the actual results for the various plans and the revisions to the underlying assumptions  marathon recognized an unfavorable additional minimum pension adjustment to other comprehensive income loss of million at december  marathon expects that pension and other postretirement plan expense in will increase approximately million from levels  of which approximately million relates to map 
map is required to fund a cash contribution of approximately million to its pension plan in the third quarter of as of december   the allocation of pension plan assets approximated percent in equity securities  percent in bonds and percent in other investments  which is consistent with the expectations underlying the rate of return assumptions 
the average rate of return on marathon s plan assets achieved by its investment advisor has historically exceeded the current expected rate of return

as of december   marathon had identified obligations totaling million that had been assumed by united states steel 
also  as of december   marathon had a million settlement receivable from united states steel arising from the allocation of net debt and other financings at the time of the separation  which was paid on february  during  increases resulting from the extension of certain operating lease obligations were partially offset by decreases in obligations assumed by united states steel resulting from scheduled payments 
under the financial matters agreement  united states steel has all of the existing contractual rights under the leases assumed from marathon  including all rights related to purchase options  prepayments or the grant or release of security interests 
however  united states steel has no right to increase amounts due under or lengthen the term of any of the assumed leases  other than extensions set forth in the terms of any of the assumed leases 
the table below provides aggregated information on the portion of marathon s obligations to make future payments under existing contracts that have been assumed by united states steel as of december  summary of contractual cash obligations assumed by united states steel dollars in millions total later years contractual obligations assumed by united states steel long term debt sale leaseback financing includes imputed interest operating lease obligations operating lease obligations under sublease total contractual obligations assumed by united states steel united states steel reported in its form q for the quarterly period ended september   that it has significant restrictive covenants related to its indebtedness including cross default and cross acceleration clauses on selected debt that could have an adverse effect on its financial position and liquidity 
however  united states steel management believes that its liquidity will be adequate to satisfy its obligations for the foreseeable future 
if there is a prolonged delay in the recovery of the manufacturing sector of the us economy  united states steel believes that it can maintain adequate liquidity through a combination of deferral of nonessential capital spending  sale of non strategic assets and other cash conservation measures 
on january   united states steel announced  in a press release reporting fourth quarter and full year results  that available sources of liquidity at the end of were billion 
in february  united states steel issued mandatory convertible preferred shares for net proceeds of approximately million 
united states steel has announced its interest in acquiring the assets of bankrupt national steel corporation 

table of contents management s discussion and analysis of environmental matters  litigation and contingencies marathon has incurred and will continue to incur substantial capital  operating and maintenance  and remediation expenditures as a result of environmental laws and regulations 
to the extent these expenditures  as with all costs  are not ultimately reflected in the prices of marathon s products and services  operating results will be adversely affected 
marathon believes that substantially all of its competitors are subject to similar environmental laws and regulations 
however  the specific impact on each competitor may vary depending on a number of factors  including the age and location of its operating facilities  marketing areas  production processes and whether or not it is engaged in the petrochemical business or the marine transportation of crude oil and refined products 
marathon s environmental expenditures for each of the last three years were a in millions capital compliance operating maintenance remediation b total a amounts are determined based on american petroleum institute survey guidelines and include percent of map 
b these amounts include spending charged against remediation reserves  where permissible  but exclude noncash provisions recorded for environmental remediation 
marathon s environmental capital expenditures accounted for nine percent of total capital expenditures in  seven percent in  and five percent in during through  compliance expenditures represented one percent of marathon s total operating costs 
remediation spending during this period was primarily related to retail marketing outlets that incur ongoing clean up costs for soil and groundwater contamination associated with underground storage tanks and piping 
marathon has been notified that it is a potentially responsible party prp at waste sites under the comprehensive environmental response  compensation and liability act cercla as of december  in addition  there are four sites where marathon has received information requests or other indications that marathon may be a prp under cercla but where sufficient information is not presently available to confirm the existence of liability 
at many of these sites  marathon is one of a number of parties involved and the total cost of remediation  as well as marathon s share thereof  is frequently dependent upon the outcome of investigations and remedial studies 
there are also additional sites  excluding retail marketing outlets  related to marathon where remediation is being sought under other environmental statutes  both federal and state  or where private parties are seeking remediation through discussions or litigation 
of these sites  were associated with properties conveyed to map by ashland for which ashland has retained liability for all costs associated with remediation 
marathon accrues for environmental remediation activities when the responsibility to remediate is probable and the amount of associated costs can be reasonably estimated 
as environmental remediation matters proceed toward ultimate resolution or as additional remediation obligations arise  charges in excess of those previously accrued may be required 
new or expanded environmental requirements  which could increase marathon s environmental costs  may arise in the future 
marathon intends to comply with all legal requirements regarding the environment  but since not all of them are fixed or presently determinable even under existing legislation and may be affected by future legislation  it probably is not possible to predict all of the ultimate costs of compliance  including remediation costs which may be incurred and penalties which may be imposed 
however  based on presently available information  and existing laws and regulations as currently implemented  marathon does not anticipate that environmental compliance expenditures including operating and maintenance and remediation will materially increase in 
table of contents marathon s environmental capital expenditures are expected to be approximately million in predictions beyond can only be broad based estimates  which have varied  and will continue to vary  due to the ongoing evolution of specific regulatory requirements  the possible imposition of more stringent requirements and the availability of new technologies  among other matters 
based upon currently identified projects  marathon anticipates that environmental capital expenditures will be approximately million in  however  actual expenditures may vary as the number and scope of environmental projects are revised as a result of improved technology or changes in regulatory requirements and could increase if additional projects are identified or additional requirements are imposed 
new tier ii gasoline rules  which were finalized by the epa in february  and the diesel fuel rules  which were finalized in january  require substantially reduced sulfur levels for gasoline and diesel 
the combined capital costs to achieve compliance with the gasoline and diesel regulations could amount to approximately million  which includes costs that could be incurred as part of other refinery upgrade projects  between and this is a forward looking statement 
some factors among others that could potentially affect gasoline and diesel fuel compliance costs include obtaining the necessary construction and environmental permits  operating and logistical considerations  further refinement of preliminary engineering studies and project scopes  and unforeseen hazards 
in march  map attended a meeting with the illinois epa concerning map s self reporting of possible emission exceedences and permitting issues related to some storage tanks at map s robinson  illinois facility 
in late april  map submitted to iepa a comprehensive settlement proposal that was rejected by iepa 
map has had subsequent discussions with iepa and the illinois attorney general s office and anticipates additional meetings and discussions in the coming months 
during map entered into a new source review consent decree and settlement of alleged clean air act caa and other violations with the epa covering all of map s refineries 
the settlement committed map to specific control technologies and implementation schedules for environmental expenditures and improvements to map s refineries over approximately an eight year period 
the total one time expenditures for these environmental projects is approximately million over the eight year period  with about million remaining over the next six years 
the impact of the settlement on on going operating expenses is expected to be immaterial 
in addition  map has nearly completed certain agreed upon supplemental environmental projects as part of this settlement of an enforcement action for alleged caa violations  at a cost of million 
map believes that this settlement will provide map with increased permitting and operating flexibility while achieving significant emission reductions 
map entered into a consent decree in july of with the state of ohio regarding air compliance matters at its canton refinery during both ashland s and map s term of ownership and operation 
the consent decree required  in payments which included a penalty of  several supplemental environmental projects and the funding of a community notification system 
the consent decree is being implemented 
map used mtbe as an octane enhancer and oxygenate in reformulated gasoline to comply with applicable laws for many years 
the maximum amount of mtbe in gasoline is percent by volume 
approximately percent of map s gasoline production contained mtbe 
map had three mtbe units at its refineries in detroit  robinson and catlettsburg with a combined book value of approximately million at december  because several states in map s marketing area have passed laws banning mtbe as a gasoline component in the future  map decided in the first quarter of to begin to phase out production of mtbe and to reduce the remaining estimated useful life of the mtbe units 
mtbe production was discontinued in october  by which time the mtbe units were fully depreciated 
marathon is the subject of  or a party to  a number of pending or threatened legal actions  contingencies and commitments involving a variety of matters  including laws and regulations relating to the environment 
see note to the consolidated financial statements on page f for a discussion of certain of these matters 
the ultimate resolution of these contingencies could  individually or in the aggregate  be material to marathon 
however  management believes that marathon will remain a viable and competitive enterprise even though it is possible that these contingencies could be resolved unfavorably to marathon 
other contingencies map has instituted a number of process and facility modifications at its catlettsburg refinery to correct the operating conditions that led to a product quality issue in map has been working with some regional gasoline jobbers and dealers since august to remedy certain product quality issues in gasoline produced at 
table of contents this refinery 
as a part of its response to the situation  map has inspected a large number of retail  terminal and transportation facilities  and has systematically cleaned facilities and repaired consumer vehicles that may have been impacted 
credit risk marathon is exposed to credit risk in the form of possible nonpayment by counterparties  a significant portion of which are concentrated in energy related industries 
to mitigate this risk  the creditworthiness of customers and other counterparties is subject to ongoing review 
when deemed appropriate  marathon requires prepayment  letters of credit  netting agreements or other security to reduce its exposure 
marathon has taken steps throughout to manage its exposures to those energy merchant firms whose creditworthiness has deteriorated 
where appropriate  marathon has either obtained security to support its continued sales or has ceased business activity with the affected entities 
marathon has significant exposures to united states steel arising from the separation 
those exposures are discussed in obligations associated with the separation of united states steel 

table of contents outlook exploration and production the outlook regarding marathon s upstream revenues and income is largely dependent upon future prices and volumes of liquid hydrocarbons and natural gas 
prices have historically been volatile and have frequently been affected by unpredictable changes in supply and demand resulting from fluctuations in worldwide economic activity and political developments in the world s major oil and gas producing and consuming areas 
any significant decline in prices could have a material adverse effect on marathon s results of operations 
a prolonged decline in such prices could also adversely affect the quantity of crude oil and natural gas reserves that can be economically produced and the amount of capital available for exploration and development 
marathon estimates its and production will average  to  barrels of oil equivalent per day boepd  excluding the effect of any acquisitions or dispositions 
this compares to production of slightly over  boepd 
major upstream activities  which are currently underway or under evaluation  include gulf of mexico  where marathon plans to participate in three or four deepwater exploration wells during  norway  where marathon has interests in nine licenses in the norwegian sector of the north sea and plans to drill three or four exploration wells during and participate in two development wells in the byggve skirne fields  alaska  where marathon had a natural gas discovery on the ninilchik unit on the kenai peninsula with additional drilling planned in  angola  where marathon participated in the drilling of the successful plutao exploration well on block  is currently participating in the testing of the gindungo well on block and plans to participate in three or four additional exploration wells in this area during  eastern canada  where marathon drilled the annapolis g gas discovery well and expects to drill one additional exploration well in the annapolis block during  equatorial guinea  where government approved expansion plans are underway to increase liquid and natural gas production and drill three or four exploration wells in  foinaven  in the atlantic margin offshore the uk  where marathon plans to drill three or four developmental wells  all of which are permitted  braemar  in the uk north sea  where a subsea development well will be tied back to the east brae platform  ireland  where the greensand subsea well will be drilled and tied back to the kinsale head facilities  and wyoming s powder river basin  where marathon plans to drill to coal bed natural gas wells in  all of which are permitted 
in equatorial guinea  marathon secured government approval of the alba field phase b liquefied petroleum gas lpg expansion project  complementing the phase a offshore and condensate expansion project 
upon completion of phase a fourth quarter and phase b fourth quarter  gross production is expected to increase from   net boepd to approximately   net boepd 
this new total volume will consist of   net bpd of condensate    net bpd of lpg and net mmcfd of natural gas 
the above discussion includes forward looking statements with respect to the timing and levels of marathon s worldwide liquid hydrocarbon and natural gas production  the exploration drilling program and additional resources 
some factors that could potentially affect worldwide liquid hydrocarbon and natural gas production and the exploration drilling program include acts of war or terrorist acts and the governmental or military response  pricing  supply and demand for petroleum products  amount of capital available for exploration and development  occurrence of acquisitions or dispositions of oil and gas properties  regulatory constraints  timing of commencing production from new wells  drilling rig availability and other geological  operating and economic considerations 
the forward looking information related to production is based on certain assumptions  including  among others  presently known physical data concerning size and character of reservoirs  economic recoverability  technology development  future drilling success  production experience  industry economic conditions  levels of cash flow from operations and operating conditions 
the foregoing factors among others could cause actual results to differ materially from those set forth in the forward looking statements 

table of contents refining  marketing and transportation marathon s rm t segment income is largely dependent upon the refining and wholesale marketing margin for refined products  the retail gross margin for gasoline and distillates  and the gross margin on retail merchandise sales 
the refining and wholesale marketing margin reflects the difference between the wholesale selling prices of refined products and the cost of raw materials refined  purchased product costs and manufacturing expenses 
refining and wholesale marketing margins have been historically volatile and vary with the level of economic activity in the various marketing areas  the regulatory climate  the seasonal pattern of certain product sales  crude oil costs  manufacturing costs  the available supply of crude oil and refined products  and logistical constraints 
the retail gross margin for gasoline and distillates reflects the difference between the retail selling prices of these products and their wholesale cost  including secondary transportation 
retail gasoline and distillate margins have also been historically volatile  but tend to be countercyclical to the refining and wholesale marketing margin 
factors affecting the retail gasoline and distillate margin include seasonal demand fluctuations  the available wholesale supply  the level of economic activity in the marketing areas and weather situations that impact driving conditions 
the gross margin on retail merchandise sales tends to be less volatile than the retail gasoline and distillate margin 
factors affecting the gross margin on retail merchandise sales include consumer demand for merchandise items and the level of economic activity in the marketing area 
at its catlettsburg  kentucky refinery  map has initiated a multi year million integrated investment program to upgrade product yield realizations and reduce fixed and variable manufacturing expenses 
this program involves the expansion  conversion and retirement of certain refinery processing units that  in addition to improving profitability  will reduce the refinery s total gasoline pool sulfur below ppm  thereby eliminating the need for additional low sulfur gasoline compliance investments at the refinery

the locations are in states  primarily in the midwest  southeast and the southwest regions of the country 
the above discussion includes forward looking statements with respect to the catlettsburg refinery  the cardinal products pipeline system and the disposition of ssa stores 
some factors that could potentially cause the actual results from the catlettsburg investment program to differ materially from current expectations include the price of petroleum products  levels of cash flows from operations  unforeseen hazards such as weather conditions  the completion of construction and regulatory approval constraints 
a factor that could impact the cardinal products pipeline is completion of construction 
some factors that could affect the ssa stores sale include inability or delay in obtaining necessary government and third party approvals  and satisfaction of customary closing conditions 
these factors among others could cause actual results to differ materially from those set forth in the forward looking statements

accounting for asset retirement obligations sfas no 

this statement requires that the fair value of an asset retirement obligation be recognized in the period in which it is incurred if a reasonable estimate of fair value can be made 
the present value of the estimated asset retirement costs is capitalized as part of the carrying amount of the long lived asset 
for marathon  asset retirement obligations primarily relate to the abandonment of oil and gas producing facilities 
under previous accounting standards  such obligations were recognized over the life of the producing assets on a units of production basis 
while certain assets such as refineries  crude oil and product pipelines and marketing assets have retirement obligations covered by sfas no 
 those obligations are not expected to be recognized since the fair value cannot be estimated due to the uncertainty of the settlement date of the obligation 

table of contents effective january   marathon will adopt sfas no 
 as required 
the cumulative effect on net income of adopting sfas no 
is expected to be a net favorable effect of approximately million 
at the time of adoption  total assets will increase approximately million  and total liabilities will increase approximately million 
the amounts recognized upon adoption are based upon numerous estimates and assumptions  including future retirement costs  future recoverable quantities of oil and gas  future inflation rates and the credit adjusted risk free interest rate 
previous accounting standards used the units of production method to match estimated future retirement costs with the revenues generated from the producing assets 
in contrast  sfas no 
requires depreciation of the capitalized asset retirement cost and accretion of the asset retirement obligation over time 
the depreciation will generally be determined on a units of production basis  while the accretion to be recognized will escalate over the life of the producing assets  typically as production declines

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk management opinion concerning derivative instruments management has authorized the use of futures  forwards  swaps and options to manage exposure to market fluctuations related to commodities  interest rates  and foreign currency 
marathon uses commodity based derivatives to manage price risk related to the purchase  production or sale of crude oil  natural gas  and refined products 
to a lesser extent  marathon is exposed to the risk of price fluctuations on natural gas liquids and on petroleum feedstocks used as raw materials 
the approach of marathon s e p segment to the use of commodity derivative instruments is selective and opportunistic 
when it is deemed to be advantageous  marathon may lock in market prices on portions of its future production 
marathon s rm t segment uses commodity derivative instruments to mitigate the price risk associated with crude oil and other feedstocks  to protect carrying values of inventories and to protect margins on fixed price sales of refined products 
marathon s oerb segment is exposed to market risk associated with the purchase and subsequent resale of natural gas 
marathon uses commodity derivative instruments to mitigate the price risk on purchased volumes and anticipated sales volumes 
as market conditions change  marathon evaluates its risk management program and could enter into strategies that assume market risk whereby cash settlement of commodity based derivatives will be based on market prices 
from time to time  marathon uses financial derivative instruments to manage interest rate and foreign currency exposures 
as marathon enters into derivatives  assessments are made as to the qualification of each transaction for hedge accounting 
management believes that use of derivative instruments along with risk assessment procedures and internal controls does not expose marathon to material risk 
however  the use of derivative instruments could materially affect marathon s results of operations in particular quarterly or annual periods 
management believes that use of these instruments will not have a material adverse effect on financial position or liquidity 
commodity price risk and related risks in the normal course of its business  marathon is exposed to market risk or price fluctuations related to the purchase  production or sale of crude oil  natural gas and refined products 
to a lesser extent  marathon is exposed to the risk of price fluctuations on natural gas liquids and petroleum feedstocks used as raw materials 
marathon s strategy has generally been to obtain competitive prices for its products and allow operating results to reflect market price movements dictated by supply and demand 
as part of achieving marathon s strategy  certain fixed priced physical contracts are hedged using derivative instruments that assume market risk 
marathon will use a variety of derivative instruments  including option combinations  as part of the overall risk management program to manage commodity price risk within its different businesses 

table of contents commodity price risk sensitivity analyses of the incremental effects on income from operations ifo of hypothetical percent and percent changes in commodity prices for open derivative commodity instruments as of december  and december   are provided in the following table a in millions incremental decrease in ifo assuming a hypothetical price change of a derivative commodity instruments b c crude oil d e e e e natural gas d e e e e refined products d e e f f a marathon remains at risk for possible changes in the market value of derivative instruments  however  such risk should be mitigated by price changes in the underlying hedged item 
effects of these offsets are not reflected in the sensitivity analyses 
amounts reflect hypothetical and changes in closing commodity prices for each open contract position at december  and marathon evaluates its portfolio of derivative commodity instruments on an ongoing basis and adds or revises strategies to reflect anticipated market conditions and changes in risk profiles 
marathon is also exposed to credit risk in the event of nonperformance by counterparties 
the creditworthiness of counterparties is subject to continuing review  including the use of master netting agreements to the extent practical 
changes to the portfolio subsequent to december   would cause future ifo effects to differ from those presented in the table 
b net open contracts for the combined e p and oerb segments varied throughout  from a low of  contracts at february to a high of  contracts at october  and averaged  for the year 
the number of net open contracts for the rm t segment varied throughout  from a low of contract at march to a high of  contracts at december  and averaged  for the year 
the derivative commodity instruments used and hedging positions taken will vary and  because of these variations in the composition of the portfolio over time  the number of open contracts by itself cannot be used to predict future income effects 
c the calculation of sensitivity amounts for basis swaps assumes that the physical and paper indices are perfectly correlated

of the mmcfd  mmcfd currently qualify for hedge accounting  with the non qualified gas volumes being marked to market and included in income 
additionally  marathon has also entered into zero cost collars on  bpd of its us and us crude oil for january through december  whereby marathon will receive up to an average per bbl but no less than an average per bbl 
all  bpd currently qualify for hedge accounting 
subsequent to december   marathon has entered into zero cost collars on an additional mmcfd of its us natural gas production for the last half of  whereby marathon will receive up to an average per mcf but no less than an average per mcf 
marathon has also placed derivatives on mmcfd at an average of per mcf for relating to the powder river basin area 
all mmcfd for the last half of and mmcfd for currently qualify for hedge accounting 
additionally  marathon has also used other derivative instruments to sell forward   bpd of its us and us crude oil for the last half of at an average of per bbl 
all  bpd currently qualify for hedge accounting 
as of december   marathon had hedged approximately percent and percent of its forecasted worldwide equity natural gas and liquid hydrocarbon production  respectively 
subsequent to december   marathon has hedged an additional percent and percent of its forecasted worldwide equity natural gas and liquid hydrocarbon production  respectively 
derivative gains included in the e p segment were million and million for and  respectively 
gains of million from discontinued cash flow hedges for are included in the aforementioned amounts 
these gains were reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive income loss as it is no longer probable that the original forecasted transactions will occur 
rm t segment marathon s rm t operations generally use derivative commodity instruments to mitigate the price risk of certain crude oil and other feedstocks  to protect carrying values of inventories and to protect margins on fixed price sales of refined products 
derivative losses included in rm t segment income were million for compared with gains of million for rm t s trading activity gains and losses were not significant for and 
table of contents oerb segment marathon has used derivative instruments to convert the fixed price of a long term gas sales contract to market prices 
the underlying physical contract is for a specified annual quantity of gas and matures in similarly  marathon will use derivative instruments to convert shorter term typically less than a year fixed price contracts to market prices in its ongoing purchase for resale activity  and to hedge purchased gas injected into storage for subsequent resale 
derivative losses included in oerb segment income were million and million for and  respectively 
other commodity risk marathon is subject to basis risk  caused by factors that affect the relationship between commodity futures prices reflected in derivative commodity instruments and the cash market price of the underlying commodity 
natural gas transaction prices are frequently based on industry reference prices that may vary from prices experienced in local markets 
for example  new york mercantile exchange nymex contracts for natural gas are priced at louisiana s henry hub  while the underlying quantities of natural gas may be produced and sold in the western united states at prices that do not move in strict correlation with nymex prices 
to the extent that commodity price changes in one region are not reflected in other regions  derivative commodity instruments may no longer provide the expected hedge  resulting in increased exposure to basis risk 
these regional price differences could yield favorable or unfavorable results 
otc transactions are being used to manage exposure to a portion of basis risk 
marathon is subject to liquidity risk  caused by timing delays in liquidating contract positions due to a potential inability to identify a counterparty willing to accept an offsetting position 
due to the large number of active participants  liquidity risk exposure is relatively low for exchange traded transactions 
interest rate risk marathon is subject to the effects of interest rate fluctuations affecting the fair value of certain financial instruments 
a sensitivity analysis of the projected incremental effect of a hypothetical percent decrease in interest rates is provided in the following table in millions december  december  financial instruments a fair value b incremental increase in fair value c fair value b incremental increase in fair value c financial assets investments and long term receivables interest rate swap agreements financial liabilities long term debt d e a fair values of cash and cash equivalents  receivables  notes payable  accounts payable and accrued interest approximate carrying value and are relatively insensitive to changes in interest rates due to the short term maturity of the instruments 
accordingly  these instruments are excluded from the table 
b see notes and to the consolidated financial statements for carrying value of instruments 
c for financial liabilities  this assumes a decrease in the weighted average yield to maturity of marathon s long term debt at december  and d includes amounts due within one year 
e fair value was based on market prices where available  or current borrowing rates for financings with similar terms and maturities 
at december  and  marathon s portfolio of long term debt was substantially comprised of fixed rate instruments 
therefore  the fair value of the portfolio is relatively sensitive to effects of interest rate fluctuations 
this sensitivity is illustrated by the million increase in the fair value of long term debt assuming a hypothetical percent decrease in interest rates 
however  marathon s sensitivity to interest rate declines and corresponding increases in the fair value of its debt portfolio would unfavorably affect marathon s results and cash flows only to the extent that marathon would elect to repurchase or otherwise retire all or a portion of its fixed rate debt portfolio at prices above carrying value 
marathon has initiated a program to manage its exposure to interest rate movements by utilizing financial derivative instruments 
the primary objective of this program is to reduce the company s overall cost of borrowing 
table of contents by managing the fixed and floating interest rate mix of the debt portfolio 
in  marathon entered into seven interest rate swap agreements  designated as fair value hedges  which effectively resulted in an exchange of existing obligations to pay fixed interest rates for obligations to pay floating rates 
the following table summarizes marathon s interest rate swap activity as of december  and march  as of december  floating rate to be paid fixed rate to be received notional amount millions swap maturity fair value millions six month libor six month libor cumulative as of march  floating rate to be paid fixed rate to be received notional amount millions swap maturity six month libor six month libor six month libor during  marathon entered into us treasury rate lock agreements to hedge pending issuances of new debt 
the us treasury rate lock agreements  which were designated and effective as cash flow hedges  were settled for a net of million concurrent with the issuance of the new debt 
the million  net of tax  unrecognized loss is being reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive income loss to net interest and other financial cost over the life of the new debt 
foreign currency exchange rate risk marathon is subject to the risk of price fluctuations related to anticipated revenues and operating costs  firm commitments for capital expenditures and existing assets or liabilities denominated in currencies other than the us dollar 
marathon has used on occasion forward currency contracts or other derivative instruments to manage this risk 
at december  and  marathon had no open forward currency contracts in place 
safe harbor marathon s quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk include forward looking statements with respect to management s opinion about risks associated with the use of derivative instruments 
these statements are based on certain assumptions with respect to market prices and industry supply of and demand for crude oil  natural gas  refined products and other feedstocks 
to the extent that these assumptions prove to be inaccurate  future outcomes with respect to marathon s hedging programs may differ materially from those discussed in the forward looking statements
