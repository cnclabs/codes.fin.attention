the company bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
the company records estimated reductions to revenue for incentive offerings including promotions and other volume based incentives as well as estimates for returns based upon recent history 
if market conditions were to decline or inventory was in danger of expiring or becoming obsolete  the company may take actions to increase customer incentive offerings possibly resulting in an incremental reduction of revenue at the time the incentive is offered 
additionally  if demand for the company s product were to drop  the company s distributors may request return of product for credit causing a need to re evaluate and possibly increase the reserve for product returns 
the company maintains allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of its customers to make required payments 
if the financial condition of the company s customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
the company writes down its inventory for estimated obsolescence or unmarketable inventory equal to the difference between the cost of inventory and the estimated market value based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions
