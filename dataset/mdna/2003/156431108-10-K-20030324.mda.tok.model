overview the company is a producer of primary aluminum  and the company s net sales are derived from the sale of primary aluminum 
effective april   the company increased its ownership of the mt 
holly facility to by acquiring an additional interest for a cash purchase price of million 
the mt 
holly facility has an annual production capacity of million pounds of primary aluminum  and century s interest represents million pounds of that capacity 
on april   the company acquired from southwire  a privately held wire and cable manufacturing company  all of the outstanding stock of metalsco  formerly a wholly owned subsidiary of southwire 
metalsco owns nsa  which owns and operates the hawesville facility 
the hawesville facility has the capacity to produce million pounds of primary aluminum per year 
the company also acquired from southwire  certain land  facilities and rights related to nsa s aluminum reduction operations which were not held by nsa 
the cash purchase price for the hawesville acquisition was million 
the company also assumed industrial revenue bonds related to the hawesville facility in the principal amount of million and century may be required to make additional post closing payments to southwire of up to million 
in connection with the acquisition  glencore effectively purchased from century a interest in the hawesville facility for million and assumed responsibility for payment of of the principal amount of the industrial revenue bonds and payment of a pro rata portion of any post closing payments made to southwire

holly facility for the years through at prices based on the then current market 
the price will remain fixed for the years and in consideration for the above  the company will receive million 
because the contract was terminated  delivery on the contract under its original fixed price terms is no longer probable 
accordingly  the contract will no longer qualify as normal under sfas  as amended  and the entire contract including and will be marked to market in the first quarter of with subsequent gains and losses reported in the statement of operations 
the aluminum industry is cyclical and the market price of primary aluminum which trades as a commodity is determined by worldwide supply and demand 
the company s results of operations depend to a large degree on the market price of primary aluminum 
any adverse changes in the conditions that affect the market price of primary aluminum could have a material adverse effect on the company s results of operations 
the principal elements comprising the company s cost of goods sold are raw materials  power and labor 
the company was party to a long term supply agreement to purchase alumina through the end of beginning january   that agreement was replaced by new long term supply agreements with glencore that extends through these new agreements provide that glencore will supply a fixed quantity of alumina at prices determined by a market based formula

the new agreement is effective august   when the company s current power contract with ohio power expires 
the new contract will provide power for the ravenswood facility at competitive rates under a gs schedule approved by the public utilities commission of ohio 
the gs schedule is due to expire on december  the mt 
holly facility purchases all of its power from the south carolina public service authority at rates fixed by published schedules 
one of those schedules contains a fuel adjustment clause which permits the authority to pass through certain charges or credits to the extent its actual costs vary from those costs used in the formula set in the fuel adjustment clause 
the mt 
holly power contract expires december  the hawesville facility currently purchases all of its power from kenergy corporation at fixed prices

on march    the labor agreement was extended through may  in connection with the hawesville acquisition  the company negotiated a collective bargaining agreement with the uswa which covers all of the represented hourly employees at the hawesville facility 
under this agreement  the company established the terms of employment for uswa employees and settled all claims relating to a work stoppage which occurred during southwire s ownership of the facility 
the agreement was ratified by the uswa local on september   became effective upon closing of the hawesville acquisition and has a five year term 
the agreement provides for fixed increases in hourly wages and certain benefits adjustments in its first  third and fifth years

the employees at the mt 
holly facility are employed by alcoa  and are not unionized 
application of critical accounting policies the company s significant accounting policies are discussed in note of the consolidated financial statements 
the preparation of the financial statements requires that management make subjective estimates  assumptions and judgments in applying these accounting policies 
those judgments are normally based on knowledge and experience about past and current events and on assumptions about future events 
critical accounting estimates require management to make assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain at the time of the estimate and a change in these estimates may have a material impact on the presentation of the company s financial position or results of operations 
significant judgments and estimates made by the company include expenses and liabilities related to pensions and other postemployment benefits 
pension and other postemployment benefit liabilities the company sponsors various pension plans and also participates in a union sponsored multi employer pension plan for the employees at the hawesville facility 
the liabilities and annual income or expense of the company s pension and other postemployment benefit plans are determined using methodologies that involve several actuarial assumptions  the most significant of which are the discount rate and the long term rate of asset return 
in developing its expected long term rate of return assumption for pension fund assets  the company evaluated input from its actuaries  including their review of asset class return expectations as well as long term inflation assumptions 
projected returns are based on historical returns of broad equity and bond indices 
the company also considered its historical year compound returns 
century anticipates that  as the economy recovers  the company s investment managers will continue to generate long term rates of return of 
our expected long term rate of return is based on an assumed asset allocation of equity funds and fixed income funds 
the discount rate that the company utilizes for determining future pension and post employment obligations is based on a review of long term bonds that receive one of the two highest ratings given by a recognized rating agency 
the discount rate determined on this basis has decreased to at december  from at december  lowering the expected long term rate of return by from to would have increased the company s pension expense for the year ended december  by approximately million 
lowering the discount rate assumptions by would have increased the company s pension expense for the year ended december  by approximately million 
the company provides postemployment benefit plans that provide health care and life insurance benefits for substantially all retired employees 
sfas no 
requires the company to accrue the estimated cost of providing postretirement benefits during the working careers of those employees who could become eligible for such benefits when they retire 
the company funds these benefits as the retirees submit claims 
measurement of the company s postretirement benefit obligations requires the use of several assumptions about factors that will affect the amount and timing of future benefit payments 
the assumed health care cost trend rates are the most critical assumptions for measurement of the postretirement benefits obligation 
changes in the health care cost trend rates have a significant effect on the amounts reported for the health care benefit obligations 
the company assumes medical inflation is initially  declining to over six years and thereafter 
a one percentage point change in the assumed health care cost trend rates would have the following effects in one percentage one percentage point increase point decrease in thousands effect on total of service and interest cost components   effect on accumulated postretirement benefit obligation   results of operations the following table sets forth  for the years indicated  the percentage relationship to net sales of certain items included in the company s statements of operations
