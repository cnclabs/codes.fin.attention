table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview during  the metals service center industry continued to experience low levels of customer demand  primarily related to the economic recession in the united states 
demand for our products began to slow in the second half of  but only in certain geographic areas 
in early  we felt a sudden slowdown in demand for the semiconductor and related markets  and demand continued to decline throughout for all of our product end markets except aerospace 
aerospace demand and pricing were strong in  but fell off significantly after september th 
the low demand levels in all areas continued throughout metals pricing in remained at the historically low levels reached in  with the exception of carbon steel flat rolled products 
although end market demand was low  domestic carbon steel flat rolled costs increased significantly in the second half of due to supply constraints resulting from tariffs on imported material and domestic capacity shutdowns 
there were significant competitive pressures in late that did not allow us to fully pass through these price increases and caused our gross margins to decline 
our performance was significantly impacted by these factors  however  we are proud of our profitable returns and our ability to manage our working capital and to generate cash flow to expand and strengthen our business and reduce debt during this challenging environment 
we also completed three acquisitions during and began to consolidate the financial results of american steel  llc  our joint venture company  due to an increase in our ownership 
we believe that we are positioned to take full advantage of improved economic conditions  while at the same time we are poised to continue to operate efficiently in the less favorable economies such as that experienced during because of our focus on cost controls  inventory turnover  and product and geographic diversification 
we do not anticipate any significant improvements in either demand or pricing for our products in and we expect the competitive factors experienced in late to continue to pressure our gross margins into at least the early part of recent developments we completed three acquisitions and had a change in the ownership structure of a joint venture company in through these transactions  we entered into new geographic markets in idaho and montana  strengthened our presence in the midwest and pacific northwest markets of the united states and expanded our product offerings 
the acquisitions made in did not result in new segments 
on september   through a newly formed company  we purchased certain assets of a metals usa  inc business  metals usa specialty metals northwest  inc  for approximately million  after final approval of the us bankruptcy court  through the metals usa bankruptcy procedures 
this business is now operating under its original name  pacific metal company  with locations in portland  eugene and medford  oregon  kent seattle and spokane  washington  billings  montana  and boise  idaho 
pacific metal company processes and distributes mainly aluminum and coated carbon steel products and had net sales of approximately million for the period september  through december  on april   we purchased substantially all of the net assets and business of central plains steel co 
through a newly formed subsidiary that is now operating under the same name 
central plains steel co  a full line carbon steel service center with facilities in kansas city and wichita  kansas  had net sales of approximately million for the nine months ended december  also on april   we acquired all of the outstanding stock of olympic metals  inc  a metals service center in denver  colorado 
olympic metals  inc specializes in the processing and distribution of aluminum  red metals and stainless steel products and had net sales of approximately million for the nine months ended december  we merged olympic metals  inc into reliance effective december  
table of contents effective may   we obtained one additional membership unit of american steel  llc american steel giving us a ownership interest 
the operating agreement was amended to eliminate all super majority and unanimous voting rights  among other changes 
due to this change in ownership structure  we began consolidating american steel s financial results as of may  there was no cost involved in this transaction  which was completed to facilitate the renewal of december  american steel had net sales of approximately million for the eight months ended december  for discussion purposes  all references to the company s acquisitions include the consolidation of american steel as of may  results of operations the following table sets forth certain income statement data for each of the three years in the period ended december  dollars are shown in thousands and certain amounts may not calculate due to rounding of of of net sales net sales net sales net sales gross profit s  g a expenses depreciation expense income from operations year ended december  compared to year ended december  net sales 
our consolidated net sales were billion  an increase of  compared to billion in this includes an increase in tons sold of and a decrease in the average selling price per ton of 
the increase in our tons sold is mainly due to the sales from the companies we acquired in we continued to experience reduced customer demand in all markets during this resulted in reduced volumes at most of our locations  but especially those primarily servicing the aerospace industry  with sales to the aerospace industry decreasing  with a decrease in tons sold and a decrease in the average selling price per ton 
our sales to the aerospace market represented approximately of total sales 
the decrease in our average selling price per ton of resulted mainly from shifts in product mix due to both acquisitions and reductions in our sales of higher priced products to the semiconductor  electronics and aerospace markets 
although metals costs had decreased significantly for most of our products during  we experienced further declines in with the exception of carbon steel flat rolled products 
in the second half of  costs of carbon steel flat rolled products increased significantly due to supply constraints resulting from the temporary closure of a few mills and due to tariffs placed on imports 
carbon steel flat rolled products represented approximately of our sales 
our same store sales excludes sales of businesses we acquired in and decreased million  or  with year tons sold declining as compared to  and the average selling price per ton decreasing by 
these decreases were due to the poor economic conditions in and shifts in our product mix with significant declines in same store sales to the semiconductor and aerospace industries impacting both the tons sold and the average selling price 
gross profit 
our total gross profit of million increased from due to our acquisitions 
our gross profit as a percentage of sales was in compared to in the decline in our gross margin percentage occurred primarily due to competitive pressures resulting from the low level of customer demand throughout the year  especially in the fourth quarter and due to lifo expense of 
table of contents million in compared to lifo income of million in lifo expense and income is reflected as part of our costs of sales 
although we were successful in passing through most of our cost increases  we did experience some margin pressure due to increased costs of carbon steel flat rolled products  coupled with the low demand in the latter part of the year 
the reduction in sales of our higher priced products to the aerospace and semiconductor markets also impacted our gross margins 
expenses 
warehouse  delivery  selling  general and administrative expenses s  g a expenses for increased million  or  from this increase includes the s  g a expenses of the companies we acquired in plus a full year of expenses of our acquisitions 
these expenses represented and of sales in and  respectively 
we were able to reduce our same store s  g a expenses by in as compared to the majority of the decrease in same store s  g a expenses relates to headcount reductions  as personnel costs are the most significant component of our variable costs 
for the year  we reduced our work force by  with half of the reductions  or approximately employees  occurring in the fourth quarter in response to declines in demand 
this reduction was in addition to the reduction that occurred in depreciation and amortization expense decreased million for compared to  mainly because of the change in accounting rules for goodwill 
in  we had million of goodwill amortization expense that was not recorded in  in accordance with the new rules 
this was offset by the inclusion of depreciation expense related to the companies we acquired in and  along with depreciation expense on current year capital expenditures 
the new accounting rules adopted in also require us to measure our goodwill annually for impairment of value 
we did not experience any goodwill impairment in  and therefore did not record any impairment charges 
operating income 
income from operations  calculated as gross profit less s  g a expenses and depreciation expense  decreased as a percentage of sales to in compared to in although consolidated sales increased  our gross profit margin declined and our operating expenses increased due to a larger network of service centers  as discussed above 
interest expense decreased by to million in compared to  due to lower borrowing levels and lower interest rates 
we used the july equity offering proceeds of approximately million to pay down debt 
the year included borrowings for our acquisitions of central plains steel co 
and pacific metal company which were paid off with cash from operations and included million of debt upon consolidation of american steel 
equity earnings and minority interest 
because of our increased ownership interest in american steel  we began to consolidate their results beginning may  prior to that date  we accounted for our investment using the equity method 
on our income statement  the equity in earnings of owned company represents our of american steel s net income from january through april th 
the minority interest amount represents of american steel s net income beginning may  for the portion that we do not own 
our consolidated balance sheet at december  includes the assets and liabilities of american steel  including million of goodwill  million of debt and a reclassification from investment in owned company to minority interest 
income tax rate 
our effective income tax rate decreased from in to in  mainly due to shifts in the geographic composition of our income  resulting from both acquisitions and current economic conditions 
year ended december  compared to year ended december  net sales 
our consolidated net sales were billion  a decrease of  compared to billion in this includes an increase in tons sold of and a decrease in the average selling price per ton of 
the increase in our tons sold is due to the sales from the companies we acquired in overall customer demand declined due to the poor business environment in the united states during this resulted in reduced volumes at all of our locations except for those primarily serving the aerospace 
table of contents industry  with sales to the aerospace industry increasing  with a increase in tons sold and an increase in the average selling price per ton 
the decrease in our average selling price per ton of resulted from lower metals costs and from a shift in our product mix 
during  costs for most metals we sell continued to decline from the year levels 
however  costs of the heat treated aluminum and specialty metals we sell to the aerospace industry increased somewhat in early  but then declined in the fourth quarter of our average selling price was also impacted by shifts in product mix  as the products sold to the aerospace industry are higher priced than most other products we sell  which had a favorable impact on our average selling price 
however  the reduced sales of the even higher priced products we sell to the semiconductor and related industries more than offset this favorable increase 
in addition  the companies we acquired in sell mostly carbon steel products  which generally have lower prices than most other products we sell 
our same store sales excludes sales of businesses we acquired in and decreased million  or  with year tons sold declining as compared to  and the average selling price per ton decreasing by 
these decreases were due to the poor economic conditions in and shifts in our product mix with significant declines in same store sales to the semiconductor and related industries impacting both the tons sold and the average selling price 
gross profit 
our total gross profit of million decreased only in from  on a decrease in sales 
this was due to our ability to increase our gross margins as a percentage of sales to in compared to in we believe our focus on inventory turnover allowed us to reduce our selling prices at a slightly slower pace than our metals costs during  resulting in an improvement in our gross margin percentage in cost of sales was reduced by lifo income of million in  resulting from the decrease in metals costs noted above and a decrease in inventory quantities  compared to increased costs of sales in lifo expense of million due to increased metals costs 
expenses 
s  g a expenses for increased million  or  from  because of the s  g a expenses of the companies we acquired in these expenses represented and of sales in and  respectively 
the increase in our s  g a expenses as a percentage of sales resulted from both lower metals prices and lower selling volumes experienced in we were able to reduce our same store s  g a expenses by million in as compared to the majority of the decrease in same store s  g a expenses relates to headcount reductions  as personnel costs are the most significant component of our variable costs 
for the year  we reduced our work force by over employees  or  with reductions from time to time during the year in response to declining demand 
depreciation and amortization expense increased million for compared to  due to the inclusion of both the depreciation expense and the amortization of goodwill related to the companies we acquired in and  along with depreciation expense on current year capital expenditures 
operating income 
income from operations decreased as a percentage of sales to in compared to in this decline resulted from the decrease in gross profit and the increases in expenses discussed above 
interest expense increased by to million in compared to  due to an increase in the average debt outstanding early in to fund the million stock repurchase in the fourth quarter of and to fund the january acquisitions of aluminum and stainless  inc and viking materials  inc and its related company  viking materials of illinois  inc however  we were able to significantly reduce our debt level and fund the acquisition of the assets and business contributed to our subsidiary pdm steel service centers  inc with the million of net proceeds from our july equity offering 
the interest rate reductions during also lowered our interest expense 
equity earnings 
equity earnings from our owned company decreased by million  or  in as compared to a weakness in demand in the pacific northwest  related mainly to the truck trailer and rail car markets  began in the second half of and continued throughout 
table of contents income tax rate 
our effective income tax rate increased from in to in  mainly due to shifts in the geographic composition of our income  resulting from both acquisitions and current business conditions 
liquidity and capital resources at december   working capital was million  compared to million at december  the increase was primarily due to the additional working capital from our acquisitions  and is net of decreases in our inventory level due to the decline in sales volumes we experienced throughout and our ability to effectively manage our inventories 
we focus on our days sales outstanding to monitor accounts receivable and on our inventory turnover rate to monitor our inventory levels  as receivables and inventory are our two most significant elements of working capital 
at december   our accounts receivable days sales outstanding were days  improved from days at december  we calculate our days sales outstanding as an average of the most recent two month period 
our inventory turnover rate was about times in  improved from about times in and better than the industry average in the current business environment 
our primary sources of liquidity are generally from our internally generated funds from operations and our revolving line of credit 
in  we also raised million in a secondary equity offering 
our operations provided cash of million in  compared to million in along with our earnings  the reductions in our inventory levels in reaction to our reduced sales levels was the primary factor in providing cash flow from operations 
the cash generated from operations in was used to fund the million for the purchase of our acquisitions and to pay down debt of million 
we reduced our net debt to total capital ratio to at december   from at december  our syndicated credit facility allows for million in borrowings 
as of december   million was outstanding under this credit facility 
the million five year unsecured syndicated credit facility  as amended effective december   is with nine banks and may be increased to million 
at december   we had million of letters of credit outstanding under our syndicated credit facility 
american steel has a two year syndicated credit agreement  as amended effective june   that is secured with working capital with a borrowing limit of million 
as of december   million was outstanding on american steel s credit facility 
we also have senior unsecured notes outstanding in the aggregate amount of million 
the senior notes have maturity dates ranging from to  with an average remaining life of years  and bear interest at a weighted average fixed rate of per annum 
the syndicated credit facility and senior note agreements require that we maintain a minimum net worth and interest coverage ratio  and a maximum leverage ratio  and include restrictions on the amount of cash dividends we pay 
our net capital expenditures  excluding acquisitions  were million for the year 
we had no material commitments for capital expenditures or capital leases as of december  our operating lease commitments are discussed in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
the purchases of central plains steel co 
and pacific metal company were funded with borrowings on our line of credit 
the acquisition of olympic metals  inc was funded by cash from operations 
our capital requirements are primarily for working capital  acquisitions  and capital expenditures for continued improvements in plant capacities and materials handling and processing equipment 
on july   we issued  shares of our common stock  including the shares issued on exercise of the over allotment option  at a price of per share for total net proceeds of approximately million  after deducting the underwriting discount and offering expenses 
the proceeds were used to reduce debt related to the pdm steel service centers  inc acquisition and debt related to other acquisitions  capital expenditures  and general working capital needs 
we anticipate that funds generated from operations and funds available under our line of credit will be sufficient to meet our working capital needs for the foreseeable future 

table of contents on august   our board of directors approved the purchase of up to an additional  shares of our outstanding common stock through our stock repurchase plan  for a total of  shares 
since inception of the stock repurchase plan  we have purchased a total of  shares of our common stock  at an average purchase price of per share  as of december   all of which are being treated as authorized but unissued shares 
in and  we did not repurchase any shares of our common stock 
we believe such purchases  given appropriate circumstances  enhance shareholder value and reflect our confidence in the long term growth potential of our company 
inflation our operations have not been  and we do not expect them to be  materially affected by general inflation 
historically  we have been successful in adjusting prices to our customers to reflect changes in metal prices 
seasonality some of our customers may be in seasonal businesses  especially customers in the construction industry 
as a result of our geographic  product and customer diversity  however  our operations have not shown any material seasonal trends 
revenues in the months of november and december traditionally have been lower than in other months because of a reduced number of working days for shipments of our products and holiday closures of some of our customers 
in  many customers extended their holiday closures which we believe was due to both the poor business conditions and the holidays occurring mid week 
we cannot assure you that period to period fluctuations will not occur in the future 
results of any one or more quarters are therefore not necessarily indicative of annual results 
goodwill goodwill  which represents the excess of cost over the fair value of net assets acquired  amounted to million at december   or approximately of total assets or of consolidated shareholders equity 
the amortization of goodwill in the year was million  or approximately of pretax income 
in june  the financial accounting standards board issued statement of financial accounting standards sfas or statement no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
under the new rule  goodwill deemed to have indefinite lives is no longer amortized but will be subject to annual impairment tests in accordance with the statement 
other intangible assets continue to be amortized over their useful lives 
we have adopted the provisions of sfas no 
effective january  we review the recoverability of goodwill annually or whenever significant events or changes occur which might impair the recovery of recorded costs 
we measure possible impairment based on either significant losses of an entity or the ability to recover the balance of the long lived asset from expected future operating cash flows on an undiscounted basis 
if impairment is identified  we would calculate the amount of such impairment based upon the discounted cash flows or the market values as compared to the recorded costs 
we have performed impairment tests of goodwill as of january  and november  and believe that the recorded amounts for goodwill are recoverable and that no impairment currently exists 
critical accounting policies management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations discusses our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
when we prepare these consolidated financial statements  we are required to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates and judgments  including those related to accounts receivable  inventories  deferred tax assets  goodwill and intangible assets  long lived assets and revenue recognition 
we base our estimates and judgments on historical experience and on various other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for our judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily 
table of contents apparent from other sources 
our actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies  as discussed with the audit committee  affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in preparing our consolidated financial statements 
see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements for our summary of significant accounting policies 
there have been no material changes made to the critical accounting policies during the periods presented in the consolidated financial statements 
accounts receivable we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts to reflect our estimate of the uncollectibility of accounts receivable based on our past collection history and the identification of specific potential customer risks 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate beyond our estimates  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  we may be required to increase our allowance for doubtful accounts 
inventories we maintain allowances for estimated obsolescence or unmarketable inventory to reflect the difference between the cost of inventory and the estimated market value based on an evaluation of slow moving products and current replacement costs 
if actual market conditions are less favorable than those anticipated by management  additional allowances may be required 
deferred tax assets we currently have significant deferred tax assets  which are subject to periodic recoverability assessments 
realizing our deferred tax assets principally depends upon our achieving projected future taxable income 
we may change our judgments regarding future profitability due to future market conditions and other factors 
these changes  if any  may require adjustments to our deferred tax asset balances 
for information concerning our provision for income taxes as well as information regarding differences between our effective tax rate and statutory rates  see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
goodwill and intangible assets in assessing the recoverability of our goodwill and other intangibles we must make assumptions regarding estimated future cash flows and other factors to determine the fair value of the respective assets 
effective january   we adopted sfas no 
and have performed impairment testing in accordance with the statement 
we estimated future cash flows at the reporting unit level 
a key assumption made is that our business will continue to grow at the industry average of to per year  adjusted for the cyclical businesses of certain reporting units and the current economic outlook 
if these estimates or their related assumptions change in the future  we may be required to record impairment charges for these assets not previously recorded 
long lived assets we review the recoverability of our long lived assets as required by sfas no 
and must make assumptions regarding estimated future cash flows and other factors to determine the fair value of the respective assets 
if these estimates or their related assumptions change in the future  we may be required to record impairment charges for these assets not previously recorded 
effective january   we adopted sfas no 
and have reviewed recoverability of our long lived assets in accordance with the statement 

table of contents revenue recognition we recognize revenue when title to our products passes to our customers  typically upon delivery 
sales are shown net of returns and discounts 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk in the ordinary course of business  we are exposed to various market risk factors  including changes in general economic conditions  domestic and foreign competition  foreign currency exchange rates  and metals pricing and availability 
additionally  we are exposed to market risk primarily related to our fixed rate long term debt 
market risk is the potential loss arising from adverse changes in market rates and prices  such as interest rates 
decreases in interest rates may affect the market value of our fixed rate debt 
under our current policies  we do not use interest rate derivative instruments to manage exposure to interest rate changes 
based on our debt  we do not consider the exposure to interest rate risk to be material 
our fixed rate debt obligations are not callable until maturity
