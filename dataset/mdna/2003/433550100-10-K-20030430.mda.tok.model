general hirsch international corp 
hirsch or the company is a leading single source supplier of electronic computer controlled embroidery machinery and related value added products and services to the embroidery industry 
the company offers a complete line of technologically advanced single and multi head embroidery machines  proprietary application software and a diverse line of embroidery supplies and accessories 
hirsch believes its comprehensive customer service  user training  software support through pulse and broad product offerings combine to place the company in a superior competitive position within its marketplace 
the company sells embroidery machines manufactured by tajima industries ltd 
tajima and tajima usa  inc tui  a subsidiary formed in fiscal  as well as a wide variety of embroidery supplies  microcomputers manufactured by dell computer corporation and software manufactured by pulse microsystems ltd 
pulse 
the company s focus from through was on growth and expansion of its installed machine base and increasing the breadth of its offerings to the embroidery industry 
the acquisitions of smx and sedeco increased the area in which the company is the exclusive distributor of tajima embroidery equipment from states to states 
in january  tajima granted the company the exclusive right to distribute small one through six head models tajima embroidery machines in nine western states and hawaii 
with this expansion of the company s small machine territory to the west coast  hirsch gained the right to distribute tajima machines throughout the continental united states and hawaii 
in fiscal hirsch formed tui for the purpose of assembling tajima embroidery machines in the united states 
production at tui consists of models in configurations of up to eight heads per machine 
in january tokai industries tajima s manufacturing arm purchased a percent interest in tui 
this investment reflects their continuing confidence in this endeavor and will be a contributing factor in the long range growth of tui 
in july tajima granted to hirsch the non exclusive right to distribute to its existing us customers who have expanded their operations into the caribbean region 
the company grew rapidly from the time of its initial public offering through fiscal growth during this period was fueled by rapid technological advances in software and hardware  the continued strong demand for embroidered products  the creation of new embroidery applications and the continued strength of the embroidery entrepreneur as a growing segment of the marketplace 
the company believes that the purchasers of smaller embroidery machines are a significant source of repeat business for the sale of multi head embroidery machines as the entrepreneurs operations expand 
fiscal continued the trend toward retrenchment begun in the industry in fiscal  with retrenchment driven by the relocation and continued investment offshore of large multi head equipment customers 
while growth of small machine customers stabilized in the domestic market  the market continued to experience a decline in large machine sales  continuing the change in the sales mix of embroidery machines and an overall decline in demand 
it was further compounded by weakening value in foreign exchange of the yen versus the us dollar  resulting in dollar price pressure for machine sales 
all japanese equipment based competitors in the industry faced difficulty in meeting these new market demands 
in fiscal the company initiated a restructuring program to address the market shifts in the industry  including closing and consolidating certain divisions  reducing total employment  and consolidating facilities that were no longer required to support its new business model see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
the company believes the continued implementation of the cost reduction program coupled with its reorganization of operational functions will allow it to position itself to return to profitable operations 
results of operations the following table presents certain income statement items expressed as a percentage of total revenue for the fiscal years ended january   and net sales cost of sales operating expenses interest expense  net other expense income  net loss income before income taxes and minority interest income tax benefit provision minority interest loss on discontinued operations net loss income note the results of operations have been restated to reflect the discontinued operations of hapl and pulse 
use of estimates and critical accounting policies the preparation of hirsch s financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and revenues and expenses during the period 
future events and their effects cannot be determined with absolute certainty  therefore  the determination of estimates requires the exercise of judgment 
actual results inevitably will differ from those estimates  and such differences may be material to our financial statements 
management continually evaluates its estimates and assumptions  which are based on historical experience and other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
these estimates and hirsch s actual results are subject to the risk factors listed above under item business risk factors 
critical accounting policies management believes the following critical accounting policies affect its more significant estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements revenue recognition the company distributes embroidery equipment that it offers for sale or lease 
prior to the issuance by the sec of the staff accounting bulletin no 
sab  revenue related to the sale of equipment was recorded at the time of shipment 
the company has adopted the recommendation of sab effective with reporting for fiscal year where installation and customer acceptance are a substantive part of the sale  by its terms  the company has deferred recognition of the revenue until such customer acceptance of installation has occurred 
comparisons of financial performance have been retroactively adjusted to reflect the impact of this change in accounting method 
in fiscal year  and  most sales of new equipment did not require installation within the terms of the sales contract and accordingly sales are booked when shipped 
the company s policy is to accrue the estimate cost of installation on a quarterly basis 
service revenues and costs are recognized when services are provided 
sales of computer hardware and software are recognized when shipped provided that no significant vendor and post contract and support obligations remain and collection is probable 
sales of parts and supplies are recognized when shipped 
long lived assets the company reviews its long lived assets  including property  plant and equipment  identifiable intangibles goodwill and purchased technologies  for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be fully recoverable 
to determine recoverability of its long lived assets  the company evaluates the probability that future undiscounted net cash flows will be less than the carrying amount of the assets 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal   of goodwill associated with the acquisitions of smx corporation  sedeco corporation and all pro punching  inc was written off 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal  the remaining balance of  of goodwill associated with the acquisitions of smx corporation and sedeco corporation was written off 
see note to the consolidated financial statements 
income taxes current income tax expense is the amount of income taxes expected to be payable for the current year 
a deferred income tax asset or liability is established for the expected future consequences resulting from temporary differences in the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities 
the company provides a valuation allowance for its deferred tax assets when  in the opinion of management  it is more likely than not that such assets will not be realized 
allowance for doubtful accounts the company maintains an allowance for estimated losses resulting from the inability of its customers to make required payments 
an estimate of uncollectable amounts is made by management based upon historical bad debts  current customer receivable balances  age of customer receivable balances  the customer s financial condition and current economic trends 
if the actual uncollected amounts significantly exceed the estimated allowance  then the company s operating results would be significantly adversely affected 
inventories inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market 
cost is determined using the average cost for supplies and parts and specific cost for embroidery machines and peripherals 
the inventory balance is recorded net of an estimated allowance for obsolete or unmarketable inventory 
the estimated allowance for obsolete or unmarketable inventory is based upon management s understanding of market conditions and forecasts of future product demand 
if the actual amount of obsolete or unmarketable inventory significantly exceeds the estimated allowance  the company s cost of sales  gross profit and net income would be significantly adversely affected 
warranty the company instituted a five year limited warranty policy for its embroidery machines 
the company s policy is to accrue the estimated cost of satisfying future warranty claims on a quarterly basis 
in estimating its future warranty obligations  the company considers various relevant factors  including the company s stated warranty policies and practices  the historical frequency of claims  and the cost to replace or repair its products under warranty 
if the number of actual warranty claims or the cost of satisfying warranty claims significantly exceeds the estimated warranty reserve  the company s cost of sales  gross profit and net income would be significantly adversely affected

fiscal year as compared to fiscal year net sales 
net sales for fiscal year were million  a decrease of million  or compared to million for fiscal year the company believes that the reduction in the sales level for the fiscal year ended january  is primarily attributable to a decrease in overall demand for new multi head embroidery machines  as well as increased pricing pressure from the marketplace on new and used machine sales 
sales of the company s new and used machines  computer hardware and software  application software for fiscal year aggregated approximately million as compared to million for fiscal year  a decrease of million or

operating expenses 
operating expenses for fiscal year  decreased million or  to million from million for fiscal year excluding the non recurring charges for goodwill impairment and restructuring costs  operating expenses were million in fiscal  a decline of million or from million in fiscal this decline was attributable to the cost reduction initiatives the company put into place at the end of fiscal the company performed an impairment evaluation during the fourth quarter of fiscal for the smx corporation and sedeco corporation territories and as a result wrote off the balance of the goodwill associated with these acquisitions 
the goodwill write off represented a per share net loss of both on a basic and diluted basis for fiscal year operating expenses for also include restructuring charges reflecting the company s plan to reduce operating costs relative to the anticipated sales volume 
included in this non recurring charge are 
million in employee severance costs and million in facilities combinations lease restructures see note to the consolidated financial statements 
interest expense 
interest expense for fiscal year was 
million versus interest expense of 
million for fiscal year the company continued its aggressive inventory reduction program in fiscal year the results of this program directly reflect increased liquidity and meant no increase in interest expense as a result of the eliminations of working capital borrowings outstanding against the company s revolving credit agreements during both fiscal and fiscal the sale of the corporate headquarters during fiscal also reduced the need for working capital borrowings 
income tax benefit provision 
the income tax provision reflected an effective tax rate of approximately for the twelve months ended january  as compared to an income tax benefit rate of for fiscal year the tax provision for fiscal represents federal and state taxes on the company s owned subsidiary and was reduced by the actual nol carryback for the prior year 
the benefit rate for the fiscal year is a direct result of the job creation and worker assistance act temporarily extending the carryback of net operating losses from two years to five years 
this change has enabled the company to carryback its two most recent years losses and obtain a refund of approximately million 
the difference of the above rate to the federal statutory rate for is the valuation allowance established on deferred tax assets since the company cannot determine the future utilization of those assets  as well as minimum franchise taxes for fiscal loss on discontinued operations 
in the fourth quarter of fiscal  the company determined that its hapl leasing subsidiary was not strategic to the company s ongoing objectives and discontinued operations

while the fluctuation of the dollar against the yen has historically had a minimal effect on tajima equipment gross margins  since currency fluctuations are generally reflected in pricing adjustments in order to maintain consistent gross margins on machine revenues  increased cost of sales reflects the continuing product mix shift from larger equipment with higher gross margins to smaller equipment with lower gross margins 
the lower gross margins also reflect the aggressive pricing used to meet market demand 
operating expenses 
as reported for fiscal year  operating expenses decreased million or  to million from million for fiscal year excluding the non recurring charges for goodwill impairment and restructuring costs  operating expenses were million  a decline of million or from million 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal  in view of the overall industry decline in demand for embroidery equipment and related products  the resulting decline in company revenue delivered in the territories associated with the acquisition of smx corporation and sedeco corporation and the company s impairment evaluation  the company wrote off approximately million of goodwill as an impairment charge to operations

loss on discontinued operations 
in the fourth quarter of fiscal  the company determined that its hapl leasing subsidiary was not strategic to the company s ongoing objectives and discontinued operations 
the company has made provisions for the cost of winding down the operations as well as the potential losses that could be incurred in disposing of its minimum lease payments and residual receivables 
the operating loss in fiscal includes million provision for the unl liability and the sale of the residual receivable associated with it  million increase in the mlpr provision  as well as million in other costs

see note to the consolidated financial statements 
net loss 
the net loss for fiscal year was million  an increase of million  compared to a net loss of million for fiscal year this increase is attributable to the decrease in net sales  an increase in the cost of sales  an increase operating expenses associated with the restructuring charge of million and a loss on discontinued operations of million 
these charges were offset by the reduction in goodwill impairment charge of million  a reduction in selling  general and administrative expenses of million and an increase in tax benefit of million 
liquidity and capital resources the company s working capital was million at january   decreasing million or  from million  at january  the decrease in working capital was principally due to decrease in the net assets of discontinued operations as well as continued reductions in inventory  accounts receivable and refundable income taxes 
this reduction reflects a reduced level of business activity and receipt of federal income taxes based on the carry back of prior year losses 
the company has financed its operations principally through cash provided by decreases in inventory  accounts receivable and the receipt of the tax refund 
during fiscal year  the company s cash increased by million to million 
net cash of million was provided by the company s operating activities and was largely driven by the converting receivables and inventory into cash as well as the reduction in the net assets of discontinued operations 
this was offset in part by decreases in accounts payable and accrued expenses 
cash used for investing activities of  was used for the purchase of fixed assets and was offset by the cash received from the sale of the pulse subsidiary 
cash used for financing activities was for additional collateral for the lcs outstanding  used to pay for embroidery machines as well as the repayment of long term debt and for the cost of the credit line with congress financial corp 
future commitments the following table shows the company s contractual obligations related to long term obligations see notes and to the consolidated financial statements 
payments due by period in thousands less more than years than contractual obligations total year years years capital lease obligations  operating lease obligations   purchase commitments    employment agreements  total      revolving credit facility and borrowings on november  the company satisfied all of its obligations and exited its revolving credit and security facility with pnc bank and replaced it with a loan and security agreement the congress agreement with congress financial corporation congress for three years expiring on november  the congress agreement provides for a credit facility of million for hirsch and all subsidiaries 
advances made pursuant to the congress agreement may be used by the company and its subsidiaries for working capital loans  letters of credit and deferred payment letters of credit 
the terms of the congress agreement require the company to maintain certain financial covenants 
future capital requirements subsequent to the close of fiscal  the federal government passed the job creation and worker assistance act temporarily extending the carry back of net operating losses from two years to five years 
this should provide approximately million in cash available for operations 
approximately million was received during the fiscal year ended january  and the balance should be received during the second quarter of fiscal the company believes these proceeds  with its existing cash and funds generated from operations  together with its new credit facility  will be sufficient to meet its working capital and capital expenditure requirements and to finance planned growth 
backlog and inventory the ability of the company to fill orders quickly is an important part of its customer service strategy 
the embroidery machines held in inventory by the company are generally shipped within a week from the date the customer s orders are received  and as a result  backlog is not meaningful as an indicator of future sales 
inflation the company does not believe that inflation has had  or will have in the foreseeable future  a material impact upon the company s operating results

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company is exposed to various market risks  including changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates 
market risk is the potential loss arising from adverse changes in market rates and prices  such as foreign currency exchange and interest rates 
the company has a formal policy that prohibits the use of currency derivatives or other financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes 
the policy permits the use of financial instruments to manage and reduce the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates that may arise in the normal course of the company s business 
currently  the company does not use interest rate derivatives 
the company may enter into forward foreign exchange contracts principally to hedge the currency fluctuations in transactions denominated in foreign currencies  thereby limiting the company s risk that would otherwise result from changes in exchange rates 
any company debt  if utilized  is us dollar denominated and floating rate based 
at year end  there was no usage of the revolving credit facility 
if the company had utilized its credit facility  it would have exposure to rising and falling rates  and an increase in such rates would have an adverse impact on net pre tax expenses 
the company does not use interest rate derivatives to protect its exposure to interest rate market movements
