item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
you should read the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations with the consolidated and combined financial statements and the accompanying notes to the consolidated and combined financial statements included elsewhere in this document 
this discussion contains forward looking statements and involves numerous risks and uncertainties  including  but not limited to  those described in the risks relating to our business and industry section of this item our actual results may differ materially from those contained in any forward looking statements 
overview we are a worldwide developer  manufacturer and supplier of liquid and gas delivery systems  components and consumables used to precisely measure  deliver  control and purify the process liquids  gases and chemicals  as well as the deionized water  photoresists and vacuum systems  that are utilized in the semiconductor manufacturing process 
our products include membrane and metal based filters  housings  precision liquid dispense filtration pumps  resin based gas purifiers and mass flow and pressure controllers 
our products are used by our customers in manufacturing operations to remove contaminants in liquid and gas processes  to purify liquids and gases  to measure and control flow rates and to control and monitor pressure and vacuum levels during the manufacturing process 
our products are sold globally through a direct sales force and through distributors in selected regions 
our customers are located worldwide and we currently manufacture our products at four sites located in the united states and japan 
in  as part of our separation plan from millipore corporation millipore  we opened a new corporate headquarters  r d and manufacturing facility in billerica  massachusetts and exited the jaffrey  new hampshire manufacturing facility owned by millipore 
our separation from millipore on october   millipore announced its plan to spin off its microelectronics business which served the semiconductor industry and certain related industries with products needed to manufacture semiconductor devices as well as a range of other products that now comprises mykrolis corporation the company 
on october   the company was incorporated in delaware as a wholly owned subsidiary of millipore to receive millipore s microelectronics business and to be the spun off company 
prior to march  our business was operated as a fully integrated business unit of millipore 
on march   millipore transferred to us substantially all of the assets and liabilities associated with its microelectronics business the separation 
we completed our initial public offering ipo of million shares of common stock on august  receiving net proceeds of approximately million  after deducting underwriting commissions and offering expenses 
we retained approximately million of the net proceeds and paid the balance to millipore as repayment of amounts outstanding as intercompany loans incurred by us in connection with the separation 
after the initial public offering  millipore owned million shares  or approximately  of our total outstanding common stock 
on february  the distribution date  millipore completed the spin off of mykrolis through the distribution to its shareholders of all of the million shares of mykrolis common stock owned by millipore on that date 
mykrolis is now a fully independent company with million shares outstanding at december  in connection with our separation from millipore  we entered into agreements with millipore under which millipore agreed to provide services to us during a transition period after the separation date 
the agreements related to facilities services  information technology services  distribution  accounting  finance and other services and arrangements 
under these agreements  we reimburse millipore for the cost of these services 
the duration of each of the different transition service agreements varied depending on the anticipated time it would take for us to replace the service  but was generally for a one year period 
no agreement has been extended beyond the mutually agreed upon initial transition period  with the exception of the accounting and distribution services in 
table of contents europe which was extended by one additional quarter until the end of the second quarter as most of these transition service agreements have expired without renewal  we have been able to provide these services ourselves or negotiate new agreements with various third parties as a separate stand alone entity 
we have been able to do this at costs at least as favorable as those paid to millipore for these services 
we will be terminating the use of millipore s information technology it data center  which is currently hosting our it system operations  during the first half of in accordance with the schedule contemplated by our transition service agreement 
in addition  we have entered into agreements with millipore for membrane manufacturing and supply  research and development  product distribution and contract manufacturing  generally for a five year period 
the foregoing transition agreements do not necessarily reflect the costs of obtaining the services from unrelated third parties or of our providing the applicable services ourselves 
however  we believe that purchasing these products and services from millipore provides us with an efficient means of obtaining these products and services during the transition period 
in addition  we have agreed to provide transition services to millipore  for which we are reimbursed at our cost 
basis of presentation our combined financial statements for periods prior to march  include amounts that have been derived from the consolidated financial statements and accounting records of millipore using the historical results of operations and historical basis of assets and liabilities of our business 
we believe the assumptions underlying the combined financial statements are reasonable 
however  the combined financial information included herein may not necessarily reflect our operating results  financial position and cash flows in the future or what they would have been had we been a separate  stand alone entity during the periods presented 
because a direct ownership relationship did not exist among all our various units  millipore s net investment in us is shown in lieu of shareholders equity in the combined financial statements prior to the separation 
we began accumulating retained earnings accumulated deficit on april   following the effective date of the separation agreement with millipore  pursuant to which our assets and liabilities were transferred to us 
beginning april   our consolidated financial statements include all our wholly owned subsidiaries and our assets and liabilities 
all material intercompany transactions and balances between and among our subsidiaries have been eliminated 
prior to march  millipore allocated certain corporate expenses  including centralized research and development  legal  accounting  employee benefits  officers salaries  facilities  insurance  information technology services  distribution  treasury and other millipore corporate and infrastructure costs 
these expense allocations were determined on a basis that millipore and we consider to be a reasonable assessment of the utilization of services provided or the benefit received by us 
at the time of separation from millipore  we entered into transition service agreements with millipore for millipore to provide specified functions and for us to reimburse millipore for the cost of these functions 
these agreements do not necessarily reflect the costs of obtaining the services from unrelated third parties or of our providing the applicable services ourselves 
however  we believe that purchasing these services from millipore provided us with an efficient means of obtaining these services during the transition period 
in  we purchased million of services from millipore under these transition services agreement 
in  we purchased services of million and were allocated costs from millipore of million 
in  we were allocated million of costs from millipore 
allocated costs and purchased services included in the accompanying consolidated and combined statements of operations are as follows year ended december  in millions cost of sales selling  general and administrative expenses research and development expenses total 
table of contents in addition  we have agreed to provide transition services to millipore  for which we are reimbursed at our cost 
these amounts totaled million and million in and respectively  related to manufacturing  distribution and research and development services that have been recorded as reductions to our cost of sales and research and development expenses 
during  we entered into a royalty agreement with nihon millipore  which provides nihon millipore the right to use certain intellectual property that was developed by mykrolis in connection with the bioscience business 
as a result of this agreement  million in royalty income from millipore was recognized and recorded in other income expense  net for the years ended december  and millipore used a centralized approach to cash management and the financing of its operations 
prior to the separation  our cash deposits were transferred to millipore on a regular basis and netted against millipore s net investment 
as a result  none of millipore s cash  cash equivalents or debt at the corporate level were allocated to us in our combined financial statements through the second quarter of changes in millipore s net investment include our net earnings plus net cash transfers to or from millipore 
after the separation but prior to the ipo  cash deposits were netted against amounts outstanding under our separation revolving credit agreement with millipore 
from the ipo to distribution date  amounts due to millipore were netted against amounts due from millipore and reported as accounts payable millipore in our consolidated and combined financial statements 
after distribution date  these transactions were reported as third party accounts payable and third party accounts receivable 
for the years ended december   and we purchased products from millipore for inclusion in our products sold to third parties totaling million  million and million  respectively 
for the years ended december  and  products sold to millipore by us totaled million and million  respectively 
for the year ended december   products sold to millipore were not material 
critical accounting policies and significant judgements and accounting estimates our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated and combined financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the us the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our judgments and estimates  including those related to revenues  accounts receivable  inventories  long lived assets and goodwill  deferred tax assets  income tax contingencies  warranty obligations  restructuring charges  accrued pension and other post retirement benefit obligations  and litigation contingencies 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of the consolidated and combined financial statements 
the company has reviewed these policies with its audit and finance committee 
revenues our net sales consist of revenue from sales of products net of trade discounts and allowances 
we recognize revenue when evidence of an arrangement exists  contractual obligations have been satisfied  title and risk of loss have been transferred to the customer and collection of the resulting receivable is reasonably assured 
in the event significant post shipment obligations or uncertainties remain  revenue is recognized when such obligations are fulfilled by us or the uncertainties are resolved 
we provide for estimated product returns under limited contractual obligations 
amounts billed to customers that relate to shipping costs are included in net sales and in cost of sales 
revenue from services is recognized when the services are provided 
our service revenue was less than of total net sales for each of the three years ended december  and 
table of contents accounts receivable we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments based upon specific identification  by customer 
if the financial condition of our customers was to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
inventories we provide reserves for estimated excess and obsolete inventory equal to the difference between the cost of inventory and the estimated net realizable value based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions 
we fully reserve for inventories deemed obsolete 
we perform quarterly reviews of all inventory items to identify excess and obsolete inventories on hand by comparing on hand balances to recent historical usage as well as anticipated or forecasted demand  based upon input from sales  research and development and marketing functions 
if estimates of demand diminish further or actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected  additional inventory write downs may be required 
we adjust the cost basis of inventory that has been written down to reflect its net realizable value 
long lived assets and goodwill we periodically evaluate the recoverability of long lived assets whenever events and changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset or class of assets may not be fully recoverable and exceeds its fair value 
for long lived assets we intend to hold and use  if the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the sum of undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset over its useful life  an impairment loss will be recorded 
the amount of the impairment loss is measured as the amount by which the carrying amount of the long lived asset exceeds its fair value 
assets held for sale are valued at fair value less costs to sell the asset 
for goodwill  we assess fair value by measuring discounted cash flows and comparable company analysis for the applicable underlying reporting unit and test for impairment as the difference between the resulting implied fair value of goodwill compared to its recorded carrying value 
goodwill impairment is tested annually or whenever events and changes in circumstances occur 
the estimates of useful lives and expected cash flows require us to make significant judgments regarding future periods that are subject to some factors outside our control 
changes in these estimates can result in significant revisions to the carrying value of these assets and may result in material charges to the results of operations 
deferred tax assets our valuation allowance against the deferred tax assets are based on our assessment of historical pre tax income and projected pre tax income for early future periods 
in addition  there is no valuation allowance against the deferred tax assets in foreign subsidiaries based on our assessment of historical pre tax income and projected pre tax income for early future periods 
in the event the foreign subsidiaries do not generate sufficient pre tax income as planned during  we will need to re evaluate whether it is more likely than not that certain deferred tax assets in the foreign subsidiaries will be realized 
income tax contingencies tax contingencies are recorded to address potential exposures involving tax positions we have taken that could be challenged by taxing authorities 
these potential exposures result from the varying application of statutes  rules  regulations and interpretations 
our estimate of the value of our tax contingencies contains 
table of contents assumptions based on past experiences and judgments about potential actions by taxing jurisdictions 
it is reasonably likely that the ultimate resolution of these matters may be greater or less than the amount that we have accrued 
warranty obligations at the time revenue is recognized  we provide for the estimated cost of product warranties as provided for under our contractual arrangements 
our warranty obligation is affected by product failure rates and service delivery costs incurred in correcting a product failure 
should such failure rates or costs differ from these estimates  accrued warranty costs would be adjusted in the period that such events or costs become known 
restructuring charges during and  we recorded significant charges to operations in connection with our restructuring programs 
the related reserves reflect estimates  including those pertaining to severance costs and facility exit costs 
we reassess the reserve requirements to complete each restructuring program at the end of each reporting period 
actual experience may be different from these estimates 
pension and post retirement benefit obligations we have significant pension and post retirement benefit costs and credits  which are developed from actuarial valuations 
inherent in these valuations are key assumptions  including discount rates and expected return on plan assets  which are usually updated on an annual basis at the beginning of each fiscal year 
we are required to consider current market conditions  including changes in interest rates  in making theses assumptions 
changes in the related pension and post retirement benefit costs or credits may occur in the future due to changes in assumptions 
litigation contingencies we are subject to proceedings  lawsuits and other claims  including proceedings under laws and government regulations related to securities  environmental  labor  product and other matters 
we are required to assess the likelihood of any adverse judgments or outcomes to these matters  as well as potential ranges of probable losses 
a determination of the amount of reserves required  if any  for these contingencies is based on a careful analysis of each individual issue with the assistance of outside legal counsel 
the required reserves may change in the future due to new developments in each matter or changes in approach such as a change in settlement strategy in dealing with these matters 
restructuring and other charges restructuring and other charges during the fourth quarter of  we recorded restructuring and other charges of million to further respond to the current semiconductor industry downturn 
of this amount  million relates to non cash asset writedowns due to asset impairments 
key elements of these restructuring and other charges included decision to discontinue the manufacturing of certain gas products 
accordingly  we will close our san clemente  ca manufacturing unit in august million relates to impairment in the carrying value of plant machinery and leasehold improvements  and the impairment of a capitalized patent related to this manufacturing process 
the closing of our operations in san clemente  ca also includes employee severance and facility exit costs of million 
severance costs of million related to employees in the us  asia and europe 

table of contents additional facility exit costs of million related to vacated leased facilities in bedford  ma and in swindon  england due to continued depressed real estate rental market conditions and our current assessment that we will not be able to sublease these facilities for the remainder of our lease obligations 
these restructuring initiatives are expected to yield annualized savings of approximately million 
the savings will result from reduced wages and facility related costs and depreciation 
the savings will be reflected in costs of sales  selling  general and administrative expenses and research and development expenses 
restructuring and other charges during the third quarter of  we recorded restructuring and other charges of million in response to the prolonged duration and severity of the current semiconductor industry downturn 
the restructuring and other charges included approximately million of employee severance costs  a million write off of equipment and leasehold improvements and million of net exit costs on leased property 
key initiatives of the restructuring included reducing the workforce in the us  asia and europe in order to resize the company 
this action was completed during the third quarter of these third quarter restructuring initiatives resulted in the elimination of positions worldwide 
discontinuing our plan to renovate the leased office space in bedford  massachusetts and instead exit that facility 
this action was completed during the third quarter of during the first quarter of  we recorded restructuring and other charges of million in connection with our separation from millipore to improve our manufacturing asset utilization and resize our overall cost structure 
these restructuring and other charges included approximately million of employee severance costs resulting in the elimination of positions worldwide  approximately million of equipment and leasehold improvement write offs and approximately million of lease cancellation costs 
key initiatives included consolidating manufacturing operations to eliminate redundant manufacturing processes 
we relocated the operations of two of our manufacturing facilities in the us and closed our manufacturing facility in england 
this consolidation of our manufacturing operations was substantially completed in the first quarter of realigning our european organizational structure to focus on our operating business units  thereby consolidating our sales and administrative activities into fewer locations that are closer to our customer base 
we completed this transition during the fourth quarter of reducing our administrative and management infrastructure costs in asia 
these cost reductions have resulted in a leaner infrastructure through reduced facility costs and administrative positions 
this program was completed during the fourth quarter of reducing our workforce in the us in order to address changes in the demand for our products due to the semiconductor industry downturn 
this action was completed during the second quarter of these combined restructuring initiatives resulted in annualized savings of approximately million through reduced payroll costs  and facility related costs and depreciation 
the savings are reflected in costs of sales  selling  general and administrative expenses and research and development expenses 
as of december   our total accrued restructuring costs amount to million 
of this amount  the majority of the million in severance costs for terminated employees will be paid in the first quarter of the facilities related costs of million will be substantially paid by the fourth quarter of 
table of contents separation costs included in operating income loss in addition  in connection with continuing efforts to separate from millipore and the implementation of our worldwide manufacturing strategy  we expect to incur incremental  non recurring operating costs and expenses 
during  these incremental  separation related  non recurring costs and expenses could amount to approximately million 
in and  these costs and expenses amounted to approximately million and million  respectively 
these costs and expenses are associated with legal fees  initial marketing expenses related to establishing a new brand identity  retention bonuses  depreciation expense due to decreases in the estimated useful lives of fixed assets and leasehold improvements  designing and constructing our computer infrastructure and implementing treasury  real estate  pension and records retention management services 
during the fourth quarter of  we decided to establish a data center at the billerica headquarters to handle data processing services that have been performed by millipore 
we expect that data processing operations will be operational by the end of the second quarter of and that future costs will be consistent with the historical costs incurred for these services 
in  we expect to incur approximately million of separation costs associated with transitioning our data processing activities from millipore 
results of operations operating trends and recent developments the principal market we serve is the global semiconductor industry  a highly cyclical business 
as a result  we have experienced significant variations in net sales and results of operations in the periods presented and such variations are likely to continue 
we generally have limited backlog 
we believe the business environment will remain uncertain  and there are no clear signs of an imminent industry upturn 
throughout and  we have experienced and we are continuing to experience weak demand for our liquid and gas delivery systems  components and consumables from a number of our large customers 
these customers have placed fewer orders as they attempt  we believe  to manage their demand and their inventories in response to weakness in their market 
as a result  our revenues and our operating results decreased in and as compared to prior years 
we can not predict the extent or duration of this cyclical downturn or its impact on us 
we have taken actions to reduce capital expenditures  operating costs and expenses in response to these adverse trends 
during the fourth quarter of  we implemented several actions to reduce our cost structure and to streamline our organization 
our worldwide workforce was reduced by and we announced the closing of our small manufacturing operation in san clemente  california 
however  in the midst of this downturn  we continue to support our customers around the world and to fund key research and development programs for future growth 

table of contents our results of operations for the years ended december   and in dollars and as a percentage of total net sales were as follows year ended december  year ended december  in millions as a percent of net sales net sales cost of sales gross profit selling  general and administrative expenses research and development expenses restructuring and other charges operating income loss other income expense  net income loss before income taxes income tax expense net income loss year ended december  compared to years ended december  and net sales 
net sales were million in  which represented a  or a million decrease when compared to this decrease was a result of the severe downturn in the semiconductor industry  which began in the first quarter of the decline in sales was significant in most geographic regions and across nearly all product families 
sales of microelectronics equipment have declined as new semiconductor fabrication plant construction and upgrades have declined due to industry over capacity 
in addition  sales of consumable purification products also declined  although to a lesser extent  as semiconductor fabrication plants have experienced lower manufacturing volumes and have focused on achieving manufacturing efficiencies and reducing material costs 
during  net sales decreased or million from million in the net sales decrease in was primarily due to a rapid decline in the semiconductor industry that severely impacted our business 
new semiconductor plant construction and upgrades began to decline rapidly in the first quarter of due to industry wide over capacity and resulted in a decline in our microelectronics equipment sales 
in addition  sales of consumable products also declined  although to a lesser extent  as semiconductor fabrication plants focused on achieving manufacturing efficiencies and reducing materials costs 
net sales and net sales change over the years ended december   and  by geography  are summarized in the table below 
net sales in us dollars net sales by geographic region in millions as a percentage of net sales north america japan asia europe total net sales 
table of contents net sales change in us dollars net sales change in local currencies north america japan asia europe total net sales during as compared to  the japanese yen was essentially flat against the us dollar  while the south korean won  the singapore dollar and the euro strengthened by  and  respectively 
during as compared to  the japanese yen  the south korean won  the singapore dollar and the euro weakened against the us dollar by approximately   and  respectively 
gross profit margins 
gross profit margins were in  in and in the decrease in is primarily due to reductions in product demand and production volume resulting in lower overhead absorption 
we responded to this lower demand by further consolidating our manufacturing operations 
gross profit margins in reflected million of separation related charges to operations 
these charges included million of redundant facility and labor expenses in order to ensure a smooth transfer from millipore facilities into our new billerica facility  million of impairment charges associated with surplus manufacturing machinery which was ultimately sold  and net excess and obsolete inventory charges of million 
the gross profit margin decrease in over  was primarily the result of lower manufacturing volumes 
gross profit margins in reflected million of separation related  non recurring charges 
selling  general and administrative expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses decreased to million in from million in the decrease in from levels was attributable to results of the downsizing and restructuring programs initiated in  as well as a series of actions to reduce discretionary spending in response to the current industry downturn 
selling  general and administrative expenses in decreased in from million in as a result of the restructuring initiatives 
research and development expenses 
research and development expenses of million in were essentially flat from  which were million 
we intend to continue to fund key research and development programs despite the current business conditions 
research and development expenses decreased in from million in key elements of our and research and development expenses were related to the continued development of the next generation mm products in the area of copper electrochemical plating  chemical mechanical planarization and deep ultra violet photolithography applications 
additional investments were made to develop future generation of gas flow measurement and control products  chemical management technologies for advanced wafer clean applications  as well as devicenet enabled product lines 
during  we focused on novel technology development and licensing for advanced copper interconnect and photolithography applications 
additional investments were made to develop in house copper plating capability 
we also focused on photochemical dispense systems  which are specifically designed to address advanced deep ultra violet photolithography 
we believe that our customers will migrate toward the micron technology during the next upturn and that our new generation of high value added products resulting from these research and development investments are well positioned to respond to this trend 
restructuring and other charges 
our operating results in included a total of million of restructuring and other charges 
during the fourth quarter of  we recorded charges of million related to the decision to close our san clemente  ca manufacturing plant  severance costs of million  and additional facilities exit costs of million related to facilities that are closed in bedford  ma and swindon  england 

table of contents our operating results in included a total of million of restructuring and other charges 
during the first quarter of  we recorded restructuring and other charges of million in connection with our separation from millipore to improve our manufacturing asset utilization and resize our overall cost structure 
the restructuring and other charges included million of employee severance costs  a million write off of equipment and leasehold improvements and million of lease cancellation costs 
during the third quarter of  we recorded an additional restructuring charge of million in response to the prolonged duration and severity of the semiconductor industry downturn 
this restructuring charge included million of employee severance costs  a million write off of equipment and leasehold improvements  and million of exit costs on leased property 
other income expense  net 
in  other income expense  net includes foreign currency transaction exchange gains of million  interest income of million  royalty income from millipore of million and million other income 
in  other income expense  net includes foreign currency transaction exchange losses of million and a million loss on investments in owned entities accounted for under the equity method offset by interest income of million  royalty income from millipore of million and million other income 
in  other income expense  net included the million write off of investment holdings in a privately held us company offset by million in foreign currency transaction exchange gains and income of million on investments in owned entities accounted for under the equity method 
income tax expense 
prior to the distribution date  our operating results were included in millipore s consolidated us and state income tax returns and in tax returns of certain millipore foreign subsidiaries 
accordingly  income taxes were calculated on a separate return basis as if we filed tax returns separately from millipore 
at december   we had a million income tax receivable related to net operating loss carrybacks determined on a separate return basis 
in accordance with the tax sharing agreement  during  millipore decided not to allow us to carryback these net operating losses 
as a result  the receivable was transferred to millipore during and is reflected in the consolidated financial statements as a reduction to additional paid in capital included in shareholders equity 
millipore managed its consolidated tax position for the benefit of its entire portfolio of businesses  and its tax strategies were not necessarily reflective of the tax strategies that we would have followed as a stand alone company 
in  we recorded income tax expense of million on a pre tax loss of million 
the income tax expense includes settlements from foreign tax audits for which we are responsible under our tax sharing agreement with millipore and other income tax expense in our foreign operations 
in  we recorded income tax expense of million on a pre tax loss of million 
this expense is primarily attributable to the valuation allowance against foreign tax credits on unremitted earnings of our foreign subsidiaries of approximately million and other us deferred tax assets of approximately million 
statement of financial accounting standards sfas  accounting for income tax  requires that we establish a valuation allowance or reserve when  based on an evaluation of objective verifiable evidence  we believe there is a likelihood that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
in  we recorded a valuation allowance for the majority of these tax assets based on our assessment of historical pre tax income and the significant deterioration in our projected pre tax income for early future periods given the significant uncertainty surrounding the prolonged cyclical downturn in the semiconductor industry 
our valuation allowance against the deferred tax assets is based on our assessment of historical pre tax income and projected pre tax income for early future periods 
we are undertaking tax planning initiatives designed to generate future us taxable income 
as we generate future taxable income in the us against which these tax assets may be applied  some portion or all of the valuation allowance would be reversed and an increase in net income would consequently be reported in future years 
in addition  we continuously evaluate our tax position and our effective tax rate depending on changes in the geographic mix of our earnings and the continued development of our tax strategies 
in we recorded income tax expenses of million on pre tax income of million 

table of contents liquidity and capital resources our principal cash requirements have been to fund our operations and additions to property  plant and equipment in connection with our new billerica facility and our separation from millipore 
until our separation from millipore  effective march   millipore managed our overall capital requirements on a centralized basis including management of cash and debt 
millipore retained cash receipts associated with our business on a daily basis and provided funds to cover our disbursements 
accordingly  we have reported neither cash or cash equivalents nor debt at december  cash provided by operating activities was million during the year ended december   as compared to million during the year ended december  during  cash provided by operating activities resulted primarily from our decrease in inventory of million 
this increase to cash was offset by our net loss of million  after adjusting for the non cash charges of million for depreciation and amortization  million related to restructuring and other charges and million arising from impaired assets 
in  cash provided by operating activities resulted from a series of initiatives aimed at optimizing our working capital 
in the second half of  our gross inventory was reduced by million 
on a full year basis our gross inventory increased by million 
the collection of accounts receivable contributed million offset by the reduction in accounts payable of million and the change in other operating assets and liabilities of million 
our cash flows from operations reflected a net use of cash of million in the cash flows used in operations in was primarily attributed to growth in accounts receivable and inventory due to a significant sales volume increase that more than offset increased net income 
inventory levels increased due to stocking levels of new products and efforts to increase customer service levels through increased product availability 
cash flow used in investing activities consisted of capital expenditures for property  plant and equipment of million  million and million in the years ended december   and  respectively 
in and  cash flows used in investing activities were primarily for the construction and purchase of production and research and development equipment  and the transfer of manufacturing operations from millipore facilities pursuant to our separation agreement 
expenditures in were primarily on machinery and equipment in our manufacturing facilities to increase capacity to support increased demand for our products 
during  we expect to spend between million to million on capital expenditures primarily related to the purchase of manufacturing and research and development equipment 
cash flows provided by financing activities for the year ended december  were million and resulted from net transfers of million from millipore in accordance with our transition service agreements and separation from millipore and million generated by the issuance of  shares of common stock under our employee stock purchase and stock option plans 
this was offset by million in cash collateralization related to a security deposit under a new lease for our corporate headquarters  research and development and manufacturing facility and other security deposits 
at december   this cash collateral was invested in us federal agency securities and money market funds 
cash flows from financing activities of million for the year ended december  resulted from the receipt of million of net proceeds from the sale of our stock in our initial public offering and net transfers from millipore of million offset by the payment of a million separation note to millipore 
from april  through the consummation of our initial public offering in august  millipore provided a line of credit to us pursuant to a separation revolving credit agreement to support our cash requirements 
we borrowed million under this separation revolving credit agreement with millipore that was repaid from the proceeds of our initial public offering 
the amount of the separation note represented amounts determined by agreement between us and millipore to ensure that all net proceeds of our initial public offering in excess of million would be payable to millipore 
cash flows from financing activities for the year ended december  were million and resulted from capital contributions from millipore 
these cash transfers from millipore for the year ended december  reflect changes in the cash financing required to fund our capital expenditures and operating activities 

table of contents our liquidity is affected by many factors  some of which are based on the normal ongoing operations of our business and some of which arise from uncertainties related to global economies 
we believe that our cash and cash equivalents together with expected cash collections from existing trade receivables will be sufficient to satisfy our working capital  capital expenditure  restructuring and research and development requirements and other committments for the next twelve months 
we expect that our cash flow needs beyond this twelve month period will be satisfied through cash flow generated from operations 
if our cash flows from operations are less than we expect beyond this twelve month period  we may need to incur debt or issue additional equity 
also  we may need to incur debt or issue equity to make strategic acquisitions or investments 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain necessary financing on favorable terms or at all 
if we are unable to obtain necessary financing beyond this twelve month period  we may not have sufficient cash to operate our business 
under accounting principles generally accepted in the us  certain obligations and commitments are not required to be included in the consolidated balance sheet and statement of operations 
these obligations and commitments  while entered into in the normal course of business  may have a material impact on liquidity 
the following commitments as of december  have not been included in the consolidated balance sheet and statement of operations included under
