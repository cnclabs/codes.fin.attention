forestlands at december   international paper and its subsidiaries controlled about million acres of forestlands in the united states  million acres in brazil   acres in new zealand  and had  through licenses and forest management agreements  harvesting rights on governmentowned timberlands in canada and russia 
forestlands include owned property as well as certain timber harvesting rights with terms of one or more years  and are stated at cost  less cost of timber harvested 
costs attributable to timber are charged against income as trees are cut 
the rate charged is determined annually based on the relationship of incurred costs to estimated current volume 
cost of timber harvested coth is included in depreciation and amortization in the consolidated statement of earnings 
effective january   international paper prospectively changed its method of accounting for mid rotation fertilization expenditures to include such expenditures in the capitalized cost of timberlands 
accordingly  these costs have been subsequently included as part of the cost of timber harvested as trees are sold 
prior to this change  these expenditures were capitalized and amortized to expense over a five year period 
the change was made to better match the total costs of fiber to the related income when the trees are sold 
this accounting change had no effect on earnings for the year ended december   and the effects in future years will not be significant 
due to the cumulative nature of the coth computation  calculation of the cumulative effect of the accounting change on prior periods of including these costs as part of coth  and disclosure of pro forma amounts for prior years  are not determinable 
at december   the company s consolidated balance sheet included million of previously capitalized mid rotation fertilization costs that will continue to be amortized to expense through goodwill prior to  goodwill was amortized over its estimated period of benefit on a straight line basis  not to exceed years 
effective january   international paper adopted statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 eliminating the periodic charge to earnings for goodwill amortization for and future years 
in addition  as required by sfas no 
 an initial assessment of recorded goodwill for possible impairment was conducted as of january  annual testing for possible goodwill impairment will be performed in the third quarter of each year 
see note for additional disclosures related to sfas no 
impairment of long lived assets long lived assets are reviewed for impairment upon the occurrence of events or changes in circumstances that indicate that the carrying value of the assets may not be recoverable  as measured by comparing their net book value to the estimated future cash flows generated by their use 
impaired assets are recorded at fair market value  determined principally using discounted future cash flows 
income taxes international paper uses the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes whereby deferred income taxes are recorded for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are revalued to reflect new tax rates in the periods rate changes are enacted

note earnings per common share earnings loss per common share before extraordinary items and cumulative effect of accounting changes are computed by dividing earnings loss before extraordinary items and cumulative effect of accounting changes by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding 
earnings loss per common share before extraordinary items and cumulative effect of accounting changes  assuming dilution  were computed assuming that all potentially dilutive securities  including in the money stock options  were converted into common shares at the beginning of each year 
a reconciliation of the amounts included in the computation of earnings loss per common share before extraordinary items and cumulative effect of accounting changes  and earnings loss per common share before extraordinary items and cumulative effect of accounting changes  assuming dilution  is as follows in millions  except per share amounts earnings loss before extraordinary items and cumulative effect of accounting changes  effect of dilutive securities earnings loss before extraordinary items and cumulative effect of accounting changes assuming dilution  average common shares outstanding effect of dilutive securities long term incentive plan deferred compensation stock options average common shares outstanding assuming dilution earnings loss per common share before extraordinary items and cumulative effect of accounting changes earnings loss per common share before extraordinary items and cumulative effect of accounting changes assuming dilution note if an amount does not appear in the above table  the security was antidilutive for the period presented

note industry segment information financial information by industry segment and geographic area for  and is presented on pages and note recent accounting developments costs associated with exit or disposal activities in june  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities 
the statement changes the measurement and timing of recognition for exit costs  including restructuring charges  and is effective for any such activities initiated after december  it requires that a liability for costs associated with an exit or disposal activity  such as one time termination benefits  be recognized when the liability is incurred  rather than at the date of a company s commitment to an exit plan 
it has no effect on charges recorded for exit activities begun prior to december  this standard  which international paper will adopt in  will not have a material effect on the company s consolidated financial position or results of operations 
impairment and disposal of long lived assets in october  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
it establishes a single accounting model for the impairment of long lived assets to be held and used or to be disposed of by sale or abandonment  and broadens the definition of discontinued operations 
international paper adopted sfas no 
in  with no significant change in the accounting for the impairment and disposal of long lived assets 
asset retirement obligations in august  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for asset retirement obligations  which is effective in it requires the recording of an asset and a liability equal to the present value of the estimated costs associated with the retirement of long lived assets where a legal or contractual obligation exists 
the asset is required to be depreciated over the life of the related equipment or facility  and the liability accreted each year based on a present value interest rate 
this standard  which international paper will adopt in  will not have a material effect on the company s consolidated financial position or results of operations 
goodwill in june  the fasb issued sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
it changed the accounting for goodwill by eliminating goodwill amortization beginning in it also requires at least an annual assessment of recorded goodwill for impairment 
the initial test for impairment had to be completed by december   with any impairment charge recorded as the cumulative effect of an accounting change to be retroactively reflected in the first quarter of any subsequent impairment charges would be recorded in operating results 
the initial test compared the fair value of each of international paper s business reporting units having recorded goodwill balances with the business unit s carrying amount 
fair value was determined using discounted projected future operating cash flows for all business reporting units except chh  where the average quoted market price for chh shares was used 
where the carrying amount exceeded fair value  additional testing was performed for possible goodwill impairment 
the fair value for these business reporting units was then allocated to individual assets and liabilities  using a depreciated replacement cost approach for fixed assets  and outside appraised values for intangible assets 
any excess of fair value over the allocated amounts was equal to the implied fair value of goodwill 
where this implied goodwill value was less than the goodwill book value  an impairment charge was recorded 
based on testing completed in the fourth quarter of  a transitional goodwill impairment loss was recorded for the industrial and consumer packaging  chh and printing papers business segments totaling billion 
this charge had no impact on cash flow 
goodwill arising from major acquisitions that involve multiple business segments is classified as a corporate asset for segment reporting purposes  while goodwill relating to a single business reporting unit is included as an asset of the applicable segment 
for goodwill impairment testing  all goodwill was allocated to business segments 
the following table presents changes in the goodwill balances as allocated to each business segment for the year ended december  balance transitional balance january  impairment december  in millions loss other printing papers   industrial and consumer packaging   distribution forest products carter holt harvey a corporate total    a excludes a million credit to minority interest expense

and the cumulative effect of adopting sfas no 
was a million charge to net earnings before taxes and minority interest million after taxes and minority interest  and a net decrease of million after taxes in oci 
the charge to net earnings primarily resulted from recording the fair value of certain interest rate swaps  which do not qualify under the new rules for hedge accounting treatment 
the decrease in oci primarily resulted from adjusting the foreign currency contracts used as hedges of net investments in foreign operations to fair value

international paper entered into an agreement in to guarantee  for a fee  an unsecured contractual credit agreement of an unrelated third party customer 
the guarantee  which expires in  was made in exchange for a ten year contract as the exclusive paper supplier to the customer 
both the loan to the customer and the guarantee are unsecured

the maximum amount of potential future payments is million in principal plus any accrued but unpaid interest 
there is no liability recorded on international paper s books for the guarantee 
in connection with sales of businesses  property  equipment  forestlands  and other assets  international paper commonly makes representations and warranties relating to such businesses or assets  and may enter into standard commercial indemnification arrangements with respect to tax and environmental liabilities and other matters 
where any liabilities for such matters are probable and subject to reasonable estimation  accrued liabilities are recorded at the time of sale as a cost of the transaction 
international paper believes that possible future unrecorded liabilities for these matters  if any  would not have a material adverse effect on its consolidated financial position or results of operations 
exterior siding and roofing litigation three nationwide class action lawsuits relating to exterior siding and roofing products manufactured by masonite that were filed against international paper have been settled in recent years 
the first suit  entitled judy naef v 
masonite and international paper  was filed in december hardboard lawsuit 
the plaintiffs alleged that hardboard siding manufactured by masonite fails prematurely  allowing moisture intrusion that in turn causes damage to the structure underneath the siding 
the class consisted of all us property owners having masonite hardboard siding installed on and incorporated into buildings between january  and january  the court granted final approval of the settlement on january  the settlement provides for monetary compensation to class members meeting the settlement requirements on a claims made basis  which requires a class member to individually submit proof of damage to  or caused by  masonite product  proof of square footage involved  and proofs of various other matters in order to qualify for payment with respect to a claim 
it also provides for the payment of attorneys fees equaling of the settlement amounts paid to class members  with a non refundable advance of million plus million in costs 
for siding that was installed between january  and december   claims must be made by january   and for siding installed between january  through january   claims must be made by january  the second suit  entitled cosby  et 
al 
v 
masonite corporation  et 
al  was filed in omniwood lawsuit 
the plaintiffs made allegations with regard to omniwood siding manufactured by masonite which were similar to those alleged in the hardboard lawsuit 
the class consisted of all us property owners having omniwood siding installed on and incorporated into buildings from january  to january  the settlement relating to the omniwood lawsuit provides that qualified claims must be made by january  for omniwood siding that was installed between january  and january  the third lawsuit  entitled smith  et 
al 
v 
masonite corporation  et 
al  was filed in woodruf lawsuit 
the plaintiffs alleged that woodruf roofing manufactured by masonite is defective and causes damage to the structure underneath the roofing 
the class consisted of all us property owners who had incorporated and installed masonite woodruf roofing from january  to january  the settlement relating to the woodruf lawsuit provides that for product installed between january  and december   claims must be made by january   and for product installed between january  and january   claims must be made by january  the court granted final approval of the settlements of the omniwood and woodruf lawsuits on january  the settlements provide for monetary compensation to class members meeting the settlement requirements on a claims made basis  which requires a class member to individually submit proof of damage to  or caused by  masonite product  proof of square footage involved  and proofs of various other matters 
the settlements also provide for payment of attorneys fees equaling of the settlement amounts paid to class members with a non refundable advance of million plus  in costs for each of the two cases 
claim filing and determination once a claim is determined to be valid under the respective settlement agreement covering the claim  the amount of the claim is determined by reference to a negotiated compensation formula established under the settlement agreement designed to compensate the homeowner for all damage to the structure 
the compensation formula is based on the average cost per square foot for product replacement  including material and labor as calculated by industry standards  in the area in which the structure is located  adjusted for inflation  or the cost of appropriate refinishing as determined by industry standards in such area  adjusted for inflation 
persons receiving compensation pursuant to this formula also agree to release international paper and masonite from all other property damage claims relating to the product in question 
in connection with the products involved in the lawsuits described above  where there is damage  the process of degradation  once begun  continues until repairs are made 
international paper estimates that approximately million structures have installed products that are the subject of the hardboard lawsuit   structures have installed products that are subject to the omniwood lawsuit and  structures have installed products that are the subject of the woodruf lawsuit 
masonite stopped selling the hardboard siding in may  the products involved in the woodruf lawsuit in may  and the products involved in the omniwood lawsuit in september persons who are class members under the hardboard  omniwood and woodruf lawsuits who do not pursue remedies under the respective settlement agreement pertaining to such suits  may have recourse to warranties  if any  in existence at the expiration of the respective terms established under the settlement agreements for making claims 
the warranty period generally extends for years following the installation of the product in question and  although the warranties vary from product to product  they generally provide for a payment of up to two times the purchase price 
reserve analysis the following table presents an analysis of the net reserve activity related to the hardboard  omniwood and woodruf lawsuits for the years ended december   and hard omni in millions board wood woodruf total balance  december  additional provision payments financial collar reimbursement other balance  december  additional provision payments financial collar reimbursement other balance  december  additional provision payments insurance collections balance  december  additional provisions during the third quarter of  a determination was made that an additional million provision was required to cover an expected shortfall in the reserves  resulting primarily from a higher than anticipated number of claims relating to the hardboard lawsuit 
this increase was based on an independent third party statistical study of future costs  which analyzed trends in the claims experience through may  this amount was based on a statistical outcome that assumed that the claims rate a doubles in one state for one additional year  levels off for two years  and then declines by per year  b remains level in another state for two years and then declines by per year  and c in all other areas  declines by per year 
the statistical model used to develop this outcome also included assumptions on the expected geographic patterns of claims and assumptions related to the cost of claims  including forecasts relating to the rate of inflation 
average claim costs were calculated from historical claims records  taking into consideration structure type  location and source of the claim 
in the third quarter of  a determination was made that an additional provision would be required to cover an expected shortfall in the reserves that had arisen since the third quarter of due to actual claims experience exceeding projections 
an additional million was added to the existing reserve balance at that time 
this increase was based on an independent third party statistical study of future costs  which analyzed trends in the claims experience through august  the amount was based on a statistical outcome that assumed that hardboard claims growth continued through mid  then declined by per year 
omniwood claims growth was assumed to continue through mid  decline by in and thereafter increase at the rate of per year 
woodruf claims were assumed to decline at a rate of per year 
unit costs per claim were assumed to hold at the level 
the statistical model used to develop this outcome also included assumptions on the geographic patterns of claims rates and assumptions related to the cost of claims  including forecasts relating to the rate of inflation 
average claim costs were calculated from historical claims records  taking into consideration structure type  location and source of the claim 
during  tracking of the actual versus projected number of claims filed and average cost per claim indicated that  although total claims costs were approximately equal to projected amounts  the number of claims filed was higher than projected  offsetting the effect of lower average claims payment amounts 
accordingly  updated projections were developed by two independent consultants utilizing the most current claims experience data 
principal assumptions used in the development of these projections were that the number of hardboard claims filed  which account for approximately of all claims costs  would average slightly above current levels until january  then would decline by about in and remain flat 
average claims costs were assumed to continue to decline at the rate experienced during the last twelve months 
while management believes that the assumptions used in developing these outcomes represent the most probable scenario  factors which could cause actual results to vary from these assumptions include area specific assumptions as to growth in claims rates could be incorrect  locations where previously there had been little or no claims could emerge as significant geographic locations  and the cost per claim could vary materially from that projected 
the first consultant provided two statistical outcomes  with the higher outcome indicating a required provision of approximately million 
the second consultant provided a range of possible outcomes  with the most probable outcome indicating a required provision of approximately million 
the estimate ranged from a low a probability that future charges would exceed this amount of million to a high a probability that future charges would exceed this amount of million 
using these projections  management determined that a provision of million should be recorded in the fourth quarter of as an estimate of the most probable outcome based on the consultants projections

of claims dismissed december  insurance matters in november  international paper and masonite commenced a lawsuit in the superior court of the state of california against certain of their insurance carriers because of their refusal to indemnify international paper and masonite for the settlement relating to the hardboard lawsuit and the refusal of one insurer  employer s insurance of wausau  to provide a defense of that lawsuit 
during the fall of  a trial of masonite s claim that wausau breached its duty to defend was conducted in a state court in california 
the jury found that wausau had breached its duty to defend masonite and awarded masonite million for its expense to defend the hardboard lawsuit  an additional million in attorneys fees and interest for masonite s expense to prosecute the duty to defend its case against wausau based on a finding that wausau had acted in bad faith  and an additional million in punitive damages 
in a post trial proceeding  the court awarded an additional million in attorneys fees based on the finding that wausau had acted in bad faith 
as of december   all post trial motions brought by wausau seeking to upset the jury verdict have been denied but no judgment has been entered by the court 
masonite has agreed to pay amounts equal to the proceeds of its bad faith and punitive damage award to international paper and has assigned its breach of contract claim against wausau to international paper 
the trial court has scheduled the trial of the claims for indemnification to begin on april  because of the uncertainties inherent in the litigation  international paper is unable to estimate the amount that it will recover against those insurance carriers 
however  as of december   international paper had received million  and had signed a settlement agreement with one of its insurers that provides  subject to a contingency in the agreement  for the payment to international paper of an additional million 
under a financial collar arrangement  international paper contracted with a third party for payment in an amount up to million for certain costs relating to the hardboard lawsuit if payments by international paper with respect thereto exceeded million 
the arrangement with the third party is in excess of insurance otherwise available to international paper  which is the subject of the separate litigation referred to above 
accordingly  international paper believes that the obligation of the third party with respect to this financial collar does not constitute other valid and collectible insurance that would either eliminate or otherwise affect its right to collect insurance coverage available to it and masonite under the insurance policies  which are the subject of this separate litigation 
at december   international paper had received the million 
a dispute between international paper and the third party  concerning a number of issues  including the timing of international paper s obligation to repay the third party  is the subject of an arbitration commenced in by the third party in london  england 
summary while international paper believes that the reserve balances established for these matters are adequate  and that additional amounts will be recovered from its insurance carriers in the future relating to these claims  international paper is unable to estimate at this time the amount of additional charges  if any  that may be required for these matters in the future 
international paper is also involved in various other inquiries  administrative proceedings and litigation relating to contracts  sales of property  environmental protection  tax  antitrust  personal injury and other matters  some of which allege substantial monetary damages 
while any proceeding or litigation has the element of uncertainty  international paper believes that the outcome of any of the other lawsuits or claims that are pending or threatened  or all of them combined  including the preceding class action settlements  will not have a material adverse effect on its consolidated financial position or results of operations

note derivatives and hedging activities international paper periodically uses derivatives and other financial instruments to hedge exposures to interest rate  commodity and currency risks 
for hedges that meet the criteria under sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  international paper  at inception  formally designates and documents the instrument as a hedge of a specific underlying exposure  as well as the risk management objective and strategy for undertaking each hedge transaction 
because of the high degree of effectiveness between the hedging instrument and the underlying exposure being hedged  fluctuations in the value of the derivative instruments are generally offset by changes in the value or cash flows of the underlying exposures being hedged 
derivatives are recorded in the consolidated balance sheet at fair value  determined using available market information or other appropriate valuation methodologies  in other current or noncurrent assets or liabilities 
the earnings impact resulting from the change in fair value of the derivative instruments is recorded in the same line item in the consolidated statement of earnings as the underlying exposure being hedged 
the financial instruments that are used in hedging transactions are assessed both at inception and quarterly thereafter to ensure they are effective in offsetting changes in either the fair value or cash flows of the related underlying exposures 
the ineffective portion of a financial instrument s change in fair value  if any  would be recognized currently in earnings together with the changes in fair value of derivatives not designated as hedges 
interest rate risk interest rate swaps may be used to manage interest rate risks associated with international paper s debt 
some of these instruments qualify for hedge accounting in accordance with sfas no 
and others do not 
interest rate swap agreements with a total notional amount of approximately billion and maturities ranging from one to years do not qualify as hedges under sfas no 
and  consequently  were recorded at fair value on the transition date by a pre tax charge of approximately million to earnings 
for the year ended december   the change in fair value of the swaps was immaterial  and is not expected to have a material impact on earnings in the future  although some volatility in a quarter is possible due to unforeseen market conditions 
the remainder of international paper s interest rate swap agreements qualify as fully effective fair value hedges under sfas no 
at december  and  outstanding notional amounts for its interest rate swap fair value hedges amounted to billion and billion  respectively 
the fair values of these swaps were a net asset of approximately million at december  and a net liability of million at december  in november  interest rate swaps with a notional value of million were terminated in connection with the early retirement of international paper s billion notes due in july the resulting gain of approximately million is included in restructuring and other charges in the accompanying consolidated statement of earnings see note 
during  international paper entered into agreements to fix interest rates on an anticipated billion issuance of debt 
upon issuance of the debt in the fourth quarter of  these agreements generated a pre tax loss of million that was recorded in oci 
this amount is being amortized to interest expense over the term of the bonds through october   yielding an effective interest rate of 
commodity risk to minimize volatility in earnings due to large fluctuations in the price of commodities  international paper currently uses swap and option contracts to manage risks associated with market fluctuations in energy prices 
such cash flow hedges with maturities of months or less are accounted for by deferring the after tax quarterly change in fair value of the outstanding contracts in oci 
on the date a contract matures  the gain or loss is reclassified into cost of products sold concurrently with the recognition of the commodity purchased 
for the year ended december   international paper reclassified after tax losses of million from oci 
this amount represents the after tax cash settlements on the maturing energy hedge contracts 
unrealized after tax gains of million were recorded to oci during the year ended december  after tax gains of million as of december  are expected to be reclassified into earnings in the net fair value of the energy hedge contracts as of december  is an million asset 
foreign currency risk international paper s policy has been to hedge certain investments in foreign operations with borrowings denominated in the same currency as the operation s functional currency or by entering into long term cross currency and interest rate swaps  or short term foreign exchange contracts 
these financial instruments are effective as a hedge against fluctuations in currency exchange rates 
gains or losses from changes in the fair value of these instruments  which are offset in whole or in part by translation gains and losses on the foreign operation s net assets hedged  are recorded as translation adjustments in oci 
upon liquidation or sale of the foreign investments  the accumulated gains or losses from the revaluation of the hedging instruments  together with the translation gains and losses on the net assets  are included in earnings 
for the year ended december   net losses included in oci on derivative and debt instruments hedging foreign net investments amounted to million after taxes and minority interest 
long term cross currency and interest rate swaps and short term currency swaps are used to mitigate the risk associated with changes in foreign exchange rates  which will affect the fair value of debt denominated in a foreign currency 
these hedges existing as of december   totaling a net fair value liability of million have not been designated as hedges pursuant to sfas no 
the impact on earnings from changes in the derivative values is substantially offset by the earnings impact from remeasuring the foreign currency debt each period 
foreign exchange contracts including forward  swap and purchase option contracts are also used to hedge certain transactions  primarily trade receipts and payments denominated in foreign currencies  to manage volatility associated with these transactions and to protect international paper from currency fluctuations between the contract date and ultimate settlement 
these contracts  most of which have been designated as cash flow hedges  had maturities of five years or less as of december  for the year ended december   net unrealized gains totaling million after taxes and minority interest were recorded in oci  net of million income after taxes and minority interest reclassified to earnings 
as of december   gains of million after taxes and minority interest are expected to be reclassified to earnings in other contracts are used to offset the earnings impact relating to the variability in exchange rates on certain short term monetary assets and liabilities denominated in nonfunctional currencies and are not designated as hedges 
changes in the fair value of these instruments  recognized currently in earnings to offset the remeasurement of the related assets and liabilities  were not significant 
international paper does not hold or issue financial instruments for trading purposes 
the counterparties to swap agreements and foreign exchange contracts consist of a number of major international financial institutions 
international paper continually monitors its positions with and the credit quality of these financial institutions and does not expect nonperformance by the counterparties 
note capital stock the authorized capital stock at both december  and consisted of  shares of common stock  par value   shares of cumulative preferred stock  without par value stated value per share  and  shares of serial preferred stock  par value 
the serial preferred stock is issuable in one or more series by the board of directors without further shareholder action 
note retirement plans international paper maintains pension plans that provide retirement benefits to substantially all employees 
employees generally are eligible to participate in the plans upon completion of one year of service and attainment of age the plans provide defined benefits based on years of credited service and either final average earnings salaried employees  hourly job rates or specified benefit rates hourly and union employees 
us defined benefit plans international paper makes contributions that are sufficient to fully fund its actuarially determined costs  generally equal to the minimum amounts required by the employee retirement income security act erisa 
net periodic pension income service cost is the actuarial present value of benefits attributed by the plans benefit formula to services rendered by employees during the year 
interest cost represents the increase in the projected benefit obligation  which is a discounted amount  due to the passage of time 
the expected return on plan assets reflects the computed amount of current year earnings from the investment of plan assets using an estimated long term rate of return 
net periodic pension income for qualified and nonqualified defined benefit plans comprised the following in millions service cost interest cost expected return on plan assets amortization of net transition obligation actuarial loss amortization of prior service cost curtailment loss settlement gain net periodic pension income a a excludes million and million of expense in and  respectively  for curtailment and settlement charges relating to divestitures that were recorded in restructuring and other charges and net gains losses on sales and impairments of businesses held for sale in the consolidated statement of earnings 
the decrease in us pension income was principally due to a reduction in the expected long term rate of return on plan assets to for from for  with smaller impacts from a reduction in the assumed discount rate to for from for  and a reduction in the assumed rate of future compensation increase to in from in the increase in pension income in was primarily due to the inclusion of the return on champion plan assets added to the plans after the acquisition date 
international paper evaluates its actuarial assumptions on an annual basis and considers changes in these long term factors based upon market conditions and the requirements of sfas no 
 employers accounting for pensions 
weighted average assumptions as of december   and were as follows in millions discount rate expected long term return on plan assets rate of compensation increase to calculate pension expense for  the company will use a discount rate of  an expected long term rate of return on plan assets of and a rate of compensation increase 
as a result of these assumption changes  the company estimates that it will record net pension expense of approximately million for its us defined benefit plans in the following illustrates the effect on pension expense for of a basis point decrease in these assumptions in millions expense income discount rate expected long term return on plan assets rate of compensation increase minimum pension liability adjustment at december   a prepaid pension cost asset of approximately billion related to international paper s qualified pension plan was included in deferred charges and other assets in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet 
at december   the market value of plan assets was less than the accumulated benefit obligation abo for this plan 
in accordance with the requirements of sfas no 
 the prepaid asset of approximately billion at december  was written off  and a net minimum liability of million was established equal to the shortfall of the market value of plan assets below the abo  resulting in an after tax direct charge to common shareholders equity of billion  with no impact on earnings  earnings per share or cash 
this reduction had no adverse affect on international paper s debt covenants 
unrecognized actuarial losses sfas no 
provides for delayed recognition of actuarial gains and losses  including amounts arising from changes in the estimated projected plan benefit obligation due to changes in the assumed discount rate  differences between the actual and expected return on plan assets  and other assumption changes 
these net gains and losses are recognized prospectively over a period that approximates the average remaining service period of active employees expected to receive benefits under the plans approximately years to the extent that they are not offset by gains and losses in subsequent years 
unrecognized actuarial losses in the table below increased during to approximately billion due principally to the decline in the fair value of plan assets and lower discount rates 
unless offset by the future unrecognized gains from higher discount rates or higher than projected returns on plan assets in future years  the amortization of these unrecognized losses will increase pension expense by approximately million per year for each of the next three years 
included in the following table are the changes in benefit obligation  and plan assets for and and the plans funded status and amounts recognized in the consolidated balance sheet as of december  and the benefit obligation as of december  increased by million  principally as a result of a decrease in the discount rate used in computing the estimated benefit obligation
