ebitda is not a recognized measure under canadian or united states generally accepted accounting principles gaap 
management believes that in addition to net earnings  ebitda is a useful supplemental measure as it provides investors with an indication of earnings from operations prior to debt service  amortization and income taxes 
investors should be cautioned however  that ebitda should not be construed as an alternative to net earnings determined in accordance with gaap as an indicator of the company s performance or to cash flows from operating  investing and financing activities as a measure of liquidity and cash flows 
the company s method of calculating ebitda may differ from other companies and  accordingly  ebitda may not be comparable to measures used by other companies

business outlook the natural and organic foods industries in the north american market are currently estimated to be in excess of billion  with a large number of companies competing in specific segments of the market 
however  there are relatively few companies well positioned to take advantage of this rapidly growing market  currently estimated to be growing at to annually 
the food group s vertically integrated business model coupled with its growth strategy based on a combination of internal growth and acquisitions  has positioned the company as a leader in the north american natural and organic foods market 
stake technology ltd 
december  k the company plans to continue to exercise this growth strategy in the future 
based on current market projections and annualized results of the acquisitions completed in  the company expects revenues in  excluding additional potential acquisitions  to be approximately  a increase over in addition  the company s business plan includes strategies and initiatives designed to improve the underlying performance of the operations and to improve the quality of earnings 
specifically  the company is looking to improve the strategic synergies across its food group operations  vertically integrating wherever possible 
initiatives to improve the productivity of the operations include continued training and development of employees  consolidated procurement and internal services programs  improved information systems to provide better analysis and timely decision making and plant rationalization programs 
the company expects to continue its rapid growth through an effective balance of internal growth and acquisitions  all in support of its vertically integrated field to table strategy 
growth will be financed by internally generated cash resources and a combination of debt and equity financing  as required  maintaining a target debt to equity ratio of to the company will continue to devote significant effort to increase returns on capital by improving its investment in working capital and capital projects with increased accountability and measurement 
as previously stated  the company will continue to pursue strategic alternatives for its non core operations  the environmental industrial group and the steam explosion technology group 
however  the company will only divest itself of these operations if and when a strategy that is beneficial to the shareholders of stake technology ltd 
is identified 
in  the environmental industrial group provided approximately of the company s consolidated revenues and net earnings of  based on current market projections  the company anticipates the group s results in will improve upon results 
the steam explosion technology group continues to focus on selling the steam explosion technology to the china market and is also pursuing a number of potential food applications 
the outlook for the group for is uncertain due to the time and effort required to complete the signing of each contract 
risks and uncertainties the common shares of the company are speculative in nature and involve a high degree of risk 
accordingly  in analyzing an investment in these securities  prospective investors should carefully consider the following risk factors  together with all of the other information appearing  or incorporated by reference  in this document  in light of his or her particular financial circumstances and or investment objectives 
future capital needs certain of the company s operations operate at  or near  capacity 
continued growth in these operations is reliant upon the company s ability to increase capacity through internal capital projects or acquisition 
the company s ability to raise capital  through equity and or debt financing  is directly related to its ability to continue to grow and improve returns from operations 
additional capital through equity financing may also result in additional dilution to the company s shareholders 
competition the company carries on its businesses in competition with companies and individuals with financial resources and staffs larger than the company s and the company is  therefore  subject to competitive factors over which it has little control or can otherwise affect 
product liability claims the company s food group operates in a highly sterilized environment 
however  the sourcing  processing  testing and sale of food products entail an inherent risk of allegations of product liability  and there can be no assurance that product liability claims will not be asserted against the company 
while the company currently has product liability insurance coverage  it will be required to expand such coverage as new products are introduced into the market and or additional capacity is added 
the availability of such insurance coverage in the future at cost effective prices may have a negative impact on results 
furthermore  there can be no assurance that such insurance coverage will be adequate  or that a product liability claim  even one without merit  would not materially and adversely affect the company s operations or financial condition 
technological innovation and protection of intellectual property and proprietary rights competitors include major chemical companies  other food ingredient companies and consumer food companies that also engage in the development and sale of food ingredients 
many of these companies are engaged in the stake technology ltd 
december  k development of texturizers and other food ingredients and have introduced a number of texturizers into the market 
there can be no assurance that existing products or products under development by our competitors will not prove to be more effective or less costly than any products which have been or are being developed by us 
the company and particularly the food group and steam technology group depend in part  on their ability to protect intellectual property rights 
we rely primarily on patent  copyright  trademark and trade secret laws to protect our proprietary technologies 
we cannot be sure that such measures will provide meaningful protection for our proprietary technologies and processes 
the failure of any patents to provide protection to our technology would make it easier for our competitors to offer similar products 
governmental regulation and policies the company and its subsidiaries are  and are expected to continue to be  subject to substantial federal  state  provincial and local environmental regulation 
these regulations exist in virtually all the company s operational business locations throughout north america and can present delays and costs that can adversely affect business development 
any changes to current regulations may impact the development  manufacturing and marketing of the company s products  and may have a negative impact on future results 
stake s steam explosion technology group the steam explosion technology group has yet to gain wide acceptance within the industry and consequently earnings can fluctuate from quarter to quarter 
its patented steam technology  while proven  has yet to develop a firm customer base 
the success of this division will depend upon its ability to promote commercial acceptance of the staketech system 
lack of dividends  dividend restrictions stake has never paid dividends on its common shares and does not contemplate paying cash dividends in the foreseeable future 
moreover  stake is precluded under the terms of various agreements with its creditors from paying dividends until the related indebtedness has been satisfied 
it is the company s intention to retain future earnings to fund growth 
accordingly  investors will not receive a return on investment in stake common shares through the payment of dividends in the foreseeable future and may not realize a return on investment even if they sell their shares 
any future payment of dividends to stake security holders will depend on decisions that will be made by the board of directors and will depend on then existing conditions  including the company s financial condition  contractual restrictions  capital requirements and business prospects 
the receipt of cash dividends by united states shareholders from a canadian corporation  such as stake  is subject to a canadian withholding tax 
customer concentration a portion of the company s revenues in the food group are derived from a relatively low number of customers 
although the company has a good working relationship with these customers  the loss of one of these customers would have a negative impact on the results of the company 
the company plans to continue to mitigate this risk going forward by broadening its customer base and product offering 
integration of acquired companies the company s growth strategy inherently asserts that acquisitions will be integrated successfully 
however  the company s ability to integrate current and future acquisitions will have a direct impact on the company s future results 
failure to integrate acquisitions in a timely and efficient manner may have a negative impact on the future results of the company 
item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk the primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve principal and limit risk 
to achieve this objective  the company maintains its portfolio in a variety of securities  including both government and corporate obligations and money market funds 
these securities are generally classified as cash and cash equivalents or short term investments and are recorded on the balance sheet at fair value with unrealized gains or losses reported through profit and loss 
stake technology ltd 
december  k debt in both fixed rate and floating rate interest carry different types of interest rate risk 
fixed rate debt may have their fair market value adversely affected by a decline in interest rates 
in general  longer date debts are subject to greater interest rate risk than shorter dated securities 
floating rate term debt gives less predictability to cash flows as interest rates change 
as at december   the weighted average interest rate of the fixed rate term debt was and  of the company s outstanding term debt is at fixed interest rates 
variable rate term debt of  at an interest rate of is partially hedged by variable rate cash equivalent investments 
the company s looks at varying factors to determine the percentage of debt to hold at fixed rates including  the interest rate spread between variable and fixed swap rates  the company s view on interest rate trends  the percent of offset to variable rate debt through holding variable rate investments and the companies ability to manage with interest rate volatility and uncertainty 
foreign currency risk all us subsidiaries use the us dollar as their functional currency and as of january  the united states dollar has become the company s reporting currency 
the subsidiaries are subject to risks typical of multi jurisdiction businesses  including  but not limited to differing economic conditions  changes in political climate  differing tax structures  other regulations and restrictions  and foreign exchange rate volatility 
accordingly  the company s future results could be materially adversely affected by changes in these or other factors 
the company is exposed to foreign exchange rate fluctuations as the financial results of stake s canadian corporate office and its canadian subsidiaries are translated into us dollars on consolidation 
a movement in the levels of foreign currency exchange rates in favour of against the canadian dollar with all other variables held constant would result in a decrease increase in the fair value of the company s net assets by  the environmental group has canadian based receivables and payables that on a net basis provide limited exchange exposure 
the canadian organic food group has exposure of us dollars as its us payables are greater than us receivables 
us based food operations have no exposure to other currencies since almost all sales and purchases are made in us dollars 
it is the company s intention to hold excess funds in the currency in which the funds are likely to be used  which will from time to time  potentially expose the company to exchange rate fluctuations when converted into us dollars 
commodity risk the food group enters into exchange traded commodity futures and options contracts to hedge its exposure to price fluctuations on grain transactions to the extent considered practicable for minimizing risk from market price fluctuations 
futures contracts used for hedging purposes are purchased and sold through regulated commodity exchanges 
inventories  however  may not be completely hedged  due in part to the company s assessment of its exposure from expected price fluctuations 
exchange purchase and sales contracts may expose the company to risk in the event that a counter party to a transaction is unable to fulfill its contractual obligation 
the company manages its risk by entering into purchase contracts with pre approved producers 
the company has a risk of loss from hedge activity if a grower does not deliver the grain as scheduled 
sales contracts are entered into with organizations of acceptable creditworthiness  as internally evaluated 
all futures transactions are marked to market 
gains and losses on futures transactions related to grain inventories are included in cost of goods sold 
as at december   the quantity of grain not hedged is not significant and therefore a change in the market price would not have a material impact 
there are no futures contracts in the other food group segments  environmental industrial group  the steam explosion technology group or related to corporate office activities
