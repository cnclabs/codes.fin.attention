overview we manufacture  market and distribute charles colvard created moissanite jewels also called moissanite for sale in the worldwide jewelry market 
moissanite  also known by its chemical name  silicon carbide sic  is a rare  naturally occurring mineral found primarily in meteorites 
as the sole manufacturer of scientifically made moissanite jewels  our strategy is to create a unique brand image which positions moissanite as a jewel in its own right  distinct from all other jewels based on its fire  brilliance  luster  durability and rarity 
from our inception in june through june   we were a development stage enterprise  devoting our resources to fund research and development of colorless  scientifically made moissanite jewels 
we began shipping moissanite to domestic retail jewelers and international distributors during the second quarter of during the second quarter of  we changed our domestic distribution model to sell through jewel distributors and jewelry manufacturers rather than directly to retail stores 
in march  we entered into distribution agreements with stuller settings  inc stuller and rio grande  two of the largest suppliers of jewelry related products to the jewelry industry  for the north american distribution of moissanite 
we have also entered into several agreements with domestic jewelry manufacturers  including k g creations  which is currently our largest customer 
through these agreements with stuller  rio grande and jewelry manufacturers and the brand awareness created by our marketing program  we sought to rapidly increase the introduction of moissanite into the domestic jewelry market while maintaining average selling prices 
although these new distribution and marketing strategies enabled us to achieve profitability and positive cash flow in and  we have no assurance that they will be successful in the long term 
in october  we established a wholly owned subsidiary in hong kong  charles colvard hk ltd  for the purpose of gaining better access to the important far eastern markets 
the importance of having a presence in this market is twofold  hong kong is the headquarters city for a very large number of jewelry manufacturing companies with sales and distribution worldwide  and hong kong is the gateway to the markets of mainland china 
in  we dramatically cut marketing and sales expenses  primarily by discontinuing significant advertising and promotion expenses in favor of lower cost public relations and media editorial initiatives 
additionally  we lowered general and administrative costs through personnel reductions  and we realized significant savings by suspending all research and development efforts with cree 
domestic sales accounted for of total sales in as we concentrated on growing our domestic business 
domestic distribution of moissanite expanded in into additional retail stores  including our first retail jewelry chain 
catalog sales of moissanite jewelry expanded significantly 
we demonstrated that with appropriate product mix and product positioning  home shopping channels were a viable distribution channel for jewelry featuring moissanite 
primarily as a result of these efforts  we became profitable and generated positive cash flow from operations in during  we continued our focus on the domestic market  while investing limited resources in certain international markets that show the most potential 
our sales were higher than sales in with sustained profitability and positive cash flow 
we are hopeful that our sales will continue to increase as the distribution of moissanite jewels expands both domestically and internationally 
although our goals are to continue achieving increases in sales and to sustain profitability  we cannot be sure that either goal will be achieved 
results of operations year ended december  compared with year ended december  net sales were  for the year ended december  compared to  for the year ended december   an increase of  or 
shipments of moissanite jewels increased in to approximately  carats from  carats in domestic carat shipments  which represented of total shipments  increased by  and international carat shipments increased by 
it should be noted that a portion of the carats shipped to international customers are set in jewelry and distributed by these customers to retail markets in several countries  including the united states 
the average selling price per carat decreased by  primarily due to increased sales of smaller jewels which have a lower price per carat 
increased domestic sales are primarily attributable to direct marketing efforts on the television shopping channels shopnbc and the shop at home network 
in addition  distribution has increased through our manufacturing partners at traditional retail stores 
one of our domestic manufacturing customers  k g creations  accounted for approximately of our sales during k g creations provides moissanite jewels and jewelry to a large and diversified customer base  including television shopping channels and traditional retail stores 
while we believe our current relationship with this manufacturer is good and alternate manufacturers are available to serve its customer base  a loss of this manufacturer as a customer could cause a material adverse effect on our results of operations in a particular period 
international sales also increased due to increased sales through television shopping channels 
specifically  moissanite jewels are now sold in the united kingdom on ideal world and by the infomercial company  best direct 
international sales also increased in hong kong  china  and italy 
our gross profit margin was for the year ended december  compared to for the year ended december  the increased gross margin percentage was primarily caused by improved yields of moissanite jewels from sic crystals during the period being relieved from inventory under our first in  first out accounting policy  partially offset by a decrease in the average selling price per carat 
future gross margins will vary depending on our average selling price per carat and the inventory being relieved from inventory 
marketing and sales expenses were  for the year ended december  compared to  for the year ended december   an increase of  or 
the increase resulted primarily from  of increased costs associated with our co op advertising program   of increased print media advertising  increased compensation including costs associated with the hiring of two sales and marketing executives and increased costs associated with our hong kong subsidiary 
our co op advertising program reimburses a portion of our customers marketing costs based on the amount of their purchases from us 
our print media advertising expanded in into national magazines  jewelry trade publications  and newspapers in certain markets to support sales events 
as a percentage of sales  these expenses increased from in to in general and administrative expenses were  for the year ended december  compared to  for the year ended december   an increase of  or 
the increase resulted primarily from  of increased compensation costs  including  in additional costs associated with our executive compensation plan  offset by  of decreased professional fees 
although there was an increase in general and administrative expenses  as a percentage of sales these expenses decreased from to 
research and development expenses were  for the year ended december  compared to  for the year ended december   a decrease of  or 
we suspended development efforts with cree effective january   and terminated our development agreement with cree effective december  other expenses of  for the year ended december  resulted from the write off of certain patent costs and a loss on the disposition of certain other assets 
net interest income was  for the year ended december  compared to  for the year ended december   a decrease of  or 
this decrease resulted from a lower interest rate earned on our cash balances  partially offset by higher average cash balances 
for the year ended december   we recorded an income tax benefit of  the benefit is due to the reversal of the deferred tax valuation allowance that existed in prior periods 
we established a valuation allowance in prior periods due to the uncertainty of whether we would generate sufficient taxable income to realize the benefit of our deferred tax assets 
we have now recorded eight consecutive quarters of profitability and believe that this sustained profitability is an indication that it is more likely than not that we will fully utilize our deferred tax assets 
actual income tax payments will not be made until the million tax net operating loss carry forwards are completely utilized or if alternative minimum taxes are payable 
pro forma amounts are shown below to compare the results of operations for and  excluding this one time gain and giving effect to income tax expense 
income tax expense will be recorded in all future profitable periods

shipments of moissanite jewels decreased in to approximately  carats from approximately  carats in domestic carat shipments increased by  offset by a decrease of international carat shipments 
average selling price per carat decreased by in when compared to due primarily to increased sales of smaller jewels which have a lower price per carat 
we focused our sales and marketing efforts during on the domestic market 
during  the domestic distribution of moissanite expanded into additional retail stores including our first retail chain  catalog sales  and home shopping channels 
the decreased international sales can be partially attributed to the lack of significant advertising and public relations activities abroad 
our gross profit margin was for the year ended december  compared to for the year ended december  the increased gross margin percentage is primarily due to improved yield of moissanite jewels from sic crystals and a  decrease in our reserve for excess inventory  partially offset by a decrease in our average selling prices 
marketing and sales expenses were  for the year ended december  compared to  for the year ended december   a decrease of  or 
the decrease resulted primarily from a million reduction in advertising and promotion costs consistent with our strategy to increase consumer impressions through lower cost approaches such as public relations activities and media editorial coverage  as well as decreased sales compensation costs including severance costs recorded in 
general and administrative expenses were  for the year ended december  compared to  for the year ended december   a decrease of  or 
the decrease was primarily a result of  of decreased compensation costs including severance costs of  recorded in  a  decrease in bad debt expense  and reduced general overhead expenses consistent with our efforts to cut costs 
research and development expenses were  for the year ended december  compared to  for the year ended december   a decrease of  or 
the decrease resulted from the suspension of development efforts with cree effective january  other expenses for the year ended december  amounted to  resulting from the write off of certain patent costs and a loss on the disposition of certain other assets

net interest income was  for the year ended december  compared to  for the year ended december   a decrease of  or 
this decrease resulted from a lower interest rate earned on our cash balances  as well as approximately  of interest earned during on a receivable from cree that was completely paid in liquidity and capital resources at december   we had million of cash and cash equivalents and million of working capital 
cash and inventory account for over of our current assets 
our principal sources of liquidity are cash on hand and cash generated by operations 
during the year ended december    was generated by operations 
the major components of the generated cash were pretax income of  and a reduction in receivables of  offset by a  increase in inventory 
in addition  we used  of cash for the purchase of furniture and equipment 
we believe our existing capital resources are adequate to satisfy our capital requirements for at least the next months 
in august  we agreed with cree on a framework for purchases through september we are obligated to purchase a minimum quantity of usable material on a quarterly basis if cree meets certain minimum quality levels 
for each quarter during the period beginning january and ending september  we have committed to purchase between  and  of raw material depending upon the quality of material received 
if cree s material quality is consistent with that received in  which was better than the quality produced in previous years  future purchases are expected to be at the high end of this range 
if we do not meet the minimum quarterly purchase commitment  we will be obligated to pay cree an unused capacity charge for the idle growers 
this charge will not be greater than  in any given quarter 
our four year development agreement with cree  as amended  required us to fund a development program at cree for million annually through december  our funding obligations under the development agreement were suspended from january through december   and the agreement terminated at the end of in september  our board of directors authorized a common stock repurchase program

at the discretion of management  the repurchase program can be implemented through open market or privately negotiated transactions at prices at or below prevailing prices 
the company will determine the time and extent of repurchases based on its evaluation of market conditions and other factors 
there were no shares repurchased during under the follow on program

of this amount  shares were repurchased from an affiliate of chester lf paulson  a director of the company  at a purchase price of per share 
contractual obligations and commercial commitments our contractual obligations consist of our purchase commitments with cree  the operating lease on our building and the operating lease for our hong kong subsidiary 
below are the amounts of these commitments in tabular form 
payments due by period contractual obligations total less than year years years more than years purchase commitments operating leases beginning in january and ending september  we are committed to purchase between  and  of raw material each quarter depending upon the quality of material received 
if cree s material quality is consistent with that received in  future purchases are expected to be at the high end of this range 
the numbers in the table above are based on the high end of the range 
if we do not meet the minimum quarterly purchase commitment  we will be obligated to pay cree an unused capacity charge for the idle growers 
this charge will not be greater than  in any given quarter 
net operating loss carryforward as of december   we had a net operating loss nol carryforward of approximately million  which expires between and in accordance with section of the internal revenue code of  as amended  a change in equity ownership of greater than within a three year period will result in an annual limitation on our ability to utilize our nol carryforwards that were created during tax periods prior to the change in ownership 
as a result of various equity offerings and certain shareholder transactions  the utilization of a portion of our nol carryforwards has become limited  but this limitation will not have a material effect on our ability to utilize the nol carryforward 
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
the most significant estimates impacting our consolidated financial statements relate to costing and classification of inventories  revenue recognition  income taxes  accounts receivable reserves  and co op advertising 
inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market determined on a first in  first out basis 
our inventories consist primarily of colorless moissanite jewels that meet rigorous grading criteria and are of cuts and sizes most commonly used in the jewelry industry 
moissanite jewels that do not meet our grading criteria and therefore are not deemed to be saleable are not included in inventories 
we carry only a limited amount of moissanite jewels in finished jewelry settings 
as a result  our inventories do not degrade over time and are not subject to fashion trends 
our distribution channels include two of the largest suppliers of jewelry related products to the jewelry industry  jewelry manufacturers  home shopping channels and catalogs 
consequently  significant amounts of inventories must be maintained at all times 
given our current assumptions  we believe that a substantial amount of inventories will be sold or consumed during our operating cycle 
however  no assurances can be given that this reduction will occur 
during  we established a lower of cost or market reserve of  to allow for a portion of the finished goods inventory to be re cut 
there are certain shapes and sizes of jewels in inventory that can be re cut to achieve higher quality standards 
the reserve is necessary to allow for the carat weight loss during the re cutting process 
to determine this reserve  we estimated the amount of inventory that is anticipated to be re cut and the amount of weight loss that will occur during the process 
revenue is generally recognized when products are shipped 
from time to time  we ship certain items on memo terms 
for goods shipped on memo terms  the customer receives title to the goods and assumes the risk of loss  however  the customer has an absolute right of return during the specified memo period 
we recognize revenue on these transactions upon the earlier of the customer informing us that they will keep the product or the expiration of the memo period 
we account for income taxes under the liability method in accordance with fas under the liability method  deferred income taxes are recognized for the tax consequences of temporary differences by applying enacted statutory tax rates applicable to future years to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and the tax bases of existing assets and liabilities 
fas requires management to establish a valuation allowance to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount that is likely to be realized 
primarily due to losses accumulated prior to that can be carried forward to offset future federal and state taxable income  we have a net deferred tax asset 
however  at december  and  a full valuation allowance was established against this asset because enough evidence was not available that it would be more likely than not that we could generate enough future taxable income to utilize our loss carryforwards 
at december   the valuation allowance was eliminated 
after recording eight consecutive quarters of profitability  we now believe that our sustained profitable operations makes it more likely than not that we will realize sufficient taxable income in future years to fully recognize our deferred tax assets 
if actual results differ unfavorably from our projections of future taxable income  we may not be able to realize our entire net deferred tax asset and a valuation allowance may again be required 
estimates are used to determine the amount of two reserves against accounts receivable 
first  an allowance for doubtful accounts is established to reduce accounts receivable to an amount expected to be collected 
based on our collection history  we determine a percentage based on the age of the receivable that we deem collectible 
the allowance is then calculated by applying the appropriate percentage to each of our receivables 
any increases or decreases to this allowance are charged or credited to general and administrative expenses 
this allowance for doubtful accounts was  and  at december  and  respectively 
the second reserve against accounts receivable is the allowance for returns 
at the time revenue is recognized  we estimate future returns and reduce sales and accounts receivable by this estimated amount 
this amount is estimated using the historical return rate for our company 
the allowance for returns was  and  at december  and  respectively 
we offer a co op advertising program to our customers that reimburses a portion of their marketing costs based on their net purchases from us 
at the end of any given period  we estimate the amount of co op advertising expense that has not yet been submitted for credit by our customers 
we estimate this amount based on our historical experience with each customer
