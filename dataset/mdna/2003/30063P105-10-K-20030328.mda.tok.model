overview we apply proprietary genomic technologies to the early detection of common cancers 
we have selected colorectal cancer screening as the first application of our pregen technologies platform 
since our inception on february   our principal activities have included researching and developing our pregen technologies for colorectal cancer screening  conducting clinical studies to validate our colorectal cancer screening tests  negotiating licenses for intellectual property of others incorporated into our technologies  developing relationships with opinion leaders in the scientific and medical communities  conducting market studies and analyzing potential approaches for commercializing our pregen technologies  hiring research and clinical personnel  hiring management and other support personnel  raising capital  licensing our proprietary pregen technologies to labcorp  and working with labcorp on activities necessary to prepare for commercial launch of pregen plus 
on june   we entered into a license agreement with labcorp for an exclusive  long term strategic alliance between the parties to commercialize pregen plus  our proprietary  non invasive technology for the early detection of colorectal cancer in the average risk population 
pursuant to the license agreement  we agreed to license to labcorp all us and canadian patents and patent applications owned by us relating to our pregen technologies for the detection of colorectal cancer in an average risk population 
the license is exclusive for a five year period  followed by a non exclusive license for the life of the patents 
in return for the license  labcorp has agreed to pay us certain upfront  milestone and performance based payments  and a per test royalty fee 
labcorp made an initial payment of million upon the signing of the agreement  and a second payment of million is to be made upon the commercial launch of pregen plus 
in addition  we may be eligible for milestone payments from labcorp totaling up to million based upon company deliverables related to scientific acceptance  reimbursement approval and technology improvements and up to million upon the achievement of significant labcorp revenue thresholds 
in addition to these payments  the company will receive a royalty fee for each pregen plus test performed by labcorp 
in conjunction with the strategic alliance  the company has issued to labcorp a warrant to purchase  shares of its common stock  exercisable over a three year period at an exercise price of per share 
the company assigned a value to the warrant of  under the black scholes option pricing model  which has been recorded as a reduction in the initial upfront deferred license fee of million 
we have generated no material operating revenues since our inception  and do not expect any product licensing revenues until at least the second half of as of december   we had an accumulated deficit of approximately million 
our losses have historically resulted from costs incurred in conjunction with our research and development initiatives  and more recently  costs associated with selling  general and administrative expenses as we hire additional personnel  initiate marketing programs and build our infrastructure to support the commercial launch of pregen plus  our average risk colorectal cancer test  and to support future growth 
research and development expenses include costs related to scientific and laboratory personnel  clinical studies and reagents and supplies used in the development of our pregen technologies 
there are two on going clinical trials that comprise the majority of our research and development expense during in the third quarter of  we initiated our blinded multi center clinical trial  which is expected to include an estimated  asymptomatic  age and older  patients from over academic and community based practices 
the goal of this clinical trial will be to provide additional data supporting the superiority of tests utilizing our pre gen technology versus the most widely used brand of fobt  hemoccult ii  in detecting colorectal cancer in this average risk population 
we expect patient enrollment in this clinical trial to conclude by the end of the first quarter of and expect that study data will be available in the fourth quarter of the estimated cost to complete this clinical trial is approximately million to million depending on the ultimate number of patients recruited and the final number of stool samples processed 
in october  we initiated a clinical trial in collaboration with the mayo clinic in which our pregen technologies will be the subject of an independent study by the mayo clinic for which the mayo clinic received a million grant from the national cancer institute of the national institutes of health 
this three year study will involve approximately  patients at average risk for developing colorectal cancer  and will compare the results of our non invasive  genomics based screening technology with those of fobt  a common first line colorectal cancer screening option 
the mayo clinic has indicated that it expects enrollment in this clinical trial to be completed sometime in in addition to the costs already incurred  our estimated cost to complete this clinical trial is approximately million to million depending on the ultimate number of patients recruited and the final number of stool samples processed 
we expect that the cost of our research and development activities will decrease in slightly from as we conclude our  patient blinded multi center clinical trial 
selling  general and administrative expenses consist primarily of non research personnel salaries  office expenses and professional fees 
we expect selling  general and administrative expenses to increase in as we hire additional sales and marketing personnel and implement marketing and sales initiatives in conjunction with labcorp  to support the commercialization of pregen plus 
stock based compensation expense  a non cash expense  primarily represents the difference between the exercise price and fair value of common stock on the date of grant for certain options granted prior to our initial public offering 
the stock compensation expense is being amortized over the vesting period of the applicable options  which is generally months 
currently  we expect to recognize stock based compensation expense related to employee  consultant and director options of approximately million   and  during the years ended december   and  respectively 
significant accounting policies financial reporting release no 
 which was recently issued by the securities and exchange commission sec  requires all registrants to discuss critical accounting policies or methods used in the preparation of the financial statements 
the notes to the consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form k includes a summary of the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
further  we have made a number of estimates and assumptions that affect reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and actual results may differ from those estimates 
the areas that require the greatest degree of management judgment are the assessment of the recoverability of long lived assets  primarily intellectual property and the accrual of costs related to patient recruitment for our multi center study 
patent costs  which historically consisted of related legal fees  are capitalized as incurred and are amortized beginning when patents are issued in the united states over an estimated useful life of five years 
in november  however  the company purchased certain intellectual property of mt technologies formerly known as mosaic technologies  inc relating to its hybrigel technology which consisted of four issued patents and pending patent applications 
the purchase price for the assets consisted of million in cash and warrants to purchase  shares of common stock  immediately exercisable over a three year period at an exercise price of per share  which the company valued at  in accordance with emerging issues task force  accounting for equity instruments that are issued to other than employees for acquiring  or in conjunction with selling goods or services  using the black scholes option pricing model 
capitalized patent costs are expensed upon disapproval or upon a decision by us to no longer pursue the patent 
the company accrues the estimated cost of patient recruitment associated with its large multi center clinical trial as patients are enrolled in the trial 
these costs consist primarily of payments made to the clinical centers  investigators and patients for participating in the company s clinical trial 
as actual or expected costs become known  they may differ from estimated costs previously accrued for and this clinical trial accrual would be adjusted accordingly 
we believe that full consideration has been given to all relevant circumstances that we may be subject to  and the financial statements accurately reflect our best estimate of the results of operations  financial position and cash flows for the periods presented 
results of operations comparison of the years ended december  and revenue 
revenue increased to  for the year ended december  from  for the year ended december  this revenue is primarily composed of amortization of up front technology license fees associated with agreements signed in july and june with labcorp that are being amortized on a straight line basis over the respective license periods 
cost of revenues 
cost of revenues for the year ended december  of  represents the estimated cost of performing colorectal screening tests at our facility 
research and development expenses 
research and development expenses  excluding departmental allocations of stock based compensation  increased to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  this increase was primarily attributable with the initiation of our blinded multi center clinical trial in october and included increases of million in personnel related expenses   in professional fees and expenses  million in laboratory expenses  million in trials and studies expenses and million related to the leasing of additional laboratory space 
selling  general and administrative expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses  excluding departmental allocations of stock based compensation  increased to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  this increase was attributable primarily to additional personnel hired to build our infrastructure and the initiation of other corporate and marketing programs to support future growth and included increases of  in personnel related expenses   in professional fees and expenses   in travel related expenses partially offset by lower costs of  related to office space and related office expenses 
stock based compensation 
stock based compensation  a non cash expense  decreased to million for the year ended december   of which  related to research and development personnel and million related to general and administrative personnel from million for the year ended december  the decrease in stock based compensation in from is due to the accelerated method of amortization being used to record this expense 
interest income 
interest income decreased to  for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  this decrease was primarily due to lower interest rates on our investments and overall decreases in our average cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities balances 
comparison of the years ended december  and revenue 
revenue was  for the year ended december  this revenue is primarily composed of amortization of up front technology license fees associated with an agreement signed in july with laboratory corporation of america holdings  inc that is being amortized on a straight line basis over the license period 
research and development expenses 
research and development expenses  excluding departmental allocations of stock based compensation  increased to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  this increase was primarily attributable with the initiation of our blinded multi center clinical trial and included increases of million in personnel related expenses   in professional fees and expenses   in laboratory expenses  million in trials and studies expenses and  related to the leasing of additional laboratory space 
selling  general and administrative expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses  excluding departmental allocations of stock based compensation  increased to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  this increase was attributable primarily to additional personnel hired to build our infrastructure and the initiation of other corporate and marketing programs to support future growth and included increases of million in personnel related expenses  million in professional fees and expenses   in travel related expenses and  related to the leasing of additional office space and related office expenses 
stock based compensation 
stock based compensation  a non cash expense  increased to million for the year ended december   of which  related to research and development personnel and million related to general and administrative personnel 
stock based compensation was million for the year ended december   of which  related to research and development personnel and million related to general and administrative personnel 
interest income 
interest income increased to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  this increase was primarily due to an increase in our cash and cash equivalents balances resulting from the issuance of common stock in february liquidity and capital resources we have financed our operations since inception primarily through private sales of preferred stock  as well as the completion of an initial public offering of our common stock in january as of december   we had approximately million in cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities 
net cash used in operating activities was million for the year ended december   million in and million in excluding the impact of the upfront deferred licensing fee of million from labcorp  net cash used in operating activities would have been million for the year ended december  this increase was primarily due to our increase in operating losses resulting from higher spending in research and development expenses as the company commenced its blinded multi center clinical trial in october in addition  selling  general and administrative expenses increased as we initiated certain corporate  selling and marketing programs to support the commercialization of pregen plus and build our infrastructure to support future growth 
net cash used in investing activities was million for the year ended december   million in and million in the majority of this increase was due to the purchase of million in investments during as we began to invest in longer term securities in order to increase the return on our excess cash position consistent with our investment policy guidelines 
cash used for purchasing property and equipment was million for the year ended december   million in and  in this investment for and is primarily the result of the expansion of our laboratory space to prepare for our multi center clinical trial 
cash used for our intellectual property portfolio was  for the year ended december   million in and  in the investment for includes the purchase of intellectual property from mt technologies relating to its hybrigel technology which consisted of issued patents and pending patent applications for million in cash 
patent costs  which historically consisted of related legal fees  are capitalized as incurred 
net cash provided by financing activities was  for the year ended december   million in and million in cash provided by financing for the year ended december  resulted from issuance of  of common stock under our stock option and stock purchase plans along with the repayment of  of stock subscription receivables 
cash provided by financing for the years ended december  resulted primarily from the sale of our common stock from our initial public offering in and the sale of preferred stock in we expect that cash  cash equivalents and short term investments on hand at december   together with the additional milestone and royalty payments expected to be received from labcorp  will be sufficient to fund our operations for the foreseeable future 
our future capital requirements include  but are not limited to  continuing our research and development programs  supporting our clinical study efforts  supporting our marketing efforts associated with the commercialization of pregen plus and capital expenditures primarily associated with leasehold improvements and other moving costs of approximately million for our new facility and purchases of additional laboratory equipment 
we do not have any significant fix obligations and commitments other than payments required under operating leases for leased facilities as follows year ending december  thereafter  total lease payments  our future capital requirements will depend on many factors  including the following the success of our clinical studies  the scope of and progress made in our research and development activities  and the successful commercialization of pre gen plus 
net operating loss carryforwards as of december   we had net operating loss carryforwards of approximately million and tax credit carryforwards of approximately million 
the net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards will expire at various dates through  if not utilized 
the internal revenue code and applicable state laws impose substantial restrictions on a corporation s utilization of net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards if an ownership change is deemed to have occurred 
a valuation allowance is provided for deferred tax assets if it is more likely than not these items will either expire before we are able to realize their benefit  or that future deductibility is uncertain 
in general  companies that have a history of operating losses are faced with a difficult burden of proof on their ability to generate sufficient future income within the next two years in order to realize the benefit of the deferred tax assets 
we have recorded a valuation against our deferred tax assets based on our history of losses 
the deferred tax assets are still available for us to use in the future to offset taxable income  which would result in the recognition of tax benefit and a reduction to our effective tax rate 
factors that may affect future results we operate in a rapidly changing environment that involves a number of risks  some of which are beyond our control 
this discussion highlights some of the risks which may affect future operating results 
we may never successfully commercialize any of our products or services or earn a profit 
we have incurred losses since we were formed 
from our date of inception on february  through december   we have accumulated a total deficit of approximately million 
we do not expect to have any operating revenue from the licensing of our products and services until at least the second half of even after we begin selling our products and services  we expect that our losses will continue and increase as a result of continuing research and development expenses  as well as increased sales and marketing expenses 
we cannot assure you that the revenue from any of our products or services will be sufficient to make us profitable 
dependence on our strategic partnership we have a long term strategic alliance agreement with labcorp whereby we license pregen technologies to labcorp that are required for the commercialization of pregen plus  our proprietary  non invasive technology for the early detection of colorectal cancer in the average risk population 
the license to labcorp is exclusive within north america for a five year term followed by a non exclusive license for the life of the underlying patents 
labcorp has the ability to terminate this agreement for  among other things  a material breach by us 
if labcorp were to terminate the agreement  or fail to meet its obligation under the agreement  we would incur significant delays and expense in the commercialization of pregen plus and we cannot guarantee that we would be able to enter into a similar agreement to commercialize this technology 
further  if we do not achieve certain milestones  or labcorp does not achieve certain revenue thresholds  within the time periods prescribed in the agreement  we may not fully realize the expected benefits of the agreement to us 
we are actively working together with labcorp to create and execute an operational and business plan for commercializing pregen plus 
the companies are currently focusing their efforts on assay validation  technology transfer and licensing  contracting with manufacturers and suppliers  physician education and demand  broad based reimbursement initiatives  advocacy development  and sales force training 
additionally  there are a number of significant initiatives that are primarily labcorp s responsibility that must be accomplished prior to commercialization  if we are to be successful 
some of the major initiatives include the creation of an adequate distribution infrastructure for sample movement  the build out of adequate laboratory space  the hiring and training of personnel  the establishment of supply agreements with vendors  and the licensing of certain third party technologies used with the pregen plus assay as it is currently configured 
once completed  labcorp will also need to process an adequate number of stool samples at their facilities to validate test results 
failure to adequately complete any of these initiatives  or to do so in a timely manner  could impact the timing and success of the commercialization of pregen plus 
in addition  labcorp may decide to delay the commercialization of pregen plus despite the achievement of technology transfer  validation  etc 
or may decide that the commercialization of pregen plus is no longer appropriate to its business 
should that occur  there is no assurance that we would be able to license pregen plus to another clinical reference laboratory or otherwise successfully commercialize the technology 
our business would suffer if we are unable to license certain technologies or if certain of our licenses were terminated 
the current configuration of pregen plus that we expect to commercialize with labcorp requires access to certain technologies and supply of raw materials for which we or labcorp will need to enter into licensing and supply agreements prior to commercialization 
while we believe that such agreements can be entered into with necessary third parties on favorable terms and conditions  no assurances can be given that we or labcorp will be able to accomplish this objective on a timely basis  if at all 
if we or labcorp are unable to obtain these technologies on acceptable terms  the pregen plus assay will need to be reconfigured which could significantly delay its commercialization 
we license certain technologies from roche molecular systems  inc and genzyme corporation that are key to our pregen technologies 
the roche license for the polymerase chain reaction pcr technology  which relates to a gene amplification process used in almost all genetic testing  is a non exclusive license through  the date on which the patent that we utilize expires 
roche may terminate the license upon notice if we fail to pay royalties  submit certain reports or breach any other material term of the license agreement 
the genzyme license is a non exclusive license to use the apc and p genes  methods for the detection of target nucleic acid by analysis of stool and other methodologies relating to the genes in connection with our products and services through  the date on which the term of the patent that we utilize expires 
genzyme may terminate the license upon notice if we fail to pay milestone payments and royalties  achieve a certain level of sales  or submit certain reports 
in addition  if we fail to use reasonable efforts to make products and services based on these patents available to the public or fail to request fda clearance for a diagnostic test kit as required by the agreement  genzyme may terminate the license 
if either roche or genzyme were to terminate the licenses  and if we were  at the time of license termination  generating material revenue from tests performed at our company s facility  we would incur significant delays and expense to change a portion of our testing methods and we cannot guarantee that we would be able to change our testing methods without affecting the performance characteristics of our tests 
additionally  a third party has asserted claims of patent infringement against certain entities that are anticipated suppliers of materials necessary to the pregen plus assay as it is currently configured 
although to date  no legal proceedings have been initiated against us  if any third party  including the third party discussed above  is successful in challenging the supply of materials needed for the pregen plus assay as it is currently configured  commercialization of our pregen technologies may be significantly delayed  sales of the pregen plus assay may become interrupted  and our revenue may become impacted 
dependence on collaborative relationships 
in addition to our dependence on labcorp for the commercialization of pregen plus  if any other party with which we  or labcorp  have established  or will establish  licensing  supply  or collaborative agreements were unable to satisfy its contractual obligations to us or labcorp  there can be no assurance that substantially similar agreements could be negotiated and executed with other third parties on acceptable terms  if at all  or that any such new agreements would be successful 
while we believe third parties will meet their contractual responsibilities under current and future agreements  there can be no assurance that this will be the case or that such future agreements will in fact be negotiated and entered into 
there can be no assurance that any of our current contractual arrangements between us and third parties  us and labcorp  or between our strategic partners and other third parties  will be continued  entered into  or not breached or terminated early  or that we or our strategic partners will be able to enter into any future relationships necessary to the commercial launch of pregen plus or necessary to our realization of material revenues 
the failure to do so could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
further  labcorp or any other strategic partner may commercialize technologies or products for colorectal cancer outside of their relationship with us that compete directly with our pregen technologies  and such technologies or products may prove to be more effective and cost efficient than our pregen technologies 
because our revenue will be dependent upon our and labcorp s successful commercial introduction of pregen plus  failure to successfully maintain our relationship with labcorp or any other strategic partner would have a material adverse effect on our operations and ability to generate operating revenue 
if our clinical studies do not prove the superiority of our pregen technologies  we and our partners may never sell our products and services 
in the third quarter of  we initiated a large multi center clinical study that will include approximately  patients with average risk profiles 
in october  we also signed a clinical trial agreement with the mayo clinic in which our pregen technologies will be the subject of an independent study by mayo clinic for which mayo clinic received a million grant from the national cancer institute of the national institutes of health 
this three year study will involve approximately  patients at average risk for developing colorectal cancer and  similar to our  patient study  will compare the results of our pregen technologies with those of the hemoccult ii  a fecal occult blood test  a common first line colorectal cancer screening option 
the results of these clinical studies may not be favorable or show that tests using our pregen technologies are sufficiently superior to existing non invasive screening methods 
in that event  we may have to devote significant financial and other resources to further research and development 
in addition  we may experience reluctance or refusal on the part of third party payors to pay for tests using our pregen technologies which could slow the demand and or commercialization of these tests  or commercialization may never occur 
our earlier clinical studies were small and included samples from high risk or symptomatic patients 
the results from these earlier studies may not be representative of the results we obtain from any future studies  including our multi center study  which will include substantially more samples from average risk patients 
scarcity of raw materials we rely on contract manufacturers and suppliers for certain components for our pregen technologies 
we believe that there are relatively few manufacturers that are currently capable of supplying commercial quantities of the raw materials necessary for the current configuration of the pregen plus assay that is intended for commercialization 
although we have identified suppliers that we believe are capable of supplying these raw materials in sufficient quantity today  there can be no assurance that we  or labcorp  will be able to enter into agreements with such suppliers on a timely basis on acceptable terms  if at all 
furthermore  pregen plus has never been offered on a commercial scale  and there can be no assurance that the raw materials necessary to meet demand will be available in sufficient quantities or on acceptable terms  if at all 
if we or labcorp should encounter delays or difficulties in securing the necessary raw materials for pregen plus  we may need to reconfigure our assay which would result in delays in commercialization or an interruption in sales which could materially adversely impact our revenues 
we may not be able to sustain commercialization of our pregen technologies if we are not able to lower costs through automating and simplifying key operational processes 
currently  colorectal cancer screening tests using our pregen technologies are expensive because they are labor intensive and use highly complex processes and expensive reagents 
in order to generate significant profits and make our pregen technologies more commercially attractive  we will need to reduce substantially the costs of tests using our pregen technologies through significant automation of key operational processes and other cost savings procedures 
if we fail to create and improve pregen technologies that sufficiently reduce costs  tests using our pregen technologies either may not be commercially viable or may generate little  if any  profitability for our partners  or for us 
if medicare and other third party payors  including managed care organizations  do not provide adequate reimbursement for our products and services  it is unlikely that most clinical reference laboratories will use our products or license our pregen technologies to perform cancer screening tests 
most clinical reference laboratories will not perform colorectal cancer screening tests using our pregen technologies unless they are adequately reimbursed by third party payors such as medicare and managed care organizations 
there is significant uncertainty concerning third party reimbursement for the use of any test incorporating new technology 
reimbursement by a third party payor may depend on a number of factors  including a payor s determination that tests using our pregen technologies are sensitive for colorectal cancer  not experimental or investigational  medically necessary  appropriate for the specific patient and cost effective 
while we have had some success in obtaining reimbursement from a limited number of third party payors for tests performed in house  to date  we have not secured any broad based reimbursement approval for tests using our pregen technologies from any third party payor  nor do we expect any such approvals in the immediate future 
reimbursement by medicare will require a review that may be lengthy and which may be performed under the provisions of a national coverage decision process 
the federal balanced budget act of provides for adding new technologies to the colorectal cancer screening benefit  such as ours  with such frequency and payment limits as the secretary of health and human services hhs determines appropriate 
we cannot guarantee that the secretary of hhs will act to approve tests based on our pregen technologies on a timely basis  or at all 
while the current procedural terminology codes facilitate medicare reimbursement  the level of any eventual medicare reimbursement is unknown at this time 
since policy level reimbursement approval is required from each payor individually  seeking such approvals is a time consuming and costly process 
if we are unable to obtain adequate reimbursement approval from medicare and private payors  our ability to generate revenue from our pregen technologies will be limited 
if we are unable to convince medical practitioners to order tests using our pregen technologies  our revenue and profitability may be limited 
if we fail to convince medical practitioners to order tests using our pregen technologies  we will not be able to create sufficient demand for products using our pregen technologies in sufficient volume for us to become profitable 
we will need to make thought leading gastroenterologists and primary care physicians aware of the benefits of tests using our pregen technologies through published papers  presentations at scientific conferences and favorable results from our clinical studies 
our failure to be successful in these efforts would make it difficult for us to convince medical practitioners to order colorectal cancer screening tests using our pregen technologies for their patients 
we may experience limits on our revenue and profitability if only a small number of people decide to be screened for colorectal cancer using our pregen technologies 
even if our pregen technologies are superior to alternative colorectal cancer screening technologies  adequate third party reimbursement is obtained and medical practitioners order tests using our pregen technologies  an immaterial number of people may decide to be screened for colorectal cancer 
despite the availability of current colorectal cancer screening methods as well as the recommendations of the american cancer society that all americans age and above be screened for colorectal cancer  most of these individuals decide not to complete a colorectal cancer screening test 
if only a small portion of the population decides to utilize colorectal cancer screening tests using our pregen technologies  we will  despite our efforts  experience limits on our revenue and profitability 
if we or our partners fail to comply with fda requirements  we may not be able to market our products and services and may be subject to stringent penalties 
the fda does not actively regulate laboratory tests that have been developed and used by the laboratory to conduct in house testing 
the fda does regulate specific reagents  some of which are used with our pregen technologies that react with a biological substance including those designed to identify a specific dna sequence or protein 
the fda s regulations provide that most such reagents  which the fda refers to as analyte specific reagents  are exempt from the fda s pre market review requirements 
we believe that analyte specific reagents that we may provide fall within these exemptions 
however  if the fda were to decide to more actively regulate in house developed laboratory tests  the commercialization of our products and services could be impacted by being delayed  halted or prevented 
if the fda were to view any of our actions as non compliant  it could initiate enforcement action such as a regulatory warning letter and possible imposition of penalties 
finally  analyte specific reagents that we may provide will be subject to a number of fda requirements  including compliance with the fda s quality system regulation  which establishes extensive regulations for quality assurance and control as well as manufacturing procedures 
failure to comply with these regulations could result in enforcement action for us  our partners  or our contract manufacturers 
adverse fda action in any of these areas could significantly increase our expenses and limit our revenue and profitability 
we may be subject to substantial costs and liability or be prevented from selling our screening tests for cancer as a result of litigation or other proceedings relating to patent rights 
third parties may assert infringement or other intellectual property claims against our licensors  our suppliers  our licensees  our strategic partners  or us 
we pursue an aggressive patent strategy that we believe provides us with a competitive advantage in the early detection of colorectal cancer and other common cancers 
as of december   we have issued us patents and pending patent applications in the united states 
because the us patent trademark office maintains patent applications in secrecy until a patent application publishes or the patent is issued  others may have filed patent applications for technology covered by our pending applications 
there may be third party patents  patent applications and other intellectual property relevant to our potential products that may block or compete with our products or processes 
even if third party claims are without merit  defending a lawsuit may result in substantial expense to us and may divert the attention of management and key personnel 
in addition  we cannot provide assurance that we would prevail in any of these suits or that the damages or other remedies if any  awarded against us would not be substantial 
claims of intellectual property infringement may require that we  or our strategic partners  enter into royalty or license agreements with third parties that may not be available on acceptable terms  if at all 
these claims may also result in injunctions against the further development and use of our pregen technologies  which would have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
additionally  a third party has asserted claims of patent infringement against certain entities that are anticipated suppliers of materials necessary to the pregen plus assay as it is currently configured 
although to date  no legal proceedings have been initiated against us  if any third party  including the third party discussed above  is successful in challenging the supply of materials needed for the pregen plus assay as it is currently configured  commercialization of our pregen technologies may be significantly delayed  sales of the pregen plus assay may become interrupted  and our revenue may become impacted 
also  patents and applications owned by us may become the subject of interference proceedings in the united states patent and trademark office to determine priority of invention  which could result in substantial cost to us  as well as a possible adverse decision as to the priority of invention of the patent or patent application involved 
an adverse decision in an interference proceeding may result in the loss of rights under a patent or patent application subject to such a proceeding 
if we fail to gain relief from the us department of transportation dot regulation for the transport of diagnostic specimens  it could increase the cost of transporting stool specimens and limit revenue growth 
on august   the dot issued revised hazardous materials regulations for the packaging and transport of infectious materials  including diagnostic specimens 
in anticipation of the application of these regulations to our current specimen container and transport system  we submitted an exemption request to the dot to minimize the changes that would be necessary for our specimen collection system  while still providing an equivalent level of safety 
on february   the dot issued a formal determination that stool samples intended for clinical research or diagnostic purpose would not be deemed an infectious substance subject to the hazardous materials regulations 
while this decision is favorable to us and our partners  we cannot be certain that the dot will not more actively regulate or restrict the transportation of stool samples  such as those used in our diagnostic tests 
other companies may develop and market novel or improved methods for detecting colorectal cancer  which may make our pregen technologies less competitive  or even obsolete 
the market for colorectal cancer screening is large  approximating million americans age and above  and has attracted competitors  some of which have significantly greater resources than we have 
currently  we face competition from alternative procedures based detection technologies such as flexible sigmiodoscopy  colonoscopy  virtual colonoscopy  a new procedure being performed in which a radiologist views the inside of the colon through a scanner  as well as existing and improved traditional screening tests such as fobt 
in addition  some competitors are developing serum based tests  or screening tests based on the detection of proteins or nucleic acids produced by colon cancer 
these and other companies may also be working on additional methods of detecting colon cancer that have not yet been announced 
we may be unable to compete effectively against these competitors either because their test is superior or because they may have more expertise  experience  financial resources and stronger business relationships 
the loss of key members of our senior management team could adversely affect our business 
our success depends largely on the skills  experience and performance of key members of our senior management team  including don m 
hardison  our president and chief executive officer  john a 
mccarthy  jr  our executive vice president  chief operating officer  chief financial officer and treasurer  and anthony p 
shuber  our executive vice president and chief technology officer 
anthony p 
shuber  together with stanley n 
lapidus  our chairman  has been critical to the development of our technologies and business 
although messrs 
hardison  mccarthy and shuber have each signed a non disclosure and assignment of intellectual property agreement and a non compete agreement  they have no employment agreements currently in place 
we also have a severance agreement with each of messrs 
hardison  mccarthy and shuber that provides for twelve months severance under certain circumstances 
the efforts of each of these persons will be critical to us as we continue to develop our technologies and our testing process and as we transition to a company with commercialized products and services 
if we were to lose one or more of these key employees  we may experience difficulties in competing effectively  developing our technologies and implementing our business strategies 
if we are unable to protect our intellectual property effectively  we may be unable to prevent third parties from using our pregen technologies  which would impair our competitive advantage 
we rely on patent protection as well as a combination of trademark  copyright and trade secret protection  and other contractual restrictions to protect our proprietary pregen technologies  all of which provide limited protection and may not adequately protect our rights or permit us to gain or keep any competitive advantage 
if we fail to protect our intellectual property  we will be unable to prevent third parties from using our pregen technologies and they will be able to compete more effectively against us 
as of december   we have issued patents and pending patent applications in the united states 
we also have issued foreign patents and pending foreign patent applications 
we cannot assure you that any of our currently pending or future patent applications will result in issued patents  and we cannot predict how long it will take for such patents to be issued 
further  we cannot assure you that other parties will not challenge any patents issued to us  or that courts or regulatory agencies will hold our patents to be valid or enforceable 
a third party institution has asserted co inventorship rights with respect to one of our issued patents relating to pooling patient samples in connection with our loss of heterozygosity detection method 
we cannot guarantee you that we will be successful in defending this or other challenges made in connection with our patents and patent applications 
any successful third party challenge to our patents could result in co ownership of such patents with a third party or the unenforceability or invalidity of such patents 
in addition  we and a third party institution have filed a joint patent application that is co owned by us and that third party institution relating to the use of various dna markers  including one of our detection methods  to detect cancers of the lung  pancreas  esophagus  stomach  small intestine  bile duct  naso pharyngeal  liver and gall bladder in stool under the patent cooperation treaty 
this patent application designates the united states  japan  europe and canada 
co ownership of a patent allows the co owner to exercise all rights of ownership  including the right to use  transfer and license the rights protected by the applicable patent 
in addition to our patents  we rely on contractual restrictions to protect our proprietary technology 
we require our employees and third parties to sign confidentiality agreements and employees to sign agreements assigning to us all intellectual property arising from their work for us 
nevertheless  we cannot guarantee that these measures will be effective in protecting our intellectual property rights 
we cannot guarantee that the patents issued to us will be broad enough to provide any meaningful protection nor can we assure you that one of our competitors may not develop more effective technologies  designs or methods to test for colorectal cancer or any other common cancer without infringing our intellectual property rights or that one of our competitors might not design around our proprietary pregen technologies 
we may incur substantial costs to protect and enforce our patents 
we have pursued an aggressive patent strategy designed to maximize our patent protection against third parties in the us and in foreign countries 
we have filed patent applications that cover the methods we have designed to detect colorectal cancer and other cancers  as well as patent applications that cover our testing process 
in order to protect or enforce our patent rights  we may initiate actions against third parties 
any actions regarding patents could be costly and time consuming  and divert our management and key personnel from our business 
additionally  such actions could result in challenges to the validity or applicability of our patents 
if we lose the support of our key scientific collaborators  it may be difficult to establish tests using our pregen technologies as a standard of care for colorectal cancer screening  which may limit our revenue growth and profitability 
we have established relationships with leading scientists  including members of our scientific advisory board  and research and academic institutions  such as the mayo clinic and john hopkins university that we believe are key to establishing tests using our pregen technologies as a standard of care for colorectal cancer screening 
if our collaborators determine that colorectal cancer screening tests using our pregen technologies are not superior to available colorectal cancer screening tests or that alternative technologies would be more effective in the early detection of colorectal cancer  we would encounter significant difficulty establishing tests using our pregen technologies as a standard of care for colorectal cancer screening  which would limit our revenue growth and profitability 
our inability to apply our proprietary pregen technologies successfully to detect other common cancers may limit our revenue growth and profitability 
while to date we have focused substantially all of our research and development efforts on colorectal cancer  we have used our pregen technologies to detect cancers of the lung  pancreas  esophagus  stomach and gall bladder 
as a result  we intend to devote personnel and financial resources in the future to extending our pregen technology platform to the development of screening tests for these common cancers 
to do so  we may need to overcome technological challenges to develop reliable screening tests for these cancers 
there can be no assurance that our pregen technologies will be capable of reliably detecting cancers  beyond colorectal cancer  with the sensitivity and specificity necessary to be clinically and commercially useful for such other cancers  or that we can develop such technologies 
we may never realize any benefits from our research and development activities 
changes in healthcare policy could subject us to additional regulatory requirements that may delay the commercialization of our tests and increase our costs 
healthcare policy has been a subject of discussion in the executive and legislative branches of the federal and many state governments 
we developed our commercialization strategy for pregen plus based on existing healthcare policies 
changes in healthcare policy  if implemented  could substantially delay the use of pregen plus  increase costs  and divert management s attention 
we cannot predict what changes  if any  will be proposed or adopted or the effect that such proposals or adoption may have on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
our inability to raise additional capital on acceptable terms in the future may limit our growth 
although we believe that the company will not need to raise additional funds from the capital markets for the foreseeable future  if our capital resources become insufficient to meet future requirements  we will have to raise additional funds to continue the development and commercialization of our pregen technologies 
our inability to raise capital would seriously harm our business and development efforts 
in addition  we may choose to raise additional capital due to market conditions or strategic considerations even if we believe we have sufficient funds for our current or future operations 
these funds may not be available on favorable terms  or at all 
if adequate funds are not available on attractive terms  we may have to restrict our operations significantly or obtain funds by entering into agreements on unattractive terms 
further  to the extent that additional capital is raised through the sale of equity or convertible debt securities  the issuance of these securities could result in dilution to our stockholders 
conviction of arthur andersen llp 
prior to july   arthur andersen llp arthur andersen served as the company s independent auditors 
on march   arthur andersen was indicted on federal obstruction of justice charges arising from the government s investigation of enron corporation and on june   arthur andersen was found guilty 
arthur andersen informed the sec that it would cease practicing before the sec by august   unless the sec determined that another date was appropriate 
on may   the company dismissed arthur andersen and retained ernst young llp as its independent auditors for its current fiscal year ended december  sec rules require the company to present historical audited financial statements in various sec filings  such as registration statements  along with arthur andersen s consent to the company s inclusion of arthur andersen s audit report in those filings 
since the company s former engagement partner and audit manager have left arthur andersen and in light of the announced cessation of arthur andersen s sec practice  the company will not be able to obtain the consent of arthur andersen to the inclusion of arthur andersen s audit report in the company s relevant current and future filings 
the sec recently has provided regulatory relief designed to allow companies that file reports with the sec to dispense with the requirement to file a consent of arthur andersen in certain circumstances  but purchasers of securities sold under the company s registration statements  which were not filed with the consent of arthur andersen to the inclusion of arthur andersen s audit report will not be able to sue arthur andersen pursuant to section a of the securities act of and therefore the purchasers right of recovery under that section may be limited as a result of the lack of the company s ability to obtain arthur andersen s consent 
our executive officers  directors and principal stockholders own a significant percentage of our company and could exert significant influence over matters requiring stockholder approval 
as of december   our executive officers  directors and principal stockholders and their affiliates together control approximately of our outstanding common stock  without giving effect to the exercise of outstanding options under our stock plans 
as a result  these stockholders  if they act together  will have significant influence over matters requiring stockholder approval  such as the election of directors and approval of significant corporate transactions 
this concentration of ownership may have the effect of delaying  preventing or deterring a change in control  could deprive other stockholders the opportunity to receive a premium for their common stock as part of a sale and could adversely affect the market price of our common stock 
certain provisions of our charter  by laws and delaware law may make it difficult for you to change our management and may also make a takeover difficult 
our corporate documents and delaware law contain provisions that limit the ability of stockholders to change our management and may also enable our management to resist a takeover 
these provisions include a staggered board of directors  limitations on persons authorized to call a special meeting of stockholders and advance notice procedures required for stockholders to make nominations of candidates for election as directors or to bring matters before an annual meeting of stockholders 
these provisions might discourage  delay or prevent a change of control or in our management 
these provisions could also discourage proxy contests and make it more difficult for you and other stockholders to elect directors and cause us to take other corporate actions 
in addition  the existence of these provisions  together with delaware law  might hinder or delay an attempted takeover other than through negotiations with our board of directors 
our stock price may be volatile 
the market price of our stock is likely to be highly volatile and could fluctuate widely in price in response to various factors  many of which are beyond our control  including technological innovations or new products and services by us or our competitors  clinical trial results relating to our tests or those of our competitors  reimbursement decisions by medicare and other managed care organizations  fda regulation of our products and services  the establishment of collaborative partnerships  health care legislation  intellectual property disputes and other litigation  additions or departures of key personnel  a delay  or anticipated delay  in commercialization of our pregen technologies  and sales of our common stock 
because we are a company with no operating revenue expected until at least the second half of  you may consider one of these factors to be material 
our stock price may fluctuate widely as a result of any of the above 
in addition  the nasdaq national market and the market for biotechnology companies in particular  has experienced significant price and volume fluctuations that have often been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of those companies 
future sales by our existing stockholders could depress the market price of our common stock 
if our existing stockholders sell a large number of shares of our common stock  the market price of our common stock could decline significantly 
moreover  the perception in the public market that our existing stockholders might sell shares of common stock could adversely affect the market price of our common stock
