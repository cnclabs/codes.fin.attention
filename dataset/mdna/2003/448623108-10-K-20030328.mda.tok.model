item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto 
significant accounting policies the company s consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america  and management is required to make certain estimates  judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the periods presented 
the significant accounting policies which the company believes are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating its reported financial results include the following revenue recognition revenues from product sales are recognized at the time of shipment and passage of title 
revenues from customers under distributorship agreements are also recognized at the time of shipment and passage of title 
the company offers customers the right to return products only if the products are shipped in error  are damaged or in the event of product failure 
while such returns have historically not been significant  the company cannot guarantee that it will continue to experience the same return rates that it has in the past 
any significant increase in product failure rates and the resulting credit returns could have a material adverse impact on the company s operating results for the period or periods in which such returns materialize 
accounts receivable the company performs ongoing credit evaluations of its customers and adjusts credit limits based upon payment history and the customer s current creditworthiness 
the company continuously monitors collections and payments from customers and maintains a provision for estimated credit losses based upon historical experience and any specific customer collection issues that have been identified 
the company s credit losses have historically been within expectations and the provisions established 
however  the inability of one of the company s significant customers to pay amounts owed could have a material adverse impact on the company s operating results 
inventories inventories are valued at the lower of the actual cost to purchase and or manufacture the inventory or the current estimated market value of the inventory 
the company regularly reviews inventory quantities on hand and records a provision for excess and obsolete inventory on specifically identified items based primarily on an estimated forecast of product demand and production requirements 
the company s losses from disposal of excessive and obsolete inventories have historically been within expectations and the provisions established 
however  the company s estimates of future product demand may prove to be inaccurate  in which case the company may have understated or overstated the provision required for excess and obsolete inventory 
in addition  rapid technological change or new product development could result in an increase in the amount of obsolete inventory quantities on hand 
in the future  if the company s inventory is determined to be overvalued  it would be required to recognize such costs in its cost of goods sold at the time of such determination 
likewise  if the company s inventory is determined to be undervalued  it may have over reported its costs of goods 
table of contents sold in previous periods and would be required to recognize such additional operating income at the time of sale 
additionally  the company s manufacturing costs and inventory carrying costs are dependent on management s accurate estimates of customer demand for the company s products 
a significant increase in the demand for the company s products could result in a short term increase in the cost of inventory purchases  while a significant decrease in demand could result in an increase in the amount of excess inventory quantities on hand and increase the expense of storing and maintaining the inventory until it is sold 
therefore  although management makes every effort to ensure the accuracy of its forecasts of future product demand  any significant unanticipated changes in demand or technological developments could have a significant impact on the value of the company s inventory and its reported operating results 
deferred taxes the company s deferred taxes relate primarily to prior operating losses that are available to offset future taxable income and tax credits that are available to offset future income taxes 
deferred taxes are also recognized for differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and the tax bases of assets and liabilities 
the company evaluates a variety of factors in determining the amount of deferred income assets to be recognized pursuant to statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for income taxes 
as of december   the company had recorded a valuation allowance on its net deferred assets 
to the extent that it becomes more likely than not that the deferred assets would be realized  the company would be required to reverse all or a portion of the valuation allowance 
reducing the amount of valuation allowance would have the affect of reducing the company s effective tax rate and have a positive impact on net income in the period of change 
warranties all products are guaranteed to perform pursuant to company policy for each product type when stored and used as directed 
warranty is limited to replacement of defective product returned at no cost to the customer 
while the company s warranty costs have historically not been significant  the company cannot guarantee that it will continue to experience the same warranty return rates that it has in the past 
a significant increase in product return rates could have a material adverse impact on operating results for the period or periods in which such returns materialize
