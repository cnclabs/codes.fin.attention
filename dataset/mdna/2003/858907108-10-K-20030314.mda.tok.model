critical accounting estimates the company s accounting policies are integral to understanding the results reported 
accounting policies are described in detail in note a to the consolidated financial statements in this annual report 
the company believes that of its significant accounting policies  the allowance for credit losses may involve a higher degree of judgment and complexity allowance for credit losses the allowance for credit losses is a valuation allowance for probable losses incurred on loans 
loans are charged to the allowance when the loss actually occurs or when a determination is made that a probable loss has occurred 
recoveries are credited to the allowance at the time of recovery 
throughout the year  management estimates the probable level of losses to determine whether the allowance for credit losses is adequate to absorb losses in the existing portfolio 
based on these estimates  an amount is charged to the provision for credit losses and credited to the allowance for credit losses in order to adjust the allowance to a level determined to be adequate to absorb losses 
management s judgment as to the level of probable losses on existing loans involves the consideration of current economic conditions and their estimated effects on specific borrowers  an evaluation of the existing relationships among loans  potential credit losses and the present level of the allowance  results of examinations of the loan portfolio by regulatory agencies  and management s internal review of the loan portfolio 
in determining the collectibility of certain loans  management also considers the fair value of any underlying collateral 
the amount ultimately realized may differ from the carrying value of these assets because of economic  operating or other conditions beyond the company s control 
please refer to the subsequent discussion of allowance for credit losses below as well as note a to the consolidated financial statements in this annual report for additional insight into management s approach and methodology in estimating the allowance for credit losses

loans held for sale loans held for sale totaled million at december   an increase from million at december  the million  or  increase is due to the increase in loans funded by the bank through an intercompany mortgage warehouse line of credit with scmc 
mortgage loans originated by scmc are held for sale and are typically sold to investors within one month of origination 
due to the timing of the sales of loans to investors  the balance of these loans at any given time is somewhat volatile 
loan fundings by scmc increased billion from billion funded in to billion funded in risk elements nonperforming  past due  and restructured loans are fully or substantially secured by assets  with any excess of loan balances over collateral values specifically allocated in the allowance for credit losses 
the bank receives  on an ongoing basis  updated appraisals on loans secured by real estate  particularly those categorized as nonperforming loans and potential problem loans 
in those instances where updated appraisals reflect reduced collateral values  an evaluation of the borrower s overall financial condition is made to determine the need  if any  for possible write downs or appropriate additions to the allowance for credit losses 
the bank defines potential problem loans as those loans not classified as nonperforming  but where information known by management indicates serious doubt that the borrower will be able to comply with the present payment terms 
management identifies these loans through its continuous loan review process and classifies potential problem loans as those loans graded as substandard  doubtful  or loss  excluding all nonperforming loans 
the bank s increase in potential problem loans can be directly attributed to acquisitions  loan growth and economic conditions 
the bank had no material foreign loans outstanding or loan concentrations for the years ended december  through the bank  however  continues to monitor the potential risk of foreign borrowers and concentrations of credit 
the following table presents information regarding non performing loans and assets as of december      and in thousands nonaccrual loans      restructured loans  total nonperforming loans      real estate acquired by foreclosure      other repossessed assets total nonperforming assets      nonperforming loans to total loans nonperforming assets to total assets potential problem loans      accruing loans past due days or more  total loans      total assets      allowance for credit losses the bank has several systems in place to assist in maintaining the overall quality of its loan portfolios 
the bank has established underwriting guidelines to be followed by its bank officers 
the bank also monitors its delinquency levels for any negative or adverse trends and particularly monitors credits which have a total exposure of  or more 
however  there can be no assurance that the bank s loan portfolios will not become subject to increasing pressures from deteriorating borrower creditworthiness due to general economic conditions 
the allowance for credit losses is a reserve established through charges to earnings in the form of a provision for credit losses 
based on an evaluation of the loan portfolio  management presents a quarterly review of the allowance for credit losses to the bank s board of directors  indicating any changes in the allowance since the last review and any recommendations as to adjustments in the allowance 
in making its evaluation  management considers the industry diversification of the bank s commercial loan portfolio and the effect of changes in the local real estate market on collateral values 
the bank also considers the results of recent regulatory examinations 
the bank continues to monitor the effects of current economic indicators and their probable impact on borrowers  the amount of charge offs for the period  the amount of non performing loans and related collateral security 
the bank monitors the loan portfolio through its internal loan review department 
charge offs occur when loans are deemed to be uncollectible 
the bank follows a loan review program to evaluate the credit risk in the commercial loan portfolio for substantially all commercial loans and real estate loans 
through the loan review process  the bank maintains an internally classified loan list  which  along with the delinquency list of loans  helps management assess the overall quality of the loan portfolios and the adequacy of the allowance for credit losses 
loans classified as substandard are those loans with clear and defined weaknesses such as highly leveraged positions  unfavorable financial ratios  uncertain repayment sources or poor financial condition  which may jeopardize recoverability of the debt 
loans classified as doubtful are those loans which have characteristics similar to substandard accounts but with an increased risk that a loss may occur  or at least a portion of the loan may require a charge off if liquidated at present 
although loans classified as substandard do not duplicate loans classified as doubtful  both substandard and doubtful loans include some loans that are delinquent at least days or on nonaccrual status 
loans classified as loss are those loans that are in the process of being charged off 
at december   substandard loans totaled million  of which million were loans designated as delinquent or nonaccrual  and doubtful loans totaled million of which million were designated as delinquent or nonaccrual 
in addition to the internally classified loan list and delinquency list of loans  the bank maintains a separate watch list which further aids the bank in monitoring loan portfolios 
watch list loans show warning elements where the present status portrays one or more deficiencies that require attention in the short run or where pertinent ratios of the loan account have weakened to a point where more frequent monitoring is warranted 
these loans do not have all the characteristics of a classified loan substandard or doubtful but do show weakened elements as compared with those of a satisfactory credit 
the bank reviews these loans to assist in assessing the adequacy of the allowance for credit losses 
as of december   watch list loans totaled million 
management assigns loan grades by loan and allocations are made within each loan grade so that double allocations are avoided 
loans are assigned a grade according to payment history  collateral values  and financial condition of the borrower 
the bank maintains an adequate allowance for credit losses through its watchlist classifications  allocating an increasing reserve amount as the severity of a problem loan increases 
the bank maintains an unallocated reserve for satisfactory non classified credits based on the average of the last three year s actual net charge offs 
the company has formed a sub committee for asset quality in which meets eight times each year 
that committee is composed of three outside members of the company s board of directors and five senior members of the bank s management 
this committee reviews all large loans  past dues  and overdrafts  as well as ratio and trend analysis and approves all charge offs over  this committee also mandates action items for future meetings to evaluate potential problems and assess the potential need for additional reserve requirements by any particular sector

interest rate sensitivity and liquidity the company manages its interest rate risk through structuring the balance sheet to maximize net interest income while maintaining an acceptable level of risk to changes in market interest rates 
this process requires a balance between profitability  liquidity  and interest rate risk 
to effectively measure and manage interest rate risk  the company uses simulation analysis to determine the impact on net interest income of changes in interest rates under various interest rate scenarios  balance sheet trends  and strategies 
from these simulations  interest rate risk is quantified and appropriate strategies are developed and implemented 
the overall interest rate risk position and strategies are reviewed by senior management  the asset liability management committee and the company s board of directors on an ongoing basis 
an interest rate sensitive asset or liability is one that  within a defined time period  either matures or experiences an interest rate change in line with general market interest rates 
the management of interest rate risk is performed by analyzing the maturity and repricing relationships between interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities at specific points in time gap and by analyzing the effects of interest rate changes on net interest income over specific periods of time by projecting the performance of the mix of assets and liabilities in varied interest rate environments 
interest rate sensitivity reflects the potential effect on net interest income of a movement in interest rates 
a company is considered to be asset sensitive  or having a positive gap  when the amount of its interest earning assets maturing or repricing within a given period exceeds the amount of its interest bearing liabilities also maturing or repricing within that time period 
conversely  a company is considered to be liability sensitive  or having a negative gap  when the amount of its interest bearing liabilities maturing or repricing within a given period exceeds the amount of its interest earning assets also maturing or repricing within that time period 
during a period of rising interest rates  a negative gap would tend to adversely affect net interest income  while a positive gap would tend to result in an increase in net interest income 
during a period of falling interest rates  a negative gap would tend to result in an increase in net interest income  while a positive gap would tend to affect net interest income adversely 
when analyzing its gap position  the company emphasizes the next twelve month period 
the company s net interest income is positioned to benefit from rising short term rates due to an asset sensitive position 
the company would likely benefit from an increase in short term interest rates as this might signify that economic conditions are improving 
in addition  an increase in short term interest rates would likely affect the company s fixed rate variable rate product origination mix and origination volumes and would likely slow prepayments 
however  even in the current interest rate environment  the company s loan demand remains strong 
also  management continues to evaluate the company s lending rates and those rates may not be adjusted downward on a basis that is entirely consistent with short term interest rate trends should such trends reflect a further decrease in rates 
while this asset sensitivity may compress net interest income in the short term or if the current interest rate environment continues for an extended period of time  the company believes this asset sensitive position is justified because current rates are well below historical averages and  consequently  there is a greater possibility over time of higher interest rates versus lower interest rates 
however  if interest rates remain stable or decrease  the company could continue to experience an increase in prepayments of commercial loans  mortgage backed securities and  with respect to scmc  mortgage servicing rights and may experience further compression of net interest margin or net interest income 
as mentioned  the company utilizes simulation models to estimate the impact on net interest income of changes in interest rates under various scenarios 
based on simulation analysis of the interest rate sensitivity inherent in the company s net interest income and market value of portfolio equity  as of december  and as adjusted by instantaneous rate changes upward and downward of up to basis points  the company is slightly asset sensitive 
the company s analysis indicates that an instantaneous basis point move downward in interest rates would decrease net interest income by and decrease the present value of equity by  likewise  an instantaneous basis point move upward in interest rates would increase net interest income by and increase the present value of equity by 
these sensitivities are all within the threshold set by the company s asset liability committee 
each rate scenario reflects unique prepayment and repricing assumptions 
since there are limitations inherent in any methodology used to estimate the exposure to changes in market interest rates  this analysis is not intended to be a forecast of the actual effect of a change in market interest rates on the company 
the company s interest rate sensitivity analysis includes assumptions that i the composition of the company s interest sensitive assets and liabilities existing at fiscal year end will remain constant over the measurement period  and ii that changes in market rates are parallel and instantaneous across the yield curve regardless of duration or repricing characteristics of specific assets or liabilities 
further  the analysis does not contemplate any actions that the company might undertake in response to changes in market interest rates 
accordingly  this analysis is not intended to and does not provide a precise forecast of the effect actual changes in market rates will have on the company 
the following table sets forth the expected maturity and repricing characteristics of the company s interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities as of december  over days days years years years total in thousands  except for data expressed in percentages interest earning assets cash and cash equivalents   deposits in other financial institutions  trading assets   securities       loans       total interest earning assets       interest bearing liabilities demand and savings deposits   certificates of deposit and other time deposits      other borrowed funds   notes payable   total interest bearing liabilities      period gap       cumulative gap      period gap to total assets cumulative gap to total assets shortcomings are inherent in any gap analysis since certain assets and liabilities may not reprice proportionally as interest rates change 
the company s management has begun to utilize an interest rate risk simulation model to increase its ability to monitor and forecast the effect of various interest rate environments on earnings and its net capital position 
the objectives of the company s liquidity management is to maintain the bank s ability to meet day to day deposit withdrawals and other payment obligations  to raise funds to support asset growth  to maintain reserve requirements and otherwise operate the company on an ongoing basis 
the company strives to manage its liquidity position to allow the bank to meet its requirements while maintaining an appropriate balance between assets and liabilities to meet the return on investment expectations of the company s shareholders 
in recent years  the company s liquidity needs have primarily been met by growth in core deposits 
the acquisitions of caminoreal bancshares and community bancshares during and enb bankshares in resulted in the receipt of an additional million in core deposits 
in addition to core deposits  the bank has access to purchased funds from correspondent banks and from the federal home loan bank  supplemented by amortizing investment and loan portfolios 
also in  the bank began accepting brokered certificates of deposit 
the company is a separate and distinct entity from the bank and must provide for its own liquidity and fund its obligations 
the primary source of the company s revenues are from dividends declared by the bank 
there are statutory and regulatory provisions that could limit the ability of the bank to pay dividends to the company 
at december   the bank had approximately million in the aggregate available to be paid as dividends to the company 
it is not anticipated that such restrictions will have an impact on the ability of the company to meet its ongoing cash obligations 
as of december   the company did not have any material commitments for capital expenditures 
contractual obligations and other commitments the company s future cash payments associated with its contractual obligations pursuant to its notes payable  trust preferred securities and operating leases are as follows in thousands less than over one year years years years total operating leases      notes payable   trust preferred securities   total      the company s commitments associated with commitments to extend credit  outstanding letters of credit and mortgages sold with recourse as of december  are summarized below in thousands

risk factors and cautionary statement for purposes of the provisions of the safe harbor provisions of the private securities litigation reform act of some of the statements and information contained in this annual report may contain forward looking statements within the meaning of the private securities litigation reform act of forward looking statements discuss future expectations  activities or events and by their nature  they are subject to risks and uncertainties 
forward looking statements can be identified by the fact that they do not relate strictly to historical or current facts 
they often include words such as believe  expect  anticipate  intend  plan  estimate  or words of similar meaning  or future or conditional verbs such as will  would  should  could  or may 
forward looking statements speak only as of the date they are made 
we will not update these forward looking statements to reflect circumstances or events that occur after the date the forward looking statements are made 
many possible factors could affect our future financial performance 
our actual results may differ materially from what is expressed in any forward looking statement 
important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from estimates or projections contained in forward looking statements include general business and economic conditions in the markets we serve may be less favorable than anticipated which could decrease the demand for loan  deposit and other financial services and increase loan delinquencies and defaults  changes in market rates and prices may adversely impact the value of securities  loans  deposits and other financial instruments  our liquidity requirements could be adversely affected by changes in our assets and liabilities  legislative or regulatory developments including changes in laws concerning taxes  banking  securities  insurance and other aspects of the financial securities industry  competitive factors  including product and pricing pressures among financial services organizations  may increase  and fiscal and governmental policies of the united states federal government 
with this in mind  you should consider the following important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed in any forward looking statement made by us or on our behalf our profitability depends significantly on local economic conditions 
our success depends primarily on the general economic conditions of the houston metropolitan area 
unlike larger banks that are more geographically diversified  we provide banking and financial services to customers primarily in the houston metropolitan area 
we also provide  to a lesser extent  banking and financial services to customers in the san antonio and dallas metropolitan areas 
the local economic conditions of houston  and to a lesser extent  san antonio and dallas  have a significant impact on our commercial  real estate and construction loans  the ability of the borrowers to repay these loans and the value of the collateral securing these loans 
a significant decline in general economic conditions  such as inflation  recession  acts of terrorism  an outbreak of hostilities  unemployment and other factors beyond our control will impact these local economic conditions and will negatively affect the financial results of our banking operations 
in addition  since houston remains largely dependent on the energy industry  the recent downturn in the energy industry and energy related businesses has adversely affected the economic conditions of the houston metropolitan area 
this downturn in the energy industry and the energy related business could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 
we rely on an owner operated business market 
we target our business development and marketing strategy primarily to serve the banking and financial needs of owner operated businesses with credit needs of up to million 
these owner operated businesses represent a major sector of the houston and national economies 
if general economic conditions negatively impact this economic sector in the houston metropolitan area or the other texas markets in which we operate  our results of operations and financial condition will be significantly affected 
if our allowance for loan losses is not sufficient to cover actual loan losses  our earnings could decrease 
our loan customers may not repay their loans according to the terms of these loans and the collateral securing the payment of these loans may be insufficient to assure repayment 
we may experience significant credit losses which could have a material adverse effect on our operating results 
we make various assumptions and judgments about the collectibility of our loan portfolio  including the creditworthiness of our borrowers and the value of the real estate and other assets serving as collateral for the repayment of many of our loans 
in determining the size of the allowance  we rely on our experience and our evaluation of economic conditions 
if our assumptions prove to be incorrect  our current allowance may not be sufficient to cover future loan losses and adjustments may be necessary to allow for different economic conditions or adverse developments in our loan portfolio 
material additions to our allowance would materially decrease our net income 
in addition  federal and state regulators periodically review our allowance for loan losses and may require us to increase our provision for loan losses or recognize further loan charge offs  based on judgments different than those or our management 
any increase in our loan allowance or loan charge offs as required by these regulatory agencies could have a negative effect on us 
fluctuations in interest rates could reduce our profitability 
we realize income primarily from the difference between interest earned on loans and investments and the interest paid on deposits and borrowings 
we expect that we will periodically experience gaps in the interest rate sensitivities of our assets and liabilities  meaning that either our interest bearing liabilities will be more sensitive to changes in market interest rates than our interest earning assets  or vice versa 
in either event  if market interest rates should move contrary to our position  this gap will work against us  and our earnings may be negatively affected 
we are unable to predict fluctuations of market interest rates  which are affected by the following factors inflation  recession  a rise in unemployment  tightening money supply  international disorder and instability in domestic and foreign financial markets  and instability in domestic and foreign financial markets 
our asset liability management strategy  which is designed to control our risk from changes in market interest rates  may not be able to prevent changes in interest rates from having a material adverse effect on our results of operation and financial condition 
competition with other financial institutions could adversely affect our profitability 
we face vigorous competition from banks and other financial institutions  including savings and loan associations  savings banks  finance companies and credit unions 
a number of these banks and other financial institutions have substantially greater resources and lending limits  larger branch systems and a wider array of banking services 
to a limited extent  we also compete with other providers of financial services  such as money market mutual funds  brokerage firms  consumer finance companies and insurance companies 
this competition may reduce or limit our margins on banking services  reduce our market share and adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 
we may not be able to maintain our historical growth rate which may adversely impact our results of operations and financial condition 
to achieve our growth  we have initiated internal growth programs  completed various acquisitions and opened additional branches in the past few years 
we may not be able to sustain our historical rate of growth or may not even be able to grow at all 
we may not be able to obtain the financing necessary to fund additional growth and may not be able to find suitable candidates for acquisition 
various factors  such as economic conditions and competition  may impede or prohibit the opening of new branch offices 
further  our inability to attract and retain experienced bankers may adversely affect our internal growth 
a significant decrease in our historical rate of growth may adversely impact our results of operation and financial condition 
we may be unable to complete acquisitions  and once complete  may not be able to integrate our acquisitions successfully 
our growth strategy is dependent on our ability to acquire other financial institutions 
we may not be able to complete any future acquisitions and  if completed  we may not be able to successfully integrate the operations  management  products and services of the entities we acquire 
following each acquisition  we must expend substantial managerial  operating  financial and other resources to integrate these entities 
in particular  we may be required to install and standardize adequate operational and control systems  deploy or modify equipment  implement marketing efforts in new as well as existing locations and employ and maintain qualified personnel 
our failure to successfully integrate the entities we acquire into our existing operations may adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 
we operate in a highly regulated environment and may be adversely affected by changes in federal and local laws and regulations 
we are subject to extensive regulation  supervision and examination by federal and state banking authorities 
any change in applicable regulations or federal or state legislation could have a substantial impact on us and our subsidiary  sterling bank  and its operations 
additional legislation and regulations may be enacted or adopted in the future that could significantly affect our powers  authority and operations  which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
further  regulators have significant discretion and power to prevent or remedy unsafe or unsound practices or violations of laws by banks and bank holding companies in the performance of their supervisory and enforcement duties 
the exercise of this regulatory discretion and power may have a negative impact on us
