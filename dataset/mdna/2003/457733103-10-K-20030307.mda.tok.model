we evaluate our estimates on an ongoing basis 
these estimates are based on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
the results of these estimates form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
we operate in a highly competitive environment that involves a number of risks  some of which are beyond our control 
statements contained in management s discussion and analysis of financial conditions and results of operations which are not historical facts are  or may constitute  forward looking statements

overview we were incorporated in october and commenced operations in march following our first substantial financing and licensing of our technology 
since that time  we have been engaged in the discovery and development of novel pharmaceutical products 
our technologies are based in part on exclusive license agreements with the university of north carolina at chapel hill for rights to certain developments 
to date  we have not derived any commercial revenues from product sales and we do not expect to receive sales revenues for at least one year 
we have devoted substantially all of our efforts to discovery and clinical development of our product candidates as well as establishing strategic partnerships for the development and potential marketing of our products when approved 
currently  we have five product candidates in clinical development  all of which are py agonists 
we have completed our phase ii program and two phase iii trials in diquafosol tetrasodium ins for the treatment of dry eye 
we have an ongoing phase iiib trial and we expect to file a nda in we completed one phase ii trial for ins intranasal for the treatment of perennial allergic rhinitis in august of and a phase ii trial for the treatment of the common cold in november we have a phase iii trial for ins intranasal in chronic rhinitis ongoing 
ins diagnostic is in a phase iii clinical trial 
our phase i ii trial for ins ophthalmic for the treatment of retinal disease was completed in october  we expect to launch a phase ii trial in our phase i ii trial for ins respiratory for the treatment of cystic fibrosis was completed in october  the program is moving into phase ii testing in early we have decided to discontinue the global development of ins respiratory for chronic bronchitis  which has been on hold since january  as a result of the high cost and difficulty of conducting clinical trials in the chronic bronchitis patient population and the availability of other near term product opportunities 
as a result of our discontinuance of the program  kissei pharmaceuticals  inc determined to cease the development of ins respiratory in japan and we agreed to terminate our joint development  license and supply agreement with kissei in november upon termination of the agreement  kissei returned to inspire all rights to ins respiratory 
during the term of the agreement we received an aggregate of million in equity  up front  milestone and employee reimbursement payments from kissei 
the milestone and up front payments were non refundable 
we have incurred significant operating losses since our inception and  as of december   we had an accumulated deficit of million 
we have primarily financed our operations through proceeds received from the sale of equity securities including private sales of preferred stock and the sale of common stock in our initial public offering  as well as revenues received under corporate collaborations 
we operate in a single business segment and do not have any foreign operations 
in october of  we entered into a collaboration with cfft for the funding of a phase ii study in ins respiratory for the treatment of cystic fibrosis 
under the agreement  cfft agreed to provide the majority of funding of the external costs for a phase ii trial of ins respiratory in exchange for post commercialization milestone payments 
in june  we entered into a joint license  development and marketing agreement with allergan to develop and commercialize diquafosol tetrasodium and allergan s restasis 
under the agreement  we may receive up to million in up front and milestone payments 
we will also receive royalty payments from allergan on sales  if any  of both diquafosol tetrasodium and on allergan s restasis worldwide  excluding most larger asian markets 
in december  restasis was approved for sale by the fda and allergan has indicated that it expects to launch restasis in the united states in the second quarter of we will be entitled to receive royalties on sales of restasis beginning one year after the launch 
the agreement also provides for potential co promotion by inspire of diquafosol tetrasodium and restasis and one or more of allergan s other marketed products in the united states 
in september  we entered into a license agreement with kirin for the development and commercialization of ins diagnostic 
under the agreement we granted kirin an exclusive license to commercialize ins diagnostic in most of asia 
under the terms of the agreement  we received an up front payment in cash and may receive milestone payments based on clinical success and regulatory approval 
we may also receive royalties on net sales of this product 
in december  we entered into a development  license and supply agreement with santen for the development of diquafosol tetrasodium for the therapeutic treatment of ocular surface diseases 
we are obligated to supply santen with its requirements of diquafosol tetrasodium in bulk drug substance form for all preclinical studies  clinical trials and commercial requirements at agreed upon prices 
under the agreement  we received an up front equity investment of million for shares of our stock and a milestone payment of  in addition  if all milestones are met  we could receive additional payments of up to million  as well as royalties on net sales of licensed products 
significant accounting policies revenue recognition we recognize revenue under our collaborative research and development agreements when we have performed services under such agreements or when we or our collaborative partner has met a contractual milestone triggering a payment to us 
non refundable fees received at the initiation of collaborative agreements for which we have an ongoing research and development commitment are deferred and recognized ratably over the period of ongoing research and clinical development commitment 
we are also entitled to receive milestone payments under our collaborative research and development agreements based upon achievement of development milestones by us or our collaborative partners 
we recognize milestone payments as revenues ratably over the remaining period of our research and clinical development commitment 
the recognition period begins at the date the milestone is achieved and acknowledged by the collaborative partner  which is generally at the date payment is received from the collaborative partner  and ends on the date that we have fulfilled our research and clinical development commitment 
this period is based on estimates by management and the progress towards milestones in our collaborative agreements 
the estimate is subject to revision as our development efforts progress and we gain knowledge regarding required additional development 
revisions in the commitment period are made in the period that the facts related to the change first become known 
this may cause our revenue to fluctuate from period to period 
we have revised our estimates on two occasions 
the first revision was due to the termination of our development  license and supply agreement with genentech and resulted in the acceleration of deferred revenue by one month 
the revision had no effect on our quarterly results of operations because the revenue would have been fully recognized by the end of the quarter had the revision not occurred 
the second revision was due to an extension of the commitment period related to the development of diquafosol tetrasodium and increased the revenue recognition period by six months 
taxes significant management judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes  deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowance recorded against net deferred tax assets 
we have recorded a valuation allowance of million as of december   due to uncertainties related to our ability to utilize deferred tax assets  primarily consisting of certain net operating losses carried forward  before they expire 
the valuation allowance is based on estimates of taxable income in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate and the period over which our deferred tax assets will be recoverable 
results of operations years ended december   and revenues our revenues for the year ended december  were million compared to million in and million in revenues in each year were derived primarily from collaborative research and development agreements with strategic partners 
under these agreements we received payments based both on our achievement  and our partners achievement  of defined development milestones 
milestone payments from our collaborative partners are recognized over the period of ongoing research and development commitment under the applicable collaborative research and development agreements with the respective companies 
the decrease in revenues relate to the termination of our collaborative agreements with genentech and kissei  which resulted in no revenue related to these agreements being recorded in in revenues relate to an up front payment received from kirin in the fourth quarter of  an up front payment from allergan in the third quarter of and a milestone payment received from allergan in the second quarter in the increase in revenues in over relate to milestone payments received pursuant to the execution of a license  development and marketing agreement with allergan in the third quarter of the revenues in relate to milestone payments received from genentech and kissei in the fourth quarter of and the milestone payments received from kissei  santen and kirin during costs and expenses research and development expenses include all direct costs  including salaries for our research and development personnel  consulting fees  clinical trial costs  sponsored research  clinical trial insurance  and other fees and costs related to the development of product candidates 
costs associated with obtaining and maintaining patents and licenses on our drug compounds are evaluated based on the stage of development of the related drug compound and whether the underlying compound has an alternative use 
costs of these types incurred for drug compounds not yet approved by the fda and for which no alternative use exists are recorded as research and development expense 
in the event the drug compound has been approved by the fda or an alternative use exists for the drug compound  patent costs and license costs are capitalized and amortized over the expected life of the related drug compound 
milestone payments are recognized when the underlying requirement is met by us 
research and development expenses for the year ended december  were million  compared to million in and million in research and development expenses vary according to the number of programs in pre clinical and clinical development and the stage of development of our clinical programs 
later stage clinical programs tend to cost more than earlier stage programs  due to the length of the trial and the number of patients enrolled in later stage clinical trials 
the decrease in research and development expenses in compared to was due to our efforts to focus our resources on our higher priority clinical programs in the ophthalmology and respiratory areas while reducing the number of high priority programs from six to four 
this decision resulted in an overall reduction of research and development expenses of approximately in as compared to despite the overall reduction in regarding ophthalmology programs  inspire increased the financial resources dedicated to several of its core programs 
the programs of primary focus were indications for dry eye  upper respiratory disorders  lung cancer diagnostics and cystic fibrosis 
research and development expenses relating to our dry eye candidate diquafosol tetrasodium in were greater than in because of increased costs in that year associated with two phase iii trials  including the enrollment of patients  during in  costs were less as one study was completed in january and the second was completed in june 
in addition  we reduced indirect unallocated development costs with respect to certain pre clinical and early stage clinical research and development programs 
the increase in research and development expense for over was primarily due to increased external costs related to patent activities  research costs  preclinical testing  toxicology studies  clinical development activities  including the enrollment of patients in phase iii clinical trials  and increased internal costs associated with additional personnel necessary to perform or manage these activities 
as described in the following table  our research and development expenses from inception through december  were approximately million 
of this amount  we have spent the following approximate amounts on external pre clinical and clinical development for the indicated product candidates million on ins diagnostic  million on diquafosol tetrasodium ins  million on ins respiratory  million on ins intranasal and million on ins ophthalmic 
the balance of our historic research and development expenses  million  includes internal personnel costs of our discovery and development programs  internal and external general research related to the discovery and development of our technology  and internal and external expenses of other drug discovery and development programs 
we cannot reasonably predict future research and development expenses for these programs  however  historical trends indicate that expenses tend to increase in later phases of development 
research and development expenses in thousands year ended december  cumulative from inception october  to december  ins diagnostic diquafosol tetrasodium ins ophthalmic ins respiratory ins intranasal ins ophthalmic indirect unallocated development costs total general and administrative costs for the year ended december  were million  compared to million in and million in our general and administrative expenses consist primarily of personnel and related costs for general corporate functions  including business development  finance  accounting  legal  human resources  facilities and information systems 
the decrease in general and administrative expenses in resulted from our efforts to focus our resources on our higher priority clinical programs in the ophthalmic and respiratory areas 
by focusing our clinical efforts  we were able to reduce the corporate and administrative efforts needed to support the company 
the decreases occurred primarily in personnel costs and decreases in additional professional services  including legal and public relation expense 
the increase in general and administrative expenses in over resulted primarily from increases in administrative personnel costs  and increases in insurance and additional professional services  including legal  accounting and public relations services  to support our strategic business collaborations and operations as a publicly traded company 
other income expense other income expense  net totaled  for the year ended december   compared to million for and million for other income expense  net fluctuates from year to year  and is comprised of the interest income earned on cash balances decreased by interest expense on leased equipment and amortization of debt issuance costs 
the decrease in resulted from lower interest income earned on smaller cash balances than in the increase in over was due to higher interest income earned from larger average cash and investment balances partially offset by increased interest expense related to leased equipment and amortization of debt issuance costs 
income taxes the provision for income taxes for the year ended december  was  compared to in and  in the fluctuations in the provision for income taxes are directly attributable to japanese withholding taxes paid on milestone payments received from japanese collaborative partners 
net loss net loss consists of revenues less operating expenses  other income expense  net  income taxes and dividends 
net loss was million for the year ended december   compared to million in and million in the increase in net loss was primarily due to a decrease in revenues recognized on collaborative research agreements and a decrease in other income expense  net which was partially offset by a decrease in research and development expenses 
we have incurred net losses since our inception and will continue to incur losses in the future 
liquidity and capital resources historically  we have financed our operations through the sale of equity securities  including private sales of preferred stock and the sale of common stock in our initial public offering 
as of december   our cash and cash equivalents totaled million  a decrease of million as compared to december  the decrease in cash and cash equivalents resulted from approximately million in cash used by operations  purchase of property  plant and equipment of  and the payments of capital lease obligations of  which was partially offset by the proceeds of net investments in investment grade securities of million and the issuance of common stock of  cash used by operations of million for the year ended december   represented the net loss of million  non cash expenses of million and a decrease of  in receivables  partially off set by an increase of  in prepaid expenses  an increase of  in other assets  a decrease of  in accounts payable  a decrease of  in accrued expenses and a decrease of million in deferred revenue 
cash used in our investing activities for the year ended december  was comprised of the proceeds of investment grade securities  net of maturities  of million and the purchase of property and equipment totaling  cash from our financing activities for the year ended december  was comprised of proceeds in the amount of  from the issuance of common stock offset by the payment of capital lease obligations of  we do not expect to generate revenues  other than possible license and milestone payments  from the commercial sale of our products unless and until we or our licensees receive marketing clearance from the fda and appropriate regulatory agencies in other countries 
we cannot predict the timing of any potential marketing clearance nor can assurances be given that the fda or other such agencies will approve any of our product candidates 
we expect that we will need to raise additional funds in we have contractual commitments or purchase arrangements with various clinical research organizations  manufacturers of drug product and others 
most of these arrangements are for a period of less than months 
the amount of our financial commitments under these arrangements totals approximately million at december  this estimate is dependent upon the results of the underlying studies and certain other variable components that may yield a result that differs from management s estimate 
also  at december   we have future contractual commitments to pay million of lease obligations for our administrative offices  laboratory facilities and equipment  of this amount   is payable in fiscal   is payable in fiscal and  is payable in fiscal finally  we have entered into license and collaboration agreements with unc and cfft 
under our unc licenses  we may be required to make additional milestone payments of million in the future 
under our cfft agreement  we may be required to make milestone payments in excess of million

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates to the increase or decrease in the amount of interest income we can earn on our investment portfolio and on the increase or decrease in the amount of interest expense we must pay with respect to various outstanding debt instruments 
our risk associated with fluctuating interest expense is limited  however  to capital lease obligations 
the interest rates are closely tied to market rates and our investments in interest rate sensitive financial instruments 
under our current policies  we do not use interest rate derivative instruments to manage exposure to interest rate changes 
we attempt to ensure the safety and preservation of invested principal funds by limiting default risk  market risk and reinvestment risk 
we reduce default risk by investing in investment grade securities 
a hypothetical basis point drop in interest rates along the entire interest rate yield curve would not significantly affect the fair value of our interest sensitive financial instruments at december  or december  declines in interest rates over time will  however  reduce our interest income while increases in interest rates over time will increase interest expense
