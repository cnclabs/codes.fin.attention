item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview we are a leading provider of human capital development and management solutions  which are designed to increase organizational performance through the implementation of a management system for aligning  developing and managing people 
our solutions can help large enterprises to efficiently manage regulatory compliance  increase sales and channel readiness  accelerate time to competency of people across the extended enterprise  increase speed of customer acquisition  shorten time to market of new products and increase visibility into organizational performance 

table of contents general we commenced operations in april and  through march  focused substantially all of our efforts on research activities  developing our products and building our business infrastructure 
we shipped our first saba learning products and began to generate revenues from software license fees  implementation and consulting services fees and support fees in april we began to operate saba exchange in december and our application service provider asp edition of saba learning in september  and first shipped our limited release version of saba performance in may to date  we have not generated significant revenues from saba exchange  saba learning asp edition or saba performance 
sources of revenues and revenue recognition to date  we have generated revenues primarily from licensing saba enterprise learning suite  and providing related services  including implementation  consulting  support  hosting and education 
we recognize revenues in accordance with the provisions of american institute of certified public accountants aicpa statement of position sop  software revenue recognition  as amended by sop  modification of sop  software revenue recognition  with respect to certain transactions 
under sop  as amended  we recognize revenues when all of the following conditions are met persuasive evidence of an agreement exists  delivery of the product has occurred  the fee is fixed or determinable  and collection of these fees is probable 
sop  as amended  requires revenue earned on software arrangements involving multiple elements to be allocated to each element based on the relative fair values of the elements 
we have analyzed each element in our multiple element arrangements and determined that we have sufficient vendor specific objective evidence vsoe to allocate revenues to support  consulting and education services 
accordingly  assuming all other revenue recognition criteria are met  revenues from perpetual licenses are recognized upon delivery using the residual method in accordance with sop we limit our assessment of vsoe for each element to either the price charged when the same element is sold separately or the price established by management  having the relevant authority to do so  for an element not yet sold separately 
a substantial majority of our licenses entered into from november  to august  included rights to unspecified additional platform versions of our software  extended payment terms and or services essential to the functionality of the software 
for licenses that included rights to unspecified additional platform versions  we recognized license revenues ratably over the period during which we were required to provide the additional platform versions beginning in the month when all other revenue recognition criteria had been met 
revenue from contracts with extended payment terms is recognized at the lesser of amounts due and payable or the amount of the arrangement fee otherwise recognizable 
for contracts that involve significant customization and implementation or consulting services that are essential to the functionality of the software  the license and services revenues are recognized over the service delivery period using the percentage of completion method 
we use labor hours incurred as a percentage of total expected hours as the measure of progress towards completion 
a substantial majority of our licenses entered into after august  do not provide for unspecified additional platform versions  extended payment terms or services that are essential to the functionality of the software 
revenues derived from these licenses are recognized on delivery if the other conditions of sop are satisfied 
revenues from our application service provider offering and from our hosting services are generally recognized ratably over the term of the arrangement 
support revenue is recognized ratably over the support term  typically months  and revenue related to implementation  consulting  education and other services is generally recognized as the services are performed 
although we primarily provide implementation and consulting services on a time and materials basis  a significant portion of these services is provided on a fixed fee basis 

table of contents cost of revenues our cost of revenues includes cost of our license revenues and cost of our services revenues 
our cost of license revenues includes the cost of manuals and product documentation  production media  shipping costs and royalties to third parties 
our cost of services revenues includes salaries and related expenses for our professional services organization  as well as third party hosting costs and billed expenses 
because our cost of services revenues is greater than cost of license revenues  cost of total revenues as a percentage of total revenues may fluctuate based on the mix of licenses and services sold 
operating expenses our operating expenses are classified into three general operational categories research and development  sales and marketing  and general and administrative 
in addition  our operating expenses include amortization of deferred stock compensation and other stock charges  and amortization of purchased intangible assets 
we classify all charges  except stock compensation and other stock charges  to the research and development  sales and marketing and general and administrative expense categories based on the nature of the expenses 
each of these three categories includes commonly recurring expenses such as salaries  employee benefits  travel and entertainment costs  and allocated communication  rent and depreciation costs 
we allocate these expenses to each of the functional areas that derive a benefit from such expenses based upon their respective headcounts 
the sales and marketing category of operating expenses also includes sales commissions and expenses related to public relations and advertising  trade shows and marketing collateral materials 
the general and administrative category of operating expenses also includes allowances for doubtful accounts and administrative and professional services fees 
in connection with the granting of stock options to  and restricted stock purchases by  our employees  prior to our initial public offering  we recorded deferred stock compensation totaling approximately million 
this amount represents the difference between the exercise or purchase price  as applicable  and the deemed fair value of our common stock for financial accounting purposes on the date these stock options were granted or purchase agreements for restricted stock were signed 
as of may   deferred stock compensation amounted to  and will result in additional charges to operations through fiscal our march acquisition of human performance technologies  inc resulted in purchased intangible assets of million  and our june acquisition of ultris inc resulted in goodwill of million and purchased intangible assets of million 
purchased intangible assets consist of intellectual property  customer base and noncompetition agreements 
the intangible assets are stated at cost less accumulated amortization and are being amortized on a straight line basis over their estimated useful lives of six months to three years 
effective june   we adopted sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
as required by sfas no 
 we no longer amortize goodwill  but review it annually or more frequently if impairment indicators arise for impairment 
prior to june   goodwill was being amortized on a straight line basis over its estimated useful life of three years 
there was no acquisition activity during the fiscal year ended may  acquired in process research and development in the fiscal year ended may  represents the write off of the fair value of acquired research and development work obtained in connection with the acquisition of ultris inc for the acquisition of ultris inc  the write off was necessary because the acquired in process research and development had not yet reached technological feasibility and the related products under development had not achieved commercial viability 
we allocated the purchase price of ultris inc with the assistance of an independent appraiser 
values were assigned to acquired developed technology  in process research and development  goodwill and workforce 
the fair value of the acquired in process research and development was determined by estimating the projected net 
table of contents cash flows related to the products  including costs to complete the development of the technology and the future revenues to be earned upon commercialization of the products 
these cash flows were then discounted back to their net present value 
the projected net cash flows from the project were based on management s estimates of future revenues and operating profits 
history of losses we have incurred significant losses and negative cash flows from operations since our inception 
as of may   we had an accumulated deficit of million 
we have not achieved profitability and cannot be certain that we will be able to realize sufficient revenues to achieve or  if achieved  sustain profitability 
we also expect to incur non cash expenses relating to stock compensation  amortization of purchased intangible assets and any potential goodwill impairment 
we need to generate higher revenues in order to achieve profitability 
if we achieve profitability  we may not be able to sustain it 
we had full time employees as of may  to manage future growth of our operations and personnel  we must continue to invest in scalable operational systems  procedures and controls 
we expect any future expansion to continue to challenge our ability to hire  train  manage and retain our employees 
limited operating history we have a limited operating history that makes it difficult to forecast our future operating results 
we believe that period to period comparisons of our operating results should not be relied upon as predictive of future performance 
our prospects must be considered in light of the risks  expenses and difficulties encountered by companies at a relatively early stage of development  particularly companies in new and rapidly evolving markets  such as human capital development and management 
we may not be successful in addressing these risks and difficulties 
results of operations years ended may   and revenues total revenues were million in fiscal  million in fiscal and million in fiscal the decrease in total revenues in fiscal over fiscal is primarily attributable to a decrease in license revenues 
the modest increase in total revenues in fiscal over fiscal is primarily attributable to an increase in license revenues 
as a percentage of total revenues  revenues from customers outside the united states represented in fiscal  in fiscal and in fiscal in fiscal  one customer accounted for of our revenues 
in fiscal and  no customer accounted for more than of our revenues 
license revenues were million in fiscal  or of total revenues  million in fiscal  or of total revenues  and million in fiscal  or of total revenues 
the decrease in license revenues in fiscal over fiscal is primarily attributable to a greater amount of deferred license revenues recognized in fiscal that were attributable to software licenses sold in earlier periods 
as a result  revenues from license sales made in fiscal were essentially flat in comparison to revenues from license sales made in fiscal the increase in license revenues in fiscal over fiscal is primarily attributable to the fact that fewer software licenses included provisions for future deliverables and  as a result  substantially more license revenues were recognized upon delivery in fiscal than in fiscal therefore  license revenues in fiscal increased over the prior fiscal year despite a decline in new software agreements 

table of contents services revenues were million in fiscal  or of total revenues  million in fiscal  or of total revenues  and million in fiscal  or of total revenues 
the decrease in services revenue in fiscal over fiscal is primarily attributable to a decrease in consulting revenues due primarily to a reduction in the average project size resulting from product configuration improvements 
the decrease in services revenue in fiscal over fiscal is primarily attributable to a decrease in consulting revenues as a result of the decline in new software agreements 
the decreases in consulting revenues in both fiscal and fiscal were partially offset by increases in support revenues 
the mix of license and services revenues as a percentage of total revenues has varied significantly due to our relatively early stage of development 
cost of revenues total cost of revenues decreased to million in fiscal  from million in fiscal and million in fiscal the decrease in fiscal over fiscal is primarily attributable to a reduction in consulting personnel in response to a decrease in the consulting component of services revenues and improved labor utilization rates billable hours as a percent of total hours

cost of services revenues represented of services revenues for fiscal  of services revenues for fiscal and of services revenues for fiscal the decrease in the cost of services as a percentage of services revenues in fiscal over fiscal is primarily attributable to increased utilization of our consultants  as well as an increased percentage of higher margin support revenues as a percentage of total services revenues 
the decrease in the cost of services as a percentage of services revenues in fiscal over fiscal is primarily attributable to an increased average billing rate of consultants and reduced reliance on lower margin third party sub contractors 
cost of revenues includes amortization of acquired developed technology from the acquisitions of human performance technologies  inc and ultris inc 
of million in fiscal and million in fiscal the developed technology of million acquired from human performance technologies  inc is being amortized over a two year estimated useful life and the developed technology of million acquired from ultris inc is being amortized over a three year estimated useful life 
operating expenses research and development 
research and development expenses decreased to million in fiscal  from million in fiscal and million in fiscal the decreases in fiscal over fiscal and in fiscal over fiscal are primarily attributable to reduced personnel costs associated with a decrease in research and development personnel in the us and a decrease in the use of third party consultants 
these decreases were partially offset by increased staffing in our lower cost development center in india 
sales and marketing 
sales and marketing expenses decreased to million in fiscal  from million in fiscal and million in fiscal the decrease in fiscal over fiscal is primarily attributable to reduced personnel costs associated with a decrease in sales and marketing personnel and related costs

amortization of deferred stock compensation and other stock charges 
amortization of deferred stock compensation and other stock charges decreased to million in fiscal  from million in fiscal and million in fiscal included in the charges for fiscal is  for compensation expense resulting from the acceleration of vesting of common stock for certain terminated employees 
this charge was partially offset by a reduction in amortization of deferred stock compensation of  that resulted from the cancellation of unvested stock options as a result of employee attrition and reductions in workforce 
also included in fiscal is compensation expense of  related to the acceleration of amortization of deferred stock compensation for options that were cancelled in accordance with our voluntary stock option exchange program 
the exchange program is not expected to result in any additional compensation charges or variable plan accounting 
included in amortization of deferred stock compensation and other stock charges in fiscal is million related to the post acquisition amortization of the deferred stock compensation for the intrinsic value of common stock subject to repurchase assumed in connection with the acquisition of ultris inc the estimated intrinsic value of the  shares subject to repurchase was approximately million

amortization of purchased intangible assets 
amortization of purchased intangible assets was  in fiscal  million in fiscal and  in fiscal the amortization resulted from our march acquisition of human performance technologies  inc and june acquisition of ultris inc purchased intangible assets consist of intellectual property  customer base and noncompetition agreements 
the intangible assets are stated at cost less accumulated amortization and are being amortized on a straight line basis over their estimated useful lives of six months to three years 
amortization of goodwill 
effective june   we adopted sfas no 
and are no longer amortizing goodwill  but will be reviewing it annually or more frequently if impairment indicators arise for impairment 
as of may   there had been no impairment of goodwill 
during fiscal  amortization of goodwill was million 
the amortization resulted from our march acquisition of human performance technologies  inc and june acquisition of ultris inc restructuring charges during fiscal  fiscal and fiscal  we implemented restructuring programs to reduce expenses to align our operations and cost structure with market conditions 
the restructuring programs included worldwide workforce reductions across all functions and consolidation of excess facilities 
workforce reduction charges consist primarily of severance and fringe benefits 
the restructuring charges are classified in the statement of operations as follows years ended may  in thousands cost of revenues research and development sales and marketing general and administrative 
table of contents during fiscal  we recorded workforce reduction charges of million and facilities related charges of  the workforce reduction charges  which resulted from the reduction of employees across all business functions and geographic regions  are expected to be paid by the end of fiscal the annual cost of these employees was approximately million 
the facilities related charges relate to non cancelable lease costs that will be paid over the estimated vacancy period through fiscal during fiscal  we recorded workforce reduction charges of million and facilities related charges of million 
the workforce reduction charges  which resulted from the reduction of employees across all business functions and geographic regions  were paid by the end of fiscal the facilities related charges relate to non cancelable lease costs that will be paid over the estimated vacancy period through fiscal during fiscal  we recorded workforce reduction charges of million and facilities related charges of  the workforce reduction charges  which resulted from the reduction of employees across all business functions and geographic regions  were paid by the end of fiscal included in the charges for excess facilities is  relating to non cancelable lease costs that will be paid over the estimated vacancy period through fiscal also included is a charge of  for leasehold improvements and office furniture and fixtures that were no longer used in operations 
our estimated costs to exit these facilities are based on available commercial rates 
the actual loss incurred in exiting these facilities could be different from our estimates 
interest income and other  net interest income and other  net consists of interest income  interest expense and other non operating expenses 
interest income and other  net was  in fiscal   in fiscal and million in fiscal the increase in fiscal over fiscal is primarily attributable to a reduction in interest expense due to payments on prior capital lease obligations 
the decrease in fiscal over fiscal is primarily attributable to decreases in short term investments and the decline in short term interest rates during fiscal provision for income taxes from inception through may   we incurred net losses for federal and state tax purposes 
we recorded income tax expense of  in fiscal compared to  in fiscal and  in fiscal the income tax expense consists entirely of foreign income tax expense incurred as a result of local country profits 

table of contents quarterly results of operations the following table sets forth consolidated statement of operations data for each of the eight quarters in the period ended may  this information has been derived from our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements that  in the opinion of our management  include all adjustments  consisting only of normal recurring adjustments  necessary for a fair presentation of this information 
you should read this information in conjunction with our audited consolidated financial statements and related notes appearing elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
we have experienced and expect to continue to experience fluctuations in operating results from quarter to quarter 
we incurred net losses in each quarter since inception and expect to continue to incur losses in the foreseeable future 
you should not draw any conclusions about our future results from the results of operations for any quarter  as quarterly results are not necessarily indicative of the results for a full fiscal year or any other period

if revenues fall below our expectations  we will not be able to reduce our spending rapidly in response to the shortfall and operating losses will increase 
we anticipate that we will continue to experience long sales cycles 
therefore  the timing of future customer contracts could be difficult to predict  making it difficult to predict revenues between quarters 
we are subject to employer payroll taxes  both domestic and foreign  on employee exercises of non qualified stock options 
these taxes are recorded as a charge to operations in the period such options are 
table of contents exercised based on actual gains realized by employees  measured by the difference between the price of our common stock on the date of exercise and the exercise price 
we receive domestic tax deductions for gains realized by domestic employees on the exercise of non qualified stock options for which the benefit is recorded as additional paid in capital when realized 
our taxes and cash flows could vary significantly from quarter to quarter depending on the number of non qualified stock options exercised by employees in any quarter and  consequently  our results of operations 
other factors that could affect our quarterly operating results include those described below and under the caption factors that may affect future operating results dependence of our revenues on a small number of large orders and the average order value  our ability to attract new customers  any changes in revenue recognition policies and provisions and interpretations of these provisions  our ability to license additional products to current customers  the announcement or introduction of new products or services by us or our competitors  changes in the pricing of our products and services or those of our competitors  variability in the mix of our products and services revenues in any quarter  technical difficulties or service interruptions of our computer network systems or the internet generally  the amount and timing of operating costs and capital expenditures relating to expansion or contraction of our business  and foreign currency fluctuations

as of may   we did not have any material commitments for capital expenses 
our principal commitments consisted of obligations under operating leases and our credit facility 
in august  we entered into a credit facility with a bank that provides for an equipment term loan of up to million and a revolving line of credit secured by eligible accounts receivable of up to million 
in march  we modified the credit facility by adding a term loan of million 
borrowings under the credit facility are secured by substantially all of our tangible assets 
the revolving line of credit expires in august and borrowings are at a variable interest rate using the bank s prime rate plus 
as of may   there were no amounts outstanding under the line of credit 
under the term loan borrowings must be repaid in equal monthly installments of principal plus interest and outstanding principal bears interest at either a fluctuating rate equal to the bank s prime rate plus or a fixed rate equal to the month us treasury note plus 
as of may   we had outstanding equipment term loans of  that carry fixed interest rates ranging from to with maturities from august to may as of may   we also had an outstanding term loan of million that carried a variable interest rate with a maturity of march in august  we renewed our credit facility through august the following table summarizes our contractual obligations at may  and the effect these obligations are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flows in future periods

however  we may be required  or could choose  to raise additional funds at any time 
our future liquidity and capital requirements will depend on numerous factors  including our future revenues  the timing and extent of spending to support product development efforts and expansion of sales and marketing and general and administrative activities  the success of our existing and new product and service offerings and competing technological and market developments 
there can be no assurance that additional funding  if needed  will be available on terms acceptable to us  if at all 

table of contents critical accounting policies our discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting periods 
actual results could differ materially from those estimates 
note to the consolidated financial statements describes the significant accounting policies used in preparation of the consolidated financial statements 
while there are a number of accounting policies  methods and estimates affecting our financial statements  areas that are particularly significant include revenue recognition policies  the allowance for doubtful accounts  the assessment of recoverability of goodwill and purchased intangible assets and restructuring costs 
revenue recognition 
our revenue recognition policies are described at the beginning of item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
allowance for doubtful accounts 
accounts receivable are recorded net of allowance for doubtful accounts and totaled million as of may  the allowance for doubtful accounts  which totaled  as of may   is based on our assessment of the collectibility of specific customer accounts and the aging of the accounts receivable 
if there is a deterioration of a major customer s credit worthiness or actual defaults are higher than our historical experience  we may be required to increase the allowance for doubtful accounts 
we recorded charges to operations that increased allowance for doubtful accounts by  in fiscal   in fiscal and million in fiscal amounts written off as reductions to the allowance totaled  in fiscal   in fiscal and million in fiscal recoverability of goodwill and purchased intangible assets 
effective june   we adopted sfas no 
as such  we ceased amortization of goodwill as of may  in addition  we evaluated our purchased intangible assets and determined that all such assets have determinable lives 
prior to the adoption of sfas no 
 we amortized goodwill on a straight line basis over its estimated useful life of three years and performed impairment analyses under sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of 
total amortization of goodwill prior to june  was million and our remaining goodwill balance at may  was million 
amortization of purchased intangible assets was  in fiscal  million in fiscal and  in fiscal our remaining purchased intangible asset balance was  as of may  sfas no 
prescribes a two phase process for impairment testing of goodwill 
the first phase screens for impairment  while the second phase  if necessary  measures the impairment 
we consider saba to be a single reporting unit 
accordingly  all of our goodwill is associated with the entire company 
we perform the required impairment analysis of goodwill annually  or on an interim basis if circumstances dictate 
any reduction of enterprise fair value below the amount of stockholders equity could require us to write down the value of goodwill to its fair value and record an expense for the impairment loss 
restructuring costs 
during fiscal  fiscal and fiscal we implemented restructuring programs to reduce expenses to align our operations and cost structure with market conditions 
the restructuring charges included worldwide workforce reductions across all functions and consolidation of excess facilities 
we have reduced the amount of the facilities restructuring charge by the estimated amount of sublease income 
the restructuring charges amounted to million in fiscal  million in fiscal and million in fiscal our remaining accrued restructuring charges included in the balance sheet as of may  was million  which is comprised of  for workforce reduction charges and  for facilities related charges 
the assumptions we have made are based on the current market conditions in the various areas where we have vacant space and necessarily entail a high level of management judgment 
these market conditions can fluctuate greatly due to such factors as changes in property occupancy rates and the rental prices charged for 
table of contents comparable properties 
these changes could materially affect our accrual 
if  in future periods  it is determined that we have over accrued for restructuring charges for the consolidation of facilities  the reversal of such over accrual would have a favorable impact on our results of operations in the period this was determined and would be recorded as a credit to restructuring costs 
conversely  if it is determined that our accrual is insufficient  an additional charge would have an unfavorable impact on our results of operations in the period this was determined 
recent accounting pronouncements in august  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for asset retirement obligations 
sfas no 
requires businesses to record the fair value of a liability for an asset retirement obligation in the period in which it is incurred 
when the liability is initially recorded  the entity capitalizes a cost by increasing the carrying amount of the related long lived asset 
over time  the liability is accreted to its present value each period  and the capitalized cost is depreciated over the useful life of the related asset 
upon settlement of the liability  an entity either settles the obligation for its recorded amount or incurs a gain or loss upon settlement 
we will adopt sfas no 
for our fiscal year beginning june  and do not expect it to have a material effect on our financial position and results of operations 
in june  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities 
sfas no 
addresses financial accounting and reporting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities and nullifies eitf no 
 liability recognition for certain employee termination benefits and other costs to exit an activity including certain costs incurred in a restructuring 
sfas no 
requires that a liability for a cost associated with an exit or disposal activity be recognized when the liability is incurred 
under eitf no 
 a liability for an exit cost as generally defined in eitf no 
was recognized at the date of an entity s commitment to an exit plan 
sfas no 
also establishes that fair value is the objective for initial measurement of the liability 
sfas no 
is effective for exit or disposal activities initiated after december  and could result in us recognizing the cost of future restructuring activities  if any  over a period of time as opposed to as a single event 
in december the fasb issued sfas no 
accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure that amends sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation 
the standard provides for alternative methods of transition for an entity that voluntarily changes to the fair value method of accounting for stock based employee compensation  requires more prominent disclosure of the effects of an entity s accounting policy decisions with respect to stock based employee compensation on reported income  and amends apb opinion no 
 interim financial reporting  to require disclosure of those effects in interim financial information 
sfas no 
is effective for fiscal years ending after december   and for financial reports containing condensed financial statements for interim periods beginning after december  we continue to account for employee stock options using the intrinsic value method in accordance with apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees and we apply the disclosure provisions of statement  as amended by statement in february  the fasb issued eitf no 
 revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables 
eitf no 
requires revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables to be divided into separate units of accounting 
if the deliverables in the arrangement meet certain criteria  arrangement consideration should be allocated among the separate units based on their relative fair values 
applicable revenue recognition criteria should be considered separately for each unit 
the guidance in eitf no 
is effective for revenue arrangements entered into in fiscal periods beginning after june  we do not expect the adoption of eitf no 
to have a material effect on our financial position or results of operations 
in april  the fasb issued sfas no 
 amendment of statement on derivative instruments and hedging activities  which amends and clarifies the accounting guidance on derivative instrument and hedging activities that fall within the scope of sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and 
table of contents hedging activities 
sfas no 
is effective for contracts entered into or modified after june   with certain exceptions  and for hedging relationships designated after june  sfas no 
is to be applied prospectively 
we do not expect sfas no 
to have a material effect on our financial position or results of operations 
factors that may impact future operating results we have a limited operating history and are subject to the risks encountered by early stage companies we were founded in april and shipped our first products in april because we have a limited operating history  you should consider and evaluate our operating prospects in light of the risks and uncertainties frequently encountered by early stage companies in rapidly evolving markets 
for us  these risks include risks that our revenue forecasts may be incorrect because of our limited sales to date and our long sales process  risks associated with our dependence on saba learning  and related services  for substantially all of our revenues for the foreseeable future  risks that our new products  such as saba performance and saba content  will fail to achieve market acceptance  risks that our strategy of establishing saba exchange may not be successful  risks that fluctuations in our quarterly operating results will be significant relative to our revenues  and risks that the current economic downturn will continue to negatively impact the demand for our products and services 
these risks and other risks are described in more detail below 
our future growth will depend substantially on our ability to address these and the other risks described in this section 
if we do not successfully address these risks  our business would be significantly harmed 
we have a history of losses  expect future losses and cannot assure you that we will achieve profitability we have incurred significant losses and negative cash flows from operations since our inception 
we have not achieved profitability and cannot be certain that we will realize sufficient revenues to achieve or sustain profitability 
we expect to derive substantially all of our revenues for the foreseeable future from the licensing of saba learning and providing related services 
over the longer term  we expect to derive revenues from saba exchange  which is based on an evolving and unproven business model  and new products such as saba learning asp edition and saba performance  which is in limited release  and services related to these offerings 
in the future  we expect to continue to incur substantial non cash expenses relating to the amortization of deferred compensation and purchased intangible assets that will contribute to our net losses 
as of may   we had  of purchased intangible assets to be amortized 
as a result of all of the foregoing  we expect to incur losses for the foreseeable future and will need to generate significantly higher revenues in order to achieve profitability 
if we achieve profitability  we may not be able to sustain it 
fluctuations of our results could cause our stock price to experience significant fluctuations or declines our operating results have varied significantly in the past and will likely fluctuate significantly in the future 
we believe that quarter to quarter comparisons of our revenues and operating results are not necessarily meaningful and should not be relied on as indicators of future performance 
our operating expenses are based on our expectations of future revenues and are relatively fixed in the short term 
during fiscal  fiscal and fiscal we took actions to reduce our operating expenses and  while we may from time to time reduce operating expenses in response to variability in our revenues  including variabilities caused by downturns in the united states and or international economies  over the long term we generally expect to increase our operating 
table of contents expenses to expand our sales and marketing operations  fund greater levels of research and development  develop new alliances  increase our services and support capabilities and improve our operational and financial systems 
if our revenues do not increase along with these expenses  our business would be seriously harmed and net losses in a given quarter would be even larger than expected 
it is possible that in some future quarter our operating results may be below the expectations of public market analysts or investors  which could cause the market price of our common stock to fall 
our quarterly revenues are especially subject to fluctuations because they depend on the sale of a small number of relatively large orders  principally orders for saba learning and related services 
as a result  our quarterly operating results may fluctuate if we are unable to complete a sufficient number of large orders in any particular quarter 
we have not fully developed our business model for saba exchange  including the structure and amount of the fees we intend to charge 
as this business model evolves  the potential for fluctuations in our quarterly results could increase 
furthermore  our quarterly revenues may be affected significantly by changes in revenue recognition policies and procedures based on changes to  or new  applicable accounting standards and how these standards are interpreted 
our lengthy sales cycle could cause delays in revenue growth the period between our initial contact with a potential customer and the purchase of our products and services is often long 
a customer s decision to purchase our products and services requires the commitment to increase performance through human capital development and management  involves a significant allocation of resources  and is influenced by a customer s budgetary cycles 
to successfully sell our products and services  we generally must educate our potential customers regarding the use and benefits of our products and services  which can require significant time and resources 
many of our potential customers are large enterprises that generally take longer to make significant business decisions 
our typical sales cycle has been approximately to months 
the delay or failure to complete sales in a particular quarter could reduce our revenues in that quarter 
if our sales cycle unexpectedly lengthens in general or for one or more large orders  it would adversely affect the timing of our revenues 
if we were to experience a delay on a large order  it could harm our ability to meet our forecasts for a given quarter 
a decline in the price of  or demand for  our main product  saba learning or our related services offerings would seriously harm our revenues and operating margins to date  saba learning and related services have accounted for a substantial majority of our revenues 
we anticipate that revenues from saba learning and related services will continue to constitute a substantial majority of our revenues for the foreseeable future 
consequently  a decline in the price of  or demand for  saba learning or failure to achieve broad market acceptance would seriously harm our business 
we are exposed to recent unfavorable economic conditions we have seen a rapid and increasingly severe downturn in the united states economy since the first quarter of fiscal ended august   which has been further stalled by terrorist attacks in september and the war in iraq in early there can be no certainty as to the severity or duration of this downturn 
although we cannot predict the extent and timing  if any  of the impact of economic downturns in the united states on economies in other countries or geographic regions  we are seeing an economic slowdown in certain international markets in which we conduct business 
if the economic conditions in the united states continue or worsen or if a global economic slowdown intensifies  the demand for our products and services may be reduced 
not only may these economic slowdowns reduce our customers and prospects budgets for our products and services  but also they may adversely affect our customers ability to pay for our products and services 
accordingly  these economic slowdowns may have a material adverse impact on our business  operating results and financial condition 

table of contents our performance depends on a new market human capital development and management the market for software solutions that automate human capital development and management is relatively new and rapidly evolving 
substantially all of our revenues are attributable to the suite of products and services in this market 
if this market fails to develop or develops more slowly than we expect  or if we fail to identify the challenges and risks in this new market or successfully address these risks  our business would be harmed 
our strategy of establishing saba exchange is unproven and may not be successful we must more fully establish and enhance saba exchange  where organizations and learning providers can transact business and collaborate 
our success depends on a significant number of organizations implementing saba learning and conducting business with learning providers over the internet through saba exchange 
if this business strategy is flawed  or if we are unable to execute it effectively  our revenues may be seriously harmed 
we began operating saba exchange in december accordingly  we have limited experience developing and operating saba exchange 
to date  only a limited number of learning providers and organizations are connected to saba exchange 
it is possible that we  together with the organizations and learning providers who comprise this exchange  will not be able to effectively operate this exchange  both in terms of technical performance as well as commercial viability 
it is possible that an insufficient number of organizations and or learning providers will join and remain in saba exchange  and that we will be unable to generate significant revenues from saba exchange 
unless a critical mass of organizations and learning providers join saba exchange  our solutions may not achieve widespread market acceptance and our business would be seriously harmed 
to date  we have not generated significant revenues from saba exchange 
if we lose key personnel or are unable to attract and retain additional qualified personnel  we may not be able to successfully manage our business and achieve our objectives we believe our future success will depend upon our ability to retain our key management personnel 
these employees are not subject to employment contracts 
we may not be successful in attracting  assimilating and retaining our key employees in the future 
our future success and our ability to expand our operations will also depend in large part on our ability to attract and retain additional qualified technical  sales and marketing personnel 
competition for these types of employees is intense due to the limited number of qualified professionals and the high demand for them  particularly in the san francisco bay area  where our headquarters is located 
we have in the past experienced difficulty in recruiting qualified personnel 
failure to attract  assimilate and retain personnel  particularly technical  sales and marketing personnel  would have a material adverse effect on our business and potential growth 
additionally  volatility or a lack of positive performance in our stock price may adversely affect our ability to retain key employees  all of whom have been granted stock options or been sold restricted stock 
difficulties we may encounter managing our growth could adversely affect our results of operations we intend to grow our business significantly 
to support our growth plans  we may need to expand our existing management  operational  financial and human resources  customer service and management information systems and controls 
we may be unable to expand these systems and to manage our planned growth successfully  and this inability would adversely affect our business 
intense competition in our target market could impair our ability to grow and to achieve profitability the market for our products and services is intensely competitive  dynamic and subject to rapid technological change 
the intensity of the competition and the pace of change are expected to increase in the future 
increased competition is likely to result in price reductions  reduced gross margins and loss of market share  any one of which could seriously harm our business 
competitors vary in size and in the scope and breadth 
table of contents of the products and services offered 
we encounter competition with respect to different aspects of our solution from a variety of sources including companies that market and license training  learning  performance  content  resource  talent and staffing management systems  enterprise software vendors that offer human resources information systems and employee relationship management systems with training and performance modules  potential customers internal development efforts  companies that operate internet based marketplaces for the sale of on line learning  companies that operate internet based marketplaces for the sale of goods and services and could potentially decide to evolve their marketplaces to include content offerings  and internet portals that offer learning content  performance support tools or recruiting services 
because there are relatively low barriers to entry in the electronic commerce market  which comprises a portion of our business model  we expect competition from a variety of established and emerging companies many of our competitors have longer operating histories  substantially greater financial  technical  marketing or other resources  or greater name recognition than we do 
our competitors may be able to respond more quickly than we can to new or emerging technologies and changes in customer requirements 
competition could seriously impede our ability to sell additional products and services on terms favorable to us 
our current and potential competitors may develop and market new technologies that render our existing or future products and services obsolete  unmarketable or less competitive 
our current and potential competitors may make strategic acquisitions or establish cooperative relationships among themselves or with other learning solution providers  thereby increasing the availability of their services to address the needs of our current and prospective customers 
we may not be able to compete successfully against our current and future competitors  and competitive pressures that we encounter may seriously harm our business 
if we are unable to manage the complexity of conducting business globally  our international revenues may suffer international revenues accounted for of our revenues in fiscal  in fiscal and in fiscal we intend to expand our international presence in the future 
conducting business outside of the united states is subject to certain risks  including changes in regulatory requirements and tariffs  language barriers  difficulties in staffing and managing foreign operations  longer payment cycles and greater difficulty in collecting accounts receivable  reduced protection of intellectual property rights  potentially harmful tax consequences  fluctuating exchange rates  price controls and other restrictions on foreign currency  difficulties in obtaining import and export licenses  political and social unrest or disturbances  the burden of complying with a variety of foreign laws  and political or economic constraints on international trade 

table of contents we might not successfully market  sell or distribute our products and services in foreign markets  and we cannot be certain that one or more of the factors indicated above will not materially adversely affect our future international operations  and consequently  our business and future growth 
we may become subject to government regulation and legal uncertainties that could reduce demand for our products and services or increase the cost of doing business  thereby adversely affecting our financial results we are not currently subject to direct regulation by any domestic or foreign governmental agency  other than regulations applicable to businesses generally  export control laws and laws or regulations directly applicable to internet commerce 
however  due to the increasing popularity and use of the internet  it is possible that a number of laws and regulations may become applicable to us or may be adopted in the future with respect to the internet covering issues such as user privacy  taxation  content  right to access personal data  copyrights  distribution  and characteristics and quality of services 
the applicability of existing laws governing issues such as property ownership  copyrights  and other intellectual property issues  encryption  taxation  libel  export or import matters and personal privacy to the internet is uncertain 
the vast majority of these laws were adopted prior to the broad commercial use of the internet and related technologies 
as a result  they do not contemplate or address the unique issues of the internet and related technologies 
changes to these laws  including some recently proposed changes  could create uncertainty in the internet marketplace 
such uncertainty could reduce demand for our services or increase the cost of doing business due to increased costs of litigation or increased service delivery costs 
in addition  we could be liable for the misuse of personal information 
the federal trade commission  the european union and certain state and local authorities have been investigating some internet companies regarding their use of personal information 
we could incur additional expenses if new regulations regarding the use of personal information are introduced or if these authorities choose to investigate our privacy practices 
our market is subject to rapid technological change and  to compete  we must continually enhance our products and services we must continue to enhance and improve the performance  functionality and reliability of our products and services 
the software and electronic commerce industries are characterized by rapid technological change  changes in user requirements and preferences  frequent new product and services introductions embodying new technologies and the emergence of new industry standards and practices that could render our products and services obsolete 
in the past  we have discovered that some of our customers desire additional performance and functionality not currently offered by our products 
our success will depend  in part  on our ability to both internally develop and license leading technologies to enhance our existing products and services  develop new products and services that address the increasingly sophisticated and varied needs of our customers  and respond to technological advances and emerging industry standards and practices on a cost effective and timely basis 
in addition  the development of our technology and other proprietary technology involves significant technical and business risks 
we may fail to use new technologies effectively or to adapt our proprietary technology and systems to customer requirements or emerging industry standards 
if we are unable to adapt to changing market conditions  customer requirements or emerging industry standards  we may not be able to increase our revenues and expand our business 

table of contents delays in releasing new products or enhanced versions of our existing products could adversely affect our competitive position as part of our strategy  we expect to regularly release new products and new versions of our existing products 
even if our new products or new versions of our existing products contain the features and functionality our customers want  in the event we are unable to timely introduce these new products or product releases  our competitive position may be harmed 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to successfully complete the development of currently planned or future products or product releases in a timely and efficient manner 
due to the complexity of our products  internal quality assurance testing and customer testing of pre commercial releases may reveal product performance issues or desirable feature enhancements that could lead us to postpone the release of these products 
in addition  the reallocation of resources associated with any postponement would likely cause delays in the development and release of other future products or enhancements to our currently available products 
any delay in releasing future products or enhancements of our products could cause our stock price to decline 
if we release products containing defects  we may need to halt further shipments and our business and reputation would be harmed products as complex as ours often contain unknown and undetected errors or performance problems 
many serious defects are frequently found during the period immediately following introduction and initial shipment of new products or enhancements to existing products 
although we attempt to resolve all errors that we believe would be considered serious by our customers before shipment to them  our products are not error free 
these errors or performance problems could result in lost revenues or delays in customer acceptance and would be detrimental to our business and reputation 
as is typical in the software industry  with each release we have discovered errors in our products after introduction 
we will not be able to detect and correct all errors before releasing our products commercially and these undetected errors could be significant 
we cannot assure you that undetected errors or performance problems in our existing or future products will not be discovered in the future or that known errors considered minor by us will not be considered serious by our customers  resulting in a decrease in our revenues 
claims by third parties that we infringe their intellectual property rights may result in costly litigation in recent years  there has been significant litigation in the united states involving patents and other intellectual property rights  particularly in the software and internet related industries 
on may   ip learn  llc ip learn filed a lawsuit against us alleging that we infringed a number of patents assigned to ip learn  and asking the court for a preliminary and permanent injunction as well as unspecified damages 
we believe that ip learn s claims are without merit  and we intend to defend against them vigorously 
we could become subject to additional intellectual property infringement claims as the number of our competitors grows and our products and services overlap with competitive offerings 
any of these claims  even if not meritorious  could be expensive to defend and could divert management s attention from operating our company 
if we become liable to third parties for infringing their intellectual property rights  we could be required to pay a substantial award of damages and to develop noninfringing technology  obtain a license or cease selling the products that contain the infringing intellectual property 
we may be unable to develop noninfringing technology or obtain a license on commercially reasonable terms  if at all 
we may not be able to adequately protect our proprietary technology  and our competitors may be able to offer similar products and services that would harm our competitive position our success depends upon our proprietary technology 
we rely primarily on copyright  trademark and trade secret laws  confidentiality procedures and contractual provisions to establish and protect our proprietary rights 
as part of our confidentiality procedures  we enter into non disclosure agreements with our employees 
despite these precautions  third parties could copy or otherwise obtain and use our technology without authorization  or develop similar technology independently 
in addition  we have one patent issued in the united states and seven 
table of contents patent applications pending in the united states 
we cannot assure you that any patents will be issued for any of the pending patent applications 
even for the issued patent  or any patent issued to us in the future  there can be no assurance that such patent will protect our intellectual property  or will not be challenged by third parties 
furthermore  effective protection of intellectual property rights is unavailable or limited in certain foreign countries 
we cannot assure you that the protection of our proprietary rights will be adequate or that our competitors will not independently develop similar technology  duplicate our products and services or design around any patents or other intellectual property rights we hold 
we do not have a comprehensive disaster recovery plan or back up system  and a disaster could severely damage our operations we currently do not have a comprehensive disaster recovery plan in effect and do not have fully redundant systems for our services at an alternate site 
a disaster could severely harm our business because our services could be interrupted for an indeterminate length of time 
our operations depend upon our ability to maintain and protect the computer systems needed for the day to day operation of saba exchange and saba learning asp edition 
a number of these computer systems are located on or near known earthquake fault zones 
although these systems are designed to be fault tolerant  they are vulnerable to damage from fire  floods  earthquakes  power loss  telecommunications failures and other events 
additionally  we do not carry sufficient business insurance to compensate us for all potential losses that could occur 
we outsource the management and maintenance of our hosted and asp solutions to third parties and will depend upon them to provide adequate management and maintenance services we rely on third parties to provide key components of our networks and systems 
for instance  we rely on third party internet service providers to host saba exchange and saba enterprise learning suite for customers who desire to have these solutions hosted 
we also rely on third party communications service providers for the high speed connections that link our and our internet service providers web servers and office systems to the internet 
any internet or communications systems failure or interruption could result in disruption of our service or loss or compromise of customer orders and data 
these failures  especially if they are prolonged or repeated  would make our services less attractive to customers and tarnish our reputation 
we depend upon continuing our relationship with third party integrators who support our solutions our success depends upon the acceptance and successful integration by customers of our products 
we often rely on third party systems integrators to assist with implementation of our products 
we will need to continue to rely on these systems integrators even as we increase the size of our professional services group 
if large systems integrators fail to continue to support our solution or commit resources to us  if any of our customers are not able to successfully integrate our solution or if we are unable to adequately train our existing systems integration partners  our business  operating results and financial condition could suffer 
in addition  we have only limited control over the level and quality of service provided by our current and future third party integrators 
we may not be able to secure necessary funding in the future  additional funding may result in dilution to our stockholders we require substantial working capital to fund our business 
we have had significant operating losses and negative cash flow from operations since inception and expect this to continue for the foreseeable future 
we expect to use our available cash resources and credit facilities primarily to fund sales and marketing activities  research and development  and continued operations  and possibly make future acquisitions 
we believe that our existing capital resources will be sufficient to meet our capital requirements for the next twelve months 
however  if our capital requirements increase materially from those currently planned or if revenues fail to materialize  we may require additional financing sooner than anticipated 
if additional funds are raised through 
table of contents the issuance of equity securities  the percentage ownership of our stockholders will be reduced  stockholders may experience dilution  or such equity securities may have rights  preferences or privileges senior to those of the holders of our common stock 
additional financing may not be available when needed on terms favorable to us or at all 
if adequate funds are not available or are not available on acceptable terms  we may be unable to develop or enhance our products and services  take advantage of future opportunities or respond to competitive pressures 
our past and future acquisitions may result in disruptions to our business if we fail to adequately integrate acquired businesses in march  we acquired human performance technologies  inc and  in june  we acquired ultris inc as part of our overall business strategy  we expect to continue to acquire complementary businesses or technologies that will provide additional products or services offerings  additional industry expertise or an expanded geographic presence 
these acquisitions could result in the use of significant amounts of cash  potentially dilutive issuances of equity securities  or the incurrence of debt 
in addition  any acquisition may increase the risk of future write offs for acquired in process research and development  write offs for the impairment of goodwill or long lived assets  or amortization of expenses related to intangible assets  any of which could materially adversely affect our business and our operating results 
for example  as of may   we had an aggregate of  of purchased intangible assets to be amortized as a result of the acquisition of human performance technologies  inc and ultris inc although these two acquisitions are fully integrated  future acquisitions involve numerous risks  including difficulties in the assimilation of the operations  technologies  products and personnel of the acquired company  the diversion of management s attention from other business concerns  risks of entering markets in which we have no or limited prior experience  and the potential loss of key employees of the acquired company 
our stock price may fluctuate substantially the market price for our common stock may be affected by a number of factors  including those described above and the following the announcement of new products and services or product and service enhancements by us or our competitors  quarterly variations in our results of operations or those of our competitors  changes in earnings estimates or recommendations by securities analysts that may follow our stock  developments in our industry  and general market conditions and other factors  including factors unrelated to our operating performance or the operating performance of our competitors 
in addition  the stock market in general  and the nasdaq national market and technology companies in particular  have experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have often been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of particular companies 
broad market and industry trends may also materially and adversely affect the market price of our common stock  regardless of our actual operating performance 
in the past  following periods of volatility in the market price of a company s securities  securities class action litigation has often been initiated against that company 
class action litigation could result in substantial costs and a diversion of management s attention and resources 

table of contents sales of shares eligible for future sale could cause our stock price to decline if our stockholders sell substantial amounts of our common stock including shares issued upon the exercise of outstanding options and warrants in the public market  the market price of our common stock could fall 
such sales also might make it more difficult for us to sell equity or equity related securities in the future at a time and price that we deem appropriate 
the anti takeover provisions in our charter documents could adversely affect the rights of the holders of our common stock our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws contain provisions that could make it harder for a third party to acquire us without the consent of our board of directors 
for example  if a potential acquiror were to make a hostile bid for us  the acquiror would not be able to call a special meeting of stockholders to remove our board of directors or act by written consent without a meeting 
in addition  our board of directors has staggered terms that make it difficult to remove all directors at once 
the acquiror would also be required to provide advance notice of its proposal to remove directors at an annual meeting 
the acquiror will not be able to cumulate votes at a meeting  which will require the acquiror to hold more shares to gain representation on the board of directors than if cumulative voting were permitted 
our board of directors also has the ability to issue preferred stock that would significantly dilute the ownership of a hostile acquiror 
in addition  section of the delaware general corporation law limits business combination transactions with stockholders that have not been approved by the board of directors 
these provisions and other similar provisions make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us without negotiation 
these provisions may apply even if the offer may be considered beneficial by some stockholders 
our board of directors could choose not to negotiate with an acquiror that it did not feel was in our strategic interests 
if the acquiror was discouraged from offering to acquire us or prevented from successfully completing a hostile acquisition by our anti takeover measures  you could lose the opportunity to sell your shares at a favorable price 
item a qualitative and quantitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk our investments are made in accordance with an investment policy approved by our board of directors 
all investments are carried at market value  which approximates cost 
at may   all of our investments were considered available for sale securities and the average maturity of our investment securities was approximately one month 
the weighted average interest rate of our portfolio was approximately at may  due to the nature of our cash equivalents and short term investments  which are primarily money market funds  commercial paper  and us government agency bonds  we believe that there is no material market risk exposure 
the revolving line of credit portion of our credit facility entered into in august allows us to make draws at a variable interest rate using the bank s prime rate plus 
as of may  there were no outstanding borrowings under the line of credit 
therefore  only future borrowings would be affected by changes in market interest rates 
the equipment term loan portion of our credit facility allows us to make draws at either a variable interest rate equal to the bank s prime rate plus or a fixed interest rate equal to the month us treasury note plus 
as of may   we had outstanding equipment term loans of  that carry fixed interest rates ranging from to 
therefore  only future borrowings on the equipment term loan portion of our credit facility would be affected by changes in market interest rates 

table of contents as of may   we also had an outstanding term loan of million that carried a variable interest rate based on the bank s prime rate plus 
if the bank s prime rate were to change by from its level at may   the impact would not be material to our financial position or results of operations 
foreign currency risk we provide our products and services to customers in the united states  europe and elsewhere throughout the world 
as a result  our financial results could be affected by risks typical of an international business 
such factors include  but are not limited to  changes in foreign currency exchange rates  local regulations and restrictions and political climates  weak economic conditions in foreign markets  differing tax structures and foreign currency rate volatility 
sales are primarily made in us dollars  and to a lesser but increasing extent  british pounds and euros  however  as we continue to expand our operations  more of our contracts may be denominated in australian dollars  canadian dollars and japanese yen 
a strengthening of the us dollar could make our products less competitive in foreign markets 
our exposure to foreign exchange rate fluctuations also arises in part from the translation of the financial results of foreign subsidiaries into us dollars in consolidation 
as exchange rates vary  these results  when translated  may vary from expectations and adversely impact overall expected profitability
