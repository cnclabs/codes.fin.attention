results of operations revenues revenues for fiscal were million  a decrease of million or compared to revenues for fiscal and a decrease of million or compared to revenues for fiscal we derive our revenues from the sale of memory products and non memory products  which are targeted primarily to the data communications  computation and consumer markets 
revenues in both markets were adversely affected in fiscal and fiscal by the economic slowdown in both the semiconductor market and the global economy in general 
business segment net revenues year ended in thousands december  december  december  memory non memory total consolidated revenues revenues from the sale of memory products for fiscal decreased million or versus revenues from the sale of these products for fiscal memory product revenues decreased as compared to fiscal despite a increase in unit demand for semiconductor products  particularly in the wireless markets 
in fiscal  average selling prices asps decreased although the average density mbits unit of srams products sold continued to increase 
cypress uses average asp mbit as an indication of the magnitude of price change for memory products 
this metric reflects changes in product mix and density as well as market price 
asp mbit declined by from fiscal to fiscal and from fiscal to fiscal revenues from the sale of memory products for fiscal decreased million or versus revenues from the sale of these products for fiscal the decrease in memory product revenues  as compared to fiscal  resulted from a decrease in unit demand for semiconductor products particularly in the wireless and networking markets 
in fiscal  asps increased as a result of a continuing increase in the average density mbits unit of srams products sold 
this increase was driven by new product revenues  particularly the and meg mobl family of parts and the meg and meg synchronous family of srams 
revenues in fiscal from the sale of non memory products increased million or when compared to revenues from the sale of these products for fiscal the increase in non memory product revenues  as compared to fiscal  resulted primarily from a increase in unit sales 
the increase in unit sales resulted from increases in unit demand primarily from our usb family of products  neuron  and programmable clocks 
page revenues in fiscal from the sale of non memory products decreased million or when compared to revenues from the sale of these products for fiscal the decrease in non memory product revenues  as compared to fiscal  resulted primarily from a decrease in unit sales 
the decrease in unit sales resulted from decreases in unit demand in all aspects of the networking end markets  and reduced end customer demand in the personal computer market in the first half of fiscal demand for pc related clock chips and usb related products recovered in the second half of fiscal as is typical in the semiconductor industry  asps of products generally decline over the lifetime of the products 
to increase revenues  cypress seeks to expand its market share in the markets it currently serves and to introduce and sell new products with higher asps 
cypress will seek to remain competitive with respect to its pricing to prevent a further decline in sales 
cost of revenues gross margin cost of revenues were million  million and million in fiscal  fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
during fiscal  although our asps declined significantly  we were generally able to offset this effect on our gross margin by implementing cost cutting measures including reducing manufacturing capacity and related headcount 
in addition  we continued to reduce manufacturing cycle times  reduce die size  improve labor productivity  improve efficient use of capital resources  improve defect densities  improve yields and ultimately lower manufacturing costs 
wafer fabrication utilization degraded slightly from as die per wafer increased due to the ramp of our ram and ram manufacturing processes 
our gross margin also benefited from the sale of inventory reserved during the third quarter of fiscal see below 
the incremental gross margin benefit of million is equivalent to the original cost basis of the inventory sold 
the effect was to increase gross margin by 
our future results could be favorably affected if we continue to sell fully reserved inventory 
the amount of that reserved inventory on hand at december  was million 
during the third quarter of fiscal  cypress received feedback from our customers that indicated that the downturn in sales would last longer than previously anticipated 
accordingly  we increased inventory reserves during the quarter for inventory that we did not expect to sell 
cost of revenues in the third quarter of fiscal included an unusual charge of million for inventory reserves  during fiscal  including the million charge  total net charges for inventory reserves were million 
additional charges to cost of revenues to increase inventory reserves may be necessary in the future if demand declines 
the decrease in gross margin in fiscal from fiscal was caused by increased inventory reserves  under utilization in our factories and continued declines in the asps of memory  usb and clock devices 
cypress is continuing its strong emphasis on new product development and improvements in manufacturing technologies and yields  which cypress expects will reduce manufacturing costs and help offset some of the impact of near term margin declines 
property  plant and equipment with a net book value of million was also written off to cost of revenues as a result of a periodic physical count of property  plant and equipment completed during the third quarter of fiscal research and development year ended in thousands december  december  december  revenues research and development r d as percent of revenues research and development r d expenditures in fiscal increased from fiscal and fiscal as cypress continued its efforts to develop new products and to migrate to more advanced process technologies 
r d charges for fiscal increased from fiscal due to increased spending for our silicon magnetics systems sms subsidiary and acquisition related compensations costs 
cypress believes that its future success will depend on its ability to develop and introduce new products that will compete effectively on the basis of price  performance  and ability to address customer needs 
our process technology research focuses primarily on the continuous migration to smaller geometries 
during fiscal we were ramping our latest micron technology in manufacturing 
we are simultaneously transferring our nanometer technology from our eight inch r d facility in san jose  california fab to our eight inch manufacturing fab in minnesota 
during fiscal  we recorded million in non cash deferred stock compensation and contingent cash compensation related to sahasra and the full year effect of our acquisitions made in fiscal during fiscal  we recorded million in non cash deferred stock compensation and contingent cash compensation related to acquisitions 
acquisition related compensation charged in fiscal is primarily attributed to the slm  imi  hiband and lara acquisitions 
page we recorded charges of million in the third quarter of fiscal upon reaching an agreement to settle a patent infringement suit for million  of which million pertained to prior periods 
the remainder relates to future product shipments and has been recorded as a prepaid asset that will be expensed over three years 
property  plant and equipment with a net book value of million was written off to r d as a result of a periodic physical count of property  plant and equipment completed during the third quarter of fiscal selling  general and administrative year ended in thousands december  december  december  revenues selling  general and administrative sg a as percent of revenues selling  general and administrative sg a expenses in fiscal decreased from fiscal due primarily to the effects of the reduction in force from the q restructuring plan see discussion below and continuing cost cutting measures 
during fiscal  we also realized the cost benefits of transferring certain administrative functions to our philippines operation 
commission and bonus expenses were lower due to the decline in our sales 
in addition  sg a decreased as a result of acquisition related deferred compensation and contingent cash compensation costs declining significantly 
the decline in such costs was a result of reduced amortization of compensation charges and non achievement of milestones 
these improvements were partially offset as we increased our loss reserve by million for loans outstanding to employees and former employees under the stockholder approved employee stock purchase assistance plan 
see stock purchase assistance plan  note in the consolidated financial statements for additional information 
selling  general and administrative expenses in fiscal increased from fiscal due primarily to increased sales and marketing headcount from our acquisitions during the year  acquisition related compensation charges and several major customer support initiatives  including expanded e business capabilities and improvements to the web infrastructure and site 
expenses for legal and professional services related to patent infringement litigation  patent filing and tax services also contributed to an increase in administrative costs in the periods under comparison 
lower sales commission expenses and employee bonus expenses partially offset these increases 
in fiscal  property  plant and equipment with a net book value of million was written off to sg a as a result of a periodic physical count completed during the third quarter of fiscal included in sg a are non cash deferred compensation and contingent cash compensation charges related to our acquisitions 
in fiscal  we recorded million of these costs related to our acquisition of sahasra networks  inc sahasra as well as continuing costs related to our previous acquisitions including silicon packets  isd and lara 
during fiscal  we recorded million in non cash deferred compensation and contingent cash compensation related to acquisitions 
acquisition related compensation charged in fiscal is primarily attributed to the slm  imi  and scanlogic acquisitions  and charges to fiscal are related to radiocom corporation and slm 
acquisition and other costs year ended in thousands december  december  december  amortization of intangibles impairment of intangibles amortizaton of goodwill impairment of goodwill in process research and development charge other charges total acquisition and other costs page during fiscal  we acquired sahasra and made an equity investment in sunpower corporation sunpower 
in process research and development charges and amortization of intangibles in fiscal relate to current and prior acquisitions 
the amortization of intangibles increased in fiscal versus fiscal due to the acquisition of sahasra and the full year effect of the amortization of intangibles from the imi  lara  silicon packets  isd and scanlogic acquisitions  all companies acquired in amortization of intangibles increased by million in fiscal versus fiscal due to the acquisitions made in fiscal and the effects of the acquisition of slm and radiocom in fiscal impairment of intangibles relates to slm of million and million in both fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
the slm impairment charge for fiscal was precipitated by further changes in slm s business plan that was completed in the fourth quarter of fiscal the slm impairment charge for fiscal was precipitated by a severe economic downturn in the optical market in which slm participates 
as a result  cypress reviewed slm s long lived assets  in accordance with sfas  for impairment and recognized in fiscal an impairment loss of million for existing technology impairment  representing the amount by which the carrying value of the acquired existing technology exceeded the estimated future cash flows of slm 
in fiscal  amortization of goodwill relates largely to our acquisitions of lara  isd  scanlogic  hiband  imi  slm and silicon packets 
in accordance with financial accounting standards board fasb  statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets sfas  we ceased amortizing goodwill at the end of fiscal and have not amortized goodwill for acquisitions subsequent to june  in fiscal  amortization of goodwill largely relates to our acquisition of slm 
in fiscal  cypress also recorded a goodwill impairment charge of million related to slm in accordance with its annual impairment review under sfas in fiscal  cypress recorded a goodwill impairment charge of million in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of sfas as a result of the severe downturn in the optical market discussed above 
the goodwill impairment charge recorded represented the excess of the pro rata share of goodwill over the future estimated cash flows of slm 
the in process research and development charges for fiscal relate to our equity method investment in sunpower 
in process research and development charges during fiscal relate to the acquisitions of imi  hiband  scanlogic  lara  isd and silicon packets  which were completed during fiscal the fiscal in process research and development costs relate to our acquisitions of silicon light machines and radiocom 
for the fiscal and fiscal acquisitions  the valuation method used to value in process technology is a form of discounted cash flow method commonly known as the percentage of completion approach 
this approach is a widely recognized appraisal method and is commonly used to value technology assets 
the value of the in process technology is the sum of the discounted expected future cash flows attributable to the in process technology  taking into consideration the percentage of completion of products utilizing this technology  utilization of pre existing technology  the risks related to the characteristics and applications of the technology  existing and future markets and the technological risk associated with completing the development of the technology 
the cash flows derived from the in process technology projects were discounted at rates ranging from to 
cypress believes these rates were appropriate given the risks associated with the technologies for which commercial feasibility had not been established 
the percentage of completion for each in process project was determined by identifying the elapsed time invested in the project as a ratio of the total time required to bring the project to technical and commercial feasibility 
the percentage of completion for in process projects acquired ranged from for sunpower  for sahasra  to for imi  to for hiband  to for scanlogic  to for lara  to for isd and to for silicon packets 
schedules were based on management s estimate of tasks completed and the tasks to be completed to bring the project to technical and commercial feasibility 
other charges recorded during fiscal were million for obsolete design software that is no longer being used 
cypress incurred a one time charge of million in the second quarter of fiscal due to the acceleration of contractual obligations related to the arcus acquisition 
restructuring we currently have two active restructuring plans one initiated in the third quarter of fiscal fiscal restructuring plan and the other initiated in the fourth quarter of fiscal fiscal restructuring plan after it became clear that actions taken in the previous year would not be sufficient to return the company to profitability 
we recorded initial restructuring charges in fiscal and fiscal based on assumptions that we deemed appropriate for the economic environment that existed at the time these estimates were made 
however  due to continued changes in the semiconductor industry and in our specific business conditions we took additional actions and made appropriate adjustments to the fiscal restructuring plan for property plant and equipment  leased facilities and personnel costs 
page fiscal restructuring plan on october   cypress announced a restructuring plan that included the resizing of cypress manufacturing facilities and the reduction of operating expenses  including research and development and selling  general and administration 
in the fourth quarter of fiscal  cypress recorded a charge of million which consisted of million related to equipment removed from service and held for sale  million for workforce reductions for approximately employees  including severance and benefits costs  and million for leased facilities 
to date there have been no significant sales of the equipment removed from service 
at the end of q  approximately of the employees had left cypress 
the majority of the workforce reduction affected the united states  with some reductions in europe and the philippines  and sales offices that were closed in europe and the united states 
during the first week of fiscal  an additional persons left cypress as part of the restructuring plan 
the following table summarizes the activity associated with the restructuring liabilities and asset write downs since the inception of the restructuring plan in the fourth quarter of fiscal in thousands property  plant equipment leased facilities personnel total q provision non cash charges cash charges balance at december  fiscal restructuring plan on july   cypress announced a restructuring plan that involved resizing its manufacturing facilities  reducing its workforce and combining facilities 
the restructuring was precipitated by the worldwide economic slowdown  particularly in the business areas in which cypress operates 
the intended effect of the plan was to size the manufacturing operations and facilities to meet future demand and reduce expenses in all operations areas 
during the third quarter of fiscal  cypress recorded restructuring charges of million related to property  plant and equipment  leased facilities and personnel 
in connection with the july  announcement  in the third quarter of fiscal  cypress removed from service and held for sale equipment with a net book value of million  resulting in a charge of million 
cypress has actively marketed the equipment  but has had limited success to date in selling this equipment 
through december   cypress has sold equipment with a net book value of million 
the proceeds from the sales of the assets approximated their carrying values 
in the second and third quarters of fiscal  cypress placed back into service certain of these assets previously recorded as held for sale 
the assets were needed to meet increased production requirements resulting from a substantial increase in unit demand versus our initial assumptions at the time of the q restructuring 
when the assets were put back into service  they were written up to their prior cost basis an adjustment of million and million in q and q  respectively  reduced for depreciation expense that would have been recorded during the period the asset was removed from service an adjustment of million and million in q and q  respectively  as required by sfas the net effect of the asset adjustment was a credit to the restructuring line on the statement of operations of million and million in q and q  respectively 
in the first quarter of fiscal  cypress also sold and then leased back certain other pieces of equipment classified as held for sale 
the proceeds from the sales of the assets approximated their net carrying values 
cypress continues to actively market the remaining assets held for sale 
in q  we recorded an additional charge of million for additional cost reductions identified as part of the personnel portion of the q restructuring plan 
the charge related to severance and related employee benefit costs for the termination of employees  the majority of whom were located in the philippines facility 
in the third quarter of fiscal  as a result of the continued business slowdown  cypress further restructured its operations and recorded net restructuring costs of million  which comprised a charge of million offset by a million reversal for previously written down equipment put back into service discussed above 
the charge of million consisted of million for work force reductions  and included severance  benefit costs and stock compensation  million for capital equipment removed from service and held for sale and million for the exiting of facility leases 
page in q  we recorded a credit of million related to the revised estimate of personnel costs 
in connection with the restructuring plan we have accrued costs related to an estimated employees to be terminated 
at the end of fiscal  approximately employees have left the company

year ended in thousands december  december  december  interest income interest expense other income and expense  net total interest income expense and other interest income decreased million and million in fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
the decreases are primarily due to lower average cash and investment balances and lower yields for each fiscal year 
interest expense was million for fiscal  compared to million in fiscal and million in fiscal interest expense for each of the fiscal years is primarily associated with the convertible subordinated notes notes  issued in january  due in fiscal  and the convertible subordinated notes notes  issued in june  due in the decrease in interest expense in fiscal compared to fiscal is attributable to the repurchase of million in principal of the notes that occurred between november and june the decrease in interest expense in fiscal compared to fiscal is primarily associated with a reduction in interest expense due to the conversion on october  of substantially all of the then outstanding convertible subordinated notes notes  issued in september  due in other income and expense  net of million for fiscal primarily reflects write downs of million in its investments in development stage companies  million related to our share of sunpower s net loss  million related to amortization of sunpower s intangible assets and the amortization of deferred financing costs of million 
these were partially offset by gains of million recognized on the repurchase of our notes 
in fiscal  other income and expense  net of million primarily reflects a million write down of long term investments and million related to the amortization of deferred financing costs 
these costs were somewhat offset by gains on the repurchase of convertible notes of million 
the gain on the repurchase of our convertible subordinated notes was previously classified as extraordinary  but has been reclassified to other income and expense  net in accordance with sfas no 
 rescission of fas nos 
  and  amendment of fas  and technical corrections sfas 
other income and expense  net  for fiscal primarily reflects a million gain on the sale of the fast cmos technology product line and a million gain on the disposal of assets partially offset by the amortization of deferred financing costs of million 
page taxes a tax expense of million was recognized during fiscal compared to tax benefit of million and tax expense of million during fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
the expense in fiscal was largely attributable to foreign income taxes in certain jurisdictions 
the company has not recognized a tax benefit in for its pre tax loss  as management believes it is more likely than not that the benefit will not be realized 
the fiscal tax benefit was attributable primarily to current year net operating losses  however  the tax benefit of these losses was limited to what we believed was realizable 
the tax expense of million in fiscal represented an effective tax rate on earnings of 
this amount was lower than the us statutory rates due to the utilization of research and development tax credits and lower tax rates in certain foreign jurisdictions 
our effective tax rate varies from the us statutory rate primarily due to our assessment of the utilization of loss carryovers and earnings of foreign subsidiaries taxed at different rates 
the valuation allowance against the net deferred tax asset increased from million to million from fiscal to fiscal  as management believes that it is more likely than not that the net deferred tax asset will not be realized 
liquidity and capital resources year ended in thousands december  december  december  cash  cash equivalents and short term investments restricted cash long term marketable securities working capital long term debt and capital lease obligations excluding current portion net cash flow generated from operating activities during the year ending december   our operating activities generated cash flows of approximately million 
during the same period our cash and cash equivalents declined by million 
this decrease is due to the million and million used for investing activities and financing activities  respectively 
key components of cash flow prior to changes in operating assets and liabilities  we generated million in cash during fiscal working capital consumed million due to inventory builds in the last half of fiscal with continued weak sales  manufacturing capacity has been reduced to avoid additional inventory builds 
accounts payable declined as we significantly slowed purchases of capital equipment in the latter part of fiscal these changes were partially offset by a decline in net accounts receivable commensurate with the change in revenues 
net of purchases  the sale of investments generated million in cash in fiscal this was offset by the acquisition of million in property  plant and equipment and million in investments in other companies 
in fiscal  the issuance of shares for purchase under our employee qualified stock purchase plan espp and exercised employee options generated million while the purchase by us of our stock and our convertible subordinated notes consumed million in fiscal page during fiscal  cash provided by operating activities of million was primarily attributed to changes in operating assets and liabilities of million and net loss adjusted for non cash items 
net cash flows used in investing activities of million for fiscal related primarily to the use of million in cash for acquisitions net of cash acquired  million for the purchases of property  plant and equipment and million for loans made by cypress to employees under the employee stock purchase assistance plan 
purchases of investments totaled million during fiscal  while investments  which were sold or matured  totaled million 
net cash flows used for financing activities were million during fiscal repurchases of common stock were million  redemption of convertible debt was million and purchases of private placement equity options  net were million 
these cash outflows were offset by cash inflows of million related to the premiums received from the writing of stock put options and million related to the issuance of common shares from the exercise of options or purchases through the espp 
for the year ended december   cash provided by operation activities of million was primarily attributable to earnings of million  tax benefits from stock options of million  acquired in process research and development of million and depreciation and amortization of million offset by changes in operating assets and liabilities of million 
net cash flows used in investing activities of million for fiscal related primarily to purchases of investments  which totaled million and purchases of property  plant and equipment of million 
investments that were sold or matured totaled million in fiscal liquidity based on our current plan  we expect to generate positive cash flow from operations in the fiscal year ending december  our expected significant investment and financing cash outlays for the fiscal year ending december  include capital expenditures for investment in our product development and infrastructure initiatives 
the board of directors has approved programs authorizing the repurchase of our common stock or convertible subordinated notes the subordinated notes in the open market at anytime 
however  the timing and actual number of shares or principal amount to be repurchased is limited to million and is at the discretion of management and are contingent on numerous factors including cash flow 
we have million of aggregate principal amount in subordinated notes that are due in february and july in the amount of million and million  respectively 
the subordinated notes are subject to compliance with certain covenants that do not contain financial ratios 
as of december   cypress was in compliance with these covenants 
if we failed to be in compliance with these covenants beyond any applicable grace period  the trustee of the subordinated notes  or the holders of a specific percentage thereof  would have the ability to demand immediate payment of all amounts outstanding 
as more fully discussed in note to our consolidated financial statements included in this report  cypress has entered into several synthetic operating lease agreements for manufacturing and office facilities 
each of these leases requires cypress to purchase the property or to arrange for the property to be acquired by a third party at lease expiration 
if cypress had exercised its right to purchase all the properties subject to these leases at december   it would have been required to make a payment and record assets totaling million 
cypress is required to maintain restricted cash or investments to serve as collateral for these leases 
as of december   the amount of restricted cash recorded was million  which was classified as a non current asset on the consolidated balance sheet 
at december   cypress had purchase commitments aggregating million  principally for manufacturing equipment  and facilities  bulk gas and nitrogen 
these commitments relate to purchases to be made in fiscal of million and the remainder committed through fiscal in june  cypress borrowed million yen at from sumitomo bank japan 
the outstanding principal  including accrued interest  amounts to million at december  and is due in june in may  we invested million in preferred stock of privately held sunpower a manufacturer of ultra high efficiency silicon solar cells 
cypress  at december  owned  and currently owns approximately of sunpower on an as converted basis 
we own a warrant to purchase an additional million in preferred stock in sunpower 
if we do not exercise the warrant by april   or the warrant expires  we will be obligated  based on our current agreements  to fund sunpower up to million through may in february  we loaned sunpower million 
sunpower  which was accounted for under the equity method in fiscal due to the existence of substantive participating rights by the minority shareholders  will be a consolidated subsidiary of cypress at the time  if any  when we have effective control 
any future funding of sunpower is based upon sunpower achieving its planned business milestones in if sunpower achieves its milestones in  we anticipate we will burther fund sunpower resulting in us obtaining effective control in fiscal page below is a summary of fixed payments related to certain contractual obligations  including synthetic lease arrangements 
payment timing may be subject to change 
payments due by period in thousands total years year years years convertible subordinated notes including interest operating leases  including synthetic leases purchase commitments customer advances short term borrowing sunpower commitments total as of december   cypress was in violation of one covenant related to two synthetic lease agreements with one lessor for buildings located on the main campus in san jose  california 
cypress expects to receive a waiver for this violation during the first quarter of if cypress does not receive the waiver  then cypress will either purchase the building or pursue alternative financing arrangements 
capital resources and financial condition our long term strategy is to maintain a minimum amount of cash and cash equivalents for operational purposes and to invest the remaining amount of our cash in interest bearing and highly liquid cash equivalents and marketable debt securities 
accordingly  in addition to the million in cash and cash equivalents that we currently have for short term requirements  we have approximately million in marketable debt securities that are available for future operating  financing and investing activities  for a total liquid cash and investment position of million 
cypress has an additional million of restricted cash as more fully discussed in note to our consolidated financial statements included in this report for a total cash  investment and restricted cash position of million 
as of december  cypress has issued million in convertible subordinated securities from a million shelf registration statement filed in fiscal we believe that liquidity provided by existing cash  cash equivalents  investments  our borrowing arrangements described above and cash generated from operations  will provide sufficient capital to meet our requirements for at least the next twelve months 
however  should prevailing economic conditions and or financial  business and other factors beyond our control adversely affect our estimates of our future cash requirements including our debt obligations  we would be required to fund our cash requirements by alternative financing 
there can be no assurance that additional financing  if needed  would be available on terms acceptable to us or at all 
we may choose at any time to raise additional capital to strengthen our financial position  facilitate growth  and provide us with additional flexibility to take advantage of business opportunities that arise 
as disclosed in note  as of december  cypress was in violation of one covenant related to two synthetic lease agreements with one lessor for buildings located on our main campus in san jose  california 
cypress expects to receive a waiver for this violation during the first quarter of fiscal if cypress does not receive the waiver  then cypress will purchase the buildings for their lease balance or find another buyer 
if cypress elects the purchase option  then existing restricted cash will be used to purchase the buildings 
at the end of fiscal  the restricted cash recorded for these leases was adequate to cover the purchase price 
during the first quarter of fiscal  cypress entered into negotiations with a third party to replace the current lessor on the leases referenced above 
cypress expects to complete this transaction in the second quarter of fiscal subsequent events in q  we announced that further actions would be taken as part of our restructuring efforts 
these actions include a workforce reduction in q that we anticipate will result in a charge of approximately million 
in addition  on december  we exercised an option to purchase the lynwood  washington building from the developer for million in cash 
page critical accounting policies our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and the results of our operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements included in this report and the data used to prepare them 
our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states and we are required to make estimates  judgments and assumptions in the course of such preparation 
note to the consolidated financial statements describes the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements 
on an ongoing basis  we re evaluate our judgments and estimates including those related to revenue recognition  product returns  allowances for doubtful accounts receivable and employee loans  inventories  valuation of long lived assets including intangibles  investment impairments  restructuring charges  goodwill impairments  income taxes  litigation and contingencies 
we base our estimates and judgments on our historical experience  knowledge of current conditions and our beliefs of what could occur in the future considering available information 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following are our critical accounting policies that are affected by significant estimates  assumptions and judgments used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition we generate revenue by selling our products to original equipment manufacturers and distributors 
our policy is to recognize revenue from sales to customers when title and the rights and risks of ownership have passed to the customer  when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  the product has been delivered  the price is fixed and determinable and collection of the resulting receivable is reasonably assured 
we allow certain distributors  primarily based in the united states  rights of return and other credits for price protection 
given the uncertainties associated with the levels of returns and other credits issuable to these distributors  we defer recognition of revenue from sales to these distributors until they have resold our products 
our method of deferral is based on certain assumptions  including average gross margins 
if actual results differ from our estimates  future operating results could be adversely affected 
sales to certain other primarily non us based distributors carry either no or very limited rights of return 
we have historically been able to estimate returns and other credits from these distributors and accordingly have historically recognized revenue from sales to these distributors on shipment  with a related allowance for potential returns established at the time of our sale 
we must make estimates of potential future product returns and revenue adjustments related to current period product revenue 
management analyzes historical returns  current economic trends in the semiconductor industry  changes in customer demand and acceptance of our products when evaluating the adequacy of our allowance for sales returns 
if management made different judgments or utilized different estimates  material differences in the amount of our reported revenue may result 
we provide for these situations based on our experience with specific customers and our expectations for revenue adjustments based on economic conditions within the semiconductor industry 
at december   december  and december  our reserves for sales returns were million  million  and million  respectively 
allowance for doubtful accounts and employee loans we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for losses that we estimate will arise from our customers inability to make required payments 
we make our estimates of the collectibility of our accounts receivable by analyzing historical bad debts  specific customer creditworthiness and current economic trends 
at december   the allowance for doubtful accounts was million at december  it was million and at december  it was million 
cypress has outstanding loans  consisting of principal and cumulative accrued interest  of million to employees and former employees under the shareholder approved employee stock purchase assistance plan 
each loan is evidenced by a full recourse promissory note executed by the employee in favor of cypress and is secured by a pledge of the shares of cypress s common stock purchased with the proceeds of the loan 
as of december   cypress has a loss reserve against these accounts of million 
in determining the reserve  management considered various factors  including an independent fair value analysis of these employee and former employee loans and the underlying collateral 
at december   the difference between the carrying value of the loan and the underlying common stock collateral was million 
if the underlying assumptions supporting our reserve requirements change  including the value of our stock price  future operating results could be adversely affected 
page accounting for income taxes cypress s global operations involve manufacturing  r d and selling activities outside the united states 
profit from non us sales are tax deferred until repatriated back to the us this lowers our effective tax rate 
if management decides to remit these earnings to the us in a future period  our provision for taxes may increase materially in that period 
significant management judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes and in determining whether deferred tax assets will be realized in full or in part 
when it is more likely than not that all or some portion of the deferred tax assets will not be realized  a valuation allowance must be established for the amount of the deferred tax assets that are determined not to be realizable 
as at december   we have recorded a full valuation allowance against our net deferred tax assets 
while we consider historical levels of income  expectations and risks associated with estimates of future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for the valuation allowance  in the event that we determine that we would be able to realize deferred tax assets in the future in excess of the net recorded amount  we would record an adjustment to the deferred tax asset valuation allowance 
this adjustment would increase income in the period such determination was made 
we have recorded valuation allowances against our net deferred tax assets of million at december  and million at december  and none at december  the valuation allowances relate primarily to deferred tax assets in the us  where the realization of tax benefit of such assets is not assured 
valuation of inventory we write down our inventory for lower of cost or market reserves  aged inventory reserves and obsolescence reserves 
inventory reserves are generally recorded when the inventory for a device exceeds nine months of demand for that device and or when individual parts have been in inventory for greater than six months 
our inventories represent high technology parts that may be subject to rapid technological obsolescence and which are sold in a highly competitive industry 
if actual product demand or selling prices are less favorable than we estimate  we may be required to take additional inventory write downs 
conversely  if demand comes back for devices that have been fully reserved  our future margins may be higher 
valuation of long lived assets our business requires heavy investment in manufacturing facilities that are technologically advanced but can quickly become significantly under utilized or rendered obsolete by rapid changes in demand for semiconductors produced in those facilities 
in addition  we have recorded intangible assets related to our acquisitions 
we evaluate our long lived assets and intangible assets in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for impairment or disposal of long lived assets sfas 
we review our other long lived assets  including property and equipment and other identifiable finite intangible assets  for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of such assets may not be recoverable 
factors considered important that could result in an impairment review include significant underperformance relative to expected historical or projected future operating results  significant changes in the manner of use of acquired assets or the strategy for its business  significant negative industry or economic trends  and a significant decline in our stock price for a sustained period of time 
impairments are recognized based on the difference between the fair value of the asset and its carrying value  and fair value is generally measured based on discounted cash flow analyses 
we recorded an impairment charge on indefinite useful lived intangibles in the fourth quarter of fiscal of million related to slm 
if there is a significant decrease in our business in the future  we may be required to record impairment charges in the future 
page goodwill impairments we perform goodwill impairment tests on an annual basis and between annual tests in certain circumstances for each reporting unit  refer to note in the consolidated financial statements included in this report 
the process of evaluating the potential impairment of goodwill is highly subjective and requires significant judgment at many points during the analysis 
in estimating the fair value of the businesses with recognized goodwill for the purposes of our fiscal consolidated financial statements  we made estimates and judgments about the future cash flows of these businesses 
our cash flow forecasts were based on assumptions that are consistent with the plans and estimates we are using to manage the underlying businesses 
in addition  we made certain judgments about allocating shared assets such as accounts receivable and inventory to the estimated balance sheet for those businesses 
we also considered our market capitalization on the dates of our impairment tests under sfas  in determining the fair value of the respective businesses 
in connection with the adoption of sfas  effective the beginning of fiscal  we completed the required transistional analysis in q with no impairment charge required 
in addition  as required by sfas  we performed our annual goodwill impairment test 
we performed this test in q as a result of this impairment test  we recorded a goodwill impairment charge of million related to slm 
however  changes in these estimates  including projected cash flows of our market capitalization  could cause one or more of the businesses to be valued differently  which could result in a future impairment of our remaining goodwill 
restructuring costs we currently have two active restructuring plans one initiated in the third quarter of fiscal and the other initiated in the fourth quarter of fiscal after it became clear that actions taken in the previous year would not be sufficient to return the company to profitability 
both plans were designed to reduce costs and expenses in order to return the company to profitability 
the current accounting for restructuring costs requires us to record provisions and charges when we have a formal and committed plan 
in connection with these plans  we have recorded estimated expenses for severance and outplacement costs  lease cancellations  asset write offs and other restructuring costs 
given the significance of  and the timing of the execution of such activities  this process is complex and involves periodic reassessments of estimates made at the time the original decisions were made 
we continually evaluate the adequacy of the remaining liabilities under our restructuring initiatives 
although we believe that these estimates accurately reflect the costs of our restructuring plans  actual results may differ  thereby requiring us to record additional provisions or reverse a portion of such provisions 
recent accounting pronouncements in june  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for asset retirement obligations sfas which provides accounting and reporting guidance for legal obligations associated with the retirement of long lived assets that result from the acquisition  construction or normal operation of a long lived asset

in april  the fasb issued sfas no 
 rescission of fas nos 
  and  amendment of fas no 
 and technical corrections sfas 
among other things  sfas rescinds various pronouncements regarding early extinguishment of debt and allows extraordinary accounting treatment for early extinguishment only when the provisions of apb opinion no 
 reporting the results of operations reporting the effects of disposal of a segment of a business  and extraordinary  unusual and infrequently occurring events and transactions are met

in june  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for exit or disposal activities sfas 
sfas addresses the recognition  measurement and reporting of costs associated with exit and disposal activities  including restructuring activities that are currently accounted for pursuant to the guidance set forth in emerging issues task force eitf issue no 
 liability recognition for certain employee termination benefits and other costs to exit an activity including certain costs incurred in a restructuring 
the scope of sfas includes costs related to terminating a contract that is not a capital lease  costs to consolidate facilities or relocate employees  and certain termination benefits provided to employees who are involuntarily terminated 
sfas is effective for exit or disposal activities initiated after december  we do not expect that the adoption of sfas will have a significant impact on our consolidated financial statements 
page in november  the fasb issued fasb interpretation no 
 guarantor s accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees  including indirect guarantees of indebtedness of others fin 
fin requires that a liability be recorded in the guarantor s balance sheet upon issuance of a guarantee 
in addition  fin requires disclosures about the guarantees that an entity has issued 
we will apply the recognition provisions of fin prospectively to guarantees issued after december  we are currently in the process of evaluating the potential impact that the adoption of fin will have on our consolidated financial statements 
in december  the fasb issued sfas no  accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure an amendment of fas sfas 
sfas provides additional transition guidance for those entities that elect to voluntarily adopt the accounting provisions of sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation sfas 
since we intend to continue to apply the intrinsic value method of accounting for stock based compensation  the adoption of sfas will not have an effect on our consolidated financial statements 
however  we will provide the additional disclosures required by sfas in in january  the fasb issued fasb interpretation no 
 consolidation of variable interest entities  an interpretation of arb no 
fin 
fin requires certain variable interest entities to be consolidated by the primary beneficiary of the entity if the equity investors in the entity do not have the characteristics of a controlling financial interest or do not have sufficient equity at risk for the entity to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support from other parties 
fin is effective immediately for all new variable interest entities created or acquired after january  for variable interest entities created or acquired prior to february   the provisions of fin must be applied for the first interim or annual period beginning after june  we are currently evaluating the effect that fin will have on our consolidated financial statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk interest and foreign currency exchange rates cypress is exposed to financial market risks  including changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates 
to mitigate these risks  cypress utilizes derivative financial instruments 
cypress does not use derivative financial instruments for speculative or trading purposes 
the fair value of cypress s investment portfolio would not be significantly impacted by either a basis point increase or decrease in interest rates due mainly to the short term nature of the major portion of cypress s investment portfolio 
an increase in interest rates would not significantly increase interest expense due to the fixed nature of cypress s debt obligations 
a majority of cypress s revenue and capital spending is transacted in us dollars 
however  cypress does enter into these transactions in other currencies  primarily japanese yen and euro 
to protect against reductions in value and the volatility of future cash flows caused by changes in foreign exchange rates  cypress has established revenue and balance sheet hedging programs 
cypress s hedging programs reduce  but do not always eliminate  the impact of foreign currency exchange rate movements 
based on cypress s overall currency rate exposure at december   a near term appreciation or depreciation in the us dollar  relative to the japanese yen or the euro  would have an immaterial effect on cypress s financial position  results of operations and cash flows over the next fiscal year 
all of the potential changes noted above are based on sensitivity analyses performed on cypress s balances as of december  equity options at december   cypress had outstanding a series of equity options on cypress common stock with an initial cost of million  which is classified in stockholders equity 
the contracts require physical settlement and expire in june upon expiration of the options  if cypress s stock price is above the threshold price of per share  cypress will receive a settlement value totaling million 
if cypress s stock price is below the threshold price of per share  cypress will receive million shares of its common stock 
during fiscal  the contracts resulted in net cash inflows of million 
page investments in privately held companies cypress has also invested in several privately held companies  all of which can be considered in the startup or development stages 
these investments are inherently risky as the market for the technologies or products they have under development are typically in the early stages and may never materialize 
as of december   cypress had invested million  in development stage companies  all of which could be lost if the companies are not successful 
as our equity investments generally do not permit us to exert significant influence or control over the entity in which we are investing  these amounts generally represent our cost of the investment  less any adjustments we make when we determine that an investment s net realizable value is less than its carrying cost 
the process of assessing whether a particular equity investment s net realizable value is less than its carrying cost requires a significant amount of judgment 
in making this judgment  we carefully consider the investee s cash position  projected cash flows both short and long term  financing needs  most recent valuation data  the current investing environment  management ownership changes  and competition 
this evaluation process is based on information that we request from these privately held companies 
this information is not subject to the same disclosure and audit requirements as the reports required of us public companies  and as such  the reliability and accuracy of the data may vary 
based on our evaluation  we recorded impairment charges related to our investments in privately held companies of million in fiscal  million in fiscal and none in fiscal estimating the net realizable value of investments in privately held early stage technology companies is inherently subjective and may contribute to volatility in our reported results of operations 
for example  if the current weak investing environment continues throughout fiscal  we may incur additional impairments to our equity investments in privately held companies 
stock purchase assistance plan included in other current assets as of the year end of fiscal  cypress has outstanding loans  consisting of principal and cumulative accrued interest  of million to employees and former employees under the shareholder approved employee stock purchase assistance plan 
as of the end of fiscal  the outstanding principal and cumulative accrued interest totaled million 
cypress made the loans to employees for the purpose of purchasing cypress common stock 
each loan is evidenced by a full recourse promissory note executed by the employee in favor of cypress and is secured by a pledge of the shares of cypress s common stock purchased with the proceeds of the loan 
the primary benefit to cypress from this program is increased employee retention 
in accordance with the plan  the ceo and the board of directors do not participate in this program 
to date  there have been immaterial write offs 
as of december  cypress has a loss reserve against these loans of million 
in determining the reserve  management considered various factors  including an independent fair value analysis of these employee and former employee loans and the underlying collateral 
at december   the difference between the carrying value of the loan and the underlying common stock collateral was million 
if there were an additional decline in the stock price  the difference between the carrying value of the loan and the underlying common stock collateral would be million 
if the stock continues at the same level  or does not increase  cypress may have to further evaluate the reserve 
however  cypress is willing to pursue every available avenue  including those covered under the uniform commercial code  to recover these loans by pursuing employees personal assets should the employees not repay these loans
