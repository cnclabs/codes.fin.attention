critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues  and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
by their nature  these judgments are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty 
on an ongoing basis management evaluates its estimates  including those related to the allowance for doubtful notes and accounts  allowances for customer returns and adjustments  inventory reserves and for impairment of real property investments  long term investments and other long lived assets 
management bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that management believes to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form a basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions  however  management believes that its estimates  including those for the above described items  are reasonable and that the actual results will not vary significantly from the estimated amounts 
the following critical accounting policies relate to the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements allowances for doubtful notes and accounts and customer returns and adjustments the company maintains an allowance for doubtful notes and accounts for estimated losses resulting from customers or other parties failure to make payments on trade or notes receivable due to the company 
in addition  the company maintains allowances for customer returns  trade discounts  customer chargebacks  and for sales and markdown allowances given to the customer  typically at the end of the selling seasons  which enable customers to markdown the retail sales prices of any remaining goods on hand 
the estimates for these allowances and discounts are based on a number of factors  including historical experience  aging of the trade accounts receivable  specific information obtained by the company on the financial condition and current credit worthiness of customers or other parties  and specific agreements or negotiated amounts with customers 
if the financial condition of the company s customers were to deteriorate and reduce the ability of the company s customers to make payments on their accounts  the company may be required to increase its allowances by recording additional bad debt expense 
further  while the company believes that it has negotiated all substantial sales and markdown allowances with its customers  additional allowances may be requested by customers 
likewise  should the financial condition of the company s customers or other parties improve and result in payments or favorable settlements of previously reserved amounts  the company may be required to record a reduction in bad debt expense to reverse recorded allowances 
inventory reserves the company analyzes out of season merchandise on a sku by sku basis to determine reserves  if any  that may be required 
factors considered in evaluating the requirement for reserves include product styling  color  current fashion trends and quantities on hand 
many of the company s products are classics and remain saleable from one season to the next and therefore no reserves are generally required on these products 
an estimate is made of the market value  less costs to dispose and a normal profit margin  of products whose value is determined to be impaired 
if these products are ultimately sold at less than estimated amounts  additional reserves may be required 
likewise  if these products are sold for more than estimated amounts  reserves may be reduced 
impairment of long lived assets the company s long lived assets include real property investments  long term investments  property and goodwill

additionally  economic conditions and other factors in foreign countries and elsewhere affect certain of the company s real property investments and long term investments 
where impairment indicators exist  management uses available information  including estimated future undiscounted cash flows to estimate impairment  if any 
factors could develop to cause the company to recognize additional impairment of long lived assets 
if the impairment estimates are excessive  gains may be recognized upon disposal or sale of the assets 
likewise  if insufficient impairment charges have been recorded  losses may be recognized upon disposal or sale of the assets 
outlook the company believes that the primary reason for its success in recent years has been its ability to offer classic and new products and a high level of quality and services to its customers 
management is committed to continue to offer such quality and services to its customers

the ability of the company to compete is enhanced by its financial strength

further  retailers have concentrated more volume with a fewer number of vendors 
the company has responded by expanding its product line in the sweater business and by acquiring item eyes 
by increasing its utilization of foreign sources  the company can offer greater variety in yarns  styling and surface treatment at competitive prices 
seasonality the company s apparel business is highly seasonal 
approximately of net sales occurred in the third and fourth quarters of fiscal effects of changing prices the company is subject to the effects of changing prices
