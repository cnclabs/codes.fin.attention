table of contents general the company s primary lending activity is the making of small  non recourse loans secured by tangible personal property through its pawnshops 
the income earned on this activity is pawn service charge revenue 
while allowable service charges vary by state and by amount of the loan  a majority of the company s pawn loans are in amounts that permit pawn service charges of per month or per annum 
the company s average pawn loan amount has historically averaged between and the allowable term of pawn loans also differs by state  but is typically days with an automatic day extension 
the company sells merchandise acquired primarily through pawn loan forfeitures and  to a lesser extent  through purchases of customers merchandise 
the realization of gross profit on sales of inventory primarily depends on the company s initial assessment of the property s resale value 
improper assessment of the resale value of the collateral in the lending function can result in reduced marketability of the property and the realization of a lower margin 
the company also offers unsecured payday loans in of its pawnshops  ezmoney mono line stores  and in its call center as of november  in locations and its call center  the company markets and services payday loans made by county bank  a federally insured delaware bank 
after origination of the loans  the company may purchase an participation in the loans made by county bank and marketed by the company 
in of its locations  the company makes payday loans directly  operating under state law 
the average payday loan amount is approximately and the terms are generally less than days  averaging about days 
the service charge per loaned is typically for a to day period  but varies in certain locations 
critical accounting policies and estimates management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are based upon the company s consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  management evaluates its estimates and judgments  including those related to revenue recognition  inventory  allowance for losses on payday loans  long lived and intangible assets  income taxes  contingencies and litigation 
management bases its estimates on historical experience  observable trends  and various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
management uses this information to make judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from the estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
management believes the following critical accounting policies affect its more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements 
pawn loan revenue recognition pawn service charges are recorded using the interest method for all pawn loans the company deems to be collectible 
the company bases its estimate of uncollectible loans on several factors  including recent redemption rates  historical trends in redemption rates  and the amount of loans due in the following three months 
unexpected variations in any of these factors could increase or decrease the company s estimate of uncollectible loans  affecting the company s earnings and financial condition 
in fiscal  million of recorded pawn service charge revenue was collected in cash  and million resulted from an increase in accrued pawn service charges receivable 
payday loan revenue recognition payday loans and related service charges reported in the company s consolidated financial statements reflect only the company s participation interest in these loans 
the company accrues service charges on the percentage of loans the company deems to be collectible using the interest method 
accrued service charges related to defaulted loans are deducted 
table of contents from service charge revenue upon loan default  and increase service charge revenue upon subsequent collection 
in fiscal  million of recorded payday loan service charge revenue was collected in cash  and million resulted from an increase in accrued payday loan service charges receivable 
allowance for losses on payday loans unlike pawn loans  payday loans are unsecured  and their profitability is highly dependent upon the company s ability to manage the default rate and collect defaulted loans 
the company considers a loan defaulted if the loan has not been repaid or refinanced by the maturity date 
although defaulted loans may be collected later  the company charges defaulted loans principal to bad debt upon default  leaving only active loans in the reported balance 
subsequent collections of principal are recorded as a reduction of bad debt at the time of collection 
the company also provides an allowance for losses on active payday loans and related service charges receivable 
this estimate is based largely on recent net default rates and expected seasonal fluctuations in default rates 
the accuracy of the company s allowance estimate is dependent upon several factors  including its ability to predict future default rates based on historical trends and expected future events 
actual loan losses could vary from those estimated due to variance in any of these factors 
changes in the principal valuation allowance are charged to bad debt expense  a component of operations expense in the company s statement of operations 
changes in the service charge receivable valuation allowance are charged to payday loan service charge revenue 
increased defaults and credit losses may occur during a national or regional economic downturn  or could occur for other reasons  resulting in the need to increase the allowance 
the company believes it effectively manages these risks through its underwriting criteria  closely monitoring the performance of the portfolio  and participating in loans made by a bank using similar strategies 
inventory if a pawn loan is not repaid  the forfeited collateral inventory is recorded at cost pawn loan principal 
the company does not record loan loss allowances or charge offs on the principal portion of pawn loans 
in order to state inventory at the lower of cost or market net realizable value  the company provides an allowance for shrinkage and excess  obsolete  or slow moving inventory 
the company s inventory valuation allowance is based on the type and age of merchandise as well as recent sales trends and margins 
at september   this allowance was approximately million  or of the gross inventory balance 
changes in the inventory valuation allowance are recorded as cost of goods sold 
the accuracy of the company s inventory allowance is dependent on its ability to predict future events based on historical trends 
unexpected variations in sales margins  inventory turnover  or other factors  including fluctuations in gold prices could increase or decrease the company s inventory allowance 
valuation of tangible long lived assets the company assesses the impairment of tangible long lived assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
factors which could trigger an impairment review include the following significant underperformance relative to historical or projected future cash flows  significant changes in the manner of use of the assets or the strategy for the overall business  and significant negative industry trends 
when management determines that the carrying value of tangible long lived assets may not be recoverable  impairment is measured based on the excess of the assets carrying value over the estimated fair value 
no impairment of tangible long lived assets was recognized in fiscal   or effect of adoption of new accounting principle the company adopted the statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets effective october  under its provisions  goodwill and other intangible assets having indefinite lives are no longer subject to amortization but will be tested for impairment annually  or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the assets might be impaired 
with the adoption of sfas no 
 the company ceased amortization of goodwill and pawn licenses  which lowered amortization expense approximately  annually  beginning october  the company also ceased goodwill amortization related to its equity investment in a b  resulting in a  annual increase in equity in net income of unconsolidated affiliates 
during the quarter ended december   the 
table of contents company completed impairment tests of its goodwill and pawn licenses 
the testing estimated enterprise value based on discounted cash flows and market capitalization and indicated no impairment of pawn licenses and implied fair value of goodwill of based on the allocation of enterprise value to all of the company s assets and liabilities 
this resulted in an million  net of tax  impairment charge for goodwill recorded as a cumulative effect of adopting a new accounting principle 
the company assesses its goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets as of july of each year or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate impairment 
excluding the cumulative adjustment recognizing impairment of the company s goodwill  the company concluded that there was no impairment of its indefinite lived intangible assets in fiscal income taxes as part of the process of preparing the consolidated financial statements  the company is required to estimate income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which it operates 
this process involves estimating the actual current tax liability together with assessing temporary differences in recognition of income for tax and accounting purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included in the company s consolidated balance sheet 
management must then assess the likelihood that the deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income 
in the event that the company was to determine that it would not be able to realize all or part of its net deferred tax assets in the future  a valuation allowance would be charged to the income tax provision in the period such determination was made 
likewise  should the company determine that it would be able to realize its deferred tax assets in the future in excess of its net recorded amount  a decrease to a valuation allowance would increase income in the period such determination was made 
significant management judgment is required in determining the provision for income taxes  deferred tax assets and liabilities  and any valuation allowance recorded against deferred tax assets 
no adjustments were made to the company s valuation allowance in fiscal or at september   the company reversed its million valuation allowance on its deferred tax assets  based on management s estimate of taxable income in the three years following fiscal projected levels of pre tax earnings over the next three years  primarily attributable to ordinary and recurring operating results  are sufficient to generate the million required amount of taxable income to realize the net deferred tax assets 
the company intends to evaluate the realizability of the deferred tax assets quarterly by assessing the need for a valuation allowance  if any 
uncertainties that might impact the realization of the deferred tax assets include possible declines in revenues and margins 
equity in net income of a b the company accounts for its investment in a b using the equity method 
since a b s fiscal year ends three months prior to the company s fiscal year  the income reported by the company for its investment in a b is on a three month lag

the company has calculated the fair value of options granted in these periods using the black scholes option pricing model and has disclosed the pro forma impact on net income in note i to the consolidated financial statements 
disclosure and internal controls based on an assessment of the effectiveness of the company s disclosure controls and procedures  accounting policies  and the underlying judgments and uncertainties affecting the application of those policies and procedures  management believes that the company s consolidated financial statements provide a meaningful and fair perspective of the company 
table of contents in all material respects 
there have been no significant changes in internal controls or in other factors that could significantly affect internal controls subsequent to the date of our most recent evaluation 
management identified no significant deficiencies or material weaknesses in internal controls 
other risk factors  such as those discussed elsewhere in this annual report as well as changes in business strategies  could adversely impact the consolidated financial position  results of operations  and cash flows in future periods 
results of operations fiscal compared to fiscal the company s fiscal pawn service charge revenue increased  or million from fiscal to million 
this represents an increase in same store pawn service charge revenue million offset by the decrease in pawn service charge revenue from closed stores million 
the improvement in same store pawn service charge revenue was due to a three percentage point improvement in loan yields to in fiscal variations in the annualized loan yield  as seen between these periods  are due generally to changes in the statutory fees that can be charged  changes in the level of loan forfeitures and a mix shift between loans with different yields 
excluding the effect of closed stores  the company s fiscal average balance of pawn loans outstanding was higher and ending pawn loans outstanding were lower than in fiscal fiscal sales increased million from fiscal to million 
the increase was due to an increase in same store sales million and an increase in jewelry scrapping sales million  offset by a reduction in sales from closed stores million

margins on merchandise sales  excluding jewelry scrapping  decreased percentage points as a result of higher loan values on forfeited collateral  more aggressive discounting  and a higher inventory valuation allowance  primarily on aged general merchandise 
improvements in jewelry scrapping margins  due largely to higher gold prices  more than offset the decrease in merchandise sales margins  leading to the improvement in overall margins 
inventory shrinkage  included in cost of goods sold  was of merchandise sales in fiscal compared to in fiscal the higher level of gross profit for jewelry scrapping sales  seen in the table above  is largely due to higher gold prices  which reached historical five year highs during fiscal future fluctuations in gold prices would have an immediate and direct impact on the sales proceeds  or revenue per gram of gold scrapped 
the company may react to gold price changes by adjusting the amount it would lend on gold jewelry  which may ultimately impact the cost of scrapped gold

payday loan service charge revenue and bad debt expense each increased from fiscal primarily due to higher average loan balances 
the loan balance increased primarily due to the maturing of the product 
the company s significant improvement in net defaults was primarily due to continued refinements in the company s collection efforts and improvements to its underwriting criteria as it gains more experience with this product 
the company provides a valuation allowance on both the principal and fees receivable for payday loans 
due to the short term nature of these loans  the company uses recent net default rates and anticipated seasonal changes in the rate of defaults as the basis for its valuation allowance  rather than reserving the annual rate 
at september   the valuation allowance was of the payday loan principal and fee receivable 
in fiscal  store operating expenses as a percent of net revenues increased percentage points to 
this increase is largely due to a million increase in labor  incentive compensation  and benefits and a million increase in robberies related primarily to one gang that has been apprehended 
fiscal operating expenses also reflect a volume related million increase in payday loan bad debt and other direct payday loan transaction expenses  million higher rent on computer equipment upgrades  and a million increase in rent from the sale leaseback of previously owned store locations 
the incremental sale leaseback rent expense was largely offset by related decreases in depreciation of the sold locations and lower interest expense from debt retired with the proceeds of the sale leaseback transactions

coupled with these is a million reduction in amortization resulting from the adoption of sfas no

the company s million fiscal cash flow from operations consisted of million of earnings before depreciation  amortization  and other non cash items and million of changes in operating assets and liabilities  primarily inventory and accounts payable

during the fiscal year ending september   the company plans to open to mono line payday loan stores  including those adjoining ezpawn stores at an expected aggregate capital expenditure of approximately million  plus the funding of working capital and start up losses at these stores 
while the company anticipates that these new stores will contribute to increased future earnings  it expects they will have a negative effect on earnings in their first year of operation 
the company anticipates that cash flow from operations and availability under its revolving credit facility will be adequate to fund planned store growth  capital expenditures  and working capital requirements during the coming year 
the company s million credit agreement increased from million on june  matures march  availability of funds under the revolving credit facility is tied to loan and inventory balances  and advances are secured by the company s assets 
the company may choose either a eurodollar rate or the agent bank s base rate 
interest accrues at the eurodollar rate plus to basis points or the agent bank s base rate plus to basis points  depending on the leverage ratio computed at the end of each quarter  subject to a minimum rate of 
terms of the agreement require  among other things  that the company meet certain financial covenants that the company believes will be achieved based upon its current and anticipated performance 
in addition  payment of dividends is prohibited and additional debt is restricted 
at september   the company had million outstanding on the revolving credit facility 
seasonality historically  service charge revenues are highest in the company s first fiscal quarter october through december due to improving loan redemption rates coupled with a higher average loan balance following the summer lending season 
sales generally are highest in the company s first and second fiscal quarters october through march due to the holiday season and the impact of tax refunds 
sales volume can be heavily influenced by the timing of decisions to scrap excess jewelry inventory  which generally occurs during low jewelry sales periods may through october 
the net effect of these factors is that net revenues and net income typically are highest in the first and second fiscal quarters 
the company s cash flow is greatest in its second fiscal quarter primarily due to a high level of loan redemptions and sales in the income tax refund season

the company is exposed to market risk related to changes in interest rates  foreign currency exchange rates  and gold prices 
the company also is exposed to regulatory risk in relation to its payday loans 
the company does not use derivative financial instruments 
the company s earnings and financial position may be affected by changes in gold prices and the resulting impact on pawn lending and jewelry sales 
the proceeds of scrap sales and the company s ability to liquidate excess jewelry inventory at an acceptable margin are dependent upon gold prices 
the impact on the company s financial position and results of operations of a hypothetical change in gold prices cannot be reasonably estimated 
the company s earnings are affected by changes in interest rates due to the impact those changes have on its debt  all of which is variable rate debt
