statements included in this management s discussion and analysis may contain certain forward looking statements within the meaning of section a of the securities act of  as amended the securities act and section e of the securities exchange act of  as amended the exchange act  that involve substantial risks and uncertainties 
when used in this report  the words anticipate  believe  estimate  expect  intend  may and similar expressions identify such forward looking statements 
actual results  performance or achievements could differ materially from those contemplated  expressed or implied by the forward looking statements contained herein 
these forward looking statements are based largely on the expectations of the company or the company s management and are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties  including but not limited to economic  competitive  regulatory  and other factors affecting the company s operations  markets  products and services  as well as expansion strategies and other factors discussed elsewhere in this report filed by the company with the securities and exchange commission 
many of these factors are beyond the company s control 
forward looking statements speak only as of the date they are made 
the company undertakes no obligation to publicly update or revise forward looking information  whether as a result of new  updated information  future events  or otherwise 
application of critical accounting policies the company s consolidated financial statements  are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america and follow general practices within the industries in which it operates 
application of these principles requires management to make estimates  assumptions  and judgments that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes 
these estimates  assumptions and judgments are based on information available as of the date of the financial statements 
accordingly  as this information changes  the financial statements could reflect different estimates  assumptions and judgments 
certain policies inherently have a greater reliance on the use of estimates  assumptions and judgments  and as such have a greater possibility of producing results that could be materially different than originally reported 
estimates  assumptions and judgments are necessary when assets and liabilities are required to be recorded at fair value  when a decline in the value of an asset not carried on the financial statements at fair value warrants an impairment write down or valuation reserve to be established  or when an asset or liability needs to be recorded contingent upon a future event 
carrying assets and liabilities at fair value inherently results in more financial statement volatility 
the fair values and the information used to record valuation adjustments for certain assets and liabilities are based either on quoted market prices or are provided by other third party sources  when available 
when third party information is not available  valuation adjustments are estimated in good faith by management primarily through the use of internal cash flow modeling techniques 
the most significant accounting policies followed by the company are presented in note to the consolidated financial statements 
these policies  along with the disclosures presented in the other financial statement notes and in this financial review  provide information on how significant assets and liabilities are valued in the financial statements and how those values are determined 
based on the valuation techniques used and the sensitivity of financial statement amounts to the methods  assumptions and estimates underlying those amounts  management has identified the determination of the allowance for loan losses and valuation of goodwill to be the accounting areas that require the most subjective or complex judgments and as such could be most subject to revision as new information becomes available 
the allowance for loan losses represents management s estimate of probable credit losses inherent in the loan portfolio 
determining the amount of the allowance for loan losses is considered a critical accounting estimate because it requires significant judgment and the use of estimates related to the amount and timing of expected future cash flows on impaired loans  estimated losses on pools of homogeneous loans based on historical loss experience and consideration of current economic trends and conditions  all of which may be susceptible to significant change 
the loan portfolio also represents the largest asset type on the consolidated balance sheets 
note to the consolidated financial statements describes the methodology used to determine the allowance for loan losses 
the amount of goodwill reflected in the company s consolidated financial statements is required to be tested by management for impairment on at least an annual basis 
the test for impairment of goodwill on the identified reporting unit is considered a critical accounting estimate because it requires judgement and the use of estimates related to the growth assumptions and market multiples used in the valuation model 
recent accounting pronouncements and developments note to the consolidated financial statements discusses new accounting policies adopted by the company during and the expected impact of accounting policies recently issued or proposed but not yet required to be adopted 
to the extent management believes the adoption of new accounting standards materially affects the company s financial condition  results of operations  or liquidity  the impacts are discussed in the applicable section s of this financial review and notes to the consolidated financial statements 
results of operations net interest income  the difference between interest income and fee income on earning assets  such as loans and securities  and interest expense on deposits and borrowings  provides the primary basis for the bank s results of operations 
these results are also impacted by non interest income  the provision for credit losses  non interest expense and income taxes 
net income of million in consists of million related to the company s banking activities and million related to the bank s insurance activities 
the total net income of million or per share in compares to million or per share for the earnings reflect a one time life insurance proceeds receipt of approximately million and an adjustment to reduce pension expense by approximately million 
both items  combined  resulted in a positive impact on earnings of approximately million or per share 
also in  the company adopted statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 under which the company no longer amortizes goodwill 
adjusting earnings to exclude the effects of goodwill amortization  net income for such year increases by million or per share 
for  net income rose million or over after adjusting results to exclude goodwill amortization 
net income in was million or per share 
however  net income includes a one time insurance proceeds benefit of million on a life insurance policy on the former chairman  president and ceo 
this policy was purchased to indirectly fund a future obligation of the bank as part of the supplemental employee retirement plan serp 
excluding the one time insurance proceeds  net income increased by million or over net interest income net interest income is dependent on the amounts and yields on interest earning assets as compared to the amounts of and rates on interest bearing liabilities 
the following table segregates changes in interest earned and paid for the past two years into amounts attributable to changes in volume and changes in rates by major categories of assets and liabilities 
the change in interest income and expense due to both volume and rate has been allocated in the table to volume and rate changes in proportion to the relationship of the absolute dollar amounts of the change in each 
compared to compared to increase decrease due to increase decrease due to volume rate total volume rate total interest earned on loans   taxable securities tax exempt securities federal funds sold time deposits in other banks total interest earning assets    interest paid on now accounts savings deposits time deposits   federal funds purchased other borrowings total interest bearing liabilities   net interest income  before the provision for credit losses  increased to million or in  as compared to million in  an increase of from to this increase in is attributable to the increase in average earning assets of million versus an increase of million in average interest bearing liabilities over this accounts  as indicated in the table above  for a net increase due to volume of approximately million in net interest income 
the tax equivalent yield on earning assets decreased basis points from in to in  while the cost of funds had a greater decrease of basis points  from in to in this resulted in a greater decrease in rate related changes on interest expense versus interest income  or a net increase in net interest income of approximately million 
the bank s net interest margin increased from during to during the increase in net interest income  before the provision for credit losses  in was primarily attributable to the increase in average earning assets of million versus an increase of million in average interest bearing liabilities over the tax equivalent yield on earning assets decreased basis points from in to in the cost of funds decreased only basis points  from in to in the bank s net interest margin decreased from at december   to at december management believes the increase in net interest margin from to is a result of a more stable interest rate environment during after the federal reserve cut key interest rates eleven times in  had only one decrease of basis points 
the more stable rate environment allowed the bank to more effectively manage within the current environment 
the bank believes net interest margin will be challenged in due to two main factors 
banks are not only competing with each other for available business  but with other providers of loan and investment products  such as credit unions and insurance companies 
a wealth of information is easily obtained by consumers via the internet  from television and through print media 
competitors exist beyond the geographic trade area and banks generally have increased business volumes by offering higher deposit rates and lower loan rates  looking to other potential sources of income  such as fees and service charges  to increase earnings 
secondly  as the bank responds to competitive pricing for assets  the current low interest rate environment will make it difficult to competitively adjust the pricing of liabilities much further 
the historically low environment provides the bank a smaller interval to move rates on deposits to offset any decrease on assets 
the bank regularly monitors its exposure to interest rate risk 
the proper management of interest sensitive funds will help protect the bank s earnings against extreme changes in interest rates 
the bank s asset liability management committee alco meets monthly for the purpose of evaluating the bank s short range and long range liquidity position and the potential impact on capital and earnings as a result of sudden changes in interest rates 
the bank has adopted an asset liability policy that specifies minimum limits for liquidity and capital ratios 
ranges have been set for the negative impact acceptable on net interest income and on the market value of equity as a result of a shift in interest rates 
the asset liability policy also includes guidelines for investment activities and funds management 
at its monthly meeting  the alco reviews the bank s status and formulates its strategy based on current economic conditions  interest rate forecasts  loan demand  deposit volatility and the bank s earnings objectives 
allowance for loan losses the allowance for loan losses represents the amount charged against the bank s earnings to establish a reserve or allowance sufficient to absorb expected loan losses based on management s evaluation of the loan portfolio 
factors considered include current loan concentrations  charge off history  delinquent loan percentages  input from regulatory agencies and general economic conditions 
on a quarterly basis  management of the bank meets to review the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses 
in making this determination  the company analyzes the ultimate collectibility of the loans in its portfolio by incorporating feedback provided by internal loan staff  an independent loan review function and information provided by examinations performed by regulatory agencies 
the analysis of the allowance for loan losses is composed of three components specific credit allocation  general portfolio allocation and subjectively by determined allocation 
the specific credit allocation includes a detailed review of the credit in accordance with sfas no 
and no 
 and allocation is made based on this analysis 
the general portfolio allocation consists of an assigned reserve percentage based on the credit rating of the loan 
the subjective portion of the allowance reflects management s current assessment of the new york state and local economies 
both have lagged behind national prosperity  which has continued to remain unsettled 
marginal job growth  in conjunction with a declining population base  has left the bank s market more susceptible to potential credit problems 
this is particularly true of commercial borrowers 
commercial loans represent a segment of significant past growth as well as concentration in the company s real estate portfolio 
commercial real estate values may be susceptible to decline in an adverse economy 
management believes that the reserve is also in accordance with regulations promulgated by the occ  and is reflective of its assessment of the local environment as well as a continued growth trend in commercial loans 
in  the bank charged million against earnings for loan losses as compared to million in in  million was charged against earnings for this purpose 
total non performing loans amounted to  at december   as compared to  at december  and  at december  the amount charged to loan losses over the past three years has been greater than the bank s actual loan losses 
the following table provides an analysis of the allowance for loan losses  the total of non performing loans and total allowance for loan losses as a percentage of total loans outstanding for the three years ended december balance  beginning of year    provisions for loan losses    recoveries    loans charged off    balance  end of year    actual loan losses non performing loans allowance for loan losses an allocation of the funding allowance for loan losses by portfolio type over the past five years follows all amounts in balance at balance at balance at balance at balance at attributable attributable attributable attributable attributable to to to to to real estate loans commercial loans leases installment loans including credit cards student loans all other loans unallocated  total    both the total increase in allowance for loan losses and allocation of the allowance to commercial loans and leases are in response to the increase in total commercial loans 
commercial real estate mortgages represent or million of total real estate mortgages at december   as compared to or million at december  commercial real estate contains mortgage loans to developers and owners of commercial real estate 
additionally  commercial loans  which represent loans to a wide variety of businesses  small and moderate across varying industries  has increased to of total loans or million at december   as compared to or million at december  the increased allowance and allocation to commercial categories are to provide for the current economic condition deterioration 
commercial loans are more susceptible to decreases in credit quality in cyclical downturns and the larger individual balances of commercial loans expose the company to larger losses 
in addition  growth in the size of the commercial loan portfolio during required additional allowance to provide for probable losses inherent but undetected in the new loans originated during the year 
the unallocated portion of the allowance reflects estimated probable inherent but undetected losses within the portfolio due to uncertainties in economic conditions  delays in obtaining information  including unfavorable information about a borrower s financial condition  the difficulty in identifying triggering events that correlate perfectly to subsequent loss rates and risk factors that have not yet manifested themselves in loss allocation factors 
in addition  the unallocated allowance includes a component that explicitly accounts for the inherent imprecision in loan loss models 
the company has changed its portfolio mix in recent years 
as a result  historical loss experience data used to establish allocation estimates might not precisely correspond to the current portfolio 
the longer term consequences of the september  terrorist attacks and the recessionary environment also affect the precision of the allocation model s estimates of loss 
given these recent factors  the losses in the historical testing period may not be representative of the actual losses inherent in the portfolio that have not yet been recognized 
the allowance for loan losses is based on estimates  and ultimate losses will vary from current estimates 
the methodology to determine the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses is consistent with prior years 
non interest income total non interest income increased approximately million or in over this compares to an increase of approximately million from to non interest income for included approximately million of life insurance proceeds  which the bank recorded as the beneficiary of a life insurance policy on a director 
excluding this one time item  non interest income increased million or from to income from the m w agency  inc accounted for a substantial portion of this increase in non interest income  approximately million 
the competitive interest rate environment resulted in prepayment fees collected on refinanced loans totaling an additional million 
new mortgage volume and refinancings also increased appraisal fees and premiums received on residential mortgages sold to the federal national mortgage association fnma for approximately million 
enb associates also benefited in the low interest rate environment as customers searched for higher yields in mutual funds and annuities 
enb associates revenue increased million in as compared to additionally  the bank has grown its atm network with the addition of one at the new amherst branch and two new offsite locations during also  the usage of the bank s point of sale debit cards has increased 
both data services have provided approximately an additional million in fees as compared to these increases were offset by a decrease of approximately million in gains realized on the sale of assets  primarily planned sales of securities  totaling approximately million in versus an approximate million gain realized in during  the bank also recognized losses on sales and write downs in the carrying value of foreclosed real estate of million 
non interest income for included approximately million of life insurance proceeds  which the bank recorded as the beneficiary of a life insurance policy on its former chairman  president and ceo 
excluding this one time item  non interest income increased million or from to income from the m w agency  inc accounted for a substantial portion of this increase in non interest income  approximately million in  which was the first full year it was operated by the company 
income on a property foreclosed on in accounted for approximately million in additional income in in  the bank received a six month benefit from the increase in service charges on deposit accounts instituted in july loan related income also increased in this included prepayment penalties collected on loans and dividends received as a result of the bank s participation in the new york state bankers group insurance trust 
gains realized on the sale of assets  primarily planned sales of securities  totaled approximately million in versus an approximate million loss realized in non interest expense total non interest expense increased approximately million or in over in  the ratio of non interest expense to average assets was compared to in and in non interest expense categories include those most impacted by branch expansion and the operations of the m w agency  inc and enb associates inc 
salaries  occupancy  advertising  and supplies  among others 
salary and benefit expense increased in of the million in salary and benefit expense increases in  the bank s operations contributed approximately million of the increase and m w agency contributed approximately million of the increase from the addition of the amherst branch  increased loan staffing  m w agency expansion and promotional increases contributed to the increased salary costs 
m w agency acquired the business  assets and certain liabilities of the eden agency in the beginning of  and opened an additional office at the derby bank branch location  which led to its increased salary and benefits 
the increased costs were offset by an adjustment to reduce pension expense of approximately million related to the supplemental executive retirement plan serp 
occupancy expense increased approximately million or 
the bank s capital expenditures completed in included a new branch in amherst  renovation of an owned building to house the bank s loan operations  renovations to the bank s administrative offices in angola  new york  and m w agency s addition of the eden location 
all additions increased related occupancy expenses utilities  rent  and depreciation  among others 
professional services increased million or 
the bank engaged outside consulting firms and attorneys for a revenue enhancement project  strategic expansion study and assistance in formation of enhc 
miscellaneous other expenses increased million or approximately in expenses associated with internet banking  atm expense  telephone and data line costs  postage costs  maintenance on foreclosed properties  director fees and correspondent bank service charges fall under miscellaneous expenses 
all of these categories increased in as compared to  for approximately million 
due to the january   sfas no 
adoption by the company  systematic goodwill amortization ceased and the net goodwill recorded by the company is evaluated for impairment on an annual basis 
the cessation of amortization expense offset the increases mentioned above by approximately million  which was the expense recognized in salary and benefit expense increased in  over of the million increase in salary and benefit expenses in  approximately million is attributable to the addition of the m w agency  inc the remainder of the increase included merit promotional increases  other additional staffing and expenses related to the bank s retirement plans 
in  occupancy expenses increased about million or 
the cost of the occupancy expense for m w agency  inc contributed million to occupancy expense 
repairs and maintenance increased approximately million or 
this was largely due to m w agency  inc professional services increased about million or due to increased fees related to the listing of the company s common stock on the nasdaq national market 
accounting and legal fees comprised a majority of these expenses 
m w agency  inc professional costs increased as a result of additional audit fees required to perform their annual external audit 
the fdic assessment expense remained stable in as compared to new assessment rates went into effect on january  other insurance decreased approximately million or in due to one time premiums paid in for life insurance policies held on certain bank officers and directors 
miscellaneous other expenses increased or approximately million in expenses associated with internet banking  atm expense  telephone costs  postal costs  maintenance on foreclosed properties  director fees and correspondent bank service charges fall under miscellaneous expenses 
all of these categories increased in as compared to amortization of goodwill related to the m w agency  inc acquisition accounted for approximately million of the increase 
evans bancorp  inc parent company expense increased approximately million due to costs incurred for initial listing and annual fees for listing of the company s common stock on the nasdaq national market 
m w agency  inc miscellaneous costs increased approximately due to a full year of operation as a part of the company in versus four months during pension the company maintains a qualified defined benefit pension plan  which covers substantially all employees 
additionally  the company has entered into individual retirement agreements with certain current executives providing for unfunded supplemental pension benefits 
our pension expense for all pension plans  including the serp  approximated  and  for the years ended december   and december   respectively  and is calculated based upon a number of actuarial assumptions  including an expected long term rate of return on our plan assets of 
in developing our expected long term rate of return assumption  we evaluated input from our actuary in conjunction with our historical returns based on the asset allocation of our portfolio 
we will continue to evaluate our actuarial assumptions  including our expected rate of return  at least annually  and will adjust as necessary 
we base our determination of pension expense or income on a market related valuation of assets  which reduces year to year volatility 
this market related valuation recognizes investment gains or losses over a three year period from the year in which they occur 
investment gains or losses for this purpose are the difference between the expected return calculated using the market related value of assets and the actual return based on the market related value of assets 
since the market related value of assets recognizes gains or losses over a three year period  the future value of assets will be impacted as previously deferred gains or losses are recorded 
the discount rate utilized for determining future pension obligations is based on a review of long term bonds that receive one of the two highest ratings given by a recognized rating agency 
the discount rate determined on this basis has decreased from at september   for purposes of our deferred benefit pension plan and at december   for purposes of our serp  both of which are the measurement dates  to for both plans at september  and december   respectively 
taxes the provision for income taxes in of million reflects an effective tax rate of approximately 
this compares to million or in and million or in there were two main factors for the decrease in the effective tax rate in the first was due to the establishment of enhc as a reit 
in addition to the flexibility and planning opportunities for the bank  it also provided state tax benefits 
additionally  the life insurance proceeds recorded in were tax exempt and contributed to a more favorable tax position 
the bank also continues to maintain a substantial investment in tax advantaged municipal bonds  which contributes to its favorable tax position 
a significant reason for the increase in the effective tax rate in over was a full year of non tax deductible goodwill amortization expense related to the m w agency acquisition 
additionally  the life insurance proceeds recorded in were tax exempt income also contributing to the favorable tax position in that year 
financial condition the bank had total assets of million at december   an increase of million or over million at december  net loans of million increased or million over the previous year 
securities increased million or and cash and cash equivalents increased million or 
deposits grew by million or 
shareholders equity increased million or 
net unrealized gains losses on investment securities held by the bank increased million over loans loans comprised of the bank s total average earning assets in actual year end balances increased versus an increase of in and in the bank continues to focus its lending on commercial and residential mortgages  commercial loans and home equity loans 
commercial mortgages make up the largest segment of the portfolio at of total loans 
residential mortgages comprise of the portfolio and are home equity loans 
other commercial loans account for of outstanding loans 
commercial loans total million at december   reflecting a or million increase for the year 
total loan growth was in spite of a decrease in total consumer loans of or million for the year  primarily due to the refinancings of fixed rate residential mortgages and corresponding sales of such mortgages in the secondary market  as a result of the low interest rate environment and to minimize interest rate risk in the bank s portfolio 
given the current low interest rate environment  the bank continues to sell certain fixed rateresidential loans originated under a certain interest rate level  while maintaining the servicing right to such loans 
at december   the bank had a loan deposit ratio of 
this compares to a loan deposit ratio of at december  at december   the bank retained the servicing rights to million in long term mortgages sold to the fnma since becoming a member in this compares to a loan servicing portfolio principal balance of million at december  this arrangement allows the bank to offer long term mortgages without exposure to the associated interest rate risks  while retaining customer account relationships 
in and  the bank sold loans to fnma totaling approximately million and million respectively 
the bank did not record any related asset to the servicing portfolio rights as management determined it immaterial 
securities and federal funds sold securities and federal funds sold made up the remaining of the bank s total average earning assets at december  these categories provide the bank with additional sources of liquidity and income 
the bank s securities portfolio increased over the prior year 
it continues to be strongly concentrated in tax advantaged municipal bonds  which make up of the portfolio  us government guaranteed mortgage backed securities which make up of the portfolio  and us government sponsored agency bonds of various types which comprise of the total 
as a member of both the federal reserve system and the federal home loan bank  the bank is required to hold stock in those entities 
these investments made up of the portfolio at december  the credit quality of the securities portfolio is strong  with of the securities portfolio carrying the equivalent of a moody s rating of aaa 
federal funds sold balances are largely maintained for liquidity purposes 
the average balance maintained in federal funds sold increased slightly in to of total average earning assets from in the tax equivalent yield earned on securities and federal funds sold decreased basis points in moving from in to in this compares to in available yields on investments have declined throughout the year 
the bank s investment strategy has been focused on the purchase of seasoned and new production mortgage backed securities of moderate average lives to years  which have been purchased at discounts  at par  and at premiums  to par 
based on the company s evaluation  mortgage backed securities are an appropriate investment vehicle in response to a low interest rate environment 
mortgage backed securities offer competitive yields  provide monthly cash flows  serve as acceptable collateral  and have most of the liquidity characteristics of us treasury notes and bonds 
total mortgage backed securities increased million  or from all fixed and adjustable rate mortgage pools contain a certain amount of risk related to the uncertainty of prepayments of the underlying mortgages 
interest rate changes have a direct impact on prepayment rates 
the company uses a third party s computer simulation model to monitor the average life and yield volatility of mortgage pools under various interest rate assumptions 
the company manages its securities available for sale portfolio on a total return basis 
in this respect  management regularly reviews the performance of its securities and sells specific securities to enhance net interest income and net interest margin 
the bank experienced million in net gains on these sales in sfas no 
outlines accounting and reporting requirements for investment securities 
all securities are designated at the time of purchase as either held to maturity or available for sale 
securities designated as held to maturity are stated on the balance sheet at amortized cost 
those designated as available for sale are reported at fair market value 
at december   million in securities were designated as held to maturity 
these bonds are primarily municipal investments that the bank has made in its local trade area 
the available for sale portfolio totaled million or approximately of the bank s securities portfolio at december  net unrealized gains and losses on available for sale securities resulted in a net unrealized gain of million at december   as compared to million at december  interest rates decreased in as discussed above  driving market prices up on fixed income bonds held in the portfolio 
unrealized gains and losses on available for sale securities are reported  net of taxes  as a separate component of shareholders equity 
at december   the impact to equity was a net unrealized gain of approximately million 
deposits total deposits increased million or in over core deposit growth has been an area the bank has focused on and its success is evident in the increase in demand deposits  increase in now accounts  and increase in savings accounts 
savings deposit growth is primarily due to the bank s success in attracting municipal deposits with a revamped money market type product called muni vest 
muni vest is geared at paying higher money market equivalent rates of return to municipalities and school districts in markets where the bank operates 
time deposits of less than  decreased in  as the bank was less aggressive in in pursuing these generally more costly deposits 
certificates of deposit in excess of  decreased 
these funds are generally not considered core deposits 
many of these deposits are obtained from municipalities through the competitive bidding process 
others are obtained from commercial and retail customers looking for the safety of an fdic insured deposit 
certificates of deposit in excess of  have increased significantly in over the past several years prior to due to the bank s expansion of its trade area 
liquidity the bank utilizes cash flows from the investment portfolio and federal funds sold balances to manage the liquidity requirements it experiences due to loan demand and deposit fluctuations 
the bank also has many borrowing options 
as a member of the federal home loan bank fhlb  the bank is able to borrow funds at competitive rates 
advances of up to million can be drawn on the fhlb via the overnight line of credit agreement 
an amount equal to of the bank s total assets could be borrowed through the advance programs under certain qualifying circumstances 
the bank also has the ability to purchase up to million in federal funds from one of its correspondent banks 
by placing sufficient collateral in safekeeping at the federal reserve bank  the bank could also borrow at the discount window 
additionally  the bank has access to capital markets as a funding source 
the cash flows from the investment portfolio are laddered  so that securities mature at regular intervals  to provide funds from principal and interest payments at various times as liquidity needs may arise 
contractual maturities are also laddered  with consideration as to the volatility of market prices  so that securities are available for sale from time to time without the need to incur significant losses 
at december   approximately of the bank s securities had maturity dates of one year or less and approximately had maturity dates of five years or less 
at december   the bank had net short term liquidity of million as compared to million at december  available assets of million  less public and purchased funds of million  resulted in a long term liquidity ratio of at december   versus at december  liquidity needs can also be met by aggressively pursuing municipal deposits  which are normally awarded on the basis of competitive bidding 
the bank maintains a sufficient level of us government and government agency securities and new york state municipal bonds that can be pledged as collateral for these deposits 
capital the bank has consistently maintained regulatory capital ratios at  or above well capitalized standards 
for further detail on capital and capital ratios  see note to the consolidated financial statements 
total stockholders equity was million at december   up from million at december  equity as a percentage of assets was at december   compared to at december  book value per common share rose to at december   up from at december  in september  the company s board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to  shares of evans bancorp s outstanding common stock over the following two years 
in july of  the board approved an extension of the repurchase plan for two years from the july date 
shares are held for reissue in connection with the company s stock dividend reinvestment plan and general corporate purposes 
during and the company repurchased under the plan  shares and shares  respectively 
subject to ongoing capital and investment considerations  management intends to continue to repurchase shares in on an opportunistic basis 
evans bancorp paid dividends per share of common stock of in  in and in the dividend payout is continually reviewed by management and the board of directors 
the dividend payout ratio  which represents dividends per share divided by earnings per share  was and for the years and  respectively 
interest rate risk the company s asset liability management strategy is to maximize earnings and return on capital while limiting exposure to risks associated with a volatile interest rate environment 
the company s exposure to interest rate risk is managed primarily through the company s strategy of selecting the type and terms of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities that generate favorable earnings  while limiting the potential negative effects of changes in market interest rates 
management uses income simulation models to quantify the potential impact on earnings and capital with changes in interest rates 
the model uses cash flows and repricing information from loans and certificates of deposit  plus repricing assumptions on products without specific repricing dates eg savings and interest bearing demand accounts  to calculate durations of each of the bank s assets and liabilities 
in addition  the model uses management assumptions on growth with duration to project income 
the model also projects the effect on income due to changes in interest rates as well as the value of the company s equity in each of the theoretical rate environments 
the company maintains specific interest rate risk management policy limits 
based on simulation modeling  these guidelines include a of net interest income and a of capital threshold on the value of the company s economic value of equity 
at december   the effect of an immediate basis point increase in interest rate would increase the company s annual net interest income by  or million 
a basis point decrease in interest rate would decrease annual net interest income by or approximately million 
the company and its subsidiary  m w agency  inc  lease certain offices  land and equipment under long term operating leases 
the aggregate minimum annual rental commitments under these leases total approximately  in   in   in   in   in and  thereafter 
financial instruments with off balance sheet risk at december  included million in undisbursed lines of credit at an average interest rate of  million in fixed rate loan origination commitments at  million in adjustable rate loan origination commitments at and million in adjustable rate letters of credit at an average rate of
