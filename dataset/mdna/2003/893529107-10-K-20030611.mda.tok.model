item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition an results of operations reclassification of amounts certain prior year and prior quarter financial information have been made to conform to current quarter and twelve month presentation 

table of contents overview we appreciate that understanding the nature and magnitude of changes that have taken place over the last two years at transcat is complex 
therefore  it is appropriate to review the extent of those changes  and relate those changes to the pro forma statements of operations that are included in item of this report 
at the end of fiscal year  we had manufacturing operations to support our distribution products business  assets of million  including million of net goodwill  and million of debt 
during fiscal year  a number of actions were taken to begin repositioning transcat  including both our organizational and operational structure 
those actions included divesting the mac and tpg business units  with the proceeds of the divestitures reducing our bank debt 
the divestitures allowed us to strategically focus on our distribution products business and growth in our calibration services 
see divestitures above in item and deferred gain on tpg of the critical accounting policies and estimates in item  amending our bank lending agreement for the eighth time  announcing and implementing a corporate consolidated restructuring which resulted in a reduction of employees at march   opening two new calibration laboratories in ottawa and san francisco  and signing a distribution agreement with the purchaser of tpg that included long term purchase requirements 
see distribution agreement above in item at the completion of fiscal year  and throughout fiscal year  we believed it was important to present pro forma statements of operations  to facilitate the understanding of our ongoing business and the comparability of reported operating results 
these pro forma operating results were reconciled to accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america gaap prepared  as reported operating results  and were intended to be used in addition to  and not as a replacement for as reported operating results 
see pro forma statement of operations below in item mr 
carl sassano moved from an external board member to chief executive officer as of april   replacing mr 
robert klimasewski  who resigned on march  during fiscal year  we continued our execution of actions we deemed necessary to develop the foundation for a consistent  profitable business model 
those actions included executing a new three year credit agreement  including a million net gain on extinguishment of debt  which reduced our debt by million see note of the consolidated financial statements  creating ten calibration centers of excellence and  in the process  consolidating four laboratories into existing laboratory operations  completing restructuring of the organization  incurring million of severance charges  changing the senior management team replacing the chief financial officer and eliminating the positions of president calibration services and president distribution products 
at the completion of fiscal year  our balance sheet reflects assets of million  including million of goodwill  and debt of million 
we believe that these actions  which were implemented in a very challenging economic environment  have laid the foundation for profitable growth 
critical accounting policies and estimates financial reporting release no 
requires all companies to include a discussion of critical accounting principles or methods used in the preparation of financial statements 
note of the consolidated financial statements includes a complete discussion of the significant accounting policies and methods used in the 
table of contents preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
a summary of our most critical accounting policies follows revenue recognition 
sales are recorded when products are shipped or services are rendered to customers  as we generally have no significant post delivery obligations  the product price is fixed and determinable  collection of the resulting receivable is probable and product returns are reasonably estimated 
provisions for customer returns are provided for in the period the related sales are recorded based upon historical data 
goodwill 
on april   transcat adopted statement of financial accounting standard sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
upon adopting sfas  we were required to calculate the fair value of recorded goodwill 
if the fair value of the goodwill does not exceed the carrying value of the goodwill  a write down of the remaining goodwill is necessitated 
we evaluated the fair value of our goodwill and determined that a non cash goodwill impairment of million existed at april  accordingly  in the first quarter of fiscal year  we reported a million charge as a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle 
we re evaluated the fair value of our remaining goodwill  consistent with the provisions of sfas no 
 as of march  and determined no further impairment existed 
at march  and  goodwill amounted to million and million  respectively 
a change in business could cause additional write off or impairment 
deferred catalog costs 
transcat amortizes the cost of each master catalog mailed over such catalog s estimated productive life 
we review response results from catalog mailings on a continuous basis  and if warranted  we may modify the period over which costs are recognized 
in the fourth quarter of fiscal year  we determined that useful life for the master catalog approximated the mailing cycle  reducing its productive life from to months  and recognized an additional million in catalog related amortization expense in fiscal year deferred catalog costs totaled million at march  there were no deferred catalog costs at march  deferred gain on tpg 
as a result of certain post divestiture commitments  transcat  according to gaap  is unable to recognize the gain of million on the divestiture of tpg until those commitments expire in fiscal year valuation allowance on deferred tax assets 
a valuation allowance for the full amount of the net deferred tax asset was recorded at march  and the valuation allowance represents the portion of the foreign tax credit carry forwards and other items for which it is more likely than not that the benefit of such items will not be realized 
such valuation allowance increased by approximately million and million for the fiscal years ended march  and  respectively 
stock options 
transcat has elected the use of the accounting principle board apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  which does not require compensation costs related to stock options to be recorded in net income  as all options granted under the stock option plan had exercise prices equal to the market value of the underlying common stock at grant date 
sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure an amendment of fasb statement no 
requires pro forma disclosure of net income and earnings per share determined as of the fair value method of accounting for stock options had been applied in measuring compensation cost 
if we chose to adopt sfas no 
 our stock based employee compensation expense for the fiscal years ending   and would be million  million  and million  respectively

to enhance comparability  management believes that the unaudited pro forma information that follows provides additional information that is useful in analyzing the underlying business results 
however  the pro forma operating results should be considered in addition to  not as a substitute for  reported results of operations 
the unaudited pro forma information is not necessarily reflective of the results of operations had these events occurred at the beginning of fiscal years and  nor is it necessarily indicative of future results 
we had previously reported in these quarterly reconciliations adjustments of million of severance charges in the fourth quarter of fiscal year and million from the elimination of the cost of restructured personnel in all quarters of fiscal year under recent sec guidance  because we incurred million of severance charges in fiscal year  the items should not be included in reconciliations of this nature and therefore are now excluded from adjustments

this impact is especially evident in the process industry  which has historically been and strategically is a major market for our products 
our product sales excluding divestitures declined by million  or  from fiscal year to of the decline  occurred in the fourth quarter  as industrial spending again was further constrained 
calibration services sales declined million  or  from fiscal year to this decline was also impacted  although not as severely as product sales  by the economic conditions existing over the last twelve months 
more significant  was the impact of certain decisions we made and actions that were taken in the last six months of fiscal year during that period  we consolidated the operations of four calibration laboratories into existing calibration laboratories  and the contract for one unprofitable customer on site was terminated by the customer 
gross profit for the years ended march  pro forma gross profit product service total gross profit decreased million  or  from fiscal year to excluding the divestitures  which accounted for million of the decline  gross profit decreased million  or  from fiscal year to on an as reported basis  inclusive of the divestitures  gross profit on product sales decreased  as a percentage of product sales  from in fiscal year to in fiscal year excluding the impact of the 
table of contents divestitures  including manufacturing profit and certain other one time costs  explained in more detail in the pro forma statements of operations section of this report  gross profit on product sales decreased from to 
this deterioration is largely attributed to product mix and an increased level of discounting necessary under current economic conditions 
the following table presents the quarterly trend of product gross profit on an as reported basis and on a pro forma basis giving effect to the divestitures  which were substantially completed by the end of the third quarter of fiscal year the fourth quarter of fiscal year includes both a million inventory write off and an incremental million of manufacturing purchase rebate income over the fourth quarter of fiscal year the fourth quarter of fiscal year pro forma excludes the inventory write off  as discussed above in the pro forma statements of operations in item product gross profit q q q q total fy fy fy pro forma calibration services gross profit  as a percentage of service sales  increased from in fiscal year to in fiscal year calibration gross profit has begun to yield the benefit of cost restructuring initiatives implemented in late fiscal year  increasing revenue in new calibration laboratories opened in fiscal year offset by lower sales in the fourth quarter of fiscal year than we had experienced in the fourth quarter of fiscal year gross profit by quarter for calibration services for fiscal years and was service gross profit q q q q total fy fy operating expenses for the years ended march  pro forma operating expenses selling  marketing  and warehouse general and administrative research and development goodwill amortization goodwill impairment total operating expenses decreased million from fiscal year to fiscal year  or from of sales to of net sales

the gross profit on product sales declined from of product sales in to in fiscal year the gross profit deterioration is the result of a non recurring inventory write off of million in the fourth quarter of fiscal year  the higher cost of products previously manufactured and product mix along with volume cost absorption issues 
gross profit on calibration services decreased from in to in our investment in four new calibration operations  including two new laboratories and two new on sites  was the primary cause of the gross profit erosion 
operating expenses for the years ended march  operating expenses selling  marketing  and warehouse general and administrative research and development goodwill amortization goodwill impairment total selling  general and administrative expenses decreased million or in fiscal year from this decrease is attributable to certain operating expenses eliminated as a result of the divestitures and our ongoing effort to control operating expense spending 
direct selling  marketing  general and administrative expenses from the divestitures totaled million in fiscal year research and development costs decreased million or in fiscal year from the reduction in research and development expenses reflects the divestiture of tpg 
for the twelve months ended march   tpg accounted for our entire million in research and development expenditures 

table of contents other income expense for the years ended march  other income expense interest expense other expense income total interest expense decreased by million  or  from fiscal year to this decrease reflects proceeds from the divestitures to reduce our bank debt from million at march  to million at march  the interest expense attributed to the divestitures was million in fiscal year other income increased by million due to the gain associated with the proceeds received from a life insurance policy

as a result of utilization of net operating loss tax carry backs  a million  or effective income tax benefit  was recorded in fiscal year the effective income tax benefit of in fiscal year resulted from utilization of net operating losses and the reversal of valuation allowances 
the effects of inflation during fiscal years and were not material 
liquidity and capital resources refinancing of debt 
on november   transcat entered into a new revolving credit and loan agreement the credit agreement with gmac business credit  lcc gmac 
the credit agreement expires on november  and replaced our revolving credit and loan agreement the prior credit agreement with key bank  na and citizens bank the banks originally dated august  and most recently amended on july  the credit agreement consists of a term loan and a revolving line of credit the loan  the terms of which are as set forth below under the credit agreement  transcat made a term note in the amount of million in favor of gmac 
this term note requires annual payments totaling million  payable in equal monthly installments  commencing on december  interest on the term note is payable at our option  at prime plus or up to of the loan at the day libor london interbank offered rate plus 
the prime rate and libor as of june  were and  respectively 
in addition  under the credit agreement  we are required to further reduce the term loan  on an annual basis  by of excess cash flow  as defined  not to exceed million per fiscal year 
excess cash flow for the fiscal year ended march  was million 
as a result  we have classified an additional million as a current liability as of march  the maximum amount available under the revolving line of credit portion of the credit agreement is million 
as of march   transcat borrowed million 
availability under the line of credit is determined by a formula based on eligible accounts receivable and inventory 
as of march   availability amounted to million 
the credit agreement has certain covenants with which we must comply  including a minimum ebitda earnings before interest  income taxes  depreciation and amortization covenant  as well as  restrictions on capital expenditures and master catalog spending 
we were not in violation of any loan covenants as of march   and we believe we will be in compliance with all covenants in the upcoming fiscal year 
interest on borrowings under the revolving line of credit is payable monthly  at our option  
table of contents at prime rate  as of june   or up to of the loan at the day libor  as of june   plus 
additional terms of the credit agreement require an increase in our borrowing rate of two percentage points should an event of default occur and a termination premium of of the maximum available borrowing under the revolving line of credit plus the then outstanding balance owed under the term note if the credit agreement is terminated in its first year and if terminated thereafter  prior to november  additionally  we have pledged certain property and fixtures in favor of gmac  including inventory  equipment  and accounts receivable as collateral security for the loans made under the credit agreement 
the credit agreement requires transcat to make the following principal payments on the term note  excluding any reductions attributable to excess cash flow  as discussed above in thousands fiscal year fiscal year fiscal year total cash flows 
the following table is a summary of our consolidated statements of cash flows for the years ended march  cash provided by used in operating activities investing activities financing activities operating activities 
for fiscal year  cash provided by operating activities was million  compared to million and million in fiscal year and  respectively 
cash was provided by net income adjusted for non cash related items 
decreased inventories and receivables of million were offset by reduced payables of million 
the reduction in receivables is a direct result of lower sales in the fourth quarter  whereas the reduction in inventory and payables is due to a corporate initiative to reduce both inventory and overall spending 
investing activities 
transcat used million in net cash for investing activities in fiscal year  compared to cash provided by investing activities in fiscal year of million and cash used for investing activities in fiscal year of million 
the reduction in cash provided by investing activities resulted primarily from million of cash realized in fiscal year from the proceeds of the divestitures 
we also reduced capital expenditures in fiscal year to million 
following the investment in two new calibration laboratories in fiscal year  capital expenditures in fiscal year totaled million 
capital spending in fiscal year included capital spending for tpg  which was divested in fiscal year financing activities 
in fiscal year  we reduced our bank debt by million  of which  million was the gain on extinguishment of debt  before expenses and warrants and million in cash used for debt reduction 
this follows a reduction in debt in fiscal year  primarily funded by the proceeds of the divestitures  of million and debt reduction in fiscal year of million 
we believe that we have the financial resources  which include cash from operations and the use of our availability under our credit agreement  needed to meet our business requirements for the next twelve months

early application of the provisions of sfas no 
is encouraged and transcat elected to do so beginning in may transcat now classifies the aggregate of gains and or losses from the early extinguishment of debt separately on the consolidated statements of operations  as appropriate  instead of as an extraordinary item 
the remaining provisions of sfas no

in june  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities 
sfas no 
requires that a liability for a cost associated with an exit or disposal activity be recognized when the liability is incurred  rather than at a plan or commitment date for the exit or disposal activity 
the sfas establishes fair value as the objective for initial measurement of the liability 
the provisions of sfas no 
are effective for exit or disposal activities initiated after december  transcat has determined that our adoption of sfas no 
does not have a material effect on our consolidated financial position or results of operations at march  in november  the fasb issued interpretation no 
 guarantor s accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees  including indirect guarantees of indebtedness of others  which expands previously issued accounting guidance and disclosure requirements for certain guarantees 
the interpretation requires an entity to recognize an initial liability for the fair value of an obligation assumed by issuing a guarantee

in addition  the interpretation expands disclosure requirements for both variable interest entities that are consolidated as well as variable interest entities from which the entity is the holder of a significant amount of the beneficial interests  but not the majority 
the disclosure requirements of this interpretation are 
table of contents effective for all financial statements issued after january  the consolidation requirements of this interpretation are effective for all periods beginning after june  transcat does not have any such variable interest entities as of march  employee stock options our stock option program  which expires in june is a broad based  long term retention program intended to attract  incent and retain key employees  thereby aligning stockholder and employee interests

for the first four years after the grant date  options are exercisable only if transcat s stock price attains a specific market value for a minimum specified number of consecutive trading days

purchases are limited under certain circumstances to maintain plan conformance to various regulations 
plan participation was approximately of total employees  including those ineligible  during fiscal years and 
table of contents outlook in general  as we look ahead to fiscal year  the outlook continues to be uncertain 
we anticipate a year  especially in our distribution products business  largely driven by the pace of the recovery in the economy  and the resulting impact on our industry 
our plans assume little  if any  improvement throughout the first two quarters  however  we have maintained the flexibility to respond quickly to any earlier improvement in business conditions 
our financial results are heavily dependent on the leverage of sales of our calibration services 
we anticipate single digit growth  primarily in the last two quarters  as we continue to focus our field and inside sales efforts on the quality demanding process and life science industries 
we expect our gross margin in fiscal year to be in the range of  plus or minus a few points  which is an increase of four points from our fiscal year gross margin of approximately 
our gross margin variability is dependent upon our calibration services business as distribution products margins are generally stable 
calibration services margins should improve due to lower costs resulting from consolidation actions taken in fiscal year  lower depreciation expense  targeted operational efficiency improvements  as well as  the leverage of increased volume 
in conjunction with the implementation of the new accounting rules for goodwill  we completed the initial goodwill impairment review in the first quarter of fiscal year and recorded an impairment charge of million 
we completed the required subsequent review as of march  and found no additional impairment 
our impairment review process is based on a discounted cash flow approach that uses our estimates of revenue for our business units and appropriate discount rates 
the estimates we have used are consistent with the plans and estimates that we are using to manage our business 
to the extent  either due to factors within or outside of our control  those estimates are not achieved  we may further incur charges for impairment of goodwill 
the need for a deferred tax valuation allowance will be reviewed quarterly in fiscal year and may change depending on the success of the operating plans and other related business developments 
any change in the valuation allowance will impact transcat s effective rate 
as we continue to improve our operating performance  we anticipate significantly increased capital expenditures 
under our credit agreement  we are limited to million in fiscal year  increasing to million in fiscal year we would expect fiscal year capital to primarily be asset replacement and strategic investment  followed by investment in capacity and operational efficiency in fiscal year finally  we believe that it would not be unreasonable to anticipate further reductions in our debt of approximately million by the end of fiscal year item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rates transcat s exposure to changes in interest rates results from borrowing activities 
in the event interest rates were to move by  interest expense would increase or decrease by approximately million assuming average borrowing levels remained constant from year to year 
during fiscal year  proceeds from the divestitures were used to significantly reduce our debt 
on march   we had no hedging arrangements in place that would limit our exposure to upward movements in interest rates 
under the credit agreement described in note of the consolidated financial statements  interest on the term note is payable at our option  at prime plus or up to of the loan at the day libor london interbank offered rate plus 
interest on the revolving line of credit is payable monthly  at our option  at prime rate  as of june   or up to of the loan at the day libor  as of june   plus 
table of contents foreign currency approximately and of transcat s sales are denominated in united states dollars with the remainder denominated in canadian dollars for the three months and twelve months ended march   respectively 
a change in the value of the canadian dollar to the united states dollar would impact our revenues by approximately 
we monitor the relationship between the united states and canadian currencies on a continuous basis and adjust sales prices for products and services sold in canadian dollars as it believes to be appropriate to safeguard the profitability of sales recorded in canadian dollars 
risk factors you should consider carefully the following risks and all other information included in this form k 
the risks and uncertainties described below and elsewhere in this form k are not the only ones facing our business 
if any of the following risks actually occur  our business  financial condition or results of operations would likely suffer 
in that case  the trading price of our common stock could fall and you could lose all or part of your investment 
general economic conditions 
the electronic instrumentation distribution industry is affected by changes in economic conditions  which are outside our control 
our operating results may also be adversely affected by increases in interest rates that may lead to a decline in economic activity and higher interest payments under our secured credit facilities 
we cannot assure you that economic slowdowns  adverse economic conditions or cyclical trends in certain customer markets will not have a material adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition 
dependence on manufacturers 
a significant amount of inventory purchases were made from one vendor group 
our reliance on this vendor group leaves us vulnerable to having an inadequate supply of required products  price increases  late deliveries  and poor product quality 
like other distributors in our industry  we occasionally experience supply shortages and are unable to purchase our desired volume of products 
if we are unable to enter into and maintain satisfactory distribution arrangements with leading manufacturers and an adequate supply of products  our sales could suffer considerably 
finally  we cannot assure that particular products  or product lines  will be available to us  or available in quantities sufficient to meet customer demand 
this is of particular significance to our business because the products we sell are often only available from one source 
such limited product access could materially and adversely affect our business 
indebtedness 
although we have paid down a significant portion of the outstanding indebtedness under our secured credit facility  as of march   we owed million to our secured creditor 
we are still required to meet financial tests on a quarterly basis and comply with other covenants customary in secured financings 
although we believe that we will  if we do not meet debt covenant requirements  our lenders may demand immediate repayment of amounts outstanding 
changes in interest rates may have a significant effect on our monthly payment obligations and operating results 
furthermore  we are dependent on credit from our manufacturers to fund our inventory purchases 
if our debt burden increases to high levels  our manufacturers may restrict our credit 
our cash requirements will depend on numerous factors  including the rate of growth of our sales  the timing and levels of products purchased  payment terms  and credit limits from manufacturers  the timing and level of our accounts receivable collections and our ability to manage our business profitably 
our ability to satisfy our existing obligations  whether or not under our secured credit facility  will depend upon our future operating performance  which may be affected by prevailing economic conditions and financial  business  and other factors described in this form k  many of which are beyond our control 
if existing stockholders sell large numbers of shares of our common stock  our stock price could decline 
the market price of our common stock could decline as a result of sales by our existing stockholders or holders of stock options of a large number of shares of our common stock in the public market or the perception that these sales could occur 
our stock price has been  and may continue to be  particularly volatile
