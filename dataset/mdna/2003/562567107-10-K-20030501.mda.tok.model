item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
overview we are one of the largest hotel casino operators in the united states 
our operations consist of wholly owned resorts in nevada and mississippi  as well as jointly owned resorts in nevada  illinois and michigan 
our resorts cater to a wide variety of customers  and we strive to provide the best value in each of the markets where we compete 
we generate half of our net revenues from gaming activities  and nearly one quarter from room sales 
our core market is las vegas  where our properties generate approximately two thirds of our operating income 
mandalay bay has become the best performer among our properties in this market 
as our flagship operation  mandalay bay possesses amenities that appeal to higher income customers 
strong demand from this segment of our customer base has permitted us greater pricing leverage  which has helped to drive results at this property 
with the addition of the convention center  all suites hotel tower and retail center each discussed more fully under financial position and capital resources new projects below  mandalay bay should continue to be the leading driver of future growth for our company 
our operating results are highly dependent on the volume of customers visiting and staying at our resorts 
this is particularly evident in our two principal revenue centers the casino and the hotel 
the volume of casino activity is measured by drop  which refers to amounts wagered by our customers 
the amount of drop which we keep and which is recognized as casino revenue is referred to as our win or hold 
in our hotel business  a key metric is revenue per available room  or revpar 
revpar reflects both occupancy levels and room rates  each of which is impacted by customer demand  among other factors 
critical accounting policies the consolidated financial statements included in this report were prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
certain accounting policies require us to apply significant judgment in defining the appropriate assumptions for calculating financial estimates 
by their nature  these judgments are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty 
these judgments are based on our historical experience  terms of existing contracts  observance of trends in the gaming industry and information available from other outside sources 
there can be no assurance that actual results will not differ from these estimates 
the following is a summary of our critical accounting policies 
see also the summary of significant accounting policies included in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in item of this report 
property and equipment we have significant capital invested in our property and equipment  which represents almost of our total assets 
we utilize our judgement in various ways including i determining whether an expenditure is considered a maintenance expense or a capital asset  ii determining the estimated useful lives of assets  iii determining the salvage values to be assigned to assets  and iv determining if or when an asset has been impaired 
the accuracy of these estimates affects the amount of depreciation expense recognized in our income statement  whether we have a gain or loss on the disposal of an asset and whether or not we record an impairment loss related to an asset 
we review the carrying value of our property and equipment whenever events and circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable from the estimated future cash flows expected to result from its use and eventual disposition 
the factors we consider in performing this assessment include current operating results  trends and prospects  as well as the effect of obsolescence  demand  competition and other economic factors 
in estimating expected future cash flows for determining whether an asset is impaired  assets are grouped at the operating unit level  which for most of our assets is the individual casino 
if the sum of the expected future cash flows undiscounted and without interest charges is less than the carrying amount  we recognize an impairment loss 
the impairment loss recognized is the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the fair value 
the ability to accurately predict future cash flows may impact the determination of fair value  and hence  the amount of the impairment loss 
our assessment of cash flows represents our best estimate as of the time of the impairment review and is consistent with our internal planning 
based upon our most recent review of the carrying values of our property and equipment  we do not believe that there are additional impairments that have occurred or are likely to occur in the near term 
goodwill and other intangible assets we have million in goodwill and million in intangible development costs on our consolidated balance sheet at january  effective february   we adopted statement of financial accounting standards no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets sfas  which requires an annual review of goodwill and other indefinite life intangible assets for impairment 
we completed our initial assessment of these assets  pursuant to which we recorded an impairment charge of million reflected as a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle in the first quarter of fiscal we also completed our annual assessment for impairment in the fourth quarter of fiscal  pursuant to which we recorded an additional impairment charge of million 
the annual evaluation of goodwill and other indefinite life intangible assets requires the use of estimates about future operating results of each reporting unit to determine their estimated fair value 
changes in forecasted operations can materially affect these estimates 
once an impairment of goodwill or other intangible assets has been recorded  it cannot be reversed 
based upon our most recent review of goodwill and another intangible asset  we do not believe that there are additional impairments that have occurred or are likely to occur in the near term 
the remaining goodwill relates entirely to our acquisition of slots a fun and our investment in motorcity casino in detroit 
the carrying value of goodwill related to these investments  relative to the market value of the other assets  is small and furthermore  operating results at these properties have historically been strong and stable 
consequently  in our opinion  it is unlikely that there will be additional goodwill impairment in the near term 
players club program our players club program offers incentives to customers who gamble at our casinos 
customers earn points  redeemable for cash and complimentaries  based upon their level of gambling 
these points accumulate until such time as the customer elects to redeem them  up to a maximum of months at which time the points expire 
we accrue expense related to this program as the points are earned based upon historical redemption percentages and  in the case of complimentaries  the estimated cost of the complimentaries to be provided 
the actual amount of expense can differ from this estimate to the extent that actual redemptions differ from historical patterns 
for example  to the extent players increase their redemption activity above historical levels  the actual expense we incur related to our players club could be significantly higher 
bad debt reserves we reserve an estimated amount for receivables that may not be collected 
these bad debt reserves are estimated using a combination of specific reserves and various percentages applied to aged receivables based upon our judgment 
we consider historical collection rates along with customer relationships in determining specific reserves 
at january   we had million in our bad debt reserve  representing approximately of the related receivables 
to the extent world events such as economic downturns  war or further terrorist attacks impact the ability of our customers to pay us  our reserves could be inadequate 
however  the majority of our casino receivables relate to domestic play 
consequently  we believe our casino receivables are less exposed to the impact of some of these events 
notwithstanding  we believe our current reserve is appropriate and reasonable based upon our experience 
self insurance accruals we are self insured  up to certain limits  for costs associated with workers compensation and employee medical coverage 
insurance claims and reserves include accruals of estimated settlements for known claims  as well as accruals of estimates for claims incurred but not yet reported 
at january   we had total self insurance accruals reflected on our balance sheet of million 
in estimating these accruals  we consider historical loss experience and make judgments about the expected levels of costs per claim 
we believe our estimates of future liability are reasonable based upon our methodology  however  changes in health care costs  accident frequency and severity and other factors could materially affect the estimate for these liabilities 
income taxes we are subject to income taxes in the united states and in several states in which we operate 
we account for income taxes according to statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for income taxes sfas 
sfas requires the recognition of deferred tax assets  net of applicable reserves  related to net operating loss carryforwards and certain temporary differences 
the standard requires recognition of a future tax benefit to the extent that realization of such benefit is more likely than not 
otherwise  a valuation allowance is applied 
at january   we had million of deferred tax assets and million of deferred tax liabilities 
we believe that our deferred tax assets are fully realizable because of the future reversal of existing taxable temporary differences and future projected taxable income 
our income tax returns are subject to examination by the internal revenue service and other tax authorities 
we regularly assess the potential outcomes of these examinations in determining the adequacy of our provision for income taxes and our income tax liabilities 
inherent in our determination of any necessary reserves are assumptions based on past experiences and judgments about potential actions by taxing authorities 
our estimate of the potential outcome for any uncertain tax issues is highly judgmental 
we believe we have adequately provided for any reasonable and foreseeable outcome related to uncertain tax matters 
when actual results of tax examinations differ from our estimates  we adjust the income tax provision in the period in which the examination issues are settled 
in august  we settled the irs audits of our fiscal through fiscal tax returns  which did not result in a material impact on our results of operations or financial position 
the tax returns for years after fiscal are still under examination or are subject to possible future examination 
contingencies we are involved in various legal proceedings  as more fully discussed in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements in item of this report 
due to their nature  such legal proceedings involve inherent uncertainties including  but not limited to  court rulings  negotiations between affected parties and governmental intervention 
management assesses the probability of loss for such contingencies and accrues a liability and or discloses the relevant circumstances  as appropriate 
we believe that any liability to the company that may arise as a result of currently pending legal proceedings will not have a material adverse effect on our financial condition  taken as a whole 
fiscal compared with fiscal significant factors affecting results of operations in fiscal september  we believe that the terrorist attacks of september  continued to affect our operating results in fiscal our las vegas properties are particularly dependent on air travel for a substantial portion of their customers 
while passenger counts in fiscal at mccarran international airport  as well as overall las vegas visitor volume  rebounded from the depressed levels immediately following september   they remained below the counts recorded for fiscal the last fiscal year unaffected by the attacks 
as a result  fewer customers visited or stayed at our las vegas properties  and this led to a drop in revenues at most of those properties in fiscal our properties in our other markets were not as vulnerable to the aftermath of september   and  consequently  their operations do not appear to have been significantly impacted 
we cannot predict the extent to which the events of september  will continue to directly or indirectly impact our operating results  nor can we predict the extent to which the war with iraq  future security alerts or additional terrorist attacks may interfere with our operations 
economic recession historically  there has not been a high correlation between economic conditions and our operating results 
this has been true with respect to the overall us economy and also the regional economies from which we derive a sizeable portion of our customers eg  california 
however  we believe the broad economic recession in the country last year did have a significant effect on our results for fiscal expansion of native american gaming on march   california voters approved proposition a  which amended the california constitution and legalized nevada style gaming on native american reservations 
since then  a significant expansion of native american gaming operations has occurred in california and is continuing 
this trend has caused generally lower operating results at our properties in the secondary markets of reno  laughlin and jean  nevada 
while most existing native american gaming facilities in california are modest compared to our nevada casinos  numerous native american tribes have announced they are developing  or are considering establishing  large scale hotel and gaming facilities in california 
numerous other tribes are at various stages of planning new or expanded facilities 
the continued growth of native american gaming establishments in california as well as elsewhere in the country could have a material adverse effect on our operations 
results of operations earnings per share for the year ended january   we reported net income of million  or per diluted share  versus million  or 
per diluted share  for the year ended january  the increase in earnings for fiscal was due primarily to a million decrease in depreciation and amortization expense  which was partially offset by a related million increase in operating lease rent see depreciation and amortization below 
earnings in fiscal also benefitted from a million decrease in interest expense  an overall reduction in write offs related to asset impairment  goodwill impairment and intangible assets  and a decrease in the average number of diluted shares outstanding 
earnings for fiscal reflected strong results at mandalay bay and motorcity casino 
at mandalay bay  operating income surged  on the strength of cost cutting measures implemented after september   lower depreciation and amortization expense and a decline in entertainment expense due to the july closing of the storm production in the mandalay showroom 
mandalay bay also benefitted from the january  opening of the new convention center 
at motorcity casino  operating income rose despite the intangible write off discussed below  reflecting higher slot machine revenues at that property 
other factors affecting our fiscal and results included the following preopening expenses 
we recorded preopening expenses of million for fiscal and million for fiscal in both years  these expenses related primarily to the new convention center at mandalay bay that opened in january adjustments to carrying values 
at the end of each quarterly reporting period  we adjust the carrying value of investments associated with our supplemental executive retirement plan serp  a defined benefit plan for senior executives  to reflect their market value 
these noncash adjustments reflected in the interest  dividends and other income caption amounted to losses of million and million for fiscal and  respectively 
write off of intangibles 
results for fiscal reflect the write off of million of intangible costs associated with motorcity casino in detroit 
these intangible costs represent amounts paid by mandalay to its partner  atwater casino group  in exchange for a so called preference applicable to predecessors of atwater casino group to develop a casino in detroit 
in early  preferences of this nature were declared unconstitutional by a federal appeals court 
on august   motorcity signed a revised development agreement with the city of detroit which provided for the development of an expanded permanent casino on the site of the current facility 
as a result of these events  it was determined that the intangible preference had no value and should be written off 
goodwill impairment 
statement of financial accounting standards no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets sfas  became effective for mandalay on february  under sfas  goodwill is no longer amortized  but must be reviewed at least annually for impairment 
in connection with our implementation of sfas  we completed an analysis of the goodwill arising from our prior acquisitions and recorded a write off of million  representing the unamortized goodwill associated with the june  acquisition of the railroad pass hotel and casino in henderson  nevada 
this write off was reflected as a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle in the quarter ended april  pursuant to our subsequent annual review for goodwill impairment  we recorded a write off of million that was reflected as an impairment loss in the fourth quarter of fiscal this write off represented the unamortized goodwill associated with the february  acquisition of the edgewater hotel and casino in laughlin  nevada 
it was necessitated by a decline in income from operations at that property  as well as lower future expectations attributable to the impact on the laughlin market of increased competition from native american casinos 
the effects of the above write offs were offset by the elimination of goodwill amortization in fiscal goodwill amortization in fiscal had amounted to million 
other impairment 
in fiscal  we recorded an impairment loss of million related to the write down of the carrying value of our two jean properties  gold strike and nevada landing 
this write down reflected the downturn in these properties operating results due to the continued expansion of native american casinos in california 
the write down was made in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of 
of the million write down  million represented goodwill 
revenues revenues increased million  or less than  for the year ended january  the increase was due to a million  or  increase in revenues at motorcity casino in detroit  michigan 
this increase was partially offset by lower revenues at our las vegas strip properties stemming from the continued effect of september  and the recession 
revenues at these properties were down million  or 
revenues also declined at our other nevada properties  mainly because of expanded native american gaming in california 
in reno  revenues decreased million  or  in laughlin they were down million  or  and in jean they were down million  or 
casino revenues casino revenues rose million  or less than  in fiscal casino revenues declined at most of our major wholly owned properties due to the impact of the significant factors discussed previously the exceptions were luxor in las vegas and gold strike in tunica county  mississippi  which recorded slight increases 
these declines were offset by a million  or  increase in casino revenues at motorcity casino 
room revenues room revenues fell million  or  in fiscal despite improving steadily throughout fiscal  revpar at our las vegas properties decreased from fiscal due mainly to the lingering effects of the september  attacks and the recession 
the following table compares average room rates  occupancy and revpar at our major wholly owned properties fye fye rate occ

other revenues rose million  or  in fiscal the continued success of blue man group at luxor largely offset the impact from the closing of storm at mandalay bay 
income from operations for the year ended january   income from operations rose million  or  from the previous year 
the composite operating margin in fiscal was versus in fiscal income from operations for fiscal benefitted from the reduction of depreciation and amortization expense and from cost cutting measures undertaken at all of our properties following september  these benefits were partially offset by the million write off of intangible assets at motorcity casino and the million goodwill write off at edgewater discussed earlier 
meanwhile  income from operations in fiscal was negatively affected by the previously discussed impairment loss of million related to our jean  nevada properties

ebitda is included because  as in other entertainment industries  many investors consider it an important measure of property performance  since it factors out the impact of depreciation and amortization  the principal noncash expenses affecting income from operations 
ebitda is not an accepted measure of performance under gaap and should not be considered an alternative to gaap measures of performance 
includes circus circus las vegas and slots a fun 
includes gold strike  nevada landing and railroad pass 
motorcity casino is owned and its operations are consolidated for financial reporting purposes 
includes monte carlo  grand victoria and silver legacy  each of which is owned 
las vegas our las vegas properties including our share of monte carlo posted an overall increase in income from operations of million  or  for fiscal at mandalay bay  income from operations rose million  or  despite flat revenues 
the main contributors to the increase at mandalay bay were the cost cutting measures implemented after september   a combined million reduction in depreciation expense and operating lease rent see the discussions under depreciation and amortization and operating lease rent and a decrease in entertainment expense stemming from the july closing of the storm production in the mandalay showroom 
the preproduction costs associated with this show were fully expensed in fiscal in anticipation of the closing 
storm was replaced by the broadway hit mamma mia  which opened february  while cost cutting measures also benefitted our other las vegas properties  results were mixed 
income from operations at luxor in fiscal was up million  or  while the contribution from monte carlo increased by million  or  for the year 
however  at excalibur  income from operations was down million  or  and at circus circus it declined million  or 
these latter two properties cater primarily to the middle income market segment  which appears to have been more impacted by the significant factors discussed previously 
reno income from operations at our reno properties including our share of silver legacy was down million  or  in fiscal expanded native american gaming in california and the northwestern us contributed to the decline  as did the economic recession 
the absence from reno of the american bowling congress national championship  which was held there in fiscal  also affected our results 
however  in fiscal  the women s national bowling tournament will be held in reno  which is scheduled to host the men s or women s national bowling tournament in two out of every three years through fiscal laughlin our two laughlin properties  colorado belle and edgewater  posted a combined decrease in income from operations of million  or  for fiscal the decline was due to the write off of million of goodwill associated with edgewater  as discussed previously 
furthermore  like the reno market  laughlin is facing increased competition from native american casinos in its primary feeder markets in arizona and southern california 
other markets in detroit  michigan  motorcity casino generated an increase in income from operations of million  or  despite the million write off of an intangible asset discussed previously 
lower depreciation expense down million was the principal factor in this increase see discussion under depreciation and amortization  though a increase in slot revenues was also a contributing factor 
see financial position and capital resources new projects for additional details regarding our detroit operation 
in tunica county  mississippi  income from operations at gold strike increased million  or  during fiscal a rise in casino revenue  stemming from expanded marketing efforts  was largely responsible for the increase  along with cost cutting measures 
the contribution to income from operations made by grand victoria our owned riverboat casino in elgin  illinois decreased million  or  in fiscal the decrease was due primarily to a tax increase on casinos that took effect july  and included a top end rate of on gaming revenues exceeding million 
this tax increase reduced the contribution from grand victoria by million for the year 
had the new legislation been in effect for all of fiscal  the contribution from grand victoria would have been lower by million 
depreciation and amortization for fiscal  depreciation and amortization expense was million versus million in fiscal the million decrease was due to several factors  including new operating leases entered into in december under these new leases  we sold and leased back million of equipment  thus replacing depreciation expense and interest expense with operating lease rent 
see the discussion under financial position and capital resources off balance sheet arrangements for more details regarding these leases 
depreciation and amortization was also lower due to a reduction of depreciation at motorcity casino 
based upon a revised development agreement entered into with the city of detroit on august  discussed more fully under financial position and capital resources new projects  depreciation expense related to the motorcity casino facility was reduced prospectively 
previously  the cost of the temporary facility was being depreciated over its contractual operating term of four years  with the annual depreciation expense approximating million 
under the revised development agreement  the temporary facility ceases to be temporary and will be expanded as a permanent resort as opposed to the permanent resort being developed on a separate site  as was the requirement under the original development agreement 
consequently  the remaining book value of the temporary facility is being depreciated over its remaining expected life 
this will result in estimated depreciation expense of million in fiscal finally  depreciation and amortization expense also declined due to the previously discussed elimination of goodwill amortization pursuant to sfas operating lease rent operating lease rent for fiscal increased to million from million in fiscal the increase was due to the new operating leases we signed in december the higher rent expense we incurred as a result of those leases  however  was partially offset by a reduction in rent expense related to the june renewal of the previously existing million lease facility 
see the discussion under financial position and capital resources off balance sheet arrangements for additional details regarding our operating lease agreements 
interest expense in fiscal  interest expense excluding interest expense of unconsolidated joint ventures and without reduction for capitalized interest decreased million 
the decrease was primarily due to a combination of lower interest rates on short term borrowings  new fixed to floating interest rate swap agreements entered into in june and august and lower average borrowings 
see financial position and capital resources financing activities for a discussion of the new swaps 
this reduction of interest expense was partially offset by the issuance of million principal amount of senior subordinated notes in december the net proceeds from this issuance were used to pay down lower cost borrowings outstanding under our bank facility 
on march   silver legacy issued million of mortgage notes due at the same time  silver legacy entered into a new senior secured credit facility  comprised of a million revolving credit facility and a million amortizing term loan 
the net proceeds of the notes  combined with draws under the new credit facility  were used to repay the prior credit facility million and to fund a million distribution to the silver legacy partners million of which was distributed to mandalay 
at january   long term debt including current portion stood at billion compared to billion at january  the fiscal total includes million of debt related to motorcity casino  while the fiscal total includes million of debt related to motorcity 
capitalized interest was million in fiscal compared to million in the previous year 
capitalized interest in both years related primarily to the new convention center at mandalay bay 
income taxes the effective tax rates for fiscal and fiscal were and 
these rates reflect the corporate statutory rate of plus the effect of various nondeductible expenses  primarily the amortization and write off of goodwill 
the higher rate in fiscal was due to the impairment loss of million  million of which represented the write off of goodwill  which is not deductible for tax purposes 
for fiscal  we estimate our effective tax rate will be 
fiscal compared with fiscal significant factors affecting results of operations in fiscal september  the terrorist attacks of september  had a pronounced effect on our operating results for the year ended january  this effect was felt primarily at our las vegas properties  which generate approximately two thirds of our operating income 
our las vegas properties  with almost  hotel rooms  are dependent on air travel for a significant portion of their customers 
this is particularly true at our more upscale resorts  mandalay bay and luxor  where over of the hotel customers arrive via plane 
as a result of the terrorist attacks  air travel plummeted nationally 
passenger counts at mccarran international airport in las vegas fell almost over the last four months of  leading to an overall decline for the year 
the number of visitors to las vegas declined in  despite being up for the year to date period prior to september the decreases in air traffic and visitor volume caused declines in the number of customers staying at and visiting our las vegas properties 
this situation was particularly acute immediately following the attacks  when occupancy levels at our las vegas properties fell to the mid range  compared to a normal occupancy above 
these factors led to declines in revenues and operating income at our las vegas properties during the fiscal year 
our operations in reno  laughlin and jean  nevada  were not as vulnerable to the aftermath of september these markets are essentially drive in markets 
while air traffic fell sharply following the attacks  automobile traffic to laughlin and jean actually rose  while traffic to reno showed a modest drop 
our joint venture properties in elgin  illinois  and detroit  michigan  did not reflect any adverse impact from the terrorist attacks  as their revenues and operating income after september were higher than they had been in the previous year 
these properties serve essentially local markets a majority of our customers live within a relatively short distance of the properties and so were minimally affected by travel concerns in the aftermath of the attacks 
detroit also benefitted from the temporary closure of the us canadian border immediately following the terrorist attacks and from subsequently increased security  which impeded access from the us to a competing property in windsor  ontario 
in response to the terrorist attacks  we took several steps to minimize their effect on our operations and our financial position 
we temporarily until february suspended construction of our new convention center at mandalay bay and we delayed or suspended all other discretionary capital spending 
additionally  at the beginning of october  we laid off approximately  employees out of a total workforce of over  employees including those at our joint ventures 
most of the layoffs were at our las vegas properties 
we also froze wage levels for nonunion personnel and reduced compensation for many management level employees 
finally  we made several financing decisions designed to enhance our liquidity  such as amending our credit facilities to ease financial covenants  issuing additional senior subordinated notes and entering into additional operating lease arrangements 
economic recession historically  there has not been a high correlation between economic conditions and our operating results 
this has been true with respect to the overall us economy and also the regional economies from which we derive a substantial portion of our customers eg  california 
however  we believe the broad economic recession that affected the country throughout most of and into  and that was exacerbated by the terrorist attacks on september  contributed to the downturn in our results for fiscal expansion of native american gaming on march   california voters approved proposition a  which amended the california constitution and legalized nevada style gaming on native american reservations 
the passage of this amendment allowed a significant expansion of native american gaming operations to occur in the latter part of fiscal and the early part of fiscal the result was a decline in operating results at our properties in the secondary markets of reno  laughlin and jean  nevada 
the impact of expanded native american gaming was particularly significant at gold strike and nevada landing in jean  and was the principal factor behind the impairment loss that was recognized at those properties in fiscal see discussion under results of operations 
results of operations earnings per share for the year ended january   we reported net income of million  or 
per diluted share  versus million  or per diluted share  for the year ended january  the decrease in earnings per share was attributable primarily to an impairment loss of million in fiscal related to the write down of the carrying value of our two jean properties  gold strike and nevada landing 
this write down reflected the downturn in operating results at these properties over the previous few years due to the continued expansion of native american casinos in california 
the write down was made in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of sfas 
of the million write down  million represented goodwill 
results for fiscal also included preopening expenses of million related to the construction of a new convention center at mandalay bay 
fiscal earnings were affected as well by the september attacks  the recession and higher utility costs 
utility costs rose million  or  at our wholly owned properties  with most of the increase attributable to our las vegas strip properties 
utility costs were higher due to the spillover effect from the california energy crisis 
the negative effect of all of the above factors on our earnings per share was partially offset by a lower number of average diluted shares outstanding million in fiscal versus million in fiscal 
the lower number was due to our purchase of shares 
results for fiscal included preopening expenses of million related to the shark reef at mandalay bay  which opened june  results also included million in income related to reducing a liability assumed when the mandalay bay site was acquired in revenues revenues decreased million  or  for the year ended january  the decrease was due primarily to the effect of september on our las vegas strip properties  whose revenues were down million  or 
revenues also declined at our other nevada properties  mainly because of expanded native american gaming in california 
in reno  revenues decreased million  or  in laughlin they were down million  or  and in jean they were down million  or 
these declines were partially offset by a million  or  increase in revenues at motorcity casino in detroit  michigan 
casino revenues casino revenues declined million  or  in fiscal casino revenues declined at all of our major wholly owned properties due to the impact of the significant factors discussed previously 
these declines were partially offset by a million  or  increase in casino revenues at motorcity casino 
room revenues room revenues fell million  or  in fiscal our las vegas properties experienced strong growth in revenue per available room revpar through the first part of the year  mainly as a result of increases in room rates 
however  following september  occupancy rates declined dramatically and room rates were discounted in order to stimulate demand 
as a result  revpar fell noticeably in the last quarter of the year

other revenues other revenues rose million  or  in fiscal other revenues come principally from entertainment  amusements and retail stores 
most of the increase was due to the success of blue man group  the unique off broadway production which debuted in march at luxor 
the april opening of our new production  storm  in the mandalay bay showroom also contributed to the increase  as did the shark reef at mandalay bay which opened june 
income from operations for the year ended january   income from operations declined million  or  from the previous year 
the composite operating margin in fiscal was versus in fiscal the previously discussed impairment loss of million recognized at our jean properties was a principal cause of the declines in operating income and operating margin 
our las vegas strip properties also contributed to the declines  as the effects of september depressed results in that market  particularly in the hotel department where our operating margins are typically the highest

includes circus circus las vegas and slots a fun 
includes gold strike  nevada landing and railroad pass 
motorcity casino is owned and its operations are consolidated for financial reporting purposes 
includes monte carlo  grand victoria and silver legacy  each of which is owned 
las vegas our las vegas properties including our share of monte carlo posted an overall decrease in operating income of million  or  for fiscal at mandalay bay  operating income rose million  or  due primarily to increases in room rates that were achieved during the first part of the fiscal year  prior to the events of september because of the upscale clientele at this property  it possesses greater pricing leverage than our other properties 
operating income at our other las vegas properties declined for the year  tracking the lower revenues that followed september at excalibur operating income was down million  or  at luxor it was down million  or  and at circus circus it was off by million  or 
the contribution from monte carlo also declined  falling million  or  for the year 
reno operating income from our reno properties including our share of silver legacy was down million  or  in fiscal  despite the presence in reno of the men s national bowling tournament 
operating results at our reno properties have been adversely impacted by the expansion of native american gaming in california and the northwestern us the events of september also contributed to the decline in operating income 
laughlin our two laughlin properties  colorado belle and edgewater  posted a combined decrease in operating income of million  or  for fiscal while revpar was flat  casino revenues decreased 
like the reno market  laughlin is facing increased competition from native american casinos in its primary feeder markets in arizona and southern california 
other markets in detroit  michigan  motorcity casino generated operating income of million  an increase of over the prior year 
results at this property have steadily improved since its december opening 
the property also benefitted from the temporary closure of the us canadian border immediately following the september attacks 
this measure  along with subsequently increased security  impeded access from the us to a competing property in windsor  ontario 
we believe motorcity casino has been able to attract a significant number of customers who previously frequented the competing property in windsor 
see financial position and capital resources new projects for additional details regarding our detroit operation 
in tunica county  mississippi  operating income at gold strike decreased million  or  during fiscal we believe the slow economy had a more pronounced effect on this region  and especially on memphis  tennessee  which accounts for over half the property s customer base 
the contribution to income from operations made by grand victoria a owned riverboat casino in elgin  illinois increased million  or  for fiscal this market was apparently not negatively impacted by the terrorist attacks on september it may have actually benefitted to the extent potential customers in this market were less willing to travel outside the region 
depreciation and amortization for fiscal  depreciation and amortization expense was million versus million in fiscal interest expense in fiscal  interest expense excluding interest expense of unconsolidated joint ventures and without reduction for capitalized interest increased million over fiscal the increase was due to the issuance of million principal amount of senior subordinated notes in july  the issuance of million principal amount of senior notes in august  and the issuance of million principal amount of senior subordinated notes in december the net proceeds from these offerings were used to pay down lower cost borrowings outstanding under our bank facility 
the higher interest rates on the notes we issued were largely offset by lower average interest rates on our bank facility  as well as lower average borrowings outstanding 
at january   long term debt including current portion stood at billion compared to billion at january  the fiscal total included million of debt related to motorcity casino  while the fiscal total included million of debt related to motorcity 
capitalized interest was million in fiscal compared to million in the previous year 
capitalized interest in fiscal related primarily to the new convention center at mandalay bay 
capitalized interest in the prior year was associated with the shark reef at mandalay bay 
income taxes the effective tax rates for fiscal and fiscal were and 
these rates reflect the corporate statutory rate of plus the effect of various nondeductible expenses  primarily the amortization of goodwill 
the higher rate in fiscal was due to the impairment loss of million 
as previously discussed  million of this loss represented the write off of goodwill  which is not deductible for tax purposes 
financial position and capital resources operating activities for fiscal  net cash provided by operating activities was million versus million in fiscal and million in fiscal for fiscal  net cash provided by operating activities decreased slightly  despite net income increasing million 
the increase in net income was offset by the previously discussed decrease in depreciation and amortization of million 
meanwhile  the decrease in fiscal was attributable to several factors  including a decrease in the deferred tax liability  a smaller increase in interest payable  lower distributions from unconsolidated affiliates and lower net income stemming from september the decrease in the deferred tax liability was due primarily to the write down of our jean properties  which is not deductible for tax purposes until the assets are actually disposed of 
mandalay had cash and cash equivalents of million at january   sufficient for normal daily operating requirements 
investing activities net cash used in investing activities was million in fiscal versus million in fiscal and million in fiscal capital expenditures and the related increase or decrease in construction payable accounted for most of these amounts 
capital expenditures for fiscal  which were funded primarily from cash flow  totaled million 
of this amount  million related to the construction of a new convention center at mandalay bay that opened in january  million related to the construction of the new  suites tower at mandalay bay see new projects for additional details  million related to the remodeling of the original suites at mandalay bay completed in fiscal and million related to the new retail center under construction between mandalay bay and luxor 
for fiscal  capital expenditures totaled million 
of this amount  million related to the construction of the new convention center at mandalay bay 
another million related to the completion of the renovation of the pyramid rooms at luxor 
capital expenditures also included million related to the acquisition of land adjacent to our casino facility in detroit 
capital expenditures for fiscal totaled million 
of this amount  million related to the shark reef at mandalay bay  a saltwater aquarium attraction which opened june   and million related to the renovation of the luxor rooms 
we estimate that capital expenditures in fiscal will be in the range of million 
the majority of these expenditures will relate to the completion of the new all suites tower at mandalay bay 
these estimated capital expenditures also include maintenance capital spending  which consists of items necessary to maintain the operating condition of our properties  such as new slot machines  carpeting  computers and similar equipment 
capital expenditures for fiscal will be funded primarily from cash flow  though we also have funds available under our revolving credit facility 
actual capital expenditures for fiscal may differ significantly from the estimated range  particularly if we are able to proceed with the development of an expanded permanent facility in detroit 
see new projects detroit for additional details 
financing activities for fiscal  financing activities provided net cash of million 
net borrowings provided cash of million  while stock option exercises provided an additional million 
the majority of this cash was used to purchase million shares of our common stock at a cost of million 
see share purchases for further discussion of our share purchase activity 
for fiscal  financing activities used net cash of million  of which million was used for the purchase of million shares of our common stock 
another million was used to fund interim settlements and interest payments under our equity forward agreements with bank of america 
see the discussion under off balance sheet arrangements for more details regarding our equity forward agreements 
for fiscal  financing activities used net cash of million  most of which related to the purchase of million shares of our common stock at a cost of million 
credit facilities in august  we replaced our billion unsecured credit facility with three separate facilities that totaled billion 
these credit facilities included a million capital markets term loan  which we paid in full using a portion of the net proceeds we received from the issuance of million of senior subordinated notes in december by paying off this facility  we reduced our borrowing capacity under the two remaining facilities to billion 
those two facilities  which are for general corporate purposes  include a million term loan facility and an million revolving facility 
the entire amount of the term loan facility was outstanding at january  of the revolving facility  million was outstanding at january  each of our credit facilities is unsecured and provides for the payment of interest  at our option  at either i a eurodollar based rate  or ii a rate equal to or an increment above the higher of a the bank of america prime rate  or b the federal reserve board federal funds rate plus basis points 
at january   the effective rate of interest on the indebtedness outstanding under our credit facilities was 
each of our credit facilities includes financial covenants regarding total debt and interest coverage  plus covenants that limit our ability to dispose of assets  make distributions on our capital stock  engage in a merger  incur liens and engage in transactions with our affiliates 
the entire principal amount then outstanding under our credit facilities becomes due and payable on august   unless the maturity date is extended with the consent of the lenders 
in december  we amended the covenants under each of our credit facilities to provide for more liberal tests for total debt and interest coverage 
these amendments were obtained to address the impact of the events of september  in february  we again amended the covenants under each of our credit facilities 
these amendments modify the definition of adjusted ebitda with respect to our ownership of motorcity casino in detroit  michigan 
as previously defined in our credit facilities  adjusted ebitda included only the cash distributions we actually received from motorcity casino 
under the amended definition  adjusted ebitda will include our share of the adjusted ebitda of motorcity casino  whether or not distributed 
these amendments also provide for a more liberal test for total debt coverage during the fiscal year ending january  as of january   we were in compliance with all of the covenants in our credit facilities  including those related to total debt and interest coverage  and under the most restrictive covenant  we had the ability to issue additional debt of approximately million 
our borrowing capacity under these covenants can fluctuate substantially from quarter to quarter depending upon our operating cash flow 
our borrowing capacity is typically lower in our fourth quarter  when operating results are also lower than in the other three quarters 
convertible senior debentures on march   we issued million principal amount of floating rate convertible senior debentures due convertible debentures 
an additional million principal amount of the convertible debentures were issued on april   pursuant to an option granted to the initial purchasers 
the convertible debentures bear interest at a floating rate equal to month libor reset quarterly plus  subject to a maximum of 
the convertible debentures also provide for the payment of contingent interest if the average market price of the convertible debentures reaches a certain threshold 
the convertible debentures provide for an initial base conversion price of per share  reflecting a conversion premium of over mandalay s closing stock price of on march  the proceeds from this issuance were used to repay borrowings under our revolving credit facility 
each convertible debenture will be convertible into shares of mandalay s common stock i during any calendar quarter beginning after june   if the closing price of mandalay s common stock is more than of the base conversion price for at least of the last trading days of the preceding calendar quarter  ii if a credit rating assigned to the convertible securities falls below a specified level  iii if we take certain corporate actions  or iv if we call the convertible securities for redemption 
if the convertible debentures are converted  holders will receive shares per convertible debenture  or an aggregate of million shares of mandalay common stock 
in addition  if at the time of conversion the market price of mandalay s common stock exceeds the then applicable base conversion price  holders will receive up to an additional shares of mandalay s common stock per convertible debenture  as determined pursuant to a specified formula  or up to an additional million shares in the aggregate 
we may redeem all or some of the convertible debentures for cash at any time on or after march   at their accreted principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest  if any  to  but not including  the redemption date 
at the option of the holders  we may be required to repurchase the convertible securities on the th  th  th  th and th anniversaries of their issuance  at their accreted principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest  if any  to  but not including  the purchase date 
we may choose to pay the purchase price in cash  shares of mandalay common stock or any combination thereof 
senior subordinated notes and senior notes on july   the company issued million principal amount of senior subordinated notes due august and on august   the company issued million principal amount of senior notes due august these notes are not subject to any sinking fund requirements 
the net proceeds from these issuances were used to repay a portion of the borrowings under our then existing credit facility 
on december   we issued million principal amount of senior subordinated notes due february these notes are not subject to any sinking fund requirements 
the net proceeds from this issuance were used to repay a portion of the borrowings under our credit facilities 
interest rate swaps in june  we entered into two reverse interest rate swap agreements fair value hedges with a member of our bank group 
pursuant to one of the agreements  we received a fixed interest rate of and paid a variable interest rate based on libor plus on million notional amount 
pursuant to the other agreement  we received a fixed rate of and paid a variable interest rate based on libor plus on million notional amount 
the million swap was scheduled to terminate in december and the million swap was scheduled to terminate in february in august  we entered into two additional reverse interest rate swap agreements fair value hedges with members of our bank group 
under one agreement  we received a fixed interest rate of and paid a variable interest rate based on libor plus on million notional amount 
under the other  we received a fixed rate of and paid a variable interest rate based on libor plus on million notional amount 
both of these swaps were scheduled to terminate in august in october  we elected to terminate the four reverse swaps discussed above 
we received million in cash  representing the fair market value of the swaps  and recorded corresponding debt premiums which will be amortized to interest expense  using an effective interest rate method  over the remaining lives of the related debt instruments 
the amortization of the debt premium for the fiscal year ended january  was million 
this amortization is estimated to be approximately million in fiscal we entered into the above swap agreements  which met the criteria established by the financial accounting standards board for hedge accounting  in order to further manage our interest expense and achieve a better balance of variable to fixed debt in our debt portfolio 
by terminating these swaps  we effectively locked in these benefits as they pertain to these swaps  which will contribute to lower interest expense in the future 
in february  we entered into two new reverse interest rate swap agreements fair value hedges with members of our bank group 
under one agreement  we receive a fixed interest rate of and pay a variable interest rate based on libor plus on million notional amount 
under the other  we receive a fixed rate of and pay a variable interest rate based on libor plus on million notional amount 
the million swap is scheduled to terminate in december and the million swap is scheduled to terminate in february these swaps also meet the criteria for hedge accounting 
new projects mandalay bay convention center we have completed construction of a convention and meeting complex on land adjacent to the existing mandalay bay conference center 
the new complex  which opened on january   includes more than one million square feet of exhibit space 
with this new building and the original conference center  mandalay bay now offers almost two million gross square feet of conference and exhibit space 
we expect this space to be the site of approximately shows in fiscal the total cost of the new convention center  excluding land  capitalized interest and preopening expenses  was approximately million  of which million had been incurred as of january  mandalay bay suites tower we are currently building a new  suite hotel tower at mandalay bay 
the story tower will be located on the west side of the property 
the new suites will average square feet  among the largest room product in the las vegas market 
the tower will also include meeting suites  a spa and fitness center  two restaurants and a lounge 
we expect that the new suites will serve the demand generated by the new convention center 
the tower broke ground during the third quarter of fiscal and should open in november the total cost of the project is estimated to be million  excluding land  capitalized interest and preopening expenses 
as of january   we had incurred costs of million related to this project 
retail center we are constructing a retail center between mandalay bay and luxor 
the center will include approximately  square feet of retail space and approximately stores and restaurants  including several upscale  internationally branded retailers 
we started construction in the third quarter and expect a fall opening 
the cost is estimated to be approximately million  excluding land  capitalized interest and preopening expenses 
as of january   we had incurred costs of million related to this project 
detroit we participate with the detroit based atwater casino group in a joint venture that owns and operates a casino in detroit  michigan 
this joint venture is one of three groups which negotiated casino development agreements with the city of detroit 
the company has a ownership interest in the joint venture 
pending the development of a permanent hotel casino  the joint venture constructed a temporary casino motorcity casino in downtown detroit  which opened december  the cost of the temporary casino  including land and capitalized interest but excluding preopening expenses  was approximately million 
this cost was financed through the joint venture s million credit facility  which is secured by the assets associated with the temporary casino 
we have guaranteed this credit facility  which had a balance of million outstanding at january  the joint venture s operation of the casino is subject to ongoing regulatory oversight  and its ability to proceed with an expanded permanent hotel casino project is contingent upon the receipt of all necessary governmental approvals  successful resolution of pending litigation and satisfaction of other conditions 
on august   the detroit city council approved a revised development agreement between the joint venture and the city of detroit the revised development agreement 
under the revised development agreement  motorcity casino is to be expanded into a permanent facility at its current location by december  the permanent facility is currently expected to include  square feet of casino space  a room hotel  a  seat theater  convention space  and additional restaurants  retail space and parking 
depending upon market conditions  the availability of additional land and the joint venture s ability to obtain reasonable financing  the joint venture could be required to construct an additional rooms 
under the terms of the revised development agreement  the joint venture has paid the city a total of million 
it is to pay another million in june  and an additional million in equal monthly installments beginning june  also  beginning january   the joint venture is to pay the city of its adjusted casino revenues 
if its casino revenues top million in any given calendar year  the payment will be increased to for that calendar year 
under the terms of the operating agreement  mandalay is to receive a management fee for a period of ten years equal to of the cost of the permanent casino facility 
the management committee of the joint venture has made a preliminary determination that mandalay is entitled to the management fee commencing on the date the revised development agreement was signed  since that agreement provides for the existing facility to become the permanent facility 
pursuant to this determination  we recognized a management fee of million in fiscal and expect to recognize approximately million in management fees in fiscal since we own of the joint venture  the net benefit of the management fees to us is of the amount 
originally  the joint venture s permanent facility was to have been located on land along the detroit river 
the city s economic development corporation issued bonds to finance the city s acquisition of that land  and bank of america issued letters of credit totaling million to secure and ultimately make the payments of principal and interest on those bonds 
we then issued letters of credit totaling million to back bank of america s letters of credit 
we will continue to provide such letters of credit 
as part of the revised development agreement  the joint venture will forego the right to receive any of the riverfront land acquired by the city  and will transfer to the city its interest in certain real property previously purchased by the joint venture and the other casino developers 
both the joint venture and mandalay are subject to a radius restriction prohibiting them from operating additional casinos within approximately miles of detroit 
additionally  they are required to indemnify the city for up to million in claims against the city in connection with the acquisition of the riverfront land and in connection with the lac vieux litigation described below 
we have committed to contribute of the costs of the permanent facility in the form of an investment in the joint venture 
the joint venture will seek to borrow any additional funds above mandalay s equity contribution which may be necessary to complete the expanded permanent facility 
the cost of the additional facilities excluding land  capitalized interest and preopening expenses is currently estimated to be million 
under the revised development agreement  we have guaranteed completion of the expanded facility and have entered into a keep well agreement with the city that could require us to contribute additional funds to continue operation of the expanded facility for two years 
there is no contractual limitation on the amount that we may be required to contribute under our completion guarantee or to keep the project operating for two years 
however  based on the performance of the casino to date  we do not expect that these obligations will require the outlay of additional capital 
various lawsuits have been filed in the state and federal courts challenging the constitutionality of the casino development competitive selection process ordinance and the michigan gaming control and revenue act  and seeking to appeal the issuance of a certificate of suitability and casino license to motorcity casino 
a decision by the sixth circuit court of appeals in lac vieux desert band of lake superior chippewa indians v 
the michigan gaming control board et al 
held that the ordinance in its current form was unconstitutional and remanded the case to the district court 
the michigan gaming control board mgcb has taken the ruling of the sixth circuit court of appeals under advisement without comment 
the district court subsequently declared that the ordinance in its current form is unconstitutional and awarded the lac vieux band attorneys fees and costs totaling  however  it rejected the lac vieux band s request to require a rebidding of the three casino licenses 
the district court also rejected the lac vieux band s request to enjoin the city of detroit from entering into revised development agreements with the three casino developers  including motorcity casino 
the lac vieux band has appealed the district court s decision to the sixth circuit court of appeals 
pending its decision  the sixth circuit court of appeals has issued an opinion granting the lac vieux band s motion for an injunction that temporarily enjoins the city of detroit from issuing building permits for the permanent casino facilities and temporarily enjoins the casino developers from commencing construction of the permanent casino facilities 
the effect of the rulings in this case is uncertain 
the lac vieux band has filed a separate action in the gogebic county  michigan  circuit court entitled lac vieux desert band of lake superior chippewa indians v 
michigan gaming control board  in which the lac vieux band has requested the circuit court to enter an order requiring the mgcb to revoke the casino licenses issued to the three detroit casinos  including motorcity casino 
the action has been stayed pending resolution by the sixth circuit court of appeals of the lac vieux band s appeal of the district court decision referenced above 
in a separate action  on february   john ren filed suit in the circuit court of wayne county  michigan  against the detroit joint venture and the other two casino operators in detroit 
the plaintiff purports to represent himself and a class consisting of all persons who lost money and or incurred debts that remain unpaid at any of the three detroit casinos 
relying on the sixth circuit court of appeals lac vieux decision  the plaintiff alleges that the three casinos have been operating illegally and continue to do so 
the relief sought by the plaintiff includes an injunction to restrain the three casinos from remaining open until properly licensed  compensatory damages  and disgorgement of all profits unjustly obtained 
the court dismissed this action on the basis that the plaintiff should first seek relief from the mgcb 
the plaintiff has filed a claim with the mgcb  which is still pending 
the joint venture continues to operate motorcity casino 
any future adverse ruling by the courts in the above lawsuits or in other lawsuits  or any adverse ruling by the mcgb  could affect the joint venture s operation of its current facility  as well as its ability to retain its certificate of suitability and casino license for its expanded permanent facility 
no assurance can be given regarding the timing or outcome of any of these proceedings 
share purchases in june  our board of directors authorized the purchase of up to of mandalay s common stock which remained outstanding after we fully utilized our prior share purchase authorization

after giving effect to the march  settlement of the equity forward agreements discussed below under off balance sheet arrangements  the number of additional shares authorized to be purchased as of january  was approximately million 
in march  the board authorized the purchase of up to an additional million shares of our common stock 
any share purchases we may make in the future pursuant to this authorization will be dependent upon market conditions  and are expected to be made in accordance with the volume and other limitations of rule b under the securities exchange act of see financing activities for a discussion of our share purchase activity in fiscal and liquidity we have various obligations in fiscal including the following i existing cash obligations  ii capital commitments on projects under way see new projects  iii settlement of our million equity forward agreements which expired march  see off balance sheet arrangements  iv repayment of our million senior subordinated notes due july  v repayment of our million debentures due which are expected to be put by their holders in november  as permitted under the indenture  and vi refinancing of our operating lease agreements see off balance sheet arrangements we believe we have sufficient capital resources to meet all of the above obligations  as well as provide for additional strategic purchases of our common stock or investments in new projects 
this belief is based upon i our historically strong and dependable operating cash flows  ii the availability of borrowings under our revolving credit facility  and iii the ability to raise funds in the debt and equity markets 
under our revolving bank facility  which expires july  we had million of borrowing capacity available as of january   of which we could utilize million under the most restrictive of our loan covenants 
our borrowing capacity under these covenants can fluctuate substantially from quarter to quarter depending upon our operating cash flow 
the borrowing capacity available under the revolving bank facility increased to approximately million as a result of the march  issuance of million convertible senior debentures due  the proceeds of which were used to repay borrowings under the facility 
off balance sheet arrangements operating leases in october  we entered into a million operating lease agreement with a group of financial institutions to lease equipment at mandalay bay 
in december  we entered into a series of sale and leaseback agreements covering equipment located at several nevada properties 
these agreements  again made with a group of financial institutions  totaled million 
the sale of the equipment resulted in the recognition of a net deferred gain of million  a substantial portion of which was subsequently reversed when we exercised our purchase option on some of the equipment see below 
the remaining unamortized deferred gain of approximately million will be reversed upon termination of the lease  assuming we again exercise our purchase option 
the proceeds from these leases were used to reduce borrowings outstanding under our revolving credit facility

pursuant to this option  we paid million to reacquire the aircraft and reversed million of related deferred gain  which represented the remaining unamortized balance 
on september   we exercised our purchase option under a million aircraft lease agreement also part of the december agreements 
pursuant to this option  we paid million to reacquire the aircraft and reversed million of related deferred gain  which represented the remaining unamortized balance 
we entered into our operating leases solely to provide greater financial flexibility 
the rent expense related to these operating leases is reported separately in the consolidated statements of income as operating lease rent 
the operating lease agreements contain financial covenants regarding total debt and interest coverage that are similar to those under our credit facilities 
the agreements also contain covenants regarding maintenance of the equipment  insurance requirements and prohibitions on liens 
as of january   we were in compliance with all of the covenants in these agreements 
the leases provide that  at termination  we may elect to purchase the equipment for a stated purchase option amount which is equal to the estimated fair value of the equipment at that date  as determined by an independent appraisal 
if we choose not to purchase the equipment  we may be obligated to pay additional amounts under the lease provisions if such equipment cannot be sold for the appraised fair value 
we are currently negotiating a new capital lease facility that is expected to replace the above operating lease agreements 
we anticipate that this new facility will close by the end of june we are exposed to risks under these lease agreements as follows i to the extent we are unable to make required lease payments  the equipment could be foreclosed  which could have a detrimental impact on our operating results  and ii to the extent we are financially unable to purchase the equipment or similar replacement equipment at maturity  our ability to operate our properties could be impaired  which could likewise have a negative impact on our operating results 
we do not consider these risks to be significant due to our historically strong production of cash flow and our access to various other forms of capital

market risk and derivative financial instruments mandalay is exposed to market risk in the form of fluctuations in interest rates and their potential impact upon our variable rate debt 
we manage this market risk by utilizing derivative financial instruments in accordance with established policies and procedures 
we evaluate our exposure to market risk by monitoring interest rates in the marketplace 
we do not utilize derivative financial instruments for trading purposes 
our derivative financial instruments consist exclusively of interest rate swap agreements 
interest differentials resulting from these agreements are recorded on an accrual basis as an adjustment to interest expense 
interest rate swaps related to debt are initially matched either with specific fixed rate debt obligations or with levels of variable rate borrowings 
to manage our exposure to counterparty credit risk in interest rate swaps  we enter into agreements with highly rated institutions that can be expected to fully perform under the terms of such agreements 
frequently  these institutions are also members of the bank group providing our credit facilities  which management believes further minimizes the risk of nonperformance

the following table provides information as of january  about our financial instruments debt obligations and interest rate swaps that are sensitive to changes in interest rates 
for debt obligations  the table presents principal payments and related weighted average interest rates by expected maturity dates 
for interest rate swaps  the table presents notional amounts and weighted average interest rates by contractual maturity dates 
notional amounts are used to calculate the contractual cash flows to be exchanged under the contract 
weighted average variable rates are based on implied forward rates in the yield curve 
implied forward rates should not be considered a predictor of actual future interest rates
