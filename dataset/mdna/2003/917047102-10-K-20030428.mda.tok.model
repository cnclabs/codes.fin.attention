table of contents item selected financial data the following table sets forth selected consolidated income statement and balance sheet data for the periods indicated 
the selected consolidated income statement and balance sheet data at the fiscal year end for each of the five fiscal years presented below is derived from the consolidated financial statements of the company 
the data presented below should be read in conjunction with management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  the consolidated financial statements of the company  and the related notes thereto  which appear elsewhere in this report

table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion of our historical results of operations and of our liquidity and capital resources should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and their related notes included elsewhere in this report 
general our fiscal year ends on january all references in this discussion to our fiscal years refer to the fiscal years ended on january in those years 
for example  our fiscal ended on january  the comparable store net sales data presented in this discussion is calculated based on the net sales of all stores open at least twelve full months at the beginning of the period for which such data is presented 
we operate two business segments a lifestyle merchandising retailing segment and a wholesale apparel business 
the retailing segment operates through retail stores and direct to consumer  including two catalogs and two web sites 
the retail concepts are urban outfitters  which we refer to as urban retail  anthropologie and free people 
urban retail had stores open at january  and at january  anthropologie had stores open at january  and at january  free people had one store open at january   which opened in november the free people wholesale division designs  develops and markets young women s casual apparel and sells worldwide through approximately  better department and specialty stores 
we have plans to open approximately to stores during this fiscal year  primarily in our urban retail and anthropologie concepts 
our goal thereafter is to increase net sales to per year through a combination of opening new stores  growing comparable store sales and continuing the growth of our direct to consumer and wholesale operations 
we have wholly owned subsidiaries that operate urban retail stores in london and glasgow  in dublin and in montreal and toronto 
these stores are included in the store numbers given above 
the results of operations and financial position for these stores are included in our retail operations segment results 
we may open additional stores outside the united states over the next several fiscal years 
critical accounting policies and estimates our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
these generally accepted accounting principles require management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of net sales and expenses during the reporting period 
our significant accounting policies are described in note to our consolidated financial statements 
we believe that the following discussion addresses our critical accounting policies  which are those that are most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results and require management s most difficult  subjective and complex judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
if actual results were to differ significantly from estimates made  the reported results could be materially affected 
however  we are not currently aware of any reasonably likely events or circumstances that would cause our actual results to be materially different from our estimates 

table of contents the company s senior management has reviewed the critical accounting policies and estimates and management s discussion and analysis regarding them with its audit committee 
inventories we value our inventories  which consist primarily of general consumer merchandise held for sale  at the lower of cost or market 
cost is determined on the first in  first out method and includes the cost of merchandise and freight 
a periodic review of inventory quantities on hand is performed in order to determine if inventory is properly stated at the lower of cost or market 
factors related to current inventories such as future consumer demand and fashion trends  current aging  current and anticipated retail markdowns or wholesale discounts  and class or type of inventory are analyzed to determine estimated net realizable values 
criteria utilized by the company to quantify aging trends includes factors such as average selling cycle and seasonality of merchandise  historical rate at which merchandise has sold below cost during the average selling cycle  and merchandise currently priced below original cost 
a provision is recorded to reduce the cost of inventories to the estimated net realizable values  if required 
inventories as of january  and january  totaled million and million  respectively  representing approximately and of total assets  respectively 
any significant changes in the factors noted above could have a significant impact on the value of our inventories and our reported operating results 
long lived assets our long lived assets consist principally of store leasehold improvements and are included in the property and equipment line item in our consolidated balance sheets included in this report 
these long lived assets are recorded at cost and are amortized using the straight line method over the lesser of the applicable store lease term or the estimated useful life of the leasehold improvements 
the typical initial lease term for our stores is ten years 
net property and equipment as of january  and january  totaled million and million  respectively  representing and of total assets  respectively 
in assessing potential impairment of these assets  we periodically evaluate the historical and forecasted operating results and cash flows on a store by store basis 
newly opened stores may take time to generate positive operating and cash flow results 
factors such as store type eg  mall versus free standing  store location eg  urban area versus college campus or suburb  current marketplace awareness of the urban outfitters  anthropologie and free people brands  local customer demographic data and current fashion trends are all considered in determining the time frame required for a store to achieve positive financial results  which  in general  is assumed to be within three years from the date a store location has opened 
if economic conditions are substantially different from our expectations  the carrying value of certain of our long lived assets may become impaired 
for the fiscal years  and  we had no write downs of long lived assets 
accounting for income taxes as part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements  we are required to estimate our income taxes in each of the tax jurisdictions in which we operate 
this process involves estimating our actual current tax exposure together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items for tax and accounting purposes  such as depreciation of property and equipment and valuation of inventories 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included within our consolidated balance sheet 
we must then assess the likelihood that our 
table of contents deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income 
actual results could differ from this assessment if adequate taxable income is not generated in future periods 
deferred tax assets as of january  and january  totaled approximately million and million  respectively  representing approximately and of total assets  respectively 
to the extent we believe that recovery is at risk  we must establish valuation allowances 
to the extent we establish valuation allowances or increase the allowances in a period  we must include an expense within the tax provision in the consolidated statement of income 
we have valuation allowances of million as of january  due to uncertainties related to our ability to utilize the net operating loss carryforwards of certain foreign subsidiaries and capital loss carryforwards related to our prior investments in mxg media  inc in the future  if enough evidence of our ability to generate sufficient future taxable income in these foreign jurisdictions or to realize off setting capital gains becomes apparent  we would be required to reduce our valuation allowances  resulting in a reduction in income tax expense in the consolidated statement of income 
on a quarterly basis  management evaluates and assesses the realizability of deferred tax assets and adjusts valuation allowances if required 
accounting for contingencies from time to time  we are named as a defendant in legal actions arising from our normal business activities 
we account for contingencies such as these in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for contingencies 
sfas no 
requires us to record an estimated loss contingency when information available prior to the issuance of our financial statements indicates that it is probable that an asset has been impaired or a liability has been incurred at the date of the financial statements and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated 
accounting for contingencies arising from contractual or legal proceedings requires company management to use its best judgment when estimating an accrual related to such contingencies 
as additional information becomes known  our accrual for a loss contingency could fluctuate  thereby creating variability in our results of operations from period to period 
likewise  an actual loss arising from a loss contingency which significantly exceeds the amount accrued for in our financial statements could have a material adverse impact on our operating results for the period in which such actual loss becomes known 

table of contents results of operations the following tables set forth  for the periods indicated  the percentage of the company s net sales represented by certain income statement data and the change in certain income statement data from period to period 
fiscal year ended january  as a percentage of net sales net sales cost of sales  including certain buying  distribution and occupancy costs gross profit selling  general and administrative expenses income from operations other income expense  net income before income taxes income tax expense net income period over period change net sales gross profit income from operations net income fiscal compared to fiscal net sales in fiscal increased by to million from million in the prior fiscal year 
the million increase was primarily attributable to a million  or  increase in retail segment sales  offset in part by a slight decline in free people wholesale sales of million  excluding sales to urban retail  anthropologie and free people retail operations 
noncomparable and new store net sales increases of million  comparable store net sales increases of million or  and direct to consumer net sales increases of million or accounted for the retail segment increase 
comparable store net sales were comprised of a increase for urban retail and a increase for anthropologie 
the increase in net sales attributable to noncomparable and new stores was the result of opening new stores in fiscal and new stores in fiscal comparable store net sales increases were principally the result of an increase in the number of transactions and average sales price resulting from higher initial markons and a lower proportion of markdowns  which more than offset a decrease in the number of items purchased per transaction 
direct to consumer net sales increased over the prior year primarily due to an increase in the average catalog and web order value and additional customer response related to an increase in catalog circulation for anthropologie  including a new summer essentials catalog 
the urban retail web site also contributed to the direct to consumer net sales increase as a result of increased site traffic and an improvement in average order value 

table of contents gross profit margins increased to of net sales in fiscal compared to of net sales in fiscal improvements to initial margins due to better sourcing and an increased proportion of private label merchandise  together with a reduction in markdown requirements  accounted for the majority of the increase 
total inventories at january  increased by including an increase in comparable store inventories of  primarily related to an increase in the number of units per store anticipated to support sales trends 
selling  general and administrative expenses decreased to of net sales for fiscal versus of net sales for fiscal this improvement was primarily attributable to the leveraging of store level expenses as a result of the increases in the comparable store sales and leveraging of fixed expenses and increased efficiencies in the direct to consumer operations 
accordingly  our operating margins increased to of net sales for fiscal compared to of net sales for fiscal our effective tax rate of remained the same for fiscal compared to fiscal see note to our consolidated financial statements  included elsewhere in this report  for a reconciliation of the statutory us federal income tax rate to our effective tax rate 
fiscal compared to fiscal net sales in fiscal increased by to million from million in the prior fiscal year 
the million increase was attributable to a million  or  increase in retail segment sales  offset in part by a million  or  decline in free people wholesale sales  excluding sales to urban retail and anthropologie 
noncomparable and new store net sales increases of million  comparable store net sales increases of million or  and direct to consumer net sales increases of million or accounted for the retail segment increase 
comparable store net sales were comprised of a increase for urban retail and a increase for anthropologie 
the increase in net sales attributable to noncomparable and new stores was the result of opening new stores in fiscal and new stores in fiscal net of one store closing 
increases in the number of transactions in comparable stores and an increase in average sales prices resulting from a lower proportion of markdowns accounted for the comparable store sales dollar increase in fiscal in addition  direct to consumer net sales increased as a result of an increase in customer response rates to the anthropologie catalog and web site and the urban retail web site 
the decline in free people wholesale sales in the first half of the year was due to a lackluster response to our spring and summer fashion offerings combined with production problems associated with a factory we no longer utilize 
additionally  a weaker wholesale market environment in the latter half of fiscal compared to fiscal resulted in decreased trade show attendance as well as a decline in our fall and holiday regular price merchandise reorders 
the reduction in free people in season wholesale sales was offset in part by an increase in off price sales to liquidate prior season merchandise 
gross profit margins increased to of net sales in fiscal compared to of net sales in fiscal decreased markdowns in the retail segment were sufficient to offset the effects of an increase in occupancy costs of of net sales  arising primarily from noncomparable and new stores  and the impact of the reduction in free people s gross margin of of net sales  caused by the off price liquidation of excess inventories 
total inventories at january  increased by 
table of contents  including an increase in comparable store inventories of  primarily due to an increase in the average cost per unit and an increase in the number of units per store to support sales trends 
selling  general and administrative expenses decreased to of net sales for fiscal versus of net sales for fiscal an increase in direct to consumer response rates helped leverage catalog and web site production costs for direct to consumer marketing activities and was the primary reason for our operating expense percentage improvement of of net sales  despite an decrease in catalog circulation during fiscal we also experienced comparable store efficiencies primarily related to the generation of incremental sales without incremental payroll costs that  when combined with the direct to consumer operating cost leveraging  more than offset the impact of the less efficient noncomparable and new stores 
accordingly  our operating margins increased to of net sales for fiscal compared to of net sales for fiscal our effective tax rate decreased to in fiscal from in fiscal primarily due to a reduction in state and local tax rates 
see note to our consolidated financial statements  included elsewhere in this report  for a reconciliation of the statutory us federal income tax rate to our effective tax rate 
liquidity and capital resources in april  we completed a public offering of million shares of our common stock at a price of per share 
we received net proceeds of approximately million from the offering 
in conjunction with the offering  certain selling shareholders exercised options which resulted in additional cash proceeds of approximately million 
in addition to this and other sources of cash  we received net proceeds from the exercise of certain employee stock options during fiscal and fiscal of approximately million and million  respectively 
during the last three years  in addition to the proceeds generated from the public offering of our common shares and the exercise of certain employee stock options  we have also satisfied our cash requirements through cash flow from operations  accumulated cash and the sales of marketable securities 
our primary uses of cash have been to open new stores and purchase inventories 
we have also continued to invest in direct to consumer efforts and in our united kingdom and ireland subsidiaries 
we expect to increase the level of capital expenditures in support of our goal of expanding the store base by approximately per annum 
accumulated cash and future cash from operations  as well as available credit under our line of credit facility  assuming renewal or replacement  are expected to fund such expansion related uses of cash at least through fiscal on september   we renewed and amended our line of credit facility with one of our banks 
this credit facility  which renewed and amended our million committed line of credit with the bank  is a one year million committed line of credit to fund working capital requirements and letters of credit

there were no short term or long term borrowings outstanding at january  or at january  outstanding letters of credit totaled million and million at january  and january   respectively 
the available line of credit under the credit facility was million and million at january  and january   respectively 
we plan to renew the current line of credit on or before its expiration on september   however  there can be no assurance that we will be able to renew or replace the line of credit 
based on fiscal operating trends and the operating model that management has planned for fiscal  we do not believe it will be necessary to borrow short term or long term funds 
in the event  however  that there is a serious decline in sales for any reason or a significant increase in store expansion plans  we may be required to use our available line of credit for cash borrowings to fund operations 
there can be no assurance that  based upon existing covenants or financial covenants contained in any renewed or replacement line of credit  that such borrowings would be available 
in january  the company s board of directors approved a stock buyback program that authorized the company to repurchase up to  of its shares 
as of january    shares are authorized for repurchase 
we have entered into agreements that create contractual obligations and commercial commitments 
these obligations and commitments will have an impact on future liquidity and the availability of capital resources

seasonality and quarterly results while we have been profitable in each of our last operating quarters  our operating results are subject to seasonal fluctuations 
our highest sales levels have historically occurred during the five month period from august to december of each year the back to school and holiday periods 
sales generated during these periods have traditionally had a significant impact on our results of operations 
any decreases in sales for these periods or in the availability of working capital needed in the months preceding these periods could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 
our results of operations may also fluctuate from quarter to quarter as a result of the amount and timing of expenses incurred in connection with  and sales contributed by  new stores  store expansions and the integration of new stores into our operations or by the size and timing of catalog mailings and web site traffic for our direct to consumer operations 
fluctuations in the bookings and shipments of wholesale merchandise between quarters can also have positive or negative effects on earnings during the quarters

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company is exposed to the following types of market risks fluctuations in the purchase price of merchandise  as well as other goods and services  the value of foreign currencies in relation to the us dollar  and changes in interest rates 
due to the company s inventory turn and its historical ability to pass through the impact of any generalized changes in its cost of goods to its customers through pricing adjustments  commodity and other product risks are not expected to be material 
the company purchases substantially all its merchandise in us dollars  including a portion of the goods for its stores located in canada and europe 
the company s exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates to its cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities 
as of january  the company s cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities consisted primarily of funds invested in money market accounts  which bear interest at a variable rate  auction rate preferred stock rated aa or better and tax exempt municipal bonds rated aa or better  which bear interest at a fixed rate 
due to the average maturity and conservative nature of the company s investment portfolio  we believe a sudden change in interest rates would not have a material effect on the value of our investment portfolio 
as the interest rates on a material portion of our cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities are variable  a change in interest rates earned on the cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities would impact interest income and expense along with cash flows  but would not impact the fair market value of the related underlying instruments
