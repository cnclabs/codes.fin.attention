overview we provide application management software solutions that maximize the availability  performance and manageability of our customer s business critical applications and their underlying databases and other associated components 
many of our products also increase the cost effectiveness of a customer s it investments  including personnel  software and hardware 
our revenues consist of software license fees and service fees 
our software licensing model is primarily based on perpetual license fees  and our licenses are either server based or  for our sql development  report management and microsoft administration tools  user based 
service revenues primarily represent the ratable recognition of software maintenance contract fees  which entitle a customer to technical support via telephone and the internet and product enhancements 
these maintenance contracts all have annual terms 
customers purchase a software maintenance contract for the first year when they license a product and have the option of renewing the maintenance contract annually thereafter 
service revenues also include revenues from consulting and training services 
acquisition of sitraka on november   we acquired all of the outstanding common stock of sitraka  inc sitraka  a developer of application server performance management products  in exchange for cash payments of million and up to million in additional contingent consideration 
the acquisition was accounted for as a purchase and the purchase price was allocated primarily to goodwill totaling million and other intangible assets totaling million 
in connection with the acquisition  we recorded a charge totaling million for the fair value of purchased in process research and development ipr d 
we recorded this charge because the technological feasibility of products under development at the date of acquisition had not been established and no future alternative uses existed 
the charge represented the estimated fair value of the incomplete research and development products based on discounted cash flows 
management is primarily responsible for estimating the fair value of ipr d  which was determined with the assistance of an independent appraiser 
we identified and valued two ipr d projects 
both projects were approximately complete at the date of acquisition and the estimated cost to complete the projects was million 
one project was directed toward the development of improvements to an existing product and the other for a product that was in pre production 
the ipr d for the improvements to the existing product represented of the total value of ipr d acquired  while the product in pre production represented the balance of 
at the date of acquisition both projects were anticipated to be completed in the first quarter of the projects were completed as anticipated and made generally available for sale in march see note of notes to consolidated financial statements

the decline in license revenues for these products was offset by growth in other product areas  primarily our microsoft administration products and our monitoring products 
license revenues represented of total revenues in  compared to in license revenues in north america decreased to million in from million in  a decline of 
the decrease in north american license revenues was offset slightly by the acquisition of sitraka in the fourth quarter of license revenues outside of north america increased to million in from million in  and accounted for of total license revenues  compared to in the increase in license revenues outside of north america is primarily due to strengthening operations in europe as a result of continued investment in our foreign operations 
license revenues attributable to our european operations represented million in  compared to million in  representing growth of 
service revenues service revenues increased to million in from in this increase was derived primarily from higher renewal maintenance fees 
higher renewal maintenance fees derived from growth in the base of installed products and  we believe  from improved support renewal billing processes and improved maintenance renewal rates 
to a much lesser extent  support revenues from the acquired base of sitraka customers also contributed to year over year increase in service revenues 
professional services as a percentage of total service revenues represented in and in cost of revenues cost of licenses cost of licenses primarily consists of third party software royalties  product packaging  documentation  duplication and amortization of purchased software rights 
cost of licenses decreased to million in from million in  representing a decline of million or 
cost of licenses as a percentage of license revenues was for  compared with in the decrease in cost of licenses for was primarily due to a decrease in third party royalty obligations associated with our acquisition of revealnet in the third quarter of  whose products we distributed  and a decrease in amortization expense related to rights in purchased software rights 
we expect that cost of licenses as a percentage of license revenues will remain relatively constant in cost of services cost of services primarily consists of personnel  facilities and systems costs used in providing support  consulting and training services 
cost of services decreased to million in from million in  representing a decline of million 
cost of services as a percentage of service revenues declined to for  compared to for the decrease in cost of services for is primarily attributable to a reduction in the amount of fees paid to outside consultants who provided specialized professional services 
amortization of purchased intangible assets amortization of purchased intangible assets includes amortization of the fair value of acquired technology associated with the acquisitions made during  and amortization of purchased intangible assets decreased to million in from million in  representing a decrease of million or 
the decrease is primarily due to the completion of amortization of purchased intangible assets related to certain acquisitions made in  offset slightly by amortization related to acquisitions made in intangible assets purchased as part of acquisitions were million and million in and  respectively 
the useful lives of the technology acquired range from one to seven years  and we expect the amortization of these purchased intangible assets to be approximately million in  million in and thereafter million 
see critical accounting policies and estimates for additional discussion regarding accounting for intangible assets 
operating expenses sales and marketing sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of compensation and benefit costs  sales commissions  facilities and systems costs  recruiting costs  trade shows  travel and entertainment and marketing communications costs such as advertising and promotion 
sales and marketing expenses increased to million in from million in as a percentage of total revenues  sales and marketing remained relatively flat from to the increase in sales and marketing expenses in resulted from increased labor expenses  primarily due to additional headcount from our acquisition of sitraka  higher sales commission expenses and increased depreciation of sales and marketing information technology assets 
research and development research and development expenses consist primarily of compensation and benefit costs for software developers  software product managers  quality assurance and technical documentation personnel  facilities and systems costs and payments made to outside software development consultants in connection with our on going efforts to enhance our core technologies and develop additional products 
research and development expenses were constant at million in compared with million in  and declined as a percentage of total revenues to in from in in  we implemented cost control measures that resulted in decreases in travel expenses and fees paid to outside software development consultants 
these savings were offset by increased labor costs primarily attributable to the additional headcount resulting from the sitraka acquisition 
we believe significant expenditures in research and development are required to remain competitive  and expect that research and development expenses will continue to represent approximately of total revenues for the foreseeable future 
general and administrative general and administrative expenses consist primarily of compensation and benefit costs for our executive  finance  legal  administrative and information services personnel  professional fees  and facilities and systems costs 
general and administrative expenses increased to million in from million in  representing an increase of million or 
the increase in is primarily attributable to increased legal expenses and premiums for directors and officers liability insurance coverage 
general and administrative expenses as a percentage of total revenues remained relatively flat from to intangible asset and goodwill amortization intangible asset and goodwill amortization includes the amortization of intangible assets 
these costs decreased to million in from million in  principally resulting from our adoption of sfas no 
all remaining and future acquired goodwill will be subject to impairment tests annually  or earlier if indicators of potential impairment exist  using a fair value based approach 
all other intangible assets will continue to be amortized over their estimated useful lives and assessed for impairment under sfas no 
previously recognized workforce in place intangible assets were reclassified to goodwill effective january  see note of notes to consolidated financial statements for a reconciliation of previously reported net income loss and earnings loss per share to the amounts adjusted for the exclusion of goodwill amortization had we adopted the non amortization provisions of sfas no 
as of january  other compensation costs other compensation costs is comprised primarily of compensation expense associated with the issuance of stock options with exercise prices below fair market value 
these costs decreased to million in from million in other income  net other income  net consists primarily of interest income and expense and gain loss on equity investments 
other income  net increased to million in from million in the increase is primarily due to a million net gain recognized in on equity investments  partially offset by lower yields on investments as a function of the decreasing interest rate environment and a loss recognized on the disposal of an aircraft 
the net gain on equity investments in was attributable to a million gain on the sale of an equity investment  largely offset by a non cash charge of million reflecting an adjustment for other than temporary impairment of an equity investment 
these investments are in privately held information technology companies  many of which are in the start up or development stage 
these investments are carried at cost  subject to adjustment for other than temporary impairment 
the average interest rates of our investments are summarized under item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk s interest rate risk 
during  we recognized a million loss on equity investments 
the loss in resulted from a non cash charge to write down the carrying value of certain equity investments to reflect an adjustment for other than temporary impairment 
we have committed to make additional capital contributions to a private equity fund totaling million 
if the companies in which we have made direct or indirect investments do not complete initial public offerings or are not acquired by publicly traded companies or for cash  we may not be able to sell these investments 
in addition  even if we are able to sell these investments  we cannot assure that we will be able to sell them at a gain or even recover our investment 
income taxes provision for income taxes increased to million in from million in  representing an increase of million or 
the effective income tax rate in was compared to in the change in the effective tax rate from to results primarily from the elimination of goodwill amortization associated with the implementation of sfas no

comparison of fiscal years ended december  and revenues total revenues were million in compared to million in  representing growth of million or 
license revenues license revenues were million in  compared to million in  representing growth of million or 
license revenues represented of total revenues in  compared to in license revenues in north america accounted for of total license revenues for  compared to in license revenue growth in derived from higher unit volumes  sales force expansion and new product introductions 
our ability to close larger individual sales transactions also contributed to license revenue growth in these periods 
price increases did not contribute to license revenue growth 
the increase in license revenues from to was primarily due to continued expansion of our worldwide sales force  and to a greater extent increased market acceptance of existing products  including livereorg  and the successful introduction of new products  including quest central for db and the fastlane products we acquired in september for managing microsoft windows environments 
service revenues service revenues were million in  compared to million in  representing growth of million or 
service revenues represented of total revenues in  compared to in the growth in service revenues in reflect the increase in first year maintenance and support fees associated with the growth in product license sales 
to a much lesser extent  consulting services revenue growth contributed to service revenue growth in cost of revenues cost of licenses cost of licenses was million in  compared with million in  representing an increase of million or 
cost of licenses as a percentage of license revenues was in  compared with in the increase in absolute dollars in cost of licenses from to was primarily due to increased software royalties partially offset by a reduction in printing costs in cost of services cost of services was million in  compared with million in  representing an increase of million or 
cost of services as a percentage of service revenues was in  compared with for the dollar cost increase in cost of services was primarily due to the increase in the number of technical support personnel required to manage and support our growing customer base as well as increased product offerings 
as a percentage of service revenues  costs of services decreased from in to in this decrease in was caused by increased tenure and productivity of technical support personnel and increased stability of enhanced products in our installed base 
amortization of purchased intangible assets amortization of purchased intangible assets was million in  compared with million in  representing an increase of million or 
intangible assets purchased as part of acquisitions were million and million in and  respectively 
the increase in amortization from to was due entirely to technology purchased as part of the acquisitions made during the third quarter of in the third quarter of  we added million of purchased intangible assets  as a result of incurring a full year of amortization in compared to approximately three months in operating expenses sales and marketing sales and marketing expenses were million in  compared to million in  representing an increase of million or 
sales and marketing as a percentage of total revenues increased to in  compared to in the increase in sales and marketing expense was primarily due to an increase in salaries and related expenses of million  a million increase in commissions  million increase in travel and related costs and a million increase in office lease expenses 
the increases reflect our investment in our sales and marketing organization 
in particular  sales and marketing employees increased by from to  an increase of 
commissions were higher year over year as a result of increased license revenues 
sales and marketing expenses decreased as a percentage of revenues in the first and second quarters of  but then increased to and in the third and fourth quarters  respectively  as revenues declined more than expenses in the aftermath of the september  attacks on the united states 
research and development research and development expenses were million in  compared to million in  representing an increase of million or 
the increase in research and development expenses during these periods was primarily related to increases in the number of personnel conducting research and development  including software developers and technical documentation and quality assurance personnel associated with new product initiatives and the integration of software products associated with companies acquired during the to periods 
research and development expenses as a percentage of total revenues were relatively flat from to as a result of lower than expected license revenues in the last two quarters offset by a reduction in year over year headcount increases 
general and administrative general and administrative expenses were million in  compared to million in  representing an increase of million or 
the dollar increase in general and administrative expenses was primarily due to the increase in headcount to support our growing infrastructure and expanding operations 
general and administrative expenses as a percentage of total revenues decreased from in to in  primarily because associated headcount is growing at a slower rate than revenues 
intangible asset and goodwill amortization intangible asset and goodwill amortization increased to million in from million in  primarily due to the acquisitions made during the third quarter of we added million of goodwill  as a result of incurring a full year of amortization in compared to approximately three months in see note of notes to consolidated financial statements for a reconciliation of previously reported net income loss and earnings loss per share to the amounts adjusted for the exclusion of goodwill amortization had we adopted the non amortization provisions of sfas no 
as of january  other compensation costs other compensation costs increased to million in from million in these costs were primarily related to the grant of stock options with exercise prices at less than fair market value 
the majority of the option grants with exercise prices at less than fair market value were made in other income  net other income  net was million in  compared to million in the decrease from to is primarily due to a non cash charge of million we recognized to write down the carrying value of certain equity investments to reflect their estimated fair value  lower yields on investments as a function of the decreasing interest rate environment and reduced cash balances resulting from application of the net proceeds from public offerings in august and march income taxes provision for income taxes was million in  compared to million in  representing a decrease of million or 
the effective income tax rate for was  compared to in the change in the effective tax rate from to resulted primarily from an increase in non deductible goodwill amortization associated with acquisitions completed during and inflation inflation has not had a significant effect on our results of operations or financial position for the years ended december   and liquidity and capital resources as of december   the fair market value of our investment portfolio included cash  cash equivalents and short term marketable securities totaling million and million  respectively  in long term investment grade corporate and government securities 
net cash provided by operating activities declined to million in  compared with million and million in and  respectively 
the decrease in net cash provided by operating activities in resulted primarily from a slowdown in the rate of growth of deferred revenue and reduced accrued compensation 
net cash used in investing activities was million in  consisting primarily of million net cash received from sales and maturities of marketable securities  offset by the use of million for acquisitions and million in capital expenditures 
net cash used in investing activities was million in  consisting primarily of net purchases of marketable securities of million and capital expenditures of million to support our worldwide expansion and related infrastructure needs 
net cash used in investing activities was million in  consisting primarily of net purchases of marketable securities of million  acquisitions of million  and capital expenditures of million to support our worldwide expansion and related infrastructure needs 
during the year ended december   we generated approximately million in cash and cash equivalents  primarily from our operations 
because our operating results may fluctuate significantly  as a result of decreases in customer demand or decreases in the acceptance of our future products and services  our ability to generate positive cash flow from operations may be jeopardized 
in the future  we expect cash will continue to be generated from our operations 
we do not expect to spend significant amounts of additional cash to acquire property and equipment in the near term and therefore the level of cash used in investing activities to acquire property and equipment should remain constant with that used in we do  however  currently plan to reinvest our cash generated from operations in new short and long term marketable securities consistent with past investment practices  and continue to evaluate a variety of strategic investment and acquisition opportunities 
therefore  net cash used in investing activities may increase 
financing activities generated million in  primarily resulting from net proceeds of million from issuances of our common stock under employee stock option and stock purchase plans  offset by the use of million to repay debt 
financing activities generated million in  of which million was generated from issuances of our common stock under employee stock option and stock purchase plans 
financing activities generated million in in march  we raised net proceeds of million from a public offering of our common stock 
in december  our board of directors authorized a stock repurchase program under which quest may purchase up to two million shares of its common stock 
under the repurchase program  we may purchases shares from time to time at varying prices in open market or private transactions 
in october  our board of directors increased the total number of shares authorized for repurchase under the stock repurchase program from two million shares to five million 
as of december   we had repurchased approximately million shares of our common stock under this program for an aggregate cost of approximately million 
repurchases help offset dilution from stock issued under our stock option and stock purchase plans 
no shares of common stock were repurchased under this plan during or as of december   our only significant contractual obligations or commercial commitments consisted of our facility lease commitments and operating leases for office facilities and certain items of equipment  and the remaining balance of certain indebtedness assumed in connection with our acquisition of fastlane in september these commitments will require cash payments of million in  million in  million in  million in and million thereafter 
in addition  we have committed to make additional capital contributions to a private equity fund totaling million as capital calls are made 
we do not have any off balance sheet arrangements that could significantly reduce our liquidity 
we would be required to use existing cash  cash equivalents and investment balances to support our working capital balances if we are not able to generate or sustain positive cash flow from operations 
our ability to generate cash from operations is subject to substantial risks described below under the caption risk factors 
based on our current operating plan  we believe that our existing cash  cash equivalents and investment balances and cash flows from operations will be sufficient to finance our working capital and capital expenditure requirements through at least the next months 
however  if events occur or circumstances change such that we fail to meet our operating plan as expected  we may require additional funds to support our working capital requirements or for other purposes and may seek to raise additional funds through public or private equity or debt financing or from other sources 
if additional financing is needed  we can not assure you that such financing will be available to us on commercially reasonable terms or at all 
critical accounting policies and estimates the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect our reported assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to revenue recognition  accounts receivable  intangible assets and deferred income taxes 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
this forms the basis of judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies and the related judgments and estimates affect the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition we derive revenues from two primary sources software licenses and services  which include customer support  consulting and education 
we license our products through our direct sales force and indirectly through resellers 
we recognize revenue in accordance with the american institute of certified public accountants aicpa statement of position sop  software revenue recognition  and related interpretations  and sop modification of sop  software revenue recognition  with respect to certain transactions 
based on our reading and interpretation of sop and sop  we believe that our current sales contract terms and business arrangements have been properly reported 
the aicpa and its software revenue recognition task force continue to issue interpretations and guidance for applying the relevant standards to a wide range of sales contract terms and business arrangements that are prevalent in the software industry 
also  the securities and exchange commission sec has issued staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition in financial statements  which provides guidance related to revenue recognition based on interpretations and practices followed by the sec 
future interpretations of existing accounting standards or changes in our business practices could result in future changes in our revenue accounting policies that could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
revenues from sales of software licenses  which generally do not contain multiple elements  are recognized when we enter into a legally binding arrangement with a customer  we deliver the products  customer payment is deemed fixed or determinable and free of contingencies or significant uncertainties  and collection is probable 
if all the requirements of sop  sop and sab have not been met  revenue recognition is deferred until such items are known or resolved 
revenue from post sale customer support is deferred and recognized ratably over the term of the support contract 
revenues from consulting and training services are recognized as the services are performed 
for arrangements with multiple elements  we allocate revenue to each element of a transaction based upon its fair value as determined in reliance on vendor specific objective evidence 
vendor specific objective evidence of fair value for all elements of an arrangement is based upon the normal pricing and discounting practices for those products and services when sold separately 
if we cannot objectively determine the fair value of any undelivered element included in bundled software and service arrangements  we defer revenue until all elements are delivered  services have been performed or until fair value can objectively be determined 
accounts receivable we maintain allowances for sales returns and doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the unwillingness or inability of our customers to make required payments 
the amount of our reserves is based on historical experience and our analysis of the accounts receivable 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required which would result in an additional general and administrative expense in the period such determination was made 
additionally  if significant product performance issues were to arise resulting in the company accepting sales returns  additional allowances may be required which would result in a reduction of revenue in the period such determination was made 
the company s standard licensing agreement does not permit customers to return product except in situations where the product does not perform in accordance with established product requirements and the company is unable to remedy the outstanding issues 
while such amounts have historically been within our expectations and the provisions established  we cannot guarantee that we will continue to experience the same credit loss rates that we have in the past 
intangible assets in july  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 business combinations  and sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
sfas no 
requires all business combinations initiated after june  to be accounted for using the purchase method of accounting 
sfas no 
addresses financial accounting and reporting for acquired goodwill and other intangible assets 
we adopted sfas no 
at the beginning of the third quarter of and adopted sfas no 
at the beginning of the first quarter of as required by sfas no 
 we discontinued amortizing the remaining balances of goodwill as of the beginning of fiscal as a result  our annual amortization expense decreased approximately million 
all remaining and future acquired goodwill will be subject to impairment tests annually  or earlier if indicators of potential impairment exist  using a fair value based approach 
all other intangible assets will continue to be amortized over their estimated useful lives and assessed for impairment under sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
under sfas no 
 goodwill impairment is deemed to exist if the net book value of a reporting unit exceeds its estimated fair value 
in conjunction with the implementation of sfas no 
 we performed our initial impairment review and as a result determined that the carrying value of goodwill was less than the estimated fair value 
in calculating the fair value of the reporting units licenses and services  the market approach guideline company method was the methodology deemed the most reliable and used for impairment analysis 
we will perform subsequent annual impairment reviews during the fourth quarter of each year  or earlier if indicators of potential impairment exist 
future impairment reviews may result in charges against earnings to write down the value of goodwill 
purchased intangible assets are recorded at the appraised value and amortized using the straight line method over estimated useful lives of three years to six years 
the net carrying amount of purchased intangible assets was considered recoverable at december  we will continue to evaluate the value of our purchased intangible assets on a periodic basis 
recoverability of these assets is determined based upon the forecasted undiscounted future net cash flows from the operations to which the assets relate  utilizing our best estimates  appropriate assumptions and projections at the time 
these projected future cash flows may significantly vary over time as a result of increased competition  changes in technology  and fluctuations in demand 
in the event that in the future it is determined that the purchased intangible assets value has been impaired  an adjustment will be made resulting in a charge for the write down in the period in which the determination is made 
deferred taxes we recognize deferred income tax assets and liabilities based upon the differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and the tax bases of assets and liabilities 
such deferred income taxes primarily relate to the timing of the recognition of certain revenue items and the timing of the deductibility of certain reserves and accruals for income tax purposes 
we regularly review the deferred tax assets for recoverability and establish a valuation allowance when it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
if we are unable to generate sufficient future taxable income  or if there is a material change in the actual effective tax rates or time periods within which the underlying timing differences become taxable or deductible  we could be required to establish an additional valuation allowance against the deferred tax assets which could result in a substantial increase in our effective tax rate and have a materially adverse impact on our operating results 
recently issued accounting pronouncements in july  the fasb issued sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
sfas no 
addresses financial accounting and reporting for acquired goodwill and other intangible assets 
we adopted sfas no 
at the beginning of the first quarter of as required by sfas no 
 we discontinued amortizing the remaining balances of goodwill as of the beginning of fiscal all remaining and future acquired goodwill will be subject to impairment tests annually  or earlier if indicators of potential impairment exist  using a fair value based approach 
all other intangible assets will continue to be amortized over their estimated useful lives and assessed for impairment under sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
previously recognized workforce in place intangible assets were reclassified to goodwill effective january  refer to note of notes to our consolidated financial statements for adjusted net income loss for the years ended december  and under sfas no 
 goodwill impairment is deemed to exist if the net book value of a reporting unit exceeds its estimated fair value 
our reporting units are generally consistent with the operating segments underlying the reportable segments identified in note geographic and segment information 
in conjunction with the implementation of sfas no 
 we performed our initial impairment review as of january  and october  and as a result determined that the carrying value of goodwill was less than the estimated fair value 
in calculating the fair value of the reporting units licenses and services  the market approach guideline company method was the methodology deemed the most reliable and used for impairment analysis 
we will perform subsequent annual impairment reviews during the fourth quarter of each year  or earlier if indicators of potential impairment exist 
future impairment reviews may result in charges against earnings to write down the value of goodwill 
effective january   we adopted sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  which supersedes sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of 
this new statement also supersedes certain aspects of accounting principles board opinion apb  reporting the results of operations reporting the effects of disposal of a segment of a business  and extraordinary  unusual and infrequently occurring events and transactions  with regard to reporting the effects of a disposal of a segment of a business and will require expected future operating losses from discontinued operations to be reported in discontinued operations in the period incurred rather than as of the measurement date as presently required by apb 
in addition  more dispositions may qualify for discontinued operations treatment 
we adopted sfas no 
effective january  the adoption of sfas no 
did not have a significant impact on our financial position  results of operations  or cash flows 
in july  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities  which addresses financial accounting and reporting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities and emerging issues task force  liability recognition for certain employee termination benefits and other costs to exit an activity including certain costs incurred in a restructuring 
sfas no 
requires that costs associated with exit or disposal activities be recognized when they are incurred rather than at the date of a commitment to an exit or disposal plan 
sfas no 
also establishes that the liability should initially be measured and recorded at fair value 
we will apply the requirements of sfas no 
to exit activities initiated after december   as required 
in november  the fasb issued fasb interpretation no 
fin  guarantor s accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees  including indirect guarantees and indebtedness of others 
fin elaborates on the disclosures to be made by the guarantor in its interim and annual financial statements about its obligations under certain guarantees that it has issued 
it also requires that a guarantor recognize  at the inception of a guarantee  a liability for the fair value of the obligation undertaken in issuing the guarantee 
the initial recognition and measurement provisions of this interpretation are applicable on a prospective basis to guarantees issued or modified after december   while the provisions of the disclosure requirements are effective for financial statements of interim or annual reports ending after december  we adopted the disclosure provisions of fin during the fourth quarter of fiscal and such adoption did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
we are currently evaluating the recognition provisions of fin but expect that they will not have a material adverse impact on our consolidated results of operations or financial position upon adoption 
in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure 
sfas no 
amends sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  to provide alternative methods for voluntary transition to sfas no 
s fair value method of accounting for stock based employee compensation the fair value method 
sfas no 
also requires disclosure of the effects of an entity s accounting policy with respect to stock based employee compensation on reported net income loss and earnings loss per share in annual and interim financials statements 
the provisions of sfas no 
are effective in fiscal years ending after december  we are currently evaluating the provisions of sfas no 
but expect that they will not have a material adverse impact on our consolidated results of operations and financial position upon adoption since we have not adopted the fair value method 
however  should we be required to adopt the fair value method in the future  such adoption could have a material impact on our consolidated results of operations or financial position 
see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
in january  the fasb issued fasb interpretation no 
fin  consolidation of variable interest entities 
in general  a variable interest entity is a corporation  partnership  trust  or any other legal structure used for business purposes that either a does not have equity investors with voting rights or b has equity investors that do not provide sufficient financial resources for the entity to support its activities 
fin requires certain variable interest entities to be consolidated by the primary beneficiary of the entity if the investors do not have the characteristics of a controlling financial interest or do not have sufficient equity at risk for the entity to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support from other parties 
the consolidation requirements of fin apply immediately to variable interest entities created after january  the consolidation requirements apply to older entities in the first fiscal year or interim period beginning after june  certain of the disclosure requirements apply in all financial statements issued after january   regardless of when the variable interest entity was established 
since we currently have no variable interest entities  we expect that the adoption of the provisions of fin will not have a material adverse impact on our consolidated results of operations or financial position

these factors include the following the size and timing of customer orders 
see the size and timing of our customer orders may vary significantly from quarter to quarter which could cause fluctuations in our revenues 
the discretionary nature of our customers purchasing decisions and budget cycles  the timing of revenue recognition for sales of software products and services  the extent to which our customers renew their maintenance contracts with us  exposure to general economic conditions and reduced levels of corporate it spending  changes in our level of operating expenses and our ability to control costs  our ability to attain market acceptance of new products and services and enhancements to our existing products  changes in our pricing policies or the pricing policies of our competitors  the relative growth rates of competing operating system  database and application platforms  the unpredictability of the timing and level of sales through our indirect sales channels  costs related to acquisitions of technologies or businesses  including amortization costs for intangible assets with indefinite lives  and the timing of releases of new versions of third party software products that our products support or with which our products compete 
fluctuations in our results of operations are likely to affect the market price of our common stock and may not be related to or indicative of our long term performance 
the size and timing of our customer orders may vary significantly from quarter to quarter which could cause fluctuations in our revenues and operating results our license revenues in any quarter are substantially dependent on orders booked and shipped in that quarter 
our revenues in a given quarter could be adversely affected if we are unable to complete one or more large license agreements  or if the contract terms were to prevent us from recognizing revenue during that quarter 
the sales cycles for certain of our software products  such as vista plus and shareplex  can last from three to nine months and often require pre purchase evaluation periods and customer education 
also  we have often booked a large amount of our sales in the last month  weeks or days of each quarter and delays in the closing of sales near the end of a quarter could cause quarterly revenue to fall short of anticipated levels 
finally  while a portion of our revenues each quarter is recognized from previously deferred revenue  our quarterly performance will depend primarily upon entering into new contracts to generate revenues for that quarter 
these factors may cause significant periodic variation in our license revenues 
in addition  we incur or commit to operating expenses based on anticipated revenue levels  and generally do not know whether revenues in any quarter will meet expectations until the end of that quarter 
accordingly  if our revenue growth rates slow or our revenues decline  our operating results could be seriously impaired because many of our expenses are relatively fixed in nature and cannot be easily or quickly changed 
general economic conditions and reduced levels of corporate it spending may continue to affect revenue growth rates and impact our business our business and operating results are subject to the effects of changes in general economic conditions 
recent unfavorable economic conditions have resulted in continued reduced corporate it spending in the industries that we serve and a softening of demand for computer software  not only in the database and application market segments we support but also in the product segment in which we compete 
if these economic conditions do not improve  or we experience continued deterioration in general economic conditions or further reduced corporate it spending  our business and operating results could continue to be adversely impacted 
many of our products are dependent on oracle s technologies  if oracle s technologies lose market share or become incompatible with our products  the demand for our products could suffer we believe that our success has depended in part  and will continue to depend in part for the foreseeable future  upon our relationship with oracle and our status as a complementary software provider for oracle s database and application products 
many versions of our products  including shareplex and sqlab vision  are specifically designed to be used with oracle databases 
although a number of our products work with other environments  our competitive advantage consists in substantial part on the integration between our products and oracle s products  and our extensive knowledge of oracle s technology 
currently  a significant portion of our total revenues is derived from products that specifically support oracle based products 
if oracle for any reason decides to promote technologies and standards that are not compatible with our technology  or if oracle loses market share for its database products  our business  operating results and financial condition would be materially adversely affected 
many of our products are vulnerable to direct competition from oracle we compete with oracle in the market for database management solutions and the competitive pressure continues to increase 
we expect that oracle s commitment to and presence in the database management product market will increase in the future and therefore substantially increase competitive pressures 
we believe that oracle will continue to incorporate database management technology into its server software offerings  possibly at no additional cost to its users 
we believe that oracle will also continue to enhance its database management technology 
furthermore  oracle could attempt to increase its presence in this market by acquiring or forming strategic alliances with our competitors  and oracle may be in better position to withstand and respond to the current factors impacting this industry 
oracle has a longer operating history  a larger installed base of customers and substantially greater financial  distribution  marketing and technical resources than we do 
in addition  oracle has well established relationships with many of our present and potential customers 
as a result  we may not be able to compete effectively with oracle in the future  which could materially adversely affect our business  operating results and financial condition 
our success depends on our ability to develop new and enhanced products that achieve widespread market acceptance our future success depends on our ability to address the rapidly changing needs of our customers by developing and introducing new products  product updates and services on a timely basis  by extending the operation of our products on new platforms and by keeping pace with technological developments and emerging industry standards 
in order to grow our business  we are committing substantial resources to developing software products and services for the applications management market 
if this market does not continue to develop as anticipated  or demand for our products in this market does not materialize or occurs more slowly than we expect  or if our development efforts are delayed or unsuccessful  we will have expended substantial resources and capital without realizing sufficient revenues  and our business and operating results could be adversely affected 
acquisitions of companies or technologies may result in disruptions to our business and diversion of management attention we have in the past made and we expect to continue to make acquisitions of complementary companies  products or technologies  including our recent acquisition of sitraka  inc in november any additional acquisitions will require us to assimilate the operations  products and personnel of the acquired businesses and train  retain and motivate key personnel from the acquired businesses 
we may be unable to maintain uniform standards  controls  procedures and policies if we fail in these efforts 
similarly  acquisitions may subject us to liabilities and risks that are not known or identifiable at the time of the acquisition or may cause disruptions in our operations and divert management s attention from day to day operations  which could impair our relationships with our current employees  customers and strategic partners 
we may have to use cash  incur debt or issue equity securities to pay for any future acquisitions 
use of cash or debt may affect our liquidity and use of cash would reduce our cash reserves 
the issuance of equity securities for any acquisition could be substantially dilutive to our shareholders 
in addition  our profitability may suffer because of acquisition related costs or amortization costs for intangible assets with indefinite useful lives 
in consummating acquisitions  we are also subject to risks of entering geographic and business markets in which we have no or limited prior experience 
also  we may determine that the acquired company  product or technology does not further our business strategy or that the company  product or technology is ultimately worth less than the price we paid  either of which could generate a future impairment charge 
if we are unable to fully integrate acquired businesses  products or technologies with our existing operations  we may not receive the intended benefits of acquisition 
our past and future growth may strain our management  administrative  operational and financial infrastructure we have recently experienced a period of rapid growth in our operations that has placed and will continue to place a strain on our management  administrative  operational and financial infrastructure 
during this period  we have experienced an increase in the number of our employees  increasing demands on our operating and financial systems and personnel  and an expansion in the geographic coverage of our operations 
our ability to manage our operations and growth requires us to continue to improve our operational  financial and management controls  and reporting systems and procedures 
we may need to expand our facilities or relocate some or all of our employees or operations from time to time to support growth 
these relocations could result in temporary disruptions of our operations or a diversion of management s attention and resources 
in addition  we will be required to hire additional management  financial and sales and marketing personnel to manage our expanding operations 
if we are unable to manage this growth effectively  our business  operating results and financial condition may be materially adversely affected 
we may not generate increased business from our current customers  which could slow our revenue growth in the future most of our customers initially make a purchase of our products for a single department or location 
many of these customers may choose not to expand their use of our products 
if we fail to generate expanded business from our current customers  our business  operating results and financial condition could be materially adversely affected 
in addition  as we deploy new modules and features for our existing products or introduce new products  our current customers may choose not to purchase this new functionality or these new products 
moreover  if customers elect not to renew their maintenance agreements  our service revenues would be materially adversely affected 
our international operations and our planned expansion of our international operations expose us to certain risks we continue to expand our international sales activities as part of our business strategy 
as a result  we face increasing risks from our international operations  including  among others difficulties in staffing and managing foreign operations  longer payment cycles  seasonal reductions in business activity in europe  increased financial accounting and reporting burdens and complexities  potentially adverse tax consequences  potential loss of proprietary information due to piracy  misappropriation or weaker laws regarding intellectual property protection  delays in localizing our products and licensing programs  political unrest or terrorism  particularly in areas in which we have facilities  compliance with a wide variety of complex foreign laws and treaties  and licenses  tariffs and other trade barriers and regulatory consequences 
in addition  because our international subsidiaries generally conduct business in the currency of the country in which they operate  our exposure to exchange rate fluctuations  which are outside of our control  will increase as our international operations expand 
we have not yet entered into any hedging transactions to mitigate exposure to foreign currency fluctuations 
operating in international markets also requires significant management attention and financial resources and will place additional burdens on our management  administrative  operational and financial infrastructure 
we cannot be certain that our investments in establishing facilities in other countries will produce desired levels of revenue or profitability 
in addition  we have limited experience in developing localized versions of our products and marketing and distributing them internationally 
failure to develop strategic relationships could harm our business by denying us selling opportunities and other benefits from time to time  we have collaborated with other companies  including hewlett packard and oracle and certain major system integrators  in areas such as product development  marketing  distribution and implementation 
our current collaborative relationships may not prove to be beneficial to us  and they may not be sustained 
we also may not be able to enter into successful new strategic relationships in the future  which could have a material adverse effect on our business  operating results and financial condition 
we could lose sales opportunities if we fail to work effectively with these parties 
moreover  we expect that maintaining and enhancing these and other relationships will become a more meaningful part of our business strategy in the future 
however  many of our current partners are either actual or potential competitors with us 
in addition  many of these third parties also work with competing software companies and we may not be able to maintain these existing relationships  due to the fact that these relationships are informal or  if written  are terminable with little or no notice 
failure to adequately protect our intellectual property rights could harm our competitive position our success and ability to compete are dependent on our ability to develop and maintain the proprietary aspects of our technology 
we generally rely on a combination of trademark  trade secret  patent  copyright law and contractual restrictions to protect the proprietary aspects of our technology 
despite our efforts to protect our proprietary rights  unauthorized parties may attempt to copy aspects of our products or to obtain and use information that we regard as proprietary 
litigation may be necessary in the future to enforce our intellectual property rights  to protect our trade secrets  and to determine the validity and scope of the proprietary rights of others 
any such resulting litigation  whether successful or unsuccessful  could result in substantial costs and diversion of management and financial resources  which could harm our business 
our means of protecting our proprietary rights may prove to be inadequate and competitors may independently develop similar or superior technology 
policing unauthorized use of our products is difficult  and we cannot be certain that the steps we have taken will prevent misappropriation of our technology  particularly in foreign countries where the laws may not protect our proprietary rights as fully as in the united states 
we also believe that  because of the rapid rate of technological change in the software industry  trade secret and copyright protection are less significant than factors such as the knowledge  ability and experience of our employees  frequent product enhancements and the timeliness and quality of customer support services 
third parties may claim that our software products or services infringe on their intellectual property rights  exposing us to litigation that  regardless of merit  may be costly to defend our success and ability to compete are also dependent on our ability to operate without infringing upon the proprietary rights of others 
third parties may claim that our current or future products infringe their intellectual property rights 
any such claim  with our without merit  could have a significant effect on our business and financial results 
see legal proceedings in part i  item  of this report  for information concerning copyright infringement and trade secret misappropriation claims recently initiated against quest by computer associates international  inc this and any future third party claim could be time consuming  divert management s attention from our business operations and result in substantial litigation costs  including any monetary damages and customer indemnification obligations  which may result from such claims 
in addition  parties making these claims may be able to obtain injunctive or other equitable relief affecting our ability to license the products that incorporate the challenged intellectual property 
as a result of such claims  we may be required to obtain licenses from third parties  develop alternative technology or redesign our products 
we cannot be sure that such licenses would be available on terms acceptable to us  if at all 
if a successful claim is made against us and we are unable to develop or license alternative technology  our business and financial results and position could be materially adversely affected 
our business will suffer if our software contains errors the software products we offer are inherently complex 
despite testing and quality control  we cannot be certain that errors will not be found in current versions  new versions or enhancements of our products after commencement of commercial shipments 
significant technical challenges also arise with our products because our customers purchase and deploy our products across a variety of computer platforms and integrate it with a number of third party software applications and databases 
if new or existing customers have difficulty deploying our products or require significant amounts of customer support  our operating margins could be harmed 
moreover  we could face possible claims and higher development costs if our software contains undetected errors or if we fail to meet our customers expectations 
as a result of the foregoing  we could experience loss of or delay in revenues and loss of market share  loss of customers  damage to our reputation  failure to achieve market acceptance  diversion of development resources  increased service and warranty costs  legal actions by customers against us which could  whether or not successful  increase costs and distract our management  and increased insurance costs 
in addition  a product liability claim  whether or not successful  could harm our business by increasing our costs and distracting our management 
we incorporate software licensed from third parties into some of our products and any significant interruption in the availability of these third party software products or defects in these products could reduce the demand for  or prevent the shipping of  our products certain of our software products contain components developed and maintained by third party software vendors 
we expect that we may have to incorporate software from third party vendors in our future products 
we may not be able to replace the functionality provided by the third party software currently offered with our products if that software becomes obsolete  defective or incompatible with future versions of our products or is not adequately maintained or updated 
any significant interruption in the availability of these third party software products or defects in these products could harm our sales unless and until we can secure an alternative source 
although we believe there are adequate alternate sources for the technology licensed to us  such alternate sources may not provide us with the same functionality as that currently provided to us 
natural disasters or power outages could disrupt our business a substantial portion of our operations are located in california  and we are subject to risks of damage and business disruptions resulting from earthquakes  floods and similar events  as well as from power outages 
we have in the past experienced limited and temporary power losses in our california facilities due to power shortages  and we expect in the future to experience additional power losses 
while the impact to our business and operating results has not been material  we cannot assure you that power losses will not adversely affect our business in the future  or that the cost of acquiring sufficient power to run our business will not increase significantly 
since we do not have sufficient redundancy in our networking infrastructure  a natural disaster or other unanticipated problem could have an adverse effect on our business  including both our internal operations and our ability to communicate with our customers or sell and deliver our products 
risks related to our industry the demand for our products will depend on our ability to adapt to rapid technological change our future success will depend on our ability to continue to enhance our current products and to develop and introduce new products on a timely basis that keep pace with technological developments and satisfy increasingly sophisticated customer requirements 
rapid technological change  frequent new product introductions and enhancements  uncertain product life cycles  changes in customer demands and evolving industry standards characterize the market for our products and services 
the introduction of products embodying new technologies and the emergence of new industry standards can render our existing products obsolete and unmarketable 
as a result of the complexities inherent in today s computing environments and the performance demanded by customers for embedded databases and web based products  new products and product enhancements can require long development and testing periods 
as a result  significant delays in the general availability of such new releases or significant problems in the installation or implementation of such new releases could have a material adverse effect on our business  operating results and financial condition 
we may not be successful in developing and marketing  on a timely and cost effective basis  new products or new product enhancements that respond to technological change  evolving industry standards or customer requirements  avoiding difficulties that could delay or prevent the successful development  introduction or marketing of these products  or achieving market acceptance for our new products and product enhancements 
we may not be able to attract and retain personnel our future success depends on the continued service of our executive officers and other key administrative  sales and marketing and support personnel  many of whom have recently joined our company 
in addition  the success of our business is substantially dependent on the services of our chief executive officer and other executive officers 
there has in the past been and there may in the future be a shortage of personnel that possess the technical background necessary to sell  support and develop our products effectively 
competition for skilled personnel is intense  and we may not be able to attract  assimilate or retain highly qualified personnel in the future 
our business may not be able to grow if we cannot attract qualified personnel 
hiring qualified sales  marketing  administrative  research and development and customer support personnel is very competitive in our industry  particularly in southern california where quest is headquartered 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk s we transact business in a number of different foreign countries around the world 
in most instances  revenues are collected and operating expenses are paid in the local currency of the country in which we are transacting 
accordingly  we are exposed to incremental volatility in sales and earnings within these countries due to fluctuations in foreign exchange rates 
our exposure to foreign exchange risk is directly proportional to the magnitude of foreign net profits and losses denominated in currencies other than the us dollar  as well as our net foreign investment in us dollar assets 
these exposures have the potential to produce either gains or losses 
our cumulative currency gains or losses in any given period are typically lessened by the economic benefits of diversification and low correlation between different currencies  but there can be no assurance that this pattern will continue to be true in future periods 
the foreign currencies to which we currently have the most significant exposure are the canadian dollar  the british pound  the euro and the australian dollar 
based on our overall currency rate exposure at december   a ten percent change in currency rates would not have a material effect on our consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
to date  we have not used derivative financial instruments to hedge our foreign exchange exposures  nor do we use such instruments for speculative trading purposes 
we regularly monitor the potential cost benefit of hedging foreign exchange exposures with derivatives and there remains the possibility that our foreign exchange hedging practices could change accordingly in time 
interest rate risk our exposure to market interest rate risk relates primarily to our investment portfolio 
we have not used derivative financial instruments to hedge the market risks of our investments 
we place our investments with high quality issuers and  by policy  limit the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer other than the united states government and its agencies 
our investments in marketable securities consist primarily of investment grade bonds and united states government and agency securities 
investments purchased with an original maturity of three months or less are considered to be cash equivalents 
we classify all of our investments as available for sale 
available for sale securities are carried at fair value  with unrealized gains and losses  net of tax  reported in a separate component of shareholders equity 
information about our investment portfolio is presented in the table below  which states the amortized book value and related weighted average interest rates by year of maturity in thousands amortized book value weighted average rate investments maturing by december  thereafter total portfolio we maintain a level of cash and cash equivalents such that we have generally been able to hold our investments to maturity 
accordingly  changes in the market interest rate would not have a material effect on the fair value of such investments
