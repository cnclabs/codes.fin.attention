item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview entegris  inc is a leading provider of materials integrity management products and services that protect and transport the critical materials used in key technology driven industries 
entegris derives most of its revenue from the sale of products and services to the semiconductor and data storage industries 
the company s customers consist primarily of semiconductor manufacturers  semiconductor equipment and materials suppliers  and hard disk manufacturers which are served through direct sales efforts  as well as sales and distribution relationships  in the united states  asia and europe 
the company s fiscal year is a or week period ending on the last saturday of august 
the last three fiscal years ended on the following dates august   august  and august  fiscal years and included weeks  while fiscal comprised weeks 
fiscal years are identified in this report according to the calendar year in which they end 
for example  the fiscal year ended august  is alternatively referred to as fiscal or forward looking statements the information in this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  except for the historical information  contains forward looking statements 
these statements are subject to risks and uncertainties 
these forward looking statements could differ materially from actual results 
the company assumes no obligation to publicly release the results of any revision or updates to these forward looking statements to reflect future events or unanticipated occurrences 
this discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and the related notes  which are included elsewhere in this report 
critical accounting policies management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are based upon the company s consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires the company to make estimates  assumptions and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
at each balance sheet date  management evaluates its estimates  including  but not limited to  those related to accounts receivable  warranty and sales return obligations  inventories  long lived assets  and income taxes 
the company bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
the critical accounting policies affected significantly by estimates  assumptions and judgments used in the preparation of the company s consolidated financial statements are discussed below 
allowance for doubtful accounts and other accounts receivable related valuation accounts 
the company maintains an allowance for doubtful accounts as well as reserves for sales returns and allowances  and warranty claims 
significant management judgments and estimates must be made and used in connection with establishing these valuation accounts 
material differences could result in the amount and timing of the company s results of operations for any period if we made different judgments or utilized different estimates 
in addition  actual results could be different from the company s current estimates  possibly resulting in increased future charges to earnings 
the company provides an allowance for doubtful accounts for all individual receivables judged to be unlikely for collection 
for all other accounts receivable  the company records an allowance for doubtful accounts based on a combination of factors 
specifically  management analyzes the age of receivable balances  historical bad debts write off experience  industry and geographic concentrations of customers  general customer creditworthiness and current economic trends when determining its allowance for doubtful accounts 
the company s allowance for doubtful accounts was million at both august  and august  a reserve for sales returns and allowances is established based on historical trends and current trends in product returns 
at august  and august   the company s reserve for sales returns and allowances was million and million  respectively 
the company records a liability for estimated warranty claims 
the amount of the accrual is based on historical claims data by product group and other factors 
claims could be materially different from actual results for a variety of reasons  
index to financial statements including a change in the company s warranty policy in response to industry trends  competition or other external forces  manufacturing changes that could impact product quality  or as yet unrecognized defects in products sold 
at august  and august   the company s accrual for estimated future warranty costs was million and million  respectively 
the increase mainly reflected the assumption of million in liabilities made in connection with a fiscal acquisition 
inventory valuation the company uses certain estimates and judgments to properly value inventory 
in general  the company s inventories are recorded at the lower of manufacturing cost or market value 
each quarter  the company evaluates its ending inventories for obsolescence and excess quantities 
this evaluation includes analyses of inventory levels  historical write off trends  expected product lives  sales levels by product and projections of future sales demand 
inventories that are considered obsolete are written off 
in addition  reserves are established for inventory quantities in excess of forecasted demand 
at august  and august   inventory reserves were million and million  respectively 
the company s inventories comprise materials and products subject to technological obsolescence which are sold in highly competitive markets and industries 
if future demand or market conditions are less favorable than current analyses  additional inventory write downs or reserves may be required and would be reflected in cost of sales in the period the revision is made 
impairment of long lived assets the company routinely considers whether indicators of impairment of its property and equipment assets  particularly its molding equipment  are present 
if such indicators are present  it is determined whether the sum of the estimated undiscounted cash flows attributable to the assets in question is less than their carrying value 
if less  an impairment loss is recognized based on the excess of the carrying amount of the assets over their respective fair values 
fair value is determined by discounted estimated future cash flows  appraisals or other methods deemed appropriate 
if the assets determined to be impaired are to be held and used  the company recognizes an impairment charge to the extent the present value of anticipated net cash flows attributable to the asset are less than the asset s carrying value 
the fair value of the asset then becomes the asset s new carrying value  which we depreciate over the remaining estimated useful life of the asset 
the company assesses the impairment of intangible assets and related goodwill at least annually  or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
factors considered important which could trigger an impairment review  and potentially an impairment charge  include the following significant underperformance relative to historical or projected future operating results  significant changes in the manner of use of the acquired assets or the company s overall business strategy  significant negative industry or economic trends  and significant decline in the company s stock price for a sustained period changing the company s market capitalization relative to its net book value  the company s marketable equity securities are periodically reviewed to determine if declines in fair value below cost basis are other than temporary  requiring an impairment loss to be recorded and the investment written down to a new cost basis 
at august   the company s investment in metron technology nv common stock had a carrying value of million with a fair value of million 
income taxes in the preparation of the company s consolidated financial statements  management is required to estimate income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which the company operates 
this process involves estimating actual current tax exposures together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items for tax and accounting purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included in the company s consolidated balance sheet 
the company has significant amounts of deferred tax assets 
management reviews its deferred tax assets for recoverability on a quarterly basis and assesses the need for valuation allowances 
these deferred tax assets are evaluated by considering historical levels of income  estimates of future taxable income streams and the impact of tax planning strategies 
a valuation allowance is recorded to reduce deferred tax assets when it is determined that it is more likely than not that the company would not be able to realize all or part of its deferred tax assets 
at august   the company carried no valuation allowance against its net deferred tax assets  while at august   the company carried a valuation allowance of million against its net deferred tax assets with respect to certain foreign net operating loss carryforwards 
the adjustment to decrease the deferred tax asset valuation allowance was recorded as the company determined that it was more likely than not that entegris would be able to realize all of its remaining net deferred tax assets in the future 

index to financial statements results of operations the following table sets forth the relationship between various components of operations  stated as a percent of net sales  for fiscal year  and the company s historical financial data were derived from its audited consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this annual report 
percent of net sales net sales cost of sales gross profit selling  general and administrative expenses engineering  research and development expenses other charges operating loss profit interest income  net other expense income  net loss income before income taxes and other items below income tax benefit expense equity in net loss income of affiliates minority interest net income fiscal compared to fiscal net sales net sales increased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal the increase reflected some improvement in the difficult business conditions that have affected the semiconductor industry since the latter half of fiscal in addition  sales from acquired businesses and improved sales associated with the company s efforts to expand its materials integrity management expertise into new applications and new markets resulted in improved sales 
the following table summarizes total net sales by markets served for and  along with the year to year percentage change in thousands percent change net sales semiconductor data storage services other unit driven sales for the full fiscal year were approximately in  compared to about in products associated with capital spending accounted for about of total sales in the semiconductor market generated about of the company s overall sales for  compared to about in the prior year 
sales of semiconductor products rose by from to sales for the company s microenvironment products doubled over the prior year  which included sales from the wafer and reticle carrier product line acquired in the second quarter 
this factor accounted for most of the overall increase in semiconductor market sales 
sales of wafer handling process products fell slightly year over year  as did sales of chemical containers 
the company s data storage products accounted for about of consolidated net sales in  compared to a year ago 
key customers in the industry implemented form factor and process changes during the latter part of  the major factor behind the increase in sales 

index to financial statements service business revenue  which accounted for about of entegris overall sales  rose compared to fiscal this increase reflects growth in both the company s sales of equipment  used to clean wafer and disk carriers and shipping products  and sales of its on and off site cleaning services 
about of overall sales for the year were generated in the life science market 
sales increased by from fiscal  about three quarters of which was due to sales recorded by electrol specialties  a market leader in clean in place technology  which was acquired by the company in january on a geographic basis  entegris total sales in north america were  in asia pacific  in europe and in japan 
year to year sales comparisons saw solid sales gains in europe  japan and asia pacific with essentially flat sales reported for north america 
based on current order rates  industry analyst expectations and other information  the company expects that sales for the first quarter of fiscal will be down slightly from sales levels experienced in the fourth quarter of fiscal however  industry volatility and uncertain market conditions make it difficult to forecast for future quarters 
gross profit gross profit in fiscal increased to million  compared to million in fiscal fiscal gross margin was  compared to in with the increase in sales from to  the company typically would have expected a higher gross margin for the year 
however  several factors combined to offset the benefit of the higher utilization of the company s production capacity  many of them significantly affecting the company in the fourth quarter 
during the fourth quarter  the company began the process of moving its manufacturing to a build to order model  which enabled the reduction of inventory 
however  these actions led to significant under absorption of fixed manufacturing costs during the quarter  accounting for approximately million in reduced gross profit 
among other factors was the consolidation of several facilities as the company moved its polymer material manufacturing operation from texas to malaysia  relocated its upland  california operations to chaska  minnesota and consolidated its cleaning equipment operations into the gilroy  california service center 
fiscal also included transition costs of approximately million related to the integration of the wafer and reticle carrier product line acquisition 
also negatively influencing margins were stronger sales in services and life sciences  two of the company s new markets  where gross margins for such products and services are below those of the semiconductor and data storage markets 
partly offsetting the declines was the benefit of the company s actions in reducing fixed costs and increasing manufacturing efficiencies associated with the closure of manufacturing plants  investing in automation  continuing process improvements and instituting manufacturing centers of excellence 
as discussed above  the company does not provide guidance about fiscal sales levels 
however  in general  gross profit and gross margin variances mainly track the utilization of the company s production capacity associated with varying sales levels 
selling  general and administrative expenses sg a sg a expenses increased by million  or  to million in fiscal from million in fiscal sg a costs  as a percent of net sales  decreased to from with the impact of higher sg a expenses more than offset by the effect of higher net sales 
the year to year increase in sg a expenses is due to a number of factors  including higher sales commissions  incentive compensation and amortization expense 
in addition  fiscal included costs associated with the company s two acquisitions  and the transition to a direct sales model in japan for certain products previously sold under a distribution relationship 
other charges during the first quarter of fiscal  the company recorded a pre tax charge of million related to the relocation of its upland  california operations and certain workforce reductions 
the charge included million in termination costs related to a workforce reduction of approximately employees  million for estimated losses for asset impairment and million for future lease commitments on the upland facility 
the company recorded a pre tax benefit of million in the fourth quarter of associated with the favorable settlement of a portion of the future lease commitments included in the aforementioned charge 

index to financial statements in  the company s results included a charge of million in connection with the closure of its chanhassen  mn plant 
the charge included million in termination costs related to a workforce reduction of employees and million for estimated losses for asset impairment 
the company recorded pre tax benefits of million and million in the third quarter and fourth quarters of  respectively  associated with the reversal of previous accruals related to plant closures in and approximately million of the reversals was associated with the favorable settlement of future lease commitments on the castle rock facility  for which the company had recorded accruals in lower than expected impairment costs accounted for approximately million of the reversals 
as of august   million remained outstanding in connection with the aforementioned charges and are primarily related to severance payments of million  which run through may  and lease commitments of million  which run through july engineering  research and development expenses er d er d expenses increased to million  or of net sales  in as compared to million  or of net sales  in the company s er d activities continue to focus on the support of current product lines  and the development of new products and manufacturing technologies 
the company s er d expenses for the last half of the year included million related to the addition of employees hired in connection with the company s second quarter acquisition of asyst technologies  inc s wafer and reticle carrier product lines 
interest income  net the company reported net interest income of million in compared to million in the decline reflects the significantly lower rates of interest available on the company s investments in short term debt securities compared to the year ago period as well as slightly lower invested balances 
other expense income  net other expense was million in fiscal compared to other income million in fiscal other expense in included an impairment loss of million  or million after tax  related to the write down of the company s equity investment in metron technology nv common stock 
the company  a founding shareholder of metron  owned about million shares of metron common stock throughout prior to the impairment charge  the company s investment in metron technology nv common stock had a carrying value of million 
at november   the fair value of the investment was million  based on a price of per share  the closing price of metron at the end of the first quarter 
the decline in fair value was determined to be other than temporary 
accordingly  an impairment loss of million was recorded and the investment in metron common stock written down to a new carrying value of million 
other income in consisted primarily of the foreign currency gains  with about million associated with the realization of translation gains realized upon the liquidation of the company s korean entity 
income tax benefit the company recorded an income tax benefit of million for fiscal compared to an income tax benefit of million in fiscal the income tax benefit for fiscal includes one time benefits of million from the redetermination of prior years taxes  million from the reversal of a valuation allowance on the net operating loss carryforwards of certain non us subsidiaries  and million related to the impairment loss recorded on the company s investment in metron stock 
the reversal of the valuation allowance was based on a partial realization of the net operating loss carryforwards during fiscal and the current belief that sufficient taxable earnings will be generated in the future to allow the remaining net operating losses to be utilized 
the income tax benefit for fiscal included a one time benefit of million related to the repatriation of earnings from certain non us subsidiaries 
the effective tax rate for fiscal was compared to in fiscal the difference between the fiscal effective tax rate of and the us statutory rate of is primarily due to the one time benefits described above  lower taxes on foreign operations  a tax benefit associated with export activities and a tax benefit associated with r d activities 
the company expects an effective tax rate of about in fiscal equity in net loss of affiliates the company s equity in the net loss of affiliates was million in and represents the company s share of losses in entities accounted for under the equity method of accounting 
no equity in the net earnings of affiliates was recorded in fiscal as the company did not have entities under the equity method of accounting during that period 

index to financial statements minority interest the company recorded no minority interest in as all of its consolidated subsidiaries are presently owned 
for fiscal  the minority interest in subsidiaries net loss was million  reflecting the net losses of the company s formerly owned japanese subsidiaries  which became owned in february net income the company recorded net income of million  or per diluted share  in fiscal  compared to net income of million  or per diluted share  in the year ago period 
fiscal compared to fiscal net sales net sales were million in fiscal  down from million in fiscal the decline reflected the continuation of weakened business conditions in the semiconductor industry that began in the second half of fiscal  as the semiconductor industry experienced unprecedented deterioration in market conditions  with rapidly falling rates of factory utilization and reduced capital spending 
the sales decrease was attributable to softer demand for both fluid handling products  which generally depend on capital spending levels  and microelectronics products  which also depend on the utilization at semiconductor manufacturing facilities 
although the company reported sequentially higher quarterly sales as fiscal progressed  fourth quarter revenues were still significantly below the record levels experienced in the first half of fiscal sales to the semiconductor market were down from fiscal  while accounting for about of entegris sales 
sales of the company s data storage products in were down from a year ago  making up of total sales 
service business revenue  which accounted for about of entegris overall sales in  nearly tripled from levels 
this increase mainly reflected the full year inclusion of sales from acquisitions made in late fiscal revenue declines were recorded in all geographic regions  with approximately year to year declines experienced for north america  europe and japan  while sales to the asia pacific region fell just 
overall  international sales accounted for approximately of net sales in fiscal  up from in fiscal fiscal sales were to north america  to asia pacific  to europe and to japan 
gross profit gross profit in fiscal decreased to million  compared to million in fiscal the company s gross margin for fiscal was compared to for fiscal gross margin and gross profit declines were reported by both domestic and international operations 
the drop in fiscal figures was primarily caused by the lower sales levels noted above  which resulted in lower factory utilization 
gross profit levels generally improved throughout the year as sales increased sequentially by quarter 
partly offsetting the declines was the benefit of the company s actions in reducing costs and increasing manufacturing efficiencies associated with the closure of manufacturing plants  investing in automation  changing process flows and instituting manufacturing centers of excellence 
the company also recorded lower asset impairment charges in  incurring charges of million and million in and  respectively  mainly for asset write offs of molds 
selling  general and administrative expenses sg a sg a expenses decreased million  or  to million in fiscal from million in fiscal the decline was primarily due to significantly lower incentive compensation and charitable contribution accruals  which are based on the company s results of operations  offset partly by increased expenditures for information systems and the continued building of the company s global infrastructure which began in fiscal sg a costs  as a percent of net sales  increased to from with the impact of lower sg a expenses more than offset by the effect of lower net sales 
other charges in the first quarter of  the company s results included a nonrecurring charge of million in connection with the closures of the company s chanhassen  mn plant 
the charge included million in termination costs related to a workforce reduction of employees and million for estimated losses for asset impairment 
the company recorded pre tax benefits of million and million in the third quarter and fourth quarters of  respectively  associated with the reversal of previous accruals related to plant closures in and approximately million of the reversals was associated with the favorable settlement of future lease commitments on the castle rock facility  for which the company had recorded accruals in lower than expected impairment costs accounted for approximately million of the reversals 

index to financial statements operating results in fiscal included two nonrecurring charges 
in fiscal  the company recorded a charge of million related to the early termination of a distribution agreement and a million charge in connection with the closing of its castle rock  colorado and munmak  korea facilities 
as of august   million remained outstanding in connection with the aforementioned charges 
engineering  research and development expenses er d er d expenses increased to million  or of net sales  in fiscal as compared to million  or of net sales  in fiscal in fiscal  the company s expenditures were focused on supporting current product lines  developing new manufacturing technologies and developing next generation products for new and existing markets 
interest income  net the company reported net interest income of million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal the change reflects the significantly lower rates of interest earned on cash equivalents and short term investments and a shift in the mix of such investments towards tax exempt debt securities 
other income  net other income was million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal other income in fiscal consisted primarily of the foreign currency gains  with about million associated with the realization of translation gains from the liquidation of the company s korean entity  while other income in fiscal included foreign currency translation gains offset by losses on sales of property and equipment 
income tax expense benefit the company recorded an income tax benefit of million for fiscal compared to income tax expense of million in fiscal the effective tax rate for fiscal was compared to in fiscal the variance primarily reflects the significant difference in the company s pre tax operating results 
the income tax benefit in fiscal includes a one time benefit of million related to the repatriation of earnings from certain non us subsidiaries  while income tax expense in fiscal includes a million tax benefit associated with the closure of the company s korean manufacturing operations  losses of which were previously non deductible 
equity in net income of affiliates the company recorded no equity in the net income of affiliates in fiscal compared to million in fiscal  all of which was recorded in the first half of that fiscal year 
this reflected the change in accounting for the company s investment in metron technology nv metron  which was recorded under the equity method of accounting through the second quarter of fiscal at which time the company began accounting for its remaining investment as an available for sale equity security  as its percentage ownership in metron was reduced from to 
minority interest for fiscal  the minority interest in subsidiaries net loss was million  reflecting the operating losses of the company s formerly owned japanese subsidiaries in the first half of the year 
the company purchased the minority interests in these entities in february this compares to minority interest in subsidiaries net income of million for fiscal net income net income decreased to million  or per share diluted  in fiscal  compared to net income of million  or per share diluted  in fiscal quarterly results of operations the following table presents selected data from the company s consolidated statements of operations for the eight quarters ended august  this unaudited information has been prepared on the same basis as the audited consolidated financial statements appearing elsewhere in this annual report

in the third and fourth quarters of  the company recorded pre tax benefits of million and million  respectively  associated with the reversal of aforementioned pretax charges related to plant closures 
also in the third quarter of  the company recognized a one time tax benefit of million 
our quarterly results of operations have been  and will likely continue to be  subject to significant fluctuations due to a variety of factors  a number of which are beyond the company s control 
liquidity and capital resources the company has historically financed its operations and capital requirements through cash flow from operating activities  long term loans  lease financing and borrowings under domestic and international short term lines of credit 
in fiscal  entegris raised capital via an initial public offering 
operating activities cash flow provided by operating activities totaled million  million and million in fiscal  and  respectively 
cash flow provided by operating activities in mainly reflected nominal net earnings adjusted for noncash charges  including depreciation and amortization of million and an impairment loss of million on the company s equity investment in metron technology 
in addition  the company s operating cash flows benefited from decreases in inventory of million and income tax related accounts of million  and a million increase in accounts payable and accrued liabilities 
partially offsetting these items was an increase in accounts receivable of million  resulting from higher sales levels  particularly in japan where receivables typically carry longer terms than elsewhere 
other changes to working capital accounts were relatively minor for the company 
working capital stood at million at august   including million in cash and cash equivalents  and short term investments of million 

index to financial statements investing activities cash flow used in investing activities totaled million  million and million in  and  respectively 
acquisition of property and equipment totaled million  million and million in  and  respectively 
capital expenditures in included investments in manufacturing  computer and laboratory equipment 
the company expects capital expenditures during fiscal will be in the range of to million  consisting mainly of spending on manufacturing equipment  tooling and information systems 
acquisition of businesses totaled million  million and million in  and  respectively 
the company completed two transactions in in january  the company purchased the assets of electrol specialties company esc  a leader in clean in place technology 
in february  the company purchased the wafer and reticle carrier product lines of asyst technologies  inc goodwill and identifiable intangible assets of million and million  respectively  were recorded in connection with the acquisitions 
each of the above transactions was accounted for by the purchase method 
accordingly  the company s consolidated financial statements include the net assets and results of operations from the dates of acquisition 
the company had maturities  net of purchases  of debt securities classified as short term investments of million during the company made purchases  net of maturities  of million and million of short term investments in and  respectively 
short term investments stood at million at august  financing activities cash provided by financing activities totaled million  million and million in fiscal  and  respectively 
the company recorded proceeds of million  million and million in  and  respectively  in connection with common shares issued under the company s stock option and stock purchase plans 
the company made payments on short term borrowings and long term debt totaled million in fiscal  while proceeds from borrowings were million 
as of august   the company s sources of available funds comprised million in cash and cash equivalents  million in short term investments and various credit facilities 
entegris has an unsecured revolving credit agreement with two commercial banks with aggregate borrowing capacity of million  with million in borrowings outstanding at august  and lines of credit with seven international banks that provide for borrowings of currencies for the company s overseas subsidiaries  equivalent to an aggregate of approximately million 
borrowings outstanding on these lines of credit were approximately million at august  under the unsecured revolving credit agreement  we are subject to  and are in compliance with  certain financial covenants including ratios requiring a fixed charge coverage of not less than to and a leverage ratio of not more than to 
in addition  we must maintain a calculated consolidated and domestic tangible net worth  which  as of august   are million and million  respectively  while also maintaining consolidated and domestic aggregate amounts of cash and short term investments of not less than million and million  respectively 
at august   the company s shareholders equity stood at million compared to million at the beginning of the year 
the components of the increase included the company s net earnings  the proceeds and tax benefits associated with the issuance of shares issued under the company s stock option and stock purchase plans and increases in other comprehensive income totaling million 
the company believes that its cash and cash equivalents  short term investments  cash flow from operations and available credit facilities will be sufficient to meet its working capital and investment requirements for the next months 
however  future growth  including potential acquisitions  may require the company to raise capital through additional equity or debt financing 
there can be no assurance that any such financing would be available on commercially acceptable terms

recently issued accounting pronouncements in december  the emerging issues task force issued eitf no 
 revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables 
this issue addresses certain aspects of the accounting for arrangements under which a company will perform multiple revenue generating activities 
in some arrangements  the different revenue generating activities deliverables are sufficiently separable  and there exists sufficient evidence of their fair values to separately account for some or all of the deliverables that is  there are separate units of accounting 
in other arrangements  some or all of the deliverables are not independently functional  or there is not sufficient evidence of their fair values to account for them separately 
this issue addresses when and  if so  how an arrangement involving multiple deliverables should be divided into separate units of accounting 
this issue does not change otherwise applicable revenue recognition criteria 
this issue is applicable for the company for revenue arrangements entered beginning in fiscal the company does not expect the adoption of eitf no 
to have a material effect on its consolidated financial statements 
in january  the fasb issued interpretation no 
fin  consolidation of variable interest entities vies 
fin requires an investor with a majority of the variable interests in a variable interest entity to consolidate the entity and also requires majority and significant variable interest investors to provide certain disclosures 
vies are entities in which the equity investors do not have a controlling interest or the equity investment at risk is insufficient to finance the entity s activities without receiving additional subordinated financial support from the other parties 
the provisions of fin become effective for the company during the second quarter of its fiscal year ending august  the company does not expect to identify any vies that must be included in its consolidated financial statements 
in may  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity 
the statement clarifies the accounting for certain financial instruments that  under previous guidance  issuers could account for as equity 
sfas no 
requires that those instruments be classified as liabilities in statements of financial position 
this statement becomes effective for the company during the first quarter of its fiscal year ending august  the company is currently evaluating the effect of this statement  but does not expect that the adoption of sfas no 
will have a material effect on its consolidated financial statements 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risks entegris principal market risks are sensitivities to interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates 
the company s current exposure to interest rate fluctuations is not significant 
most of its long term debt at august  carries fixed rates of interest 
the company s cash equivalents and short term investments are debt instruments with maturities of months or less 
a basis point change in interest rates would potentially increase or decrease net income by approximately million annually 
the company uses derivative financial instruments to manage foreign currency exchange rate risk associated with the sale of products in currencies other than the us dollar 
at august   the company was party to forward 
index to financial statements contracts to deliver japanese yen with notional value of approximately million 
the cash flows and earnings of foreign based operations are also subject to fluctuations in foreign exchange rates 
a hypothetical change in the foreign currency exchange rates would potentially increase or decrease net income by approximately million 
the company s investment in metron common stock is accounted for as an available for sale security 
consequently  the company s financial position is exposed to fluctuations in the price of metron stock 
at august   the company s investment in metron technology nv common stock had a carrying value of million with a fair value of million 
accordingly  a adverse change in metron s per share price would result in an approximate million decrease in the fair value of the company s investment 
impact of inflation the company s consolidated financial statements are prepared on a historical cost basis  which does not completely account for the effects of inflation 
material and labor expenses are the company s primary costs 
the cost of polymers  its primary raw material  was essentially unchanged from one year ago 
entegris expects the cost of resins to remain stable in the upcoming fiscal year 
labor costs  including taxes and fringe benefits  rose slightly in fiscal and moderate increases also can be reasonably anticipated for fiscal item a
