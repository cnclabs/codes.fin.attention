results of operations overview we develop  manufacture and market the invos cerebral oximeter  the only non invasive patient monitoring system commercially available in the united states that continuously measures changes in the blood oxygen level in the brain 
we also develop and market the correstore system for use in cardiac repair and reconstruction  including heart surgeries called surgical ventricular restoration  or svr 
during the third quarter of fiscal  we began international shipments of the model cerebral oximeter 
the model has the added capability of being able to monitor pediatric patients 
in september  we received clearance from the fda to market the model cerebral oximeter in the united states 
in june  we entered into a license agreement for the correstore system 
in november we received clearance from the fda to market the correstore patch in the united states 
during fiscal and  our primary activities consisted of sales and marketing of the cerebral oximeter and related disposable somasensor 
during fiscal  our primary activities consisted of sales and marketing of the cerebral oximeter  the related disposable somasensor  and the correstore system 
we derive our revenues from sales of cerebral oximeters and somasensors to our distributors  and from sales of cerebral oximeters  somasensors and correstore systems to hospitals in the united states through our direct sales employees and independent sales representatives 
we offer to our customers a no cap sales program whereby we ship the cerebral oximeter to the customer at no charge  in exchange for the customer agreeing to purchase at a premium a minimum monthly quantity of somasensors 
we recognize revenue when there is persuasive evidence of an arrangement with the customer  the product has been delivered  the sales price is fixed or determinable  and collectibility is reasonably assured 
the product is considered delivered to the customer once we have shipped it  as this is when title and risk of loss have transferred 
payment terms are generally net days for united states sales and net days or longer for international sales 
our primary expenses  excluding the cost of our products  are selling  general and administrative and research  development and engineering 
fiscal year ended november  compared to fiscal year ended november our net revenues increased approximately  or  from  in the fiscal year ended november  to  in the fiscal year ended november  the increase in net revenues is primarily attributable to an increase in united states sales of approximately  or  from approximately  in fiscal to approximately  in fiscal  primarily due to a increase in sales of the disposable somasensor  and approximately  in correstore system revenues in fiscal  partially offset by a decrease in sales of the cerebral oximeter primarily as a result of approximately  in stocking orders to independent representatives in fiscal  and also partly as a result of a preference by larger us hospitals to acquire cerebral oximeters using our no cap sales program  and a increase in the average selling price of somasensors primarily as a result of the increase from the prior year in the suggested retail price of the somasensor effective september   and a change in the sales mix between sales in the united states  which have higher average selling prices  and sales to international distributors 
the increase in net revenues was achieved despite a decrease in international sales of approximately  or  from approximately  in fiscal to approximately  in fiscal this decrease is primarily attributable to decreased purchases by tyco healthcare in fiscal sales of our products as a percentage of net revenues were as follows percent of net revenue fiscal year ended november  product somasensors model cerebral oximeters model cerebral oximeters correstore systems total approximately of our net revenues in fiscal were export sales  compared to approximately of our net revenues in fiscal one international distributor accounted for approximately of net revenues for the fiscal year ended november   and approximately of net revenues for the fiscal year ended november  effective december   we increased the suggested list price for the adult somasensor and the pediatric somasensor in the united states to and  respectively 
although these prices may not apply to existing customers or to any existing sales quotations which were issued before december   we expect to also increase the sales price of the adult somasensor and pediatric somasensor for most existing customers 
we expect that the average selling price of somasensors will increase by approximately in fiscal gross margin as a percentage of net revenues was approximately for the fiscal year ended november  and approximately for the fiscal year ended november  the increase in gross margin as a percentage of net revenues is primarily attributable to a increase in the average selling price of somasensors  described above  increased sales of our latest model somasensor  which is less costly to manufacture than the prior model somasensor  sales of the correstore system in fiscal  and a change in sales mix with increased sales in the united states and decreased sales to international distributors which have lower average selling prices 
our research  development and engineering expenses decreased approximately  or  from  in fiscal to  in fiscal the decrease is primarily attributable to approximately  in decreased costs associated with the development of the correstore system and a  decrease in engineering salaries as a result of one less engineer  partially offset by approximately  in increased costs associated with the development of our next generation cerebral oximeter 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased approximately  or  from  for the fiscal year ended november  to  for the fiscal year ended november  the increase in selling  general and administrative expense is primarily attributable to a  increase in commissions paid to our independent sales representatives   in customer education expenses for the correstore system in fiscal  a  increase in trade show expenditures for the cerebral oximeter and correstore system as a result of our increased sales and marketing activities  a  increase in insurance expense  primarily due to increased products liability insurance coverage since we began marketing the correstore system  and a  increase in professional service fees  primarily due to the timing of auditing and tax service expenses 
these increases were partially offset by a  decrease in intangible amortization expense as a result of discontinued amortization of license acquisition costs in connection with our adoption of statement of financial accounting standards no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  described below  a  termination fee paid in fiscal related to the kingsbridge capital limited private equity line  a  decrease in salaries  wages  commissions and related expenses  primarily as a result of a reduction in the number of employees  principally sales and marketing from an average of employees for the fiscal year ended november  to an average of employees for the fiscal year ended november  and reduced employee sales commissions  and  paid in fiscal in connection with the loan and security agreement with crestmark bank 
we expect our selling  general and administrative expenses to increase in fiscal as a result of marketing and selling the cerebral oximeter and the correstore system 
fiscal year ended november  compared to fiscal year ended november  our net revenues increased approximately  or  from  in the fiscal year ended november  to  in the fiscal year ended november  the increase in net revenues is primarily attributable to an increase in united states sales of approximately  from approximately  in fiscal to approximately  in fiscal  primarily due to increased sales of the disposable somasensor and initial purchases of demonstration equipment by independent sales representatives  and a increase in the average selling price of somasensors primarily as a result of the increase from the prior year in the suggested retail price of the somasensor effective september   and a change in the sales mix between sales in the united states  which have higher average selling prices  and sales to international distributors  and a increase in the average selling price of cerebral oximeters  primarily as a result of a change in the sales mix between sales in the united states and sales to international distributors  and increased sales of the model cerebral oximeter in the united states in fiscal the increase in net revenues was achieved despite a decrease in international sales of approximately  from approximately  in fiscal to approximately  in fiscal this decrease is primarily attributable to stocking orders for model and model cerebral oximeters and somasensors by tyco healthcare  formerly nellcor puritan bennett export inc  in fiscal  and delays in marketing the cerebral oximeter in markets  including europe  in fiscal  and decreased purchases by baxter limited in japan in fiscal attributable to a change in product focus by edwards lifesciences corporation since being spun off by baxter international  inc baxter limited in japan is now part of edwards lifesciences corporation 
sales of our products as a percentage of net revenues were as follows percent of net revenue fiscal year ended november  product somasensors model cerebral oximeters model cerebral oximeters model exchanges total approximately of our net revenues in fiscal were export sales  compared to approximately of our net revenues in fiscal one international distributor accounted for approximately of net revenues for the fiscal year ended november   and approximately of net revenues for the fiscal year ended november  another international distributor accounted for approximately of net revenues in fiscal gross margin as a percentage of net revenues was approximately for the fiscal year ended november  and approximately for the fiscal year ended november  the increase in gross margin as a percentage of net revenues is primarily attributable to a increase in the average selling price of somasensors and a increase in the average selling price of cerebral oximeters described above  and increased sales of our latest model somasensor  launched in may  which is less costly to manufacture than the prior model somasensor 
our research  development and engineering expenses increased approximately  or  from  in fiscal to  in fiscal the increase is primarily attributable to a  increase in costs associated with the development of the correstore system 
this increase was partially offset by a  decrease in costs associated with the development of the latest model somasensor  and a  decrease in engineering salaries as a result of one less engineer 
selling  general and administrative expenses decreased approximately  or  from  for the fiscal year ended november  to  for the fiscal year ended november  the decrease in selling  general and administrative expense is primarily attributable to a  decrease in salaries  wages  commissions and related expenses  primarily as a result of a reduction in the number of employees  principally sales and marketing from an average of employees for the fiscal year ended november  to an average of employees for the fiscal year ended november  a  decrease in travel and selling related expenses primarily related to reduced trade show and travel expenses as a result of the reduction in sales personnel  and reduced marketing expenses as a result of promotional materials  travel and training for tyco healthcare in fiscal  a  decrease in office related expenses primarily as a result of the reduced number of employees and our focus on cost containment  a  decrease in clinical research expenses  primarily related to the model cerebral oximeter  and a  decrease in incentive compensation expense primarily due to our executive officers not participating in the employee incentive compensation plan in exchange for a grant of stock options  these decreases were partially offset by  in commissions paid to our independent sales representatives engaged in fiscal  a  termination fee related to the kingsbridge capital limited private equity line  and a  increase in intangible amortization expense related to the amortization of license acquisition costs 
we realized a  loss on the sale of marketable securities in fiscal effects of inflation we do not believe that inflation has had a significant impact on our financial position or results of operations in the past three years 
liquidity and capital resources net cash used in operations during fiscal was approximately  cash was used primarily to fund our net loss  including selling  general and administrative expenses and research  development and engineering expenses  totaling approximately  before depreciation and amortization expense  increase inventory by approximately  primarily due to purchases of correstore system inventory  increase prepaid expenses by approximately  primarily due to increased insurance costs and advance payments made for trade show reservations 
these uses of cash were partially offset by a  increase in accrued liabilities  primarily as a result of customer education expenses for the correstore system and clinical research expenses for the cerebral oximeter  and a  decrease in accounts receivable  primarily as a result of more timely collections in fiscal we expect to increase our inventory in fiscal  as a result of our fourth quarter sales  and our expected sales of the cerebral oximeter  somasensor and correstore system in fiscal we expect our working capital requirements to increase if sales increase 
we capitalized approximately  of costs for model and model cerebral oximeters being used as demonstration units and no cap units during fiscal  compared to approximately  in fiscal we depreciate these costs over five years 
capital expenditures in fiscal were approximately  these expenditures were primarily approximately  for model and model cerebral oximeters being used as demonstration units and no cap units  approximately  for a display booth and exhibit to be used at industry trade shows  approximately  in computer hardware and software to upgrade our computer infrastructure  and approximately  in tooling costs  primarily for the correstore system 
our principal sources of operating funds have been the proceeds of equity investments from sales of our common shares 
see statements of shareholders equity of our financial statements included in item of this report 
on march   we entered into the private equity line agreement with kingsbridge capital limited  a private institutional investor 
we completed the sales of  common shares under the private equity line agreement  for gross proceeds of  our net proceeds  after deducting the commissions and the estimated expenses of the offerings  were approximately  effective march   we de registered the remaining shares originally registered for resale by kingsbridge under the private equity line agreement  because we no longer intended to sell any more shares to kingsbridge  except upon any exercise of its warrant  and kingsbridge is no longer publicly offering for resale the shares subject to the warrant we granted to them 
on april   we mutually agreed with kingsbridge to terminate the private equity line agreement  the related registration rights agreement  and kingsbridge s right to the discount on any unsold shares  in exchange for our payment of  to kingsbridge 
on february   we entered into a loan and security agreement with crestmark bank for a working capital line of credit for up to  collateralized by all of our assets 
under the agreement  crestmark bank may  but is not obligated to  lend us amounts we request from time to time  up to  if no default exists 
the loans are limited by a borrowing base based on qualifying accounts receivable and lender reserves 
the loan is payable on demand  and collections of our receivables are directed to crestmark bank in payment of any outstanding balance of the loan 
the principal amount outstanding bears interest  payable monthly  at the prime rate at january  plus plus a service fee  and we paid a  commitment fee for the loan 
through november   we have borrowed an aggregate of  under the agreement and repaid  in principal amount through crestmark s collection of our receivables and by using some of the proceeds from our april  and january  offerings 
as of november    was available for borrowing  at crestmark s discretion  under the facility 
we have agreed to use the proceeds of the loans solely as working capital 
the line of credit requires us to maintain minimum tangible net worth of  and a ratio of total liabilities to tangible net worth not to exceed the line of credit terminates upon crestmark s demand 
as of january   we had no outstanding principal loan balance  and  was available for borrowing  at crestmark s discretion  under the facility 
on april   we completed the private placement of  newly issued common shares at a price of per share  for gross proceeds of  our estimated net proceeds  after deducting the placement agent s commission and the expenses of the offering  were approximately  brean murray co  inc was our exclusive placement agent for the offering and received for its services  as a placement agent fee  and warrants to purchase  common shares at per share exercisable during the four year period beginning april  a 
brean murray  one of our directors  and his wife control brean murray co  inc in addition  the brean murray co  inc profit sharing plan purchased  common shares in the offering  and robert r 
henry  one of our directors  purchased  common shares in the offering 
on january   we completed the public offering of  newly issued common shares at a price of per share  for gross proceeds of  our estimated net proceeds  after deducting the placement agent s commission and the estimated expenses of the offering  were approximately  brean murray co  inc was our exclusive placement agent for the offering and received for its services  as a placement agent fee  and warrants to purchase  common shares at per share exercisable during the four year period beginning january  a 
brean murray  one of our directors  and his wife control brean murray co  inc as of november   we had working capital of  cash and cash equivalents of  total current liabilities of  and shareholders equity of  we had an accumulated deficit of  through november  we expect that our primary needs for liquidity in fiscal will be to fund our losses  if any  and sustain our operations  including funding for marketing costs for the cerebral oximeter and the correstore system  and research and development efforts related to the advancement of the design and production processes of the cerebral oximeter and somasensor  and for working capital  including increased accounts receivable and inventories of components and sales units to satisfy expected sales orders 
in addition  we have budgeted approximately  for capital expenditures during fiscal  primarily for new demonstration and no cap equipment  and manufacturing tooling for the cerebral oximeter  somasensor  and correstore system 
we believe that the cash and cash equivalents on hand at november   together with the estimated net borrowings available under the crestmark bank loan and security agreement described above  will be adequate to satisfy our operating and capital requirements for more than the next twelve months 
the estimated length of time current cash  cash equivalents and available borrowings will sustain our operations is based on estimates and assumptions we have made 
these estimates and assumptions are subject to change as a result of actual experience 
actual funding requirements necessary to market the cerebral oximeter and somasensor  to develop and market the correstore system  to undertake other product development activities  and for working capital might be substantially greater than current estimates 
our ability to use our accumulated net operating loss carryforwards to offset future income  if any  for income tax purposes  is limited due to the initial public offering of our securities in march see note of notes to financial statements included in item of this report 
new accounting pronouncements effective december   we adopted statement of financial accounting standards no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
the effect of adopting this statement has been to discontinue amortizing our license acquisition costs related to our acquisition of exclusive  worldwide  royalty bearing licenses to specified rights relating to the correstore system and related products and accessories because we believe these licenses have an indefinite life 
for fiscal  we incurred amortization expense of approximately  associated with these license acquisition costs 
our net loss for fiscal  excluding the effect of amortizing our license acquisition costs  would have been approximately  or 
per common share 
during the third quarter of fiscal  we adopted statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  effective december  this statement replaces statement no 
and provisions of apb opinion no 
for the disposal of segments of a business 
the statement creates one accounting model  based on the framework established in statement no 
 to be applied to all long lived assets including discontinued operations 
the adoption of this statement had no impact on our financial statements 
in december  the financial accounting standards board issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure 
this statement  which is effective for fiscal years ending after december   amends statement no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  and provides alternative methods of transition for a voluntary change to the fair value based method of accounting for stock based compensation 
in addition  statement no 
amends the disclosure requirements of statement no 
regardless of the accounting method used to account for stock based compensation 
we have chosen to continue to account for stock based compensation of employees using the intrinsic value method prescribed in accounting principles board opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  and related interpretations 
however  the enhanced disclosure provisions as defined by statement no 
will be effective for our fiscal quarter ending may  critical accounting policies we believe our most significant accounting policies relate to the recording of an intangible asset for license acquisition costs related to our acquisition of exclusive  worldwide  royalty bearing licenses to specified rights relating to the correstore system and related products and accessories  and our accounting treatment of stock options issued to employees 
we have recorded an intangible asset related to our acquisition of exclusive  worldwide  royalty bearing licenses to specified rights relating to the correstore system and related products and accessories 
license acquisition costs include our estimate of the fair value of ten year vested stock options to purchase common shares granted to one of our directors in connection with negotiating and assisting us in completing the transaction  and our estimate of the fair value of the vested portion of five year warrants to purchase common shares issued in the transaction 
we estimated the value of the stock options to purchase common shares and the warrants to purchase common shares using the black scholes valuation model 
the black scholes valuation model requires the following assumptions expected life period of the security  expected volatility of our stock price during the period  risk free interest rate  and dividend yield 
given the assumptions inherent in the black scholes valuation model  it is possible to calculate a different value for our intangible asset by changing one or more of the valuation model variables or by using a different valuation model 
however  we believe that the model is appropriate  that the judgments and assumptions that we have made at the time of valuation were also appropriate  and that the reported results would not be materially different had one or more of the variables been different or had a different valuation model been used 
in addition  as described above  effective december   we adopted statement of financial accounting standards no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
the effect of adopting this statement has been to discontinue amortizing our license acquisition costs related to our acquisition of exclusive  worldwide  royalty bearing licenses to specified rights relating to the correstore system and related products and accessories described above because we believe these licenses have an indefinite life 
therefore  we recorded no amortization expense related to these license acquisition costs in fiscal for fiscal  we incurred amortization expense of approximately  associated with these license acquisition costs 
our net loss for fiscal  excluding the effect of amortizing our license acquisition costs  would have been reduced to approximately  or 
per common share 
in october  statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  was issued by the financial accounting standards board 
in addition  as described above  in december  statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure  was issued by the financial accounting standards board  and amends statement no 
we have chosen to continue to account for stock based compensation of employees using the intrinsic value method prescribed in accounting principles board opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  and related interpretations 
accordingly  compensation costs for stock options granted to employees are measured as the excess  if any  of the market price of our stock at the date of the grant over the amount an employee must pay to acquire the stock 
no compensation expense has been charged against income for stock option grants to employees because our stock option grants are priced at the market value as of the date of grant 
during fiscal  we granted  stock options to our employees and directors 
had we recognized compensation expense for stock options granted to employees in fiscal  based on the fair value of the options on the grant date using the black scholes valuation model  our net loss  on a pro forma basis  would have increased by approximately  or 
per common share 
had we recognized compensation expense for our stock options granted to employees in fiscal  based on the fair value of the options on the grant date using the black scholes valuation model  our net loss on a pro forma basis would have increased by approximately  or
