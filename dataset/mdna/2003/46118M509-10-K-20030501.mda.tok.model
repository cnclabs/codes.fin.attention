item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes 
this discussion contains forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
forward looking statements include statements regarding our future cash and liquidity position  the extent and timing of future revenues and expenses and customer demand  the deployment of our products  and our reliance on third parties 
all forward looking statements included in this document are based on information available to us as of the date hereof  and we assume no obligation to update any forward looking statement 
our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward looking statements as a result of certain factors  including but not limited to  those discussed in risk factors below and elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
intraware overview intraware  inc was incorporated in delaware on august  we are a leading provider of global electronic software delivery and management esdm solutions 
our esdm solutions help software publishers reduce operational and support costs  increase customer satisfaction and retention  accelerate and strengthen software revenue recognition processes  and comply with us export regulations 
we also offer complementary products and services  including enterprise software sales and marketing  and global web based content caching and delivery 
we have a limited operating history upon which investors may evaluate our business and prospects 
since inception  we have incurred significant losses  and  as of february   had an accumulated deficit of approximately million 
we expect to incur additional net losses during our fiscal year ending february  there can be no assurance that our gross profit will increase or continue at its current level 
there also can be no assurance that we will generate cash from operations in future periods  or achieve or maintain profitability  or that we will be able to finance our operations without raising additional capital 
our future must be considered in light of our liquidity issues and the risks frequently encountered by companies in an early stage of development  particularly companies in new and rapidly evolving markets such as internet based services 
to address these risks  we must  among other things  continue to develop new services  implement and successfully execute our business and marketing strategy  continue to develop and upgrade our technology  provide superior customer service  respond to competitive developments and attract  retain and motivate qualified personnel 
we may also be required to raise additional capital 
there can be no assurance we will be successful in addressing those risks  and our failure to do so would have a material adverse effect on us 
our current and future expense levels are based largely on our planned operations and estimates of future sales 
sales and operating results generally depend on the volume and timing of orders received  which are difficult to forecast  particularly in the current business environment 
we may be unable to adjust spending in a timely manner to compensate for any unexpected revenue shortfall 
accordingly  any significant shortfall in sales would have an immediate adverse effect on us and our cash flows 
in view of the rapidly evolving nature of our business and our limited operating history  we are unable to accurately forecast our sales and believe that period to period comparisons of our operating results are not necessarily meaningful and should not be relied upon as an indication of future performance 
critical accounting policies and estimates management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations discusses our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions affecting the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
on an ongoing basis  management evaluates its estimates and judgments 
we base our estimates and judgments on historical experience and on various other factors believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we consider accounting policies related to revenue recognition  prepaid licenses  allowance for doubtful accounts  goodwill and intangibles  and income taxes to be critical accounting policies due to the estimation process involved in each 
revenue recognition online services and technology revenue results primarily from three types of arrangements 
first  it results from sales of our subscribenet electronic software delivery and management service to software vendors 
second  it results from the sale of our proprietary software licenses and related maintenance to companies using those products internally or using those products to provide web based services to their customers 
third  it results from professional services that we provide to integrate our proprietary software  to convert data for customers  and to customize our subscribenet service for individual customer needs 
in the past  the proprietary software licenses we sold were primarily licenses to use our asset management software  however  we may recognize future revenues as a result of our plan to sell licenses for our proprietary software underlying our subscribenet service and related maintenance 
as a result of the sale of our asset management software business in may discussed below in liquidity and capital resources  we are not currently deriving significant revenue from licenses for our proprietary software 
we sell our subscribenet service and our proprietary software licenses primarily through our direct sales force or through authorized resellers 
alliance and reimbursement revenue primarily relates to our alliance agreement with software spectrum for sales of sun one software licenses and maintenance 
the revenue from software spectrum consists of a percentage of the gross profit derived from the sales of sun one software licenses and maintenance services  and reimbursement for the costs of maintaining a sales team dedicated to selling sun one software for software spectrum 
this revenue is recognized as we provide the services to software spectrum 
we derive software product revenues from resold licenses and maintenance for multiple business software product lines 
although as of july   we no longer resell third party software licenses and maintenance  we will continue to recognize revenue from third party software licenses and related maintenance contracts over the life of the arrangements made prior to july  vendor specific objective evidence of fair value for the maintenance element of the resold software arrangements is based on historical and contractual renewal rates for maintenance 
we defer the maintenance revenue at the outset of the arrangement and recognize it ratably over the period during which the maintenance is to be provided generally months  which normally commences on the date the software is delivered 
we defer services revenue related to our subscribenet service and generally recognize it ratably over the term of the service arrangement 
professional service fees revenue related to our subscribenet service is deferred until completion of the professional services  then recognized ratably over the remaining term of the service arrangement 
we recognize revenue when all of the following conditions are met there is persuasive evidence of an arrangement  we provide the service to the customer or we have made the software available for customer download through our web site  or shipped the software to the customer  we believe that collection of these fees is probable  and the amount of fees to be paid by the customer is fixed or determinable 
revenue from transactions through authorized resellers has been recognized when the licenses and maintenance have been resold  utilized by the reseller or our related obligations have been satisfied 
we have provided for sales allowances for authorized resellers and direct sales on an estimated basis 
this estimation was based on prior history as well as contractual requirements 
vendor specific objective evidence of fair value for the maintenance element of the proprietary software arrangements is based on historical and contractual renewal rates for maintenance 
we defer the maintenance revenue at the outset of the arrangement and recognize it ratably over the period during which the maintenance is to be provided generally months  which normally commences on the date the software is delivered 
as mentioned above  a determination that the collection of fees is probable is a precursor to recognizing revenue 
determination of collectibility of payments requires judgment on the part of management and includes performing periodic credit evaluations of customers see allowance for doubtful accounts below 
prepaid licenses we write down our prepaid licenses for estimated obsolescence equal to the difference between the cost of the prepaid licenses and the estimated recoverable value based on assumptions about future demand  market conditions and our rights to return under stock rotation agreements 
if actual future demand or market conditions are less favorable than those we project  additional prepaid license write downs may be required 
these prepaid licenses were originally obtained as a result of our third party reseller business 
as of july   we ceased reselling third party software licenses see revenue recognition above 
during the year ended february   we recorded approximately  in prepaid license write downs 
allowance for doubtful accounts we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses from our inability to collect required payments from our customers 
we analyze specific accounts receivable  historical bad debts  customer concentrations  customer credit worthiness  current economic trends and changes in our customer payment history when evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts 
changes in the above factors can have a material impact on actual bad debts incurred 
goodwill and intangibles as discussed in note of the consolidated financial statements  we are required to regularly review all of our long lived assets  including goodwill and other intangible assets  for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
factors we consider important which could trigger an impairment review include  but are not limited to  significant underperformance relative to historical or projected future operating results  significant changes in the manner of use of the acquired assets or the strategy for our overall business  significant negative industry or economic trends  a significant decline in our stock price for a sustained period  and our market capitalization relative to net book value 
when we determine that an impairment review for intangible and long lived assets is necessary based upon the existence of one or more of the above indicators of impairment  we compare the book value of such assets to the future undiscounted cash flows attributable to those assets 
if the book value is greater than the future undiscounted cash flows  we measure any impairment based on a projected discounted cash flow method using a discount rate commensurate with the risk inherent in our current business model 
when we determine an impairment review of goodwill is necessary based on an impairment indicator or based on our annual testing requirements  we compare the fair value of the reporting unit to the carrying value of the reporting unit 
if the carrying value of the reporting unit is greater than the fair value of the reporting unit  an impairment may be necessary 
significant judgment is required in the development of projected cash flows for these purposes including assumptions regarding the appropriate level of aggregation of cash flows  their term and discount rate as well as the underlying forecasts of expected future revenue and expense 
we recorded a write off of approximately million of intangibles in fiscal year relating to the bitsource  inc acquisition  as discussed in note of our notes to consolidated financial statements 
during fiscal year  our remaining goodwill and intangibles were included in our calculation of the gain on sale of our asset management software business  as discussed in note to our notes to consolidated financial statements 
income taxes in conjunction with preparing our financial statements  we must estimate our income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate 
this process involves estimating our actual current tax expense together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items for tax and accounting purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities 
we must then assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income and to the extent we believe that recovery is not likely  we must establish a valuation allowance 
given that we have incurred losses since inception and therefore have not been required to pay income taxes  we have fully reserved our deferred tax assets at february  in the event that we are able to realize our deferred tax assets in the future  an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would increase income in the period that this is determined 
results of operations total revenue revenue decreased to million for the year ended february  from million for the year ended february   and from million for the year ended february  for the year ended february   product revenue accounted for million or of revenue  compared to million or of revenue for the year ended february  and million or of revenue for the year ended february  online services and technology and related party online services and technology revenue for the year ended february   accounted for million or of revenue compared to million or of revenue for the year ended february   and million or of revenue for the year ended february  alliance and reimbursement revenue for the year ended february   accounted for million or of revenue compared to million or of revenue for the year ended february  we had no alliance and reimbursement revenue in the year ended february  the decrease in online services and technology revenue for the year ended february   is primarily due to our sale of our asset management software business in may as a result of the sale of our asset management software business  we recorded the remaining unamortized prepaid distribution costs relating to warrants issued to software spectrum formerly corporate software as a reduction of revenue of approximately  during the year ended february  in addition  as a result of our asset management software business sale  our subscribenet electronic software delivery and management service is now our primary service offering 
we expect our online services and technology revenue and related party online services and technology revenue to increase  primarily as a result of the introduction of new products and services  the acquisition of additional customers and an increase in total fees from existing customers through increased use of our services 
the previous sentence is a forward looking statement and actual results could differ materially from those anticipated 
in particular  our expected growth in revenue from the introduction of new products and services is subject to the risk that these new products and services may not be introduced in a timely manner  or may be canceled altogether  or even if they are introduced  customers may not be willing to buy them see risk factors beginning on page below 
in addition  we recently renegotiated our services agreement with one of our major customers  sun microsystems  inc as a result of this renegotiation  the fulfillment portion of our agreement will remain in effect through june  however  the fees payable by sun for our fulfillment services have been reduced substantially effective march  also  sun canceled the subscribenet portion of the agreement effective march  the increase in alliance and reimbursement revenue for the year ended february   is primarily due to our agreement with software spectrum  which was signed in june  but did not go into effect until july as part of this agreement  software spectrum assumed our rights and obligations under our sun one formerly iplanet software reseller agreement  and agreed to pay to us a percentage of the gross profit derived from software spectrum s sales of sun one software licenses and services and a reimbursement for the costs of maintaining a sales team dedicated to selling sun one software for software spectrum 
we expect our alliance and reimbursement revenues in our fiscal year to remain at approximately the same level as in our year ended february  the previous sentence is a forward looking statement and actual results could differ materially from those anticipated 
the decline in software product revenue and the majority of the decline in total revenue for the year ended february   was due to our transition out of the business of reselling third party software products and related maintenance see above 
we expect our exited third party product revenue to continue to decrease 
however  we may recognize future revenues for complementary subscribenet services provided by other third parties but sold through intraware as part of a comprehensive esdm business solution 
the previous two sentences are forward looking statements and actual results could differ materially from those anticipated 
cost of revenues total cost of revenues decreased to million for the year ended february   from million for the year ended february   and million for the year ended february  the decrease in cost of revenues is primarily due to the phasing out of our software reseller business 
our gross margin increased to for the year ended february   from for the year ended february   and for the year ended february  the margin percentage increase primarily reflects our focus on the sale of our own services and technology  which generate higher margins than third party products we resold 
costs of revenues primarily consist of certain allocated costs related to our internet connectivity  assets supporting costs of revenues  and customer support and the costs associated with maintaining our sales team dedicated to selling sun one software for which software spectrum reimburses us 
costs of revenues also consist of professional services personnel costs and the cost of third party products sold 
we purchased third party products at a discount to the third party s established list prices according to standard reseller terms 
we expect our overall costs of revenues and gross profit margin percentage to increase over our fiscal year levels 
however  the actual mix of sales transactions and the timing of the transactions may cause our cost of revenues and gross profit margins to fluctuate materially from those anticipated 
sales and marketing expenses for the year ended february   sales and marketing expenses were million or of revenue  a decrease from million or of revenue for the year ended february   and million or of revenue for the year ended february  sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of employee salaries  benefits and commissions  advertising  promotional materials and trade show expenses 
the decrease in the dollar amount of our sales and marketing expenses is due to our restructuring efforts and the sale of our asset management software business in may  which reduced expenditures on salaries and marketing  eliminated rent on closed offices and lowered commission expense due to lower sales  while the increase as a percentage of revenue is primarily a result of lowered revenues see total revenue above 
we plan to invest in sales and marketing at levels lower than our fiscal year levels as a percentage of revenue 
we plan to continue to market and sell our service and proprietary software licenses directly to customers using our existing sales force 
we also plan to continue to develop additional business relationships to sell our services to a broader customer base 
the previous three sentences are forward looking statements and actual results could differ materially from those anticipated 
product development expenses for the year ended february   product development expenses were million or of revenue  a decrease from million or of revenue for the year ended february   and million or of revenue for the year ended february  product development expenses primarily consist of personnel  consulting  software and related maintenance and equipment depreciation expenses 
costs related to research  design and development of products and services have been charged to product development expense as incurred 
the decrease in the dollar amount of our product development expenses is due to our restructuring efforts and the sale of our asset management software business in may  which eliminated expenditures on salaries and consulting fees for asset management software development personnel  and reduced software and related maintenance and equipment depreciation expenses through the sale or retirement of software and equipment  while the increase as a percentage of revenue is primarily a result of our lowered revenues see total revenue above 
we anticipate continuing to invest in additional functionality for our subscribenet service and underlying proprietary software 
however  we expect those investments to fluctuate over time  and expect our product development expenses to fluctuate accordingly 
total product development expenditures are expected to be lower in fiscal year than fiscal year levels as a percentage of revenue 
we cannot give assurance that our product development efforts will result in products  features or functionality or that the market will accept the products  features or functionality developed 
general and administrative expenses for the year ended february   general and administrative expenses were million or of revenue  a decrease from million or of revenue for the year ended february   and million or of revenue for the year ended february  general and administrative expenses consist primarily of compensation for administrative and executive personnel  facility costs and fees for professional services 
a significant part of the decrease in our general and administrative expenses stems from the recovery of accounts previously written off during our fiscal year as uncollectible 
in addition  our restructuring efforts in december and august resulted in a reduction in compensation expense and lease costs for office space 
total expenditures are expected to be higher than fiscal year levels in total and as a percentage of revenue 
the previous sentence is a forward looking statement and actual results could differ materially from those anticipated 
december restructuring and loss on abandonment of assets on december   we announced a strategic restructuring 
this restructuring reduced our total headcount to approximately  from at november  in addition  we consolidated our three san francisco bay area offices into two and reduced our number of outside sales offices from eleven to seven 
we took a charge relating to this restructuring in our fourth quarter ended february   of million 
the restructuring charges were primarily due to the following million primarily for the abandonment of property and equipment  net of anticipated proceeds of approximately million for rent and sublease expenses and expenses related to the closure of certain offices  net of anticipated sublease income for office leases  million for severance costs in connection with the termination of employees   for expenses relating to the write off of our e learning service  and  for other restructuring expenses 
we made cash payments of million and incurred approximately million in non cash charges during the year ended february   related to the restructuring 
at february   we had a remaining restructuring accrual of  of which  was related to future lease and related expenses and the remainder was severance costs 
we have settled all liabilities associated with the december strategic restructuring 
august restructuring and loss on abandonment of assets on august   we announced a strategic reorganization 
we recorded a charge of million relating to this restructuring and the loss on abandonment of assets during the quarter ended august  the loss on abandonment of assets includes the write off of approximately million of property and equipment and certain intangibles relating to the bitsource  inc acquisition  as we have abandoned the related technology 
the write off consisted of the following components million for property and equipment  million for trademarks  million for goodwill  and million for existing technology 
the property and equipment written off includes assets taken out of service  as they were deemed unnecessary due to the reductions in work force 
these assets were subsequently disposed of or sold 
included in this write off were certain furniture and fixtures that were written down to a net realizable value of approximately  the restructuring consisted of approximately  for severance and benefits relating to the involuntary termination of employees  all of which were based in north america

we also consolidated our two san francisco bay area offices into one 
we accrued for lease and related costs of approximately million principally pertaining to the estimated future obligations of non cancelable lease payments for excess facilities in the san francisco bay area that were vacated due to the reduction in work force 
we also recognized an additional  relating to other restructuring expenses 
due to changes in management s estimates relating to the strategic reorganization on august   we recognized additional expense of approximately  during the three months ended november  this additional charge principally related to the acquisition of the title to assets held under a capital lease 
in connection with our restructuring efforts we recorded a charge of approximately  relating to the fair value of an option issued to a consultant on september   for services performed in conjunction with exiting our excess lease space 
we issued a fully vested and immediately exercisable option to purchase  shares of our common stock at an exercise price of per share 
the term of the option is ten years 
the following assumptions were used to value the option under the black scholes option pricing model term of years  fair value of the stock price on the grant date of  option exercise price of per share  volatility of  and a zero dividend yield 
the following table sets forth an analysis of the components of the restructuring and loss on abandonment charges recorded in the second quarter of fiscal and subsequent adjustments and payments made against the reserve in thousands severance and benefits asset write offs excess lease and related costs other costs total august  restructuring and loss on abandonment of assets  total    cash paid non cash charges   reserve balance at august    cash paid non cash charges provision adjustment reserve balance at november    cash paid   reserve balance at february  may restructuring and sale of asset management software business in may  we sold substantially all of the assets related to our asset management software business to computer associates international  inc for approximately million in cash 
in connection with this sale  our july agreement with computer associates for its resale of our argis suite of software products was terminated 
in addition  as part of that asset sale  we assigned to computer associates our may agreement with corporate software now software spectrum for its resale of our argis suite of software products 
because of the asset sale  software spectrum has the right to terminate that agreement 
if it does so  all of the shares subject to the warrant that we issued to software spectrum in may will immediately become exercisable 
the fair value of the warrant had been recorded as prepaid distribution costs and was being recognized as a reduction of revenue over the lesser of a ratable charge over the month term of the agreement with software spectrum or the period it took software spectrum to generate revenue to intraware of million from software spectrum s resale of our asset management software 
as a result of the asset sale  the remaining unamortized prepaid distribution costs of  were recorded as a reduction to revenue during the three months ended may  the total proceeds from the sale of million  less the book value of transferred equipment  intangible assets  goodwill  deferred revenue  and transaction costs  based on their respective carrying values at the sale date  were recorded as a gain on sale of assets in the quarter ended may  the calculation of the gain on the sale was determined as follows in thousands total consideration  net book value of equipment  intangible assets  goodwill and deferred revenue  transaction costs gain on sale  in connection with our disposition of the asset management software business  we announced a restructuring and workforce reduction to reduce our operating expenses 
we recorded a charge of million relating to this restructuring and the impairment of assets during the three months ended may  the impairment of assets includes the write off of approximately  in prepaid licenses that were held for resale 
the restructuring charge consisted of approximately  for severance and benefits relating to the involuntary termination of employees who were not hired by computer associates 
we terminated an additional employees  all of whom were based in north america 
these terminated employees were all hired by computer associates and therefore received no severance payments 
overall  we reduced our workforce to employees from in connection with the asset sale to computer associates 
of the terminated employees  were in sales and marketing  were in product development and were directly involved in our product support 
we also closed our pittsburgh  pennsylvania office and various satellite offices 
we accrued for lease and related costs of approximately  principally pertaining to the estimated future obligations of non cancelable lease payments for excess facilities that were vacated due to our reductions in work force 
we also recognized  relating to other restructuring expenses 
due to changes in management s estimates relating to the restructuring during the three months ended august   we recognized an additional expense of  pertaining to the estimated future obligations of non cancelable lease payments for excess facilities that were vacated due to our reductions in work force 
in addition  we did not incur severance and benefits of  and reduced the reserve accordingly 
during the three months ended february   we agreed with the landlord to terminate our pittsburgh  pennsylvania lease and realized a savings of approximately  that would otherwise have been payable as rent under the lease 
in our december restructuring  we closed our fremont  california office and assigned our lease to a new tenant while acting as guarantor for that tenant 
in may  the new tenant defaulted on its lease 
during the three months ended november   we made a cash payment of approximately  to terminate this lease 
the following table sets forth an analysis of the components of the restructuring and impairment of assets charges recorded in the first quarter of fiscal and subsequent adjustments and payments made against the reserve in thousands severance and benefits excess lease and related costs impairment of assets other costs total may  restructuring  total  cash paid non cash charges reserve balance at may   cash paid provision adjustment reserve balance at august  cash paid reserve balance at november  cash paid non cash charges provision adjustment reserve balance at february  we expect to pay the remaining accrual in cash within one year 
in july  due to changes in our business and hewlett packard co 
s announcement that it would shut down its bluestone software business  we took some computer software out of service 
as a result of this impairment  we wrote off computer software with a net book value of approximately  during the three months ended august  amortization of intangibles and goodwill for the year ended february   amortization of intangibles and goodwill was million  a decrease from million for both the years ended february  and amortization of intangibles and goodwill related to our acquisitions of bitsource  inc in october and janus technologies  inc 
in july on march   we ceased amortization of our goodwill balance 
subsequently  in may  as part of our asset management software business sale to computer associates  we included our remaining intangible assets and goodwill in the determination of the gain on sale 
interest expense for both the years ended february  and  interest expense was million  an increase from  for the year ended february  interest expense relates to obligations under capital leases  notes payable and borrowings under a bank line 
the increase in interest expense from february   is primarily the result of accrued interest and accretion to redemption value related to our million in notes payable  which were fully converted or paid off at may  interest and other income and expenses  net for the year ended february   interest and other income and expenses  net was a  credit  an increase from a net charge of million for the year ended february   and a decrease from  for the year ended february  interest and other income and expenses  net primarily relates to interest earned on our investment balances and warrants recorded as liabilities adjusted to fair value 
the increase in interest and other income and expenses  net for the year ended february   is primarily the result of the decrease in the charges recorded to adjust the warrants we issued in connection with our august and september   debt issuances  and our may   common stock financing to fair value 
the decrease in interest and other income and expenses  net for the year ended february   is primarily the result of a reduction in our invested cash and charges we recorded to adjust the warrants we issued in connection with our august and september  financing  which were classified as liabilities  to fair value 
the charge recorded to adjust the warrants to fair value during the year ended february   was million 
all warrants have been reclassified to permanent equity and will no longer be adjusted to fair value 
income taxes from inception through february   we incurred net losses for federal and state tax purposes and have not recognized any tax provision or benefit 
as of february   we had approximately million of federal and million of state net operating loss carryforwards available to offset future taxable income  which expire in varying amounts between and because of cumulative ownership changes  federal loss carry forwards totaling approximately million and state loss carry overs totaling approximately million are subject to limitation 
at february   million and million of federal and state net operating losses  respectively  are available  without limitation to offset future taxable income 
should there be a change of ownership in the future  the available net operating losses may be further limited 
given our limited operating history  losses incurred to date and the difficulty in accurately forecasting our future results  management does not believe that the realization of the related deferred income tax asset meets the criteria required by generally accepted accounting principles 
accordingly  we have recorded a valuation allowance 
see note of notes to the consolidated financial statements 
liquidity and capital resources since inception  we have financed our operations primarily through private sales of preferred stock and common stock  the initial public offering of our common stock and the issuance of debt 
we will continue to use our capital raised to date to support our operations until we become cash flow positive on a regular basis 
while we have made progress toward becoming cash flow positive  there can be no assurance that we will be successful in becoming regularly cash flow positive without additional capital financing or at all 
our cash and cash equivalents at february   were million  an increase of million from million at february  this increase was due to million provided by investing activities and million provided by financing activities  offset by million used in operating activities 
the net cash used in operating activities of million for the year ended february   was primarily due to our net loss and decreases in deferred revenues and accounts payable  offset by decreases in accounts receivable and prepaid licenses and services 
financing activities provided million for the year ended february   primarily due to proceeds from common stock issuances  offset by our principal payments on our notes payable and capital lease payments 
net cash provided by investing activities of million for the year ended february   related primarily to the sale of our asset management software business to computer associates 
this annual report on form k contains a disclosure expressing substantial doubt regarding our ability to continue as a going concern as a result of our recurring losses and negative cash flows from operations 
during the year ended february   we raised approximately million in new capital see note to our notes to consolidated financial statements  retired all of our notes payable with an aggregate principal balance of million see notes and to our notes to consolidated financial statements  and narrowed our net loss attributable to common stockholders to million for the year ended february   as compared to a net loss attributable to common stockholders of million for the year ended february  although the risks that potential revenue and collections shortfalls pose to our ability to continue as a going concern diminished in recent months  we continued to experience recurring losses and negative cash flows from operations for the year ended february  in addition  there remains no assurance that we will succeed in generating sufficient revenue to enable us to continue operations over the longer term 
our future capital requirements will depend on many factors  including our ability to increase revenue levels and or reduce costs of operations to generate positive cash flows  the timing and extent of expenditures to support expansion of sales and marketing efforts  market acceptance of our services  and timeliness of collections of our accounts receivable 
any projections of our future cash needs are subject to substantial uncertainty 
our ability to generate increased revenues and cash flows and  if necessary  raise additional capital is also subject to substantial uncertainty  given the challenging economic environment currently prevailing in the technology sector 
the bid price of our common stock has been below numerous times over the past months 
if we fail to meet the minimum bid price requirement or the other standards for continued listing on the nasdaq smallcap market  our common stock will likely be delisted and our ability to generate both sales and additional capital will be subject to further uncertainty 
we have historically been able to satisfy our cash requirements through financing and investing activities  and our cash position and net losses from operations have improved substantially during the year ended february  nevertheless  we continued to suffer recurring losses and negative cash flows from operations for that period  and there is no assurance that we will succeed in generating sufficient cash from operations on a regular basis  achieving profitability  or obtaining additional capital if needed 
on may   we completed the sale of our asset management software business for gross proceeds of million 
this transaction is described in note of notes to our consolidated financial statements 
on may   we issued common stock and warrants in a private placement to a group of institutional and individual investors for aggregate gross proceeds of million  including million from the effective conversion of indebtedness 
this transaction is described in note of our notes to consolidated financial statements 
in may  we fully repaid  or converted into common stock and warrants to purchase common stock  all of our promissory notes  which consisted of million in principal plus accrued interest 
on august   we issued common stock in a private placement to zomax incorporated for aggregate gross proceeds of million 
this transaction is discussed in note and note of our notes to consolidated financial statements 
at february   we did not have any other relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships  such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities  which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes 
as such  we are not materially exposed to any financing  liquidity  market or credit risk that could arise if we had engaged in such relationships 
the following summarizes our lease obligations at february   and the effect such obligations are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flow in future periods in thousands payments due by period total capital lease obligations   operating leases  as of february   our redeemable convertible preferred stock had a liquidation value of million 
recent accounting pronouncements in july  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities 
sfas no 
nullifies the guidance in emerging issues task force eitf issue no 
 liability recognition for certain employee termination benefits and other costs to exit an activity including certain costs incurred in a restructuring 
under eitf issue no 
 an entity recognized a liability for an exit cost on the date that the entity committed itself to an exit plan 
in sfas  the fasb acknowledges that an entity s commitment to a plan does not  by itself  create a present obligation to other parties that meets the definition of a liability and requires that a liability for a cost that is associated with an exit or disposal activity be recognized when the liability is incurred 
it also establishes that fair value is the objective for the initial measurement of the liability 
sfas will be effective for exit or disposal activities that are initiated after december  we do not expect a material effect on our financial position and results of operations from the adoption of sfas in november  the eitf reached a consensus on issue no 
 accounting for revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables eitf on a model to be used to determine when a revenue arrangement with multiple deliverables should be divided into separate units of accounting and  if separation is appropriate  how the arrangement consideration should be allocated to the identified accounting units 
the eitf also reached a consensus that this guidance should be effective for all revenue arrangements entered into in fiscal periods beginning after june  we are currently assessing what the impact of the guidance would have on our financial statements 
in november  the eitf issued fasb interpretation no 
fin  guarantor s accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees  including indirect guarantees and indebtedness of others 
fin elaborates on the disclosures to be made by the guarantor in its interim and annual financial statements about its obligations under certain guarantees that it has issued 
it also requires that a guarantor recognize  at the inception of a guarantee  a liability for the fair value of the obligation undertaken in issuing the guarantee 
the initial recognition and measurement provisions of this interpretation are applicable on a prospective basis to guarantees issued or modified after december   while provisions of the disclosure requirements are effective for financial statements of interim or annual reports ending after december  we adopted the disclosure provisions of fin in our year ended february  in december  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure an amendment of fas sfas no 
amends statement of financial accounting standards no 
 sfas no 
accounting for stock based compensation  to provide alternative methods of transition for a voluntary change to the fair value based method of accounting for stock based employee compensation 
in addition  this statement amends the disclosure requirements of sfas no 
to require prominent disclosures about the method of accounting for stock based employee compensation and the effect of the method used on reported results 
finally  sfas no 
amends apb opinion no 
 interim financial reporting  to require disclosure about those effects in interim financial information 
the amendments to the transition and disclosure provisions shall be effective for fiscal years ending after december  the amendment to opinion shall be effective for financial reports containing financial statements for interim periods beginning after december  we adopted the disclosure provisions of sfas no 
for the year ended february  in january  the fasb issued fin  consolidation of variable interest entities 
in general  a variable interest entity is a corporation  partnership  trust  or any other legal structure used for business purposes that either a does not have equity investors with voting rights or b has equity investors that do not provide sufficient financial resources for the entity to support its activities 
fin requires certain variable interest entities to be consolidated by the primary beneficiary of the entity if the investors do not have the characteristics of a controlling financial interest or do not have sufficient equity at risk for the entity to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support from other parties 
the consolidation requirements of fin apply immediately to variable interest entities created after january  the consolidation requirements apply to older entities in interim periods beginning after june  certain of the disclosure requirements apply in all financial statements issued after january   regardless of when the variable interest entity was established 
because we currently have no investments in variable interest entities  we expect the adoption of the provisions of fin will not have a material impact on the consolidated results of operations or financial position 
risk factors you should carefully consider the risks described below before making a decision to invest in our common stock 
the risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones facing intraware 
additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we do not currently believe are important to an investor may also harm our business operations 
if any of the events  contingencies  circumstances or conditions described in the following risks actually occur  our business  financial condition or our results of operations could be seriously harmed 
if that occurs  the trading price of our common stock could decline  and you may lose part or all of your investment 
our subscribenet service is our primary service offering and demand for this service remains uncertain in the current economic climate 
in may  we sold our asset management software business 
accordingly  our subscribenet electronic software delivery and management service is now our primary service offering 
we market the subscribenet service primarily to enterprise software companies  and many enterprise software companies have reported reductions in demand and lowered forecasts for their products and services over the past year 
we may experience similar reductions in demand for our subscribenet service  which would have an immediate and adverse effect on us 
our planned growth in revenues is dependent in part on expected revenues from untested products and services 
our planned growth in revenues and contract value  and our planned improvement in net loss per share  in fiscal year assume that a substantial portion of our fiscal year revenue will be derived from products and services we have not yet sold  and that in some cases we have not yet released 
for example  our planned revenue growth assumes significant sales of the following products and services 
we have not sold any of these products or services yet  and some of them are not ready for sale 
content delivery network services web caching services  recently offered under a resale arrangement with cable wireless internet services  inc  which enable customers to deliver content worldwide on a x basis through cable wireless global server network 
subscribenet software product licenses a planned version of our subscribenet solution that would be hosted by the customer on its own servers 
we would provide a subscribenet software license to the customer  as well as implementation services and ongoing support and maintenance of the solution 
this is a potential product and is not currently available 
software license management and digital rights management applications a planned set of new software license management and digital rights management tools 
these new tools would enable our esdm customers to expand their esdm capabilities to include automation of end user licensing of their software  as well as activation  deactivation and enforcement of usage rights 
we may offer these new capabilities through one or more arrangements with third party providers of electronic license management and digital rights management technologies 
these are potential offerings that are not currently available 
print on demand 
a solution that would enable end users to order documentation for their licensed software through the software company s subscribenet site 
documentation would be generated by a third party in printed  cd rom or dvd format and would be delivered directly to the end users 
this is a potential offering that is not currently available 
system integration services 
business process and related systems integration consulting services 
these services would focus on improving  integrating and streamlining a company s enterprise resource planning  e commerce  digital rights management  customer relationship management  supply chain management  release management and reporting systems 
this is a potential offering that is not currently available 
our failure to derive significant revenues from these new products and services  especially our subscribenet software product licenses  in our fiscal year could have a material adverse effect on us 
if nasdaq determines that we have failed to meet its smallcap market listing requirements  our common stock may be delisted 
effective may   our common stock moved from being listed on the nasdaq national market to being listed on the nasdaq smallcap market 
nasdaq has requirements a company must meet in order to remain listed on the nasdaq smallcap market 
one requirement is that the bid price of a company s stock remain at or above 
the bid price of our common stock fell and remained below on several occasions during fiscal year if the bid price of our common stock remains below for an extended period  our grace period for regaining compliance with the minimum bid price requirement is likely to be limited to months  and is unlikely to be extended because we may be unable to meet the core initial listing criteria for the nasdaq smallcap market 
if as a result of the application of any of nasdaq s listing requirements  our common stock were delisted from the nasdaq smallcap market  our stock would become harder to buy and sell 
further  our stock could be subject to what are known as the penny stock rules  which place additional requirements on broker dealers who sell or make a market in such securities 
consequently  if we were removed from the nasdaq smallcap market  the ability or willingness of broker dealers to sell or make a market in our common stock might decline 
as a result  your ability to resell your shares of our common stock could be adversely affected 
we expect to have negative cash flow from operations for fiscal year and may not have sufficient cash to continue operations or  even if we can continue operations  to effectively manage our working capital requirements and fund our operations for the period required to achieve profitability 
this annual report on form k contains a disclosure expressing substantial doubt regarding our ability to continue as a going concern as a result of our recurring losses and negative cash flows from operations 
we continue to experience recurring losses and negative cash flows from operations  and there is no assurance that we will succeed in generating sufficient revenue to enable us to continue operations over the longer term 
as of february   we had approximately million in cash and cash equivalents and working capital of approximately million 
we may not be able to achieve the revenue and gross margin objectives necessary to achieve and maintain positive cash flow or profitability without obtaining additional financing 
such financing may not be available on reasonable terms  and if available  such additional financing may dilute current stockholders 
if such financing is required and we cannot obtain it  we will have to substantially curtail or discontinue operations 
we have a history of losses  we expect future losses and we may not ever become profitable 
we have not achieved profitability  may incur net losses through our fiscal year ending february   and may not ever become profitable in the future 
we incurred net losses attributable to common stockholders of million for the fiscal year ended february   million for the fiscal year ended february   and million for the fiscal year ended february  as of february   we had an accumulated deficit of approximately million 
we will need to generate significant additional online services and technology revenues and or reduce operating costs to achieve positive cash flow and profitability 
we have a limited operating history that makes it difficult to forecast our future operating results 
we cannot be certain we will achieve sufficient revenues or gross profits in future quarters to achieve profitability or positive cash flow 
our relationship with sun microsystems has diminished substantially and our future revenues will be adversely affected as a result 
since we began operations  we have derived a substantial portion of our subscribenet revenue through our relationship with netscape communications corporation  which was transferred to sun microsystems  inc when sun took over netscape s e commerce software business 
in march  we signed a new agreement with sun for our provision of the subscribenet service and initial software license fulfillment services to sun through june during our fiscal year sun accounted for greater than of our revenues 
in october  sun amended that agreement to make the subscribenet service cancelable by either party on december   or at the end of any calendar quarter thereafter  provided the canceling party gave days notice 
sun provided such a notice and canceled the subscribenet portion of the agreement effective march  the fulfillment portion of the agreement will remain in effect through june  however  the fees payable by sun for our fulfillment services have been reduced substantially effective march  our revenue expectations take into account the reduced fees under our sun agreement and are significantly lower than they would have been had sun not reduced the scope of its services agreement with us 
termination of our relationship with software spectrum or zomax incorporated would have a substantial adverse effect on our business 
under our sales alliance agreement with software spectrum dated june   we have transitioned to software spectrum our reseller relationship with sun microsystems  inc for sun one products 
a significant portion of our online services and technology revenues since july have been generated through this software spectrum contract  and this software spectrum contract accounted for greater than of our revenues during our fiscal year it is possible that a significant portion of our revenues in future periods could be generated through this contract 
in addition  software spectrum shares with us a portion of its gross profit from resales of sun one software licenses and maintenance  and reimburses us for a significant portion of our personnel costs relating to maintaining a team dedicated to sales of sun one software licenses and maintenance 
the term of this agreement will expire in june and is renewable for subsequent one year terms 
we expect but cannot guarantee that it will be renewed 
any non renewal of this agreement would likely have a material adverse effect on us 
under our strategic alliance agreement with zomax incorporated dated august   zomax markets and resells intraware s subscribenet esdm service to zomax customer base 
under the agreement zomax will pay intraware a minimum of million in fees over years  subject to some conditions  including zomax right to cancel this agreement at any time upon one year s prior written notice 
any early termination of this contract could have a material adverse effect on us 
we describe the relationship between zomax and intraware further in part iv  item exhibits  financial statement schedules and reports on form k  note of our notes to consolidated financial statements  and part iv  item exhibits  financial statement schedules and reports on form k  note of our notes to consolidated financial statements 
our quarterly financial results are subject to significant fluctuations because of many factors and any of these could adversely affect our stock price 
our operating results have fallen below the expectations of public market analysts and investors in the past 
it is likely that in future quarters our operating results will again be below the expectations of public market analysts and investors and as a result  the price of our common stock may fall 
our operating results have varied widely in the past  and we expect that they will continue to vary significantly from quarter to quarter due to a number of factors  including potential cancellations of subscribenet contracts due to development of in house electronic software download systems by our customers  potential weakening of demand for our subscribenet services and sun one products we sell jointly with software spectrum  the unwillingness of potential customers to purchase our services due to concerns about our financial strength  the timing of sales of our services  potential additional cost cutting in our sales and marketing  product development and support areas  potential loss of strategic relationships with major customers and resellers  potential delays in introducing our products and services according to planned release schedules  changes in our pricing policies  reluctance among software companies to accept or outsource electronic delivery of their software  potential technical difficulties  system failures or internet downtime  potential changes in the regulatory environment  our ability to upgrade and develop our information technology systems and infrastructure  costs related to acquisitions of technology or businesses  and general economic conditions  as well as those specific to the software  internet and related industries 
in addition  our june agreement with software spectrum  under which we have transitioned to software spectrum our business of reselling sun one software  has resulted in and will continue to result in a decrease in overall revenue to us 
our may sale of our asset management software business to computer associates international  inc has resulted in a substantial decrease in our revenue and gross profit 
our operating expenses  which include sales and marketing  product development and general and administrative expenses  are based on our expectations of future gross profits and are relatively fixed in the short term 
if gross profits fall below our expectations and we are not able to quickly reduce our spending in response  our operating results would be adversely affected 
software manufacturers may not wish to start using  and our current customers may not wish to continue to use  our subscribenet service as a way of outsourcing electronic delivery of their software 
our strategy for achieving profitability assumes significant revenue growth from our subscribenet service 
however  we cannot assure you that software manufacturers that are not currently our subscribenet customers will find it strategically or economically justifiable to use or start using  or that our current customers will find it strategically or economically justifiable to increase their use of or continue using  the subscribenet service to deliver software to their end users 
some software manufacturers are reluctant for security reasons to deliver their software via the internet or to authorize a third party to do so on their behalf 
some software manufacturers believe that they can internally develop an adequate electronic software delivery system at a cost lower than the fees we charge for the subscribenet service 
these and other concerns on the part of software manufacturers could make it difficult for us to achieve growth in subscribenet revenue  which could in turn hinder our ability to achieve profitability and maintain positive cash flow 
we are dependent on market acceptance of electronic software delivery  and if it does not achieve widespread acceptance  our business will be adversely affected 
our future success will depend in large part on broadened acceptance by information technology professionals of electronic software delivery as a method of receiving business software 
if electronic software delivery does not achieve widespread market acceptance  our business will be adversely affected 
electronic software delivery is a relatively new method of distributing software products and the growth and market acceptance of electronic software delivery is highly uncertain and subject to a number of risk factors 
these factors include the potential for state and local authorities to levy taxes on internet transactions  the cost of maintaining sufficient network bandwidth to enable purchasers to rapidly download software  the limited number of software packages available for electronic software delivery as compared to those available through traditional delivery methods  customer unfamiliarity with and resistance to the process of downloading software  and customer concerns about transaction security 
even if electronic software delivery achieves widespread acceptance  we cannot be sure we will overcome the substantial technical challenges associated with electronically delivering software reliably and consistently on a long term basis 
furthermore  the proliferation of software viruses poses a risk to market acceptance of electronic software delivery 
any well publicized transmission of a computer virus by us or another company using electronic software delivery could deter information technology professionals from utilizing electronic software delivery technology and our business could be adversely affected 
increased security risks of online commerce may deter future use of our services 
concerns over the security of transactions conducted on the internet and the privacy of users may also inhibit the growth of our subscribenet service 
any failure by us to prevent security breaches could significantly harm our business and results of operations 
we cannot be certain that advances in computer capabilities  new discoveries in the field of cryptography  or other developments will not result in a compromise or breach of the algorithms we use to protect our customers transaction data or our software vendors products 
anyone who is able to circumvent our security measures could misappropriate proprietary information or cause interruptions in our operations 
we may be required to incur significant costs to protect against security breaches or to alleviate problems caused by breaches 
any well publicized compromise of security could deter people from using the web to conduct transactions involving transmission of confidential information or download of sensitive materials 
the loss of one or more of our key customers could adversely affect our revenues 
a substantial amount of revenue from our subscribenet service in any given future period may come from a relatively small number of customers 
in addition  a substantial amount of our revenue derives from our agreements with software spectrum and zomax 
if one or more major customers were to stop using our services or products  our operating results could be materially adversely affected 
our contractual relationships with most of these customers are subject to renewal annually 
as a result  we cannot assure you that any of our customers will renew their contracts with us in any given year 
our industry is highly competitive and we cannot assure you that we will be able to effectively compete 
the market for selling online services and software is highly competitive 
we expect competition to intensify as current competitors expand and improve their service offerings  new competitors enter the market  and the business market for information technology services continues to exhibit softness 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to compete successfully against current or future competitors  or that competitive pressures faced by us will not adversely affect us 
our competitors include a number of companies offering electronic software delivery and management solutions 
we expect additional competition from other established and emerging companies as well as from potential customers who choose to develop in house alternatives to our subscribenet service 
increased competition is likely to result in price reductions  reduced gross margins and loss of market share  any of which could have a significant adverse effect on us 
many of our current and potential competitors have longer operating histories  significantly greater financial  technical  marketing and other resources  better name recognition  and a larger installed base of customers than we do 
many of our competitors may also have well established relationships with our existing and prospective customers 
our current and potential competitors have established or may establish cooperative relationships among themselves or with third parties to increase the ability of their products to address customer needs and compete with our products 
we also expect competition to increase as a result of software industry consolidations 
as a result  we may not be able to effectively compete for customers 
our executive officers and key personnel are critical to our business and these officers and key personnel may not remain with us in the future 
our future success depends upon the continued service of our executive officers and other key technology  sales  marketing and support personnel 
none of our officers or key employees is bound by an employment agreement for any specific term 
if we lost the services of one or more of our key employees  or if one or more of our executive officers or key employees decided to join a competitor or otherwise compete directly or indirectly with us  this could have a significant adverse effect on our business 
in particular  the services of peter h 
jackson  our president and chief executive officer  james a 
brentano  our senior vice president of technology and operations  and wendy a 
nieto  our chief financial officer and senior vice president of finance  would be difficult to replace 
we face risks of claims from third parties for intellectual property infringement that could adversely affect our business 
we electronically deliver third party software to end users 
this activity creates the potential for claims to be made against us  either directly or through contractual indemnification provisions with software companies 
any claims could result in costly litigation and be time consuming to defend  divert management s attention and resources  cause delays in releasing new or upgrading existing services or require us to enter into royalty or licensing agreements 
these claims could be made for defamation  negligence  patent  copyright or trademark infringement  personal injury  invasion of privacy or other legal theories based on the nature  content or copying of these materials 
litigation regarding intellectual property rights is common in the internet and software industries 
we expect that internet technologies and software products and services may be increasingly subject to third party infringement claims as the number of competitors in our industry segment grows and the functionality of products in different industry segments overlaps 
there can be no assurance that our services do not infringe on the intellectual property rights of third parties 
in addition  we may be involved in litigation involving the software of third party vendors that we have electronically distributed in the past 
royalty or licensing agreements  if required  may not be available on acceptable terms  if at all 
a successful claim of infringement against us could adversely affect our business 
although we carry general liability insurance  our insurance may not cover all potential claims or may not be adequate to protect us from all liability that may be imposed 
we take steps to verify that end users who download third party software through our subscribenet service are entitled to deploy and use that software 
however  there can be no assurance that this verification procedure will help us defend against claims by  or protect us against liability to  the owners of copyrights in that third party software 
our success and ability to compete are substantially dependent upon our internally developed technology  which we protect through a combination of patent  copyright  trade secret and trademark law 
we are aware that certain other companies are using or may have plans to use the name intraware as a company name or as a trademark or service mark 
while we have received no notice of any claims of trademark infringement from any of those companies  we cannot assure you that these companies may not claim superior rights to intraware or to other marks we use 
despite our efforts to protect our proprietary rights  unauthorized parties may attempt to copy or otherwise obtain and use our services or technology and we cannot be certain that the steps we have taken will prevent misappropriation of our technology 
our market is subject to rapid technological change and our future success will depend on our ability to meet the changing needs of our industry 
our market is characterized by rapidly changing technology  evolving industry standards and frequent new product announcements 
to be successful  we must adapt to our rapidly changing market by continually improving the performance  features and reliability of our services 
we could incur substantial costs to modify our services or infrastructure in order to adapt to these changes 
our business could be adversely affected if we incur significant costs without adequate results  or find ourselves unable to adapt rapidly to these changes 
additional government regulations may harm demand for our services and increase our costs of doing business 
our business has benefited from the tax laws of states in which purchases of software licenses are not taxable if the software is received only electronically 
some states currently experiencing revenue shortfalls are considering whether to change their laws to broaden the taxability of transactions executed over the internet 
any new imposition of taxes on sales of software licenses  where the software is received electronically  could substantially harm demand for our services and thereby materially adversely affect our business  operating results and financial condition 
in delivering third party software through our subscribenet service  we must comply with us export controls on software generally and encryption technology in particular 
changes in these laws could require us to implement costly changes to our automated export compliance processes 
the european union has enacted its own data protection and privacy directive  which required all european union member states to implement laws relating to the processing and transmission of personal data 
we must  at a minimum  comply with the data privacy safe harbor agreed upon by the european union and the us commerce department  as well as any other regulations adopted by other countries where we may do business 
the growth and development of the market for online commerce may prompt calls for more stringent consumer protection laws  both in the united states and abroad 
compliance with any newly adopted laws may prove difficult for us and may negatively affect our business 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk at the end of fiscal year  we had cash and cash equivalents of million 
we have not used derivative financial instruments in our investment portfolio during fiscal we place our investments with high quality issuers  by policy  in an effort to limit the amount of credit exposure to any one issue or issuer 
our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our investment portfolio 
we have not used derivative financial instruments in our investment portfolio 
at february   million of our cash  cash equivalents and investment portfolio carried maturity dates of less than days 
the effect of changes in interest rates of over a six month horizon would not have a material effect on the fair market value of the portfolio
