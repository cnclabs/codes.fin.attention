item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview silicon image designs  develops and markets semiconductor products for applications that require high bandwidth  cost effective solutions for high speed digital data communications 
the markets into which we sell our products are personal computer pc  consumer electronics ce and storage 
products sold into the pc market generated of our revenue in  of our revenue in and of our revenue in our products in the pc market are based on panellink technology  which is our proprietary implementation of the digital visual interface dvi specification that defines a high speed serial data communication link between computers and digital displays 
despite sluggish growth in the host portion of the pc market and a movement among graphic card manufacturers to eliminate the need for discrete transmitters by integrating transmitter functionality into their graphic chips  we expect continued dvi adoption to result in increased overall demand for discrete transmitters 
the display portion of the pc market remains predominantly analog or dual interface  which is capable of receiving either an analog or digital signal 
we do not offer an analog or dual interface solution  but do partner with other companies to sell multiple chip solutions into the dual interface market 
these multiple chip solutions are typically limited to higher end  larger displays operating at resolutions of sxga and above 
in addition  we have licensed certain of our technologies to companies for use in making products for the dual interface market 
products sold into the ce market generated of our revenue in  of our revenue in and of our revenue in our ce products offer a secure digital video and audio transmission for consumer devices 
demand for these products will be driven primarily by the adoption rate of new technologies and industry standards  such as dvi with hdcp and hdmi  respectively 
semiconductor products sold into the storage market generated of our revenue in  of our revenue in and none of our revenue in demand for our storage products is dependent upon the rate at which technology transitions from parallel to serial  and the extent to which serial ata and fibre channel functionality are integrated into chip sets and controllers offered by other companies  making our discrete become unnecessary 
sales of storage subsystems products generated of our revenue in  of our revenue in and none of our revenue in we are phasing out our subsystems products and do not plan on developing  manufacturing and selling new subsystems products in the future 
therefore  we expect sales of such products to represent less than of our revenue in in conjunction with our decision to phase out our storage systems products and change primarily to a licensing business model  we decided to design products and or license our technology to third parties in this market segment 
we anticipate continuing this business model for our storage systems technology as advancements and developments warrant 
in  a large portion of our development  licensing and royalty revenue was related to storage systems technology we acquired in connection with our acquisition of cmd technology 
the majority of this revenue was related to licensing fees associated with one storage systems provider 
this licensee paid these license fees pursuant to a development and license agreement under which we have worked with the licensee to provide custom hardware designs and firmware for use in a storage bridge controller board 
we are entitled to receive royalties beginning in the second quarter of based on the unit volume of these controller boards contained in products shipped by the licensee 
from our inception in through the first half of  we were engaged primarily in developing our first generation panellink digital transmitter and receiver products  developing our high speed digital interconnect technology  establishing our digital interface technology as an open standard  and building strategic customer and foundry relationships 
during that period  we derived substantially all of our revenue from contracts providing for the joint development of technologies for high speed digital communication and intelligent panel controllers for flat panel displays  as well as from licensing our high speed digital interconnect technology 
in the third quarter of  we began volume shipments of our first generation panellink digital transmitter and receiver products 
since that time  we have derived most of our revenue from the sale of panellink products and we have introduced several new generations of transmitter and receiver products providing higher speed and increased functionality 
in  we began shipping our first generation digital display controller product 
our digital display controller products integrate our receiver with digital image processing and display controller technology  which enables development of intelligent displays for the mass market 
in october  we raised approximately million in our initial public offering 
we have incurred losses in each year since our inception and at december   we had an accumulated deficit of million 
in  we began focusing our resources on entering two new markets  storage and ce  which we believed would grow significantly and in which we believed we could apply our technology and expertise in high speed serial interfaces 
during  we acquired zillion  a developer of high speed transmission technology for data storage applications  and dvdo  a provider of digital video processing systems for the ce market 
in  we focused on accelerating our entry into the ce and storage markets  leveraging our ip into licensing revenue and restructuring the company to improve profitability 
during  we acquired cmd  a provider of storage subsystems and semiconductors designed for storage area networks  and silicon communication lab  a provider of mixed signal and high speed circuit designs 
year during  we achieved double digit revenue growth in each fiscal quarter  resulting in record annual revenue of million  which was a increase from revenue levels 
we also began to see the benefits of our diversification strategy  which resulted in establishing a key presence in the ce and storage markets  both of which we expect to experience significant growth rates during the next several years 
additionally  we were able to successfully leverage our intellectual property to generate million of development and licensing revenue 
in the ce market  the hdmi high definition multimedia interface specification was published 
hdmi is a new standard for secure digital video and audio transmission for consumer devices 
this standard was created by silicon image  together with sony  matsushita electric panasonic  philips  thomson rca  hitachi and toshiba  and with strong support from fox and universal studios  directv and echostar 
we announced our first hdmi products in the fourth quarter and believe every digital tv  dvd and set top box will include a digital interconnect  whether it is dvi with high definition content protection hdcp or hdmi  within the next five years 
during the year  dvi with hdcp was embraced by high end manufacturers of digital tvs  dvds and set top boxes 
in the storage market  we announced our new satalink family of end to end serial ata solutions for the storage market  including a fully integrated pci to sata controller 
intel selected our product for inclusion on their next generation motherboards  and we were able to achieve numerous design wins with our satalink products 
we believe we are well positioned for the anticipated transition to serial ata technology  which has been somewhat limited to this point by the availability of serial ata enabled hard drives 
additionally  we achieved key design wins with our fibre channel products and are positioned to benefit as we anticipate that gb switches will become the industry standard 
demand declined throughout the year for our parallel ata and usb products as the market began to transition to serial ata and usb we expect demand for these legacy products to continue to decrease throughout in the pc market  display search  an independent research firm  estimates that the dvi adoption rate increased to in  from in we expect the adoption rate to increase significantly during the next two years as quality  cost and content will make an all digital connection more attractive than an analog solution  and we also expect the prices of digital displays to continue to decrease 
our transmitter products continued to experience competitive pressure  primarily from thine and texas instruments  resulting in lower average selling prices for these products 
we are still the market leader for discrete transmitter products  but expect graphic card manufacturers to continue to integrate a transmitter into their graphics chip  thus eliminating the need for a discrete transmitter device in many host products 
we believe that integration in the next two to three years will be limited to lower resolution technology  and that higher resolutions will continue to require a discrete transmitter to achieve high resolution quality 
during  we introduced a low cost add in card that can be used in conjunction with intel s g chip set to provide an all digital connection to flat panels 
prior to this introduction  a more expensive  high end graphics card was needed for high quality digital video and graphics 
we continued to lose market share in the receiver market during  as oems continued to use dual interface solutions in flat panels to accommodate both digital and analog signals 
we were able to partner with other companies to offer a three chip discrete solution that we believe is a cost effective alternative to a dual interface solution 
in addition  we generated licensing revenue by licensing certain technology to companies for use in making products for the dual interface market 
during  we also focused on improving the company s profitability and reducing our cash usage rate 
our cash and short term investments declined by million in  versus million in outlook we expect revenue to increase from the level achieved in  and believe our revenue in the first quarter of will be flat to slightly up from the fourth quarter of we expect to be cash flow positive in our expectation of overall revenue growth and positive cash flow in is based on four assumptions 
first  we believe the dvi adoption rate will increase in the pc market as the quality  cost and content capabilities of all digital solutions become more attractive than those offered by analog solutions and as prices of digital displays become lower 
display search forecasts the adoption rate to increase from approximately in the fourth quarter of to approximately by the end of second  we achieved numerous design wins in the ce market for dvi with hdcp and hdmi products  and expect these designs to go into production in the middle of the year 
although it is difficult to predict exactly when and how aggressively revenue from these products will ramp during  our expectation is that we will generate significant revenue from these designs in the second quarter and that revenue will grow quarter over quarter throughout the remainder of third  we believe that the storage market will continue its transitions to gb fibre channel switches and serial ata technology  which should result in increasing revenue from our fibre channel and satalink products 
we expect the availability of serial ata enabled hard drives and other peripherals to improve  which should enable acceleration of the transition to serial ata technology 
fourth  we expect licensing and royalty revenue to nearly double during as we continue to implement our strategy of licensing our technology to companies that address market segments in which we have chosen not to directly participate  and expect to begin receiving royalties from licenses entered into during and among the factors that may cause our actual results to differ materially from those anticipated by our assumptions include the rate at which the pc market adopts dvi  ce market acceptance of our dvi with hdcp and hdmi products  the rate at which the storage market transitions to gb fibre channel switches and serial ata technology  consumer demand in the pc and ce markets  the availability of serial ata enabled hard drives and other peripherals  whether and how quickly oems are able to integrate transmitters in their graphics chips  our ability to leverage our intellectual property into licensing revenue and the ability of our semiconductor foundries to manufacture our products in commercial volumes at an acceptable cost and in a timely manner 
in addition  our revenue remains dependent on competition and general economic and market conditions  none of which can be accurately predicted 
we expect our gross margin percentage to increase slightly from levels as a result of higher licensing revenue  for which there is no associated cost of sales  manufacturing cost reductions on certain of our higher volume products  higher unit volume and shifts in product mix whereby higher margin ce products will generate a higher percentage of our total revenue and lower margin storage board products will generate nominal revenue 
these positive effects will be offset by declining average selling prices asps  especially for products in the pc market  and higher manufacturing overhead spending to support increased production levels for products in the ce and storage markets 
excluding non cash charges for stock compensation expense  we expect the dollar amount of our r d expense to increase approximately in r d expense will be incurred for enhancements to existing products and for further development of technology related to consumer electronics and storage applications 
excluding non cash charges for stock compensation expense  we expect sg a expense for to increase approximately over  primarily as a result of our scheduled implementation of a new erp system in and increased headcount levels necessary to support our revenue growth 
our plan is to control r d and sg a expenses such that these expenses  exclusive of non cash charges for stock compensation expense  in the fourth quarter of represent approximately of our fourth quarter revenue 
we expect to incur substantial non cash stock compensation expense in and future periods as a result of previous stock option repricings  stock options assumed in connection with our acquisitions in and  the issuance of stock options to consultants  and modifications to stock options 
we may also incur non cash stock compensation expense in connection with future acquisitions 
the amount of stock compensation expense in each period will fluctuate with changes in our stock price and volatility 
during and future periods  we may also incur non cash expenses for the impairment or amortization of intangible assets 
we will also incur legal fees in in conjunction with our patent infringement lawsuit against genesis 
the amount of legal fees incurred will depend on the duration of the litigation  as well as the nature and extent of the litigation activities 
we are not able to accurately estimate the amount of legal fees we will incur with respect to this matter  however  we do expect to incur substantial amounts through at least the first half of in march  we exercised an option to acquire transwarp networks transwarp  a privately held storage networking company 
in connection with this acquisition  we anticipate issuing approximately million shares of our common stock in exchange for all outstanding shares of transwarp capital stock  and converting all outstanding transwarp stock options into options to purchase approximately  shares of our common stock 
we also anticipate assuming transwarp s stock option plan and having a remaining reserve of approximately  shares available for issuance under such plan following the acquisition 
we anticipate adding approximately employees as a result of this acquisition 
subject to the satisfaction of customary closing conditions  including due diligence and no material adverse changes  we anticipate that the acquisition will close in april in march  we reorganized our business to better enable customer focus  strategic alignment and operational excellence 
as part of this reorganization  we will reduce our workforce by approximately people  or 
these reductions will be primarily in engineering and operations functions 
as a result of our workforce reduction  we expect to record a restructuring expense consisting of severance costs and non cash expenses for stock option modifications in the first quarter of commitments  contingencies and concentrations in september  we entered into an agreement with intel to develop and promote the adoption of a digital display interface specification 
in connection with this agreement  we granted intel a warrant to purchase  shares of our common stock at per share 
under the same agreement  we granted intel a warrant to purchase  shares of our common stock at per share upon achievement of a specified milestone that was reached during the first quarter of both of these warrants were exercised in may additionally  if a second specified milestone is achieved  which we do not believe is likely  we would be required to grant intel a third warrant to purchase  shares of our common stock at per share 
the estimated fair value of the warrant at december  was million 
historically  a relatively small number of customers and distributors have generated a significant portion of our revenue 
for instance  our top five customers  including distributors  generated   and of our revenue in  and  respectively 
the decrease in from prior year levels can be attributed to our market diversification 
additionally  the percentage of revenue generated through distributors tends to be significant  since many oem s rely upon third party manufacturers or distributors to provide purchasing and inventory management functions 
in  of revenue was generated through distributors  compared to in and in our licensing revenue is not generated through distributors  and to the extent licensing revenue increases  we would expect a decrease in the percentage of our revenue generated through distributors 
a significant portion of our revenue is generated from products sold overseas 
sales to customers in asia  including distributors  generated   and of our revenue in   and  respectively 
the reason for our geographical concentration in asia is that most of our products are part of flat panel displays  graphic cards and motherboards  the majority of which are manufactured in asia 
the percentage of our revenue derived from any country is dependent upon where our end customers choose to manufacture their products 
accordingly  variability in our geographic revenue is not necessarily indicative of any geographic trends  but rather is the combined effect of new design wins and changes in customer manufacturing locations 
all revenue to date has been denominated in us dollars 
critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes 
we base our estimates on historical experience and all known facts and circumstances that we believe are relevant 
actual results may differ materially from our estimates 
we believe the following accounting policies are critical  either because they relate to financial statement line items that are key indicators of our financial performance such as revenue and or because their application requires significant management judgment 
revenue recognition for products sold directly to end users  or to distributors that do not receive price concessions and do not have rights of return  we recognize revenue upon shipment and title transfer if we believe collection is reasonably assured 
reserves for sales returns and allowances are estimated based primarily on historical experience and are provided at the time of shipment 
the amount of sales returns and allowances has not been  and is not expected to be  material 
for sales to distributors with agreements allowing for price concessions and product returns  we recognize revenue based on our best estimate of when the distributor sold the product to its end customer 
our estimate of distributor sell through to end customers is based on point of sales reports received from our distributors 
due to the timing of receipt of these reports  we recognize distributor sell through using information that lags quarter end by one month 
revenue is not recognized upon shipment since  due to various forms of price concessions  the sales price is not substantially fixed or determinable at that time 
additionally  these distributors have contractual rights to return products  up to a specified amount for a given period of time 
revenue is earned when the distributor sells the product to an end user  at which time our sales price to the distributor becomes fixed 
pursuant to our distributor agreements  older or end of life products are sold with no right of return and are not eligible for price concessions 
for these products  revenue is recognized upon shipment and title transfer if we believe collection is reasonably assured 
at the time of shipment to distributors  we record a trade receivable for the selling price since there is a legally enforceable right to payment  relieve inventory for the carrying value of goods shipped since legal title has passed to the distributor  and record the gross margin in deferred margin on sales to distributors  a component of current liabilities on the balance sheet 
deferred margin represents the gross margin on the sale to the distributor  however  the amount of gross margin we recognize in future periods could be less than the deferred margin as a result of price concessions 
we do not reduce deferred margin by estimated future price concessions  instead  price concessions are recorded when incurred  which is generally at the time the distributor sells the product to an end user 
the difference between deferred margin and the margin actually recognized has not been material in the past  however  since price concessions are highly dependent upon market conditions  there can be no assurance that the difference will not be material in the future 
price concessions are not granted for amounts in excess of the deferred margin 
license revenue is recognized when an agreement with a licensee exists  the price is fixed or determinable  delivery or performance has occurred  and collection is reasonably assured 
generally  we expect to meet these criteria and recognize revenue at the time we deliver the agreed upon items 
however  we may defer recognition of revenue until cash is received if collection is not reasonably assured at the time of delivery  and we may enter into agreements requiring customer acceptance of deliverables  in which case we would defer recognition of revenue until the licensee has accepted the deliverables 
development revenue is recognized when project milestones have been completed and acknowledged by the other party to the development agreement  and collection is reasonably assured 
allowance for doubtful accounts we review collectibility of accounts receivable on an on going basis and provide an allowance for amounts we estimate will not be collectible 
during our review  we consider our historical experience  the age of the receivable balance  the credit worthiness of the customer  and the reason for the delinquency 
write offs to date have not been material 
at december   we had million of gross accounts receivable and an allowance for doubtful accounts of  inventories and related reserves we record inventories at the lower of standard cost  determined on a first in first out basis  or market 
standard cost approximates actual cost 
standard costs are determined based on our estimate of material costs  manufacturing yields  costs to assemble  test and package our products  and allocable indirect costs 
we review differences between standard and actual costs  and  based on the nature of the difference  determine whether to record the amount on our balance sheet or in our statement of operations 
standard costs are evaluated at least twice each year 
reserves are provided for excess and obsolete inventory  and are estimated based on a comparison of the quantity and cost of inventory on hand to management s forecast of customer demand 
customer demand is dependent on many factors and requires us to use significant judgment in our forecasting process 
we must also make assumptions regarding the rate at which new products will be accepted in the marketplace and at which customers will transition from older products to newer products 
generally  inventories in excess of six months demand are fully reserved and the related charge is recorded as a cost of revenue 
once a reserve is established  it is maintained until the product to which it relates is sold or otherwise disposed of  even if in subsequent periods we forecast demand for the product 
this treatment is in accordance with accounting research bulletin and staff accounting bulletin at december  and  we had gross inventories of million and million  respectively  and reserves for excess and obsolete inventory of million and million  respectively 
long lived assets consideration paid in connection with acquisitions is required to be allocated to the assets  including identifiable intangible assets  and liabilities acquired 
acquired assets and liabilities are recorded based on our estimate of fair value  which requires significant judgment with respect to future cash flows and discount rates 
for certain long lived assets  primarily fixed assets and intangible assets  we are required to estimate the useful life of the asset and recognize its cost as an expense over the useful life 
we use the straight line method to depreciate long lived assets 
additionally  pursuant to sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  we periodically assess whether long lived assets have been impaired 
we deem an asset to be impaired if its estimated fair value is less than the cost at which it is recorded on our balance sheet 
our estimate of fair value is based on the net present value of expected future cash flows attributable to the asset 
predicting future cash flows attributable to a particular asset is difficult  and requires the use of significant judgment 
at december   we had million of long lived assets recorded on our balance sheet 
deferred tax assets we account for income taxes using an asset and liability approach  which requires recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our financial statements  but have not been reflected in our taxable income 
a valuation allowance is established to reduce deferred tax assets to their estimated realizable value 
therefore  we provide a valuation allowance to the extent we do not believe it is more likely than not that we will generate sufficient taxable income in future periods to realize the benefit of our deferred tax assets 
predicting future taxable income is difficult  and requires the use of significant judgment 
at december   we had a net operating loss carryforward for federal income tax purposes of approximately million  against which a full valuation allowance has been provided 
accrued liabilities certain of our accrued liabilities are based largely on estimates 
for instance  we record a liability on our balance sheet each period for the estimated cost of goods and services rendered to us  for which we have not received an invoice 
additionally  a component of our restructuring reserve related to a loss we expect to incur for excess leased facility space is based on numerous assumptions and estimates  such as the market value of the space and the time it will take to sublease the space 
our estimates are based on historical experience  input from sources outside the company  and other relevant facts and circumstances 
actual amounts could differ materially from these estimates 
stock based compensation expense we are required to determine the fair value of stock option grants to non employees  and to record the amount as an expense over the period during which services are provided to us 
management calculates the fair value of these stock option grants using the black scholes model  which requires us to estimate the life of the stock option  the volatility of our stock  an appropriate risk free interest rate  and our dividend yield 
the calculation of fair value is highly sensitive to the expected life of the stock option and the volatility of our stock  both of which we estimate based primarily on historical experience 
recent accounting pronouncements in june  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement no 
sfas no 
 accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities 
sfas no 
addresses issues regarding the recognition  measurement and reporting of costs associated with exit and disposal activities  including restructuring activities  costs related to terminating a contract that is not a capital lease and termination benefits provided under a one time benefit arrangement to involuntarily terminated employees 
sfas no 
requires that an expense associated with an exit or disposal activity be recognized when a liability is incurred  and that fair value be used for the initial measurement of the liability 
sfas no 
is effective for all exit or disposal activities that are initiated after december  in november  the fasb issued interpretation no 
interpretation  guarantor s accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees  including guarantees of indebtedness of others 
interpretation clarifies disclosure  recognition and measurement requirements related to certain guarantees 
the disclosure requirements are effective for financial statements issued after december  and the recognition and measurement requirements are effective for guarantees issued or modified after december  the company does not expect the adoption of interpretation to have a significant effect on its results of operations or financial condition 
in december  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure 
sfas no 
amends sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  to provide alternative methods of transition for a voluntary change to the fair value based method of accounting for stock based employee compensation 
in addition  sfas no 
amends the disclosure requirements of sfas no 
to require prominent disclosures in both annual and interim financial statements about the method of accounting for stock based employee compensation and the effect of the method used on reported results 
the transition guidance and annual disclosure provisions of sfas no 
are effective for fiscal years ending after december  the interim disclosure provisions of sfas no 
are effective for interim periods beginning after december  we have adopted the disclosure requirements of sfas no 
as of december  annual results of operations revenue 
revenue was million for  an increase of from million for this increase was the result of several factors the dvi adoption rate in the pc market increased to in  from in  a full year s worth of revenue in from fibre channel products that were introduced late in  which contributed million of incremental revenue in  increased sales of parallel ata and usb controllers acquired in connection with our acquisition of cmd in june revenue from these products increased by million in  primarily as a result of including a full year s worth of revenue  versus only months worth of revenue in  the introduction of serial ata products in  which contributed million of revenue  our ability to leverage our intellectual property to generate million of licensing revenue in  versus no licensing revenue in  and adoption of dvi with hdcp in for high end consumer products in the ce market 
these positive factors were partially offset by the effect of our decision as part of our strategic restructuring program to de emphasize our storage subsystems board business in  which resulted in revenue from such products being million less than the amount  and the effect of declining asps during revenue by market was as follows in thousands year ended december  pc    consumer electronics    storage ic   storage systems   development  licensing and royalties  revenue was million for  an increase of from million for this increase was primarily the result of our acquisition of cmd in june  which contributed million of revenue in without cmd  our revenue would have been million in  a decrease of from this decrease was primarily the result of a decrease in unit demand and to a lesser extent  to lower average selling prices 
weaker demand was largely attributable to a downturn in the semiconductor industry that began in the fourth quarter of to a lesser extent  increased competition in the pc market from companies offering dual interface solutions reduced demand and average selling prices for our digital receiver products 
cost of revenue 
cost of revenue consists primarily of costs incurred to manufacture  assemble and test our products  as well as related overhead costs 
gross margin revenue minus cost of revenue  as a percentage of revenue  excluding non cash stock compensation expense  was for  for and for the increase in gross margin from to was due to our ability to generate million of licensing revenue in  which has low cost of revenue associated with it and contributed to our gross margin  offset by the effect of declining asps and increased revenue from serial ata products  which have lower margins relative to our other volume products 
the decrease in gross margin from to was primarily due to the effect of lower volume and average selling prices during and  to a lesser extent  our acquisition of cmd in  which had lower margin board products 
cost of revenue excludes non cash stock compensation expense of million   and  for  and  respectively 
including stock compensation expense  our product gross margin would have been  and for  and  respectively 
research and development 
r d expense consists primarily of compensation and related costs for employees  fees for independent contractors  the cost of software tools used for designing and testing our products  and costs associated with prototype materials 
r d expense  excluding non cash stock compensation expense  was million  or of revenue  for  compared to million  or of revenue  for  and million  or of revenue  for the increase in absolute dollars for can be attributed primarily to our acquisition of cmd in june  which increased spending by million in due to the inclusion of months of cmd related expense in  versus only months of expense in additionally  we increased our product development efforts in in order to accelerate our entrance into the storage and ce markets 
we introduced new products in  versus in these increases were partially offset by an additional one week shutdown in the increase in absolute dollars in was primarily due to additional personnel and acquisitions of cmd and scl 
these acquisitions accounted for million of the million expense increase from increased r d expense as a percentage of revenue in reflected our intentional investment to gain initial penetration into the ce and storage markets 
r d excludes non cash stock compensation expense of million  million  and million for   and  respectively 
including stock compensation expense  r d expense would have been million  million  and million  or   and  of revenue for   and  respectively 
selling  general and administrative 
sg a expense consists primarily of employee compensation and benefits  sales commissions  and marketing and promotional expenses 
excluding non cash stock compensation expense  sg a expense was million  or of revenue for  million  or of revenue  for  and million  or of revenue  for the decrease in spending for can be attributed primarily to a reduction in sg a headcount from at december  to at december  additionally  as part of our expense management efforts in  we implemented an additional one week shutdown in and reduced spending on discretionary items such as advertising  travel and professional fees 
lastly  we were able to reduce spending in by consolidating space in our facilities 
the change from to can be attributed to the acquisitions of cmd and scl  which contributed million of additional sg a expense in  offset by the effects of our headcount reduction in and lower advertising expenses 
sg a excludes non cash stock compensation expense of million for and million for both and including stock compensation expense  sg a expense would have been million  million and million  or  and of revenue for   and  respectively 
stock compensation 
stock compensation expense was million  or of revenue  for  million  or of revenue  for  and million  or of revenue  for the decrease from to can be attributed to use of the accelerated method for recognizing expense for stock options granted to employees and for stock options assumed in connection with acquisitions  which results in a higher proportion of the expense being recognized in earlier periods 
these decreases are partially offset by expense recognized in for options repriced in and  as our average stock price in exceeded the strike price of the repriced options 
we did not recognize expense in or in conjunction with our stock option repricings since our average stock price in those periods was less than the exercise price of the repriced options 
the decrease in expense from to can be attributed primarily to our use of the accelerated method for recognizing expense for certain grants to employees  which results in a higher proportion of the expense being recognized in the initial year of grant 
additionally  our average stock price was lower during  which also affected the amount of expense we recognized for certain options 
those decreases were partially offset by expense of million associated with our acquisitions of cmd and scl 
the following table summarizes the components of our stock compensation expense for  and in thousands 
year ended december  options granted to employees    options granted to non employees    option repricings  options assumed in connection with acquisitions   we will incur substantial non cash stock compensation expense in future periods as a result of the issuance of  or modifications to  restricted stock awards and stock option grants to employees and consultants  the stock option repricing programs we implemented in and  and amortization of our existing unearned compensation balance 
since the expense associated with our stock option repricings and stock options issued to consultants is dependent on our stock price and volatility  stock compensation expense may fluctuate significantly from period to period 
although to date we have recognized only million of expense in connection with our stock option repricings  this may become a significant component of our stock compensation expense in future periods if our weighted average stock price exceeds  the exercise price of these repriced stock options 
approximately million of our million stock options outstanding as of december  were repriced in and amortization of goodwill and intangible assets 
for  we recorded million of expense for the amortization of goodwill and intangible assets  compared to million for and million for the decrease from to can be attributed to adoption of a new accounting standard that required companies to no longer amortize goodwill to expense beginning january   and to the impairment charges recorded against intangible assets in and that reduced the carrying value of the assets subject to amortization 
the increase in can be attributed to additional acquisitions in  and to a full year of expense recorded in  versus a partial year in  for the acquisitions we completed in in process research and development in process research and development represents technology that has not reached technological feasibility and that has no alternative future use as of the acquisition date 
cmd during the quarter ended june   we recorded a one time operating expense of million for in process research and development incurred in connection with the acquisition of cmd 
as of the acquisition date  there were four identified development projects that met the necessary criteria titan u  titan 
next  sanbox and ide ultra the value of these projects was determined by estimating their future cash flows from the time they were expected to become commercially feasible  discounting the net cash flows to their present value  and applying a percentage of completion to the calculated values 
the net cash flows from the identified projects were based on estimates of revenue  cost of revenue  research and development expenses  selling general and administrative expenses  and applicable income taxes 
these estimates did not take into account any potential synergies that could be realized as a result of the acquisition  and were in line with industry averages and growth estimates for the storage and semiconductor industries 
revenue for titan u was expected to commence in the fourth quarter of and to extend through revenue for ide ultra was expected to commence in the fourth quarter of and extend through  and revenue for both titan 
next and sanbox was expected to commence in and extend through we based our revenue projections on estimates of market size and growth  expected trends in technology and the expected timing of new product introductions by our competitors and us 
the discount rate used for all projects was  a rate that is consistent with the estimated rates of return on our intangible assets 
this rate is higher than the industry weighted average cost of capital because of the risks associated with the inherent uncertainties of the successful development of the in process research and development  market acceptance of the technology  the useful life of the technology  the profitability level of such technology and the uncertainty of technological advances 
the percentage of completion for each project was determined based on research and development expenses incurred immediately prior to the acquisition as a percentage of total estimated research and development expenses to bring each project to technological feasibility 
as of june   we estimated that titan u was complete with total projected costs of  that titan 
next was complete with total projected costs of  that sanbox was complete with total projected costs of  and that ide ultra was complete with total projected costs of  consistent with our projections  revenue related to titan u and ide ultra commenced in the fourth of quarter of development of titan 
next and sanbox was not completed 
dvdo during the quarter ended september   a one time in process research and development expense related to the acquisition of dvdo was recorded in the amount of million 
as of the date of our acquisition of dvdo  there was one identified project that met the necessary criteria  the image enhancement chip 
the value of this project was determined by estimating its future cash flows from the time it was expected to become commercially feasible  discounting the net cash flows to their present value  and applying a percentage of completion to the calculated value 
the net cash flows from the identified project were based on estimates of revenue  cost of revenue  research and development expenses  selling general and administrative expenses  and applicable income taxes for the project 
these estimates did not take into account any potential synergies that could be realized as a result of the acquisition  and were in line with industry averages and growth estimates for the semiconductor industry 
revenue for the project was expected to begin in the first quarter of and extend through we based our revenue projection on estimates of market size and growth  expected trends in technology and the expected timing of new product introductions by our competitors and us 
the discount rate used was  a rate that is consistent with the estimated rates of return on our intangible assets 
this rate is higher than the industry weighted average cost of capital because of the risks associated with the inherent uncertainties of the successful development of the in process research and development  market acceptance of the technology  the useful life of the technology  the profitability level of such technology and the uncertainty of technological advances 
the percentage of completion for the project was determined based on research and development expenses incurred immediately prior to the acquisition as a percentage of total research and development expenses to bring the project to technological feasibility 
as of june   we estimated the project to be approximately complete with remaining costs to be incurred on portions of logic  flow  layout  coding and testing 
these costs were expected to be incurred over a six month period and were not expected to be material 
the project began shipping to customers in the second quarter of and is still offered for sale 
we expect to make future acquisitions if advisable and may record additional expenses for in process research and development in connection with those acquisitions 
impairment of goodwill and intangible assets 
in  we recorded million of expense for the impairment of goodwill and intangible assets recorded in connection with the acquisition of cmd in these assets became impaired as a result of our decision in the second quarter of to transition to a licensing model for our storage subsystem board products  whereby instead of developing  manufacturing and selling board products  we will develop and license board designs in exchange for license fees and royalties 
for  we recorded million of expense for the impairment of goodwill and intangible assets recorded in connection with the acquisitions of dvdo and cmd 
dvdo goodwill and intangible assets became impaired primarily as a result of our decision to phase out or de emphasize certain existing digital video processing products and to cease funding of certain digital video processing development projects 
additionally  prevailing economic and industry conditions and the departure of certain key dvdo employees during the quarter ended september  also contributed to the impairment expense of million 
we recorded impairment expense of million in the fourth quarter of related to goodwill and intangible assets recorded in connection with our cmd acquisition 
this impairment resulted from a decrease in our initial estimate of future revenue from cmd s products 
restructuring 
during the third quarter of  we began a program to focus our business on products and technology  including those obtained through acquisitions  in which we have  or believe we can achieve  a leadership position 
as part of this program  we decided to cancel numerous products under development and to remove certain projects from our development plan  to phase out or de emphasize certain existing products and to integrate the operations of our two recently acquired companies  cmd and scl 
during the quarter ended december   we reduced our workforce by approximately people in connection with our plan to focus on products and technology in which we have  or believe we can achieve  a leadership position  and as a result of the continued integration of recently acquired companies 
in connection with these actions  we recorded a restructuring expense of million  consisting of severance related costs of  including  for the intrinsic value of modified stock options  an expected loss on leased facilities of  and a fixed asset write down of  we estimate that this restructuring will eliminate approximately million of annual operating expenses 
in the first quarter of  we implemented a second workforce reduction in connection with the program discussed above  eliminating an additional positions  or or our workforce 
positions were eliminated from all functional areas 
this reduction resulted from the continued integration of acquired companies  as well as continued execution of our product and technology strategy  whereby we decided to phase out the legacy storage subsystem board products we acquired from cmd and to develop new board products only if we believed it would facilitate or accelerate the use of our storage semiconductor products 
in connection with this workforce reduction  we recorded a restructuring expense of million in the first quarter of  consisting of cash severance related costs of  non cash severance related costs of  representing the intrinsic value of modified stock options  an expected loss on leased facilities of million and fixed asset write downs of  in addition  we reversed  of unearned compensation  a component of stockholders equity  for unvested stock options that were cancelled in connection with employee terminations 
in april  we decided to transition to a licensing model for our storage subsystem board products  whereby instead of developing  manufacturing and selling board products to facilitate or accelerate the use of our storage semiconductor products  we will develop and license board designs in exchange for license fees  royalties and the use of our semiconductor products 
in connection with this decision  we implemented a third workforce reduction  eliminating positions  or  of our workforce and recorded a restructuring expense of million  consisting of cash severance related costs of  non cash severance related costs of million representing the intrinsic value of modified stock options and fixed asset write downs of million 
we also reversed  of unearned compensation  a component of stockholders equity  for unvested stock options that were cancelled in connection with employee terminations 
in december  we revised our estimate of the loss we expect to incur on subleased facilities and recorded a restructuring expense of million 
real estate market conditions deteriorated in the fourth quarter of  causing us to reassess the length of time it will take to find tenants and the fair value lease rate of our available space 
as of december   our expected loss on subleased facilities is based on estimated sublease income of million over the remaining lease terms 
to the extent we are unable to generate million of sublease income  our future results of operations and financial condition will be negatively affected 
severance related costs were determined based on the amount of pay people received that was not for services performed and by measuring the intrinsic value of stock options that were modified to the benefit of terminated employees 
the expected loss on leased facilities resulted from our plan to consolidate our remaining workforce to the extent practicable and sublease any excess space 
to determine the expected loss  we compared our lease and operating costs for the space to our estimate of the net amount we would be able to recover by subleasing the space 
this estimate was based on a number of assumptions  including the length of time it will take to secure a tenant  the sublease rate per square foot  the cost of necessary improvements or modifications and real estate broker commissions 
the fixed asset write downs were determined based on the estimated fair value of assets  primarily computer hardware and software that would no longer be utilized after the employees termination date 
we expect severance and benefits payments to be completed by the second quarter of lease payments will be made through the end of the related lease terms of july and november the following table presents restructuring activity for and in thousands 
severance and benefits leased facilities fixed assets total provision  cash payments non cash december  balance provision     cash payments  non cash    december  balance   patent defense and acquisition integration costs 
patent defense and acquisition integration costs were million for and million for patent defense costs are related to the lawsuit we filed against genesis microchip in april  and acquisition integration costs represent costs incurred to integrate cmd and scl 
the increase in can be attributed to discovery  motions  depositions and other activities in preparation for trial 
we expect to incur patent defense costs at least until the middle of the amount of legal fees incurred in will depend on the duration of the litigation  as well as the nature and extent of the litigation activities 
we are not able to accurately estimate the amount of legal fees we will incur in with respect to this matter  but do expect the amount to be substantially less than that incurred in interest income 
interest income decreased to million in  from million in and million in these year to year decreases can be attributed to lower interest rates and decreased average cash and investment balances 
interest expense and other net 
net interest expense and other was  for   for and  for the decrease in can be attributed to lower average outstanding debt balances in the increase from to resulted from the assumption of a bank loan in connection with our acquisition of cmd 
provision for income taxes 
due to our losses in and  no provision for income taxes was recorded in either of those years 
in  we recorded a provision for income taxes of  which was equal to of our net income before taxes and non cash charges  including in process research and development  amortization of goodwill and intangible assets and stock compensation and warrant expense 
at december   we had a net operating loss carryforward for federal income tax purposes of approximately million  that expires through this future tax benefit has not been recognized as an asset on our balance sheet due to uncertainties surrounding our ability to generate sufficient taxable income in future periods to realize the benefits 
under the tax reform act of  the amounts of  and benefits from  net operating loss carryforwards may be restricted or limited in certain circumstances 
liquidity and capital resources since our inception  we have financed our operations through a combination of private sales of convertible preferred stock  our initial public offering  lines of credit and capital lease financing 
at december   we had million of working capital and million of cash  cash equivalents and short term investments 
in the future  we expect to generate positive cash flow on an annual basis 
the primary sources of cash flow will be operating activities 
if we are not able to generate cash from operating activities  we will liquidate short term investments or  to the extent available  utilize credit arrangements to meet our cash needs 
operating activities used million of cash during  used million of cash during  and generated million of cash during for  our net loss excluding depreciation  stock compensation expense  amortization and impairment of goodwill and intangible assets  in process research and development and non cash restructuring charges was million 
this was the most significant use of cash for operating activities 
in addition  accounts receivable and inventories increased million in as a result of increased business volume 
these uses of cash were offset by increases in accounts payable of million  accrued liabilities of million and deferred margin on sales to distributors of  for  net loss excluding depreciation  stock compensation and warrant expense  amortization and impairment of goodwill and intangible assets  in process research and development and non cash restructuring charges was million 
inventories and accounts receivable increased from solely as a result of our acquisitions of cmd and scl in however  decreases in both inventories and accounts receivable from operating activities provided million of cash in inventory levels at our distributors also decreased in  causing our deferred margin on sales to distributors to decrease by million 
additionally  we reduced accounts payable and accrued liabilities through operations by million during  which used cash 
during  net income excluding depreciation  stock compensation and warrant expense  amortization of goodwill and intangible assets and in process research and development was million and our deferred margin on sales to distributors increased million 
these sources of cash were partially offset by increases in accounts receivable and inventories of million and million  respectively 
accounts receivable and inventories increased as a result of our increased business volume 
deferred margin on sales to distributors increased as a result of higher inventory levels at our distributors  as demand for our products strengthened from the prior year 
we generated million of cash from investing activities in  generated million of cash from investing activities in  and used million of cash for investing activities in net proceeds from sales and purchases of short term investments generated million of cash in during  we used million for purchases of property and equipment  primarily software tools for use in r d activities 
during  we received net proceeds from sales and purchases of short term investments of million  and used million of cash for acquisition costs and million of cash for purchases of property and equipment 
the primary uses of cash in were for net purchases of short term investments and purchases of property and equipment 
we generated million of cash from financing activities in  used million of cash for financing activities in and generated million of cash from financing activities in during  we received million of proceeds from issuances of common stock through our stock option and stock purchase plans  and our net borrowing activities  including releases of security deposits and debt repayments  used million of cash during cash used by financing activities in was from security deposits on lease financing and debt payments  partially offset by cash provided by issuances of common stock for stock option exercises and stock purchase plan sales 
cash provided by financing activities in was from issuances of common stock and repayments of stockholder notes  partially offset by a security deposit requirement for leased equipment 
debt and lease obligations in october  we entered into a new debt facility that includes a revolving line of credit of up to million  a term loan of million  and equipment advances of million 
borrowings under the revolving line are limited to the lesser of million or our borrowing base of of eligible accounts receivable 
the revolving line has a maturity date of september  there were no borrowings outstanding under this line at december  the million term loan refinanced million of debt acquired in connection with our acquisition of cmd and  of other bank debt  and requires monthly payments through its maturity of october  equipment advances are available until march  all borrowings under this credit facility are at prime at december  plus and the facility is secured by substantially all of our assets  excluding intellectual property 
this facility contains certain quarterly and annual financial covenants with which we must comply 
we were not in compliance with one of the quarterly financial covenants at december   however  we were granted a waiver from the lending institution and are not in default of the loan agreement 
however  non compliance with these financial covenants in the future could result in all amounts outstanding becoming due and payable immediately 
all amounts outstanding under the credit agreement  including million due subsequent to december   have been classified as current liabilities 
in october  we financed a  insurance premium at an interest rate of 
monthly payments of  are due through june we lease certain software and equipment under lease agreements accounted for as capital leases 
these leases mature in  require monthly payments of  and bear interest at rates ranging from to 
many of these leases include end of lease bargain purchase options that we intend to exercise 
our obligations under these leasing arrangements are secured by the leased equipment 
in october  we entered into a noncancelable operating lease through july for our principal operating facility 
this lease requires average monthly rental payments of approximately  and is secured by a certificate of deposit in the amount of  which is included in prepaid expenses and other current assets on our balance sheet 
this security requirement will be reduced to zero in july in december  we entered into a noncancelable operating lease renewal for our principal operating facility that commences in august and expires in july the lease requires initial average monthly rental payments of  and provides for annual rent increases thereafter 
this lease will also require a security deposit of  in june  in connection with our acquisition of cmd  we acquired the lease of an operating facility in irvine  california with average monthly rental payments of approximately  through november a portion of this facility has been subleased through july  generating monthly sublease income of approximately  to offset our payment obligations 
additionally  in connection with our acquisition of scl in july  we acquired the lease of a facility in milpitas  california with average monthly rental payments of approximately  per month 
we do not occupy the milpitas facility and are attempting to sublease the space 
rent expense  net of sublease income  totaled   and  in  and  respectively 
future minimum lease payments under operating leases have not been reduced by expected sublease rental income or by the amount of our restructuring accrual that relates to leased facilities 
future minimum payments for our operating leases  debt and capital leases outstanding at december  are as follows in thousands year ending december  debt capital leases operating leases thereafter  total minimum payments   we plan to spend approximately million during the next months for equipment  furniture and software 
additionally  we plan to implement a new enterprise resource planning system in the second quarter of  and have entered into a contract for implementation consulting services requiring cash payments of approximately  based on our estimated cash flow for  we believe our existing cash and short term investments are sufficient to meet our capital and operating requirements for at least the next months 
operating and capital requirements depend on many factors  including the levels at which we generate revenue and maintain margins  investments in inventory and accounts receivable  the cost of securing access to adequate manufacturing capacity  our operating expenses  including patent defense costs  and general economic conditions 
in addition  cash may be required for future acquisitions should we choose to pursue any 
to the extent existing resources and cash from operations are insufficient to support our activities  we may need to raise additional funds through public or private equity or debt financing 
these funds may not be available  or if available  we may not be able to obtain them on terms favorable to us 
factors affecting future results you should carefully consider the following risk factors  together with all other information contained or incorporated by reference in this filing  before you decide to purchase shares of our common stock 
these factors could cause our future results to differ materially from those expressed in or implied by forward looking statements made by us 
additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also harm our business 
the trading price of our common stock could decline due to any of these risks  and you may lose all or part of your investment 
we operate in rapidly evolving markets  which make it difficult to evaluate our future prospects 
the revenue and income potential of our business and the markets we serve is unproven 
we began volume shipments of our first display products in the third quarter of the digital visual interface  or dvi  specification  which is based on technology developed by us and used in many of our products  was first published in april the dvi specification defines a high speed data communication link between computers and digital displays  such as flat panel displays  projectors and cathode ray tubes 
we completed our first generation of consumer electronics and storage ic products in mid to late in addition  the preliminary serial ata specification was first published in august and the high definition multimedia interface hdmi specification was first released in december accordingly  we face risks and difficulties frequently encountered by early stage companies in new and rapidly evolving markets 
if we do not successfully address these risks and difficulties  our results of operations could be negatively affected 
we have a history of losses and may not become profitable 
we have incurred net losses in each quarter and fiscal year since our inception  including losses of million  million and million for the years ended december    and  respectively 
we expect to continue to incur net losses for the foreseeable future 
accordingly  we may not achieve and sustain profitability 
our quarterly operating results may fluctuate significantly and are difficult to predict 
our quarterly operating results are likely to vary significantly in the future based on a number of factors over which we have little or no control 
these factors include  but are not limited to the growth  evolution and rate of adoption of industry standards for our key markets  including digital ready pcs and displays  consumer electronics and storage devices  competitive pressures  such as the ability of competitors to successfully introduce products that are more cost effective or that offer greater functionality than our products  including by integrating into their products functionality offered by our products  and the prices set by competitors for their products  average selling prices of our products  which are influenced by competition and technological advancements  among other factors  government regulations regarding the timing and extent to which digital content must be made available to consumers the availability of other semiconductors or other key components that are required to produce a complete solution for the customer  usually  we supply one of many necessary components  the fact that our licensing revenue is heavily dependent on a few key deals being completed  the timing of which is not always predictable and is especially susceptible to delay beyond the period in which they are expected  and our concentrated dependence on a few licensees for substantial portions of our expected licensing revenue  the cost of components for our products and prices charged by the third parties who manufacture  assemble and test our products  fluctuations in the price of our common stock  which drive a substantial portion of our non cash stock compensation and warrant expense  and the nature and extent of litigation activities  particularly our patent infringement suit against genesis 
because we have little or no control over these factors  our operating results are difficult to predict 
any substantial adverse change in any of these factors could negatively affect our business and results of operations 
our future quarterly operating results are highly dependent upon how well we manage our business 
our quarterly operating results may fluctuate based on how well we manage our business 
some of the factors that may affect how well we manage our business include the following our ability to manage product introductions and transitions  our ability to successfully manage our entry into new markets such as storage and consumer electronics  our ability to close licensing deals and make deliverables and milestones on which recognition of revenue often depends  our ability to structure our organization to enable achievement of our operating objectives and to meet the needs of our customers and markets  the success of the distribution channels through which we choose to sell our products  and our ability to manage expense and inventory levels 
if we fail to effectively manage our business  this could adversely affect our results of operations 
the licensing component of our business strategy may not be successful 
part of our business strategy is to license certain of our technology to companies that address markets in which we do not want to directly participate 
we have limited experience marketing and selling our technology on a licensing basis 
in conjunction with the business strategy we adopted in late  we signed our first license contract in december  and signed several more during the fiscal year ended december   however  there can be no assurance that additional companies will be interested in licensing our technology on commercially favorable terms or at all 
we also cannot ensure that companies who license our technology will introduce and sell products incorporating our technology  will accurately report royalties owed to us  will pay agreed upon royalties  will not infringe upon or misappropriate our intellectual property and will maintain the confidentiality of our proprietary information 
licensing revenue is heavily dependent on a few key deals being completed  the timing of which is not always predictable and is especially susceptible to delay beyond the period in which they are expected 
also  generating revenue from licensing arrangements is a lengthy and complex process that may last beyond the period in which efforts begin  and once an agreement is in place  the timing of revenue recognition may be dependent on customer acceptance of deliverables  achievement of milestones  and other factors 
in addition  in any period  our expectation of licensing revenue is or may be dependent on one or a few licenses being completed 
due to these factors  the amount of license revenue recognized in any period may differ significantly from our expectations 
our strategic restructuring program may not be successful 
during the third quarter of  we began a program to focus our business on products and technology  including those obtained through acquisitions  in which we have  or believe we can achieve  a leadership position 
as part of this program  we decided to cancel numerous products under development  to remove certain projects from our development plan  to phase out or de emphasize certain existing products  to license our technology to companies that participate in markets we do not address and to integrate the operations of our two recently acquired companies  cmd and scl 
in particular  we intend to concentrate on our discrete transmitter and receiver products for pcs and displays  and on developing products and promoting adoption of the hdmi and serial ata standards for the consumer electronics and storage markets  respectfully 
additionally  in the second quarter of  we transitioned to a licensing model for our storage systems business and are therefore phasing out our board level products through the middle of we expect that we will continue to generate revenue from sales of products being phased out or de emphasized for a limited period of time and that costs for selling and marketing these products will be minimal due to the limited resources allocated for this purpose 
however  if demand for these products is not sufficient to use our existing inventory  we may incur charges for excess and obsolete inventory 
products to be phased out or de emphasized represented approximately of our revenue in and of our revenue for the year ended december  in connection with this program  we have implemented three workforce reductions eliminating positions  or of our third quarter workforce  and have recorded restructuring expense of million 
there is no guarantee that our strategic restructuring program will be successful 
the markets in which we are promoting new technologies and standards are still developing and evolving  and there can be no assurance as to the rate or extent of adoption of these new technologies and standards 
we face intense competition in our markets  which may lead to reduced revenue from sales of our products and increased losses 
the pc  ce and storage markets in which we operate are intensely competitive 
these markets are characterized by rapid technological change  evolving standards  short product life cycles and declining selling prices 
our display products face competition from a number of sources  including analog solutions  dvi based solutions  dual analog and dvi based solutions and other digital interface solutions 
we expect competition in the display market to increase 
for example  analog devices  ati  broadcom  chrontel  genesis microchip  matrox  national semiconductor  nvidia  phillips  pixelworks  sis  smart asic  st microelectronics  texas instruments and thine have all begun shipping products or announced intentions to introduce products that we expect will compete with our panellink products 
other companies have announced dvi based solutions and we expect that additional companies are likely to enter the market 
in the future  our current or potential customers may also develop their own proprietary solutions that would likely be the integration of a dvi transmitter into a graphics processing unit or integration of a dvi receiver into a monitor controller 
in the ce market  our digital interface products are used to connect cable set top boxes  satellite set top boxes and dvd players to digital televisions 
these products incorporate dvi and hdcp  or hdmi with or without hdcp support 
companies that have announced or are shipping dvi hdcp solutions include ti  thine  broadcom and genesis 
in addition  our video processing products face competition from products sold by av science  broadcom  focus enhancements  genesis  mediamatics  micronas semiconductor  oplus  philips  pixelworks and trident 
we also compete  in some instances  against in house processing solutions designed by large original equipment manufacturers 
we expect competition for hdmi products from the other hdmi founders and adopters  including hitachi  matsushita  philips  sony  thomson and toshiba 
in the storage market  our fibre channel product faces competition from companies selling similar discrete products  including agilent  pmc sierra and vitesse  from other fibre channel serdes providers who license their core technology  such as lsi logic  and from companies that sell hba controllers with integrated serdes  such as qlogic and agilent 
our serial ata products compete with similar products from marvell promise 
in addition  other companies such as adaptec  apt  intel  lsi logic  serverworks and vitesse  have developed or announced intentions to develop serial ata controllers 
we also may compete against intel and other motherboard chip set makers that may integrate serial ata functionality into their chipsets  in fact  intel has announced its intention to integrate this functionality into one of its upcoming chip sets 
our parallel ata products compete with ic vendors including promise and highpoint 
our raid controller board products face competition from mylex  infortrend  and chaparral 
some of these competitors have already established supplier or joint development relationships with current or potential customers and may be able to leverage their existing relationships to discourage these customers from purchasing products from us or persuade them to replace our storage products with theirs 
many of our competitors have longer operating histories  greater presence in key markets  better name recognition  access to larger customer bases and significantly greater financial  sales and marketing  manufacturing  distribution  technical and other resources than we do 
in addition  some of our competitors could merge which may enhance their market presence 
as a result  they may be able to adapt more quickly to new or emerging technologies and customer requirements  or devote more resources to the promotion and sale of their products 
we cannot assure you that we can compete successfully against current or potential competitors  or that competition will not reduce our revenue and increase our losses 
growth of the market for our pc products depends on the widespread adoption and use of the dvi specification 
our success is largely dependent upon the rapid and widespread adoption of the dvi specification  which defines a high speed data communication link between computers and digital displays 
we cannot predict the rate at which manufacturers of computers and digital displays will adopt the dvi specification 
to date  relatively few systems implementing all of the electrical and mechanical aspects of the dvi specification have been shipped 
the dvi adoption rate in the pc market increased to in  from in adoption of the dvi specification may be affected by the availability of computer components able to communicate dvi compliant signals  such as transmitters  receivers  connectors and cables necessary to implement the specification 
other specifications may also emerge that could adversely affect the acceptance of the dvi specification 
for example  a number of companies have promoted alternatives to the dvi specification using other interface technologies  such as low voltage differential signaling  or lvds 
further delays in the widespread adoption of the dvi specification could reduce acceptance of our products  limit or reduce our revenue growth and increase our losses 
demand for our products for the consumer electronics market is dependent on the adoption and widespread use of the hdmi specification 
our success in the consumer electronics market is largely dependent upon the rapid and widespread adoption of the hdmi specification  which combines high definition video and multi channel audio in one digital interface and uses our patented underlying tmds technology  and optionally intel s hdcp technology  as the basis for the interface 
version of the specification was published for adoption on december  we cannot predict the rate at which manufacturers will adopt the hdmi specification or if the specification will be adopted at all 
adoption of the hdmi specification may be affected by the availability of consumer products  such as dvd players and televisions  and of computer components that implement this new interface 
other competing specifications may also emerge that could adversely affect the acceptance of the hdmi specification 
delays in the widespread adoption of the hdmi specification could reduce acceptance of our products  limit or reduce our revenue growth and increase our losses 
our ability to increase sales of our products for display systems depends on host system manufacturers including dvi compliant transmitters in their systems 
our success depends on increasing sales of our receiver products to display manufacturers 
to increase sales of our receiver products  we need computer manufacturers to incorporate dvi compliant transmitters in their systems  making these systems digital ready 
during  we introduced a low cost add in card that can be used in conjunction with intel s g chip set to provide an all digital connection to flat panels 
intel s g chip set is intended to provide an all digital path on the motherboard bus  and should make it easier to provide digital video out 
use of intel s g chip set  or any digital path chip set  is not universal and may not gain market acceptance 
if computers are not digital ready  they will not operate with their digital displays  which will limit and may reduce the demand for our digital receiver products  including our add in card 
our success depends on managing our relationship with intel intel has a dominant role in many of the markets in which we compete  such as pcs and storage  and is a growing power in the ce market 
we have a multi faceted relationship with intel that is complex and requires significant management attention  including intel has been an investor of ours  intel and we have been parties to a business cooperation agreement  intel and we are parties to a patent cross license  intel and we worked together to develop hdcp  intel and we were two of the original founders of the ddwg  intel is a promoter of the serial ata working group  of which we are a contributor  intel is a supplier to us and a customer of our products  we believe that intel has the power to drive adoption of dvi  serial ata and hdmi  by making them widely available in its chip sets and motherboards  which could negatively affect demand for our products  intel may potentially integrate the functionality of our products  including fibre channel  serial ata or dvi  into its own chips and chip sets  thereby displacing demand for our products  intel may design new technologies that would require us to re design our products for compatibility  thus increasing our r d expense and reducing our revenue  intel s technology  including its g chip set may lower barriers to entry to other parties who may enter the market and compete with us  and intel may enter into or continue relationships with our competitors that can put us at a relative disadvantage 
our cooperation and competition with intel can lead to positive benefits if managed effectively 
if our relationship with intel is not managed effectively  it could seriously harm our business  negatively affect our revenue  and increase our operating expenses 
our success depends on the growth of the digital display market 
our business depends on the growth of the digital display market 
the potential size of the digital display market and its rate of development are uncertain and will depend on many factors  including the number of digital ready computers that are being produced and consumer demand for these computers  the rate at which display manufacturers replace analog or non compliant dvi interfaces with fully dvi compliant interfaces  the availability of cost effective semiconductors that implement a fully dvi compliant interface  and improvements to analog technology  which may decrease consumer demand for our digital display products 
in order for the digital display market to grow  digital displays must be widely available and affordable to consumers 
in the past  the supply of digital displays  such as flat panels  has been cyclical and consumers have been very price sensitive 
also  some manufacturers have implemented dvi interfaces that are not fully dvi compliant 
these interfaces often interfere with the operability of our products which function best with a fully dvi compliant interface 
our ability to sustain or increase our revenue may be limited should there not be an adequate supply of  or demand for  affordable digital displays with fully dvi compliant interfaces 
our success depends on the development and growth of markets for products based on new and emerging storage technologies 
our product development efforts in the storage market are focused on the development of products using new interface technologies such as fibre channel and serial ata 
the markets for these new interface technologies are at an early stage of development  and there can be no assurance that they will replace other storage interfaces that are now widely used  such as parallel ata and scsi 
the potential size and rate of development of these markets are uncertain and will depend on many factors  including the rate at which manufacturers of storage subsystems adopt new interface technologies  which may be more costly to implement than existing interface technologies until volumes are sufficient to bring costs to competitive levels  the availability of cost effective semiconductors and components for storage subsystems  such as serial ata enabled hard drives  that implement new interface technologies for the storage market  whether intel or other motherboard manufacturers integrate the functionality of our products  such as serial ata  into their chips and chip sets  and improvement to existing storage interface technologies such as parallel ata and scsi  or the introduction of other new storage interface technologies  either of which may decrease consumer demand for our storage products 
in particular  the rate of implementation of the serial ata interface will depend on how quickly drive manufacturers  motherboard and pc providers and chipmakers are able to resolve technical communication and functionality issues to enable a plug and play environment in which a computer system is automatically able to recognize and configure storage devices 
resolution of these issues could be time consuming  and will depend in good measure on the ability of chipmakers to incorporate the required high speed serial data transfer capabilities into their semiconductors without sacrificing manufacturing yields 
any delay in acceptance of new interface technologies  or a reduction in the growth or size of the market for systems based on serial ata or fibre channel technologies  would limit sales of our storage products and reduce our revenue 
any delay in the availability of serial ata compatible drives or acceleration of serial ata or fibre channel serdes integration efforts by motherboard or storage controller manufacturers may also reduce our revenue 
we have promulgated a satalite specification to which we have invited key industry members to participate 
this program includes certain licenses to our technology that we hope will increase market acceptance of our serial ata products 
there can be no assurance that this program will succeed  or that satalite participants will not use our technology to compete against us 
to date  we have achieved a number of design wins for our serial ata and fibre channel storage products 
even after we have achieved a design win from an oem  we may not realize any revenue  or significant revenue  from that oem since a design win is not a binding commitment to purchase our products and the oem may not achieve market acceptance for their product 
further delay in serial ata enabled drive availability may lead oems to re open their designs and designs we have won may be subject to being lost  which could reduce our revenue and increase our operating expenses in competing to re win designs 
a significant amount of our revenue is associated with the adoption of new or emerging technologies within the pc industry 
the pc industry has slowed and the adoption of these new technologies may not occur as planned 
substantially all of our revenue is directly or indirectly related to the pc industry and the adoption of new or emerging technologies within the pc industry 
accordingly  we are highly dependent on the adoption of new or emerging technologies within the pc industry  which experienced a slowdown in growth during the second half of that continued throughout  and we cannot predict the duration or severity of the downturn in the pc and display market  or in the general economy  or its effect on our revenue and operating results  including the adoption of these new or emerging technologies 
if the market for pcs and pc related displays continues to grow at a slow rate or contracts whether due to reduced demand from end users  macroeconomic conditions or other factors  our business and results of operations could be negatively affected 
although we are attempting to broaden our product offerings to include more products for the consumer electronics market  there can be no guarantee that we will succeed in this effort 
to date  we have only achieved limited design wins in the consumer electronics industry 
if we fail to consistently achieve design wins in the consumer electronics market  we will remain highly dependent on the pc industry 
we do not have long term commitments from our customers and we allocate resources based on our estimates of customer demand 
substantially all of our sales are made on the basis of purchase orders  rather than long term agreements 
in addition  our customers may cancel or reschedule purchase orders 
we purchase inventory components and build our products according to our estimates of customer demand 
this process requires us to make multiple assumptions  including volume and timing of customer demand for each product  manufacturing yields and product quality 
if we overestimate customer demand or product quality or under estimate manufacturing yields  we may build products that we may not be able to sell at an acceptable price or at all 
as a result  we would have excess inventory  which would increase our losses 
additionally  if we underestimate customer demand or if sufficient manufacturing capacity is unavailable  we will forego revenue opportunities or incur significant costs for rapid increases in production  lose market share and damage our customer relationships 
our lengthy sales cycle can result in a delay between incurring expenses and generating revenue  which could harm our operating results 
because our products are based on new technology and standards  a lengthy sales process  typically requiring several months or more  is often required before potential customers begin the technical evaluation of our products 
this technical evaluation can exceed nine months  and it can then be an additional nine months before a customer commences volume shipments of systems incorporating our products  if at all 
given our lengthy sales cycle  we may experience a delay between the time we incur expenditures and the time we generate revenue  if any 
as a result  our operating results could be seriously harmed if a significant customer reduces or delays orders  or chooses not to release products incorporating our products 
we depend on a few key customers and the loss of any of them could significantly reduce our revenue 
historically  a relatively small number of customers and distributors have generated a significant portion of our revenue 
for the year ended december   shipments to world peace international  an asian distributor  generated of our revenue and shipments to weikeng  an asian distributor  generated of our revenue 
for the year  shipments to samsung  a korean customer  and compaq  a global customer  each generated of our revenue  and shipments to world peace international generated of our revenue 
in addition  an end customer may buy through multiple distributors  contract manufacturers  and or directly  which could create an even greater concentration 
we cannot be certain that customers and key distributors that have accounted for significant revenue in past periods  individually or as a group  will continue to sell our products and generate revenue 
as a result of this concentration of our customers  our results of operations could be negatively affected if any of the following occurs one or more of our customers  including distributors  becomes insolvent or goes out of business  one or more of our key customers or distributors significantly reduces  delays or cancels orders  or one or more significant customers select products manufactured by one of our competitors for inclusion in their future product generations 
due to our entrance into new markets  our customer base has broadened significantly and we therefore anticipate being less dependent on a relatively small number of customers to generate revenue 
however  as product mix may fluctuate from quarter to quarter  we may become more dependent on a small number of customers or a single customer for a significant portion of our revenue in a particular quarter  the loss of which could adversely affect our operating results 
we sell our products through distributors  which limits our direct interaction with our customers  therefore reducing our ability to forecast sales and increasing the complexity of our business 
many original equipment manufacturers rely on third party manufacturers or distributors to provide inventory management and purchasing functions 
distributors generated of our revenue for the year ended december  and of our revenue for we expect the percentage of revenue generated through distributors in to decrease as our licensing revenue  which is direct  becomes a higher percentage of our revenue 
selling through distributors reduces our ability to forecast sales and increases the complexity of our business  requiring us to manage a more complex supply chain  monitor and manage the level of inventory of our products at each distributor  estimate the impact of credits  return rights  price protection and unsold inventory at distributors  and monitor the financial condition and credit worthiness of our distributors  many of which are located outside of the united states  and the majority of which are not publicly traded 
any failure to manage these challenges could disrupt or reduce sales of our products 
we are sometimes required to maintain certain levels of our inventory at a customer s or intermediary s site in line with a customer s projection of their requirements 
these customer projections are generally non binding and we risk excess and obsolete inventory in the event that the customer s projections decrease or do not materialize and we cannot re allocate the inventory to other customers 
any of these events may adversely affect our results of operations 
our success depends on the development and introduction of new products  which we may not be able to do in a timely manner because the process of developing high speed semiconductor products is complex and costly 
the development of new products is highly complex  and we have experienced delays  some of which exceeded one year  in the development and introduction of new products on several occasions in the past 
in and  we announced our first products for the storage market and we expect to introduce new consumer electronics  storage and dvi products in the future 
as our products integrate new  more advanced functions  they become more complex and increasingly difficult to design  manufacture and debug 
successful product development and introduction depends on a number of factors  including  but not limited to accurate prediction of market requirements and evolving standards  including enhancements to existing standards such as dvi  hdcp and sata and development and adoption of new or emerging standards such as hdmi  development of advanced technologies and capabilities  and new products that satisfy customer requirements  timely completion and introduction of new product designs  use of leading edge foundry processes and achievement of high manufacturing yields  and market acceptance 
accomplishing all of this is extremely challenging  time consuming and expensive and there is no assurance that we will succeed 
product development delays may result from unanticipated engineering complexities  changing market or competitive product requirements or specifications  difficulties in overcoming resource limitations  the inability to license third party technology or other factors 
if we are not able to develop and introduce our products successfully and in a timely manner  our costs could increase or our revenue could decrease  both of which would adversely affect our operating results 
in addition  it is possible that we may experience delays in generating revenue from these products or that we may never generate revenue from these products 
we must work with a semiconductor foundry and with potential customers to complete new product development and to validate manufacturing methods and processes to support volume production and potential re work 
each of these steps may involve unanticipated difficulties  which could delay product introduction and reduce market acceptance of the product 
in addition  these difficulties and the increasing complexity of our products may result in the introduction of products that contain defects or that do not perform as expected  which would harm our relationships with customers and our ability to achieve market acceptance of our new products 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to achieve design wins for our planned new products  that we will be able to complete development of these products when anticipated  or that these products can be manufactured in commercial volumes at acceptable yields  or that any design wins will produce any revenue 
failure to develop and introduce new products  successfully and in a timely manner  may adversely affect our results of operations 
we have made acquisitions in the past and may make acquisitions in the future  if advisable  and these acquisitions involve numerous risks 
our growth depends upon market growth and our ability to enhance our existing products and introduce new products on a timely basis 
one of the ways we develop new products and enter new markets is through acquisitions of other companies 
in  we completed the acquisitions of zillion and dvdo  and in  we completed the acquisitions of cmd and scl 
we may acquire additional companies or technologies 
acquisitions involve numerous risks  including  but not limited to  the following difficulty and increased costs in assimilating employees  including our possible inability to keep and retain key employees of the acquired business  disruption of our ongoing business  discovery of undisclosed liabilities of the acquired companies and legal disputes with founders or shareholders of acquired companies  inability to successfully incorporate acquired technology and operations into our business and maintain uniform standards  controls  policies and procedures  and inability to commercialize acquired technology 
no assurance can be given that our acquisitions of zillion  dvdo  cmd or scl  or our future acquisitions  if any  will be successful or provide the anticipated benefits  or that they will not adversely affect our business  operating results or financial condition 
failure to manage growth effectively and to successfully integrate acquisitions made by us could materially harm our business and operating results 
the cyclical nature of the semiconductor industry may create fluctuations in our foundry  test and assembly capacity 
in the past  the semiconductor industry has been characterized by significant downturns and wide fluctuations in supply and demand 
for example  demand in the semiconductor industry rose to record levels in  but is currently in a downward cycle 
the industry has also experienced significant fluctuations in anticipation of changes in general economic conditions 
this cyclicality has led to significant fluctuations in product demand and in the foundry  test and assembly capacity of third party suppliers 
production capacity for semiconductors fabricated using micro technology could be subject to allocation  whereby not all of our production requirements would be met 
this may impact our ability to meet demand and could also increase our production costs 
cyclicality has also accelerated decreases in average selling prices per unit 
we may experience fluctuations in our future financial results because of changes in industry wide conditions 
we depend on third party sub contractors to manufacture  assemble and test nearly all of our products  which reduces our control over the production process 
we do not own or operate a semiconductor fabrication facility 
we rely almost entirely on taiwan semiconductor manufacturing company tsmc  an outside foundry  to produce all of our display related semiconductor products 
we also rely on kawasaki  umc and atmel  who are also outside foundries  to produce our storage semiconductor products and we rely on amkor and ase to test certain of our semiconductor products 
our reliance on independent foundries  assembly and test facilities involves a number of significant risks  including  but not limited to reduced control over delivery schedules  quality assurance  manufacturing yields and production costs  lack of guaranteed production capacity or product supply  lack of availability of  or delayed access to  next generation or key process technologies  and our ability to transition to alternate sources if services are unavailable from primary suppliers 
in addition  our semiconductor products are assembled and tested by several independent sub contractors 
we do not have a long term supply agreement with our sub contractors  and instead obtain production services on a purchase order basis 
our outside sub contractors have no obligation to supply products to us for any specific period of time  in any specific quantity or at any specific price  except as set forth in a particular purchase order 
our requirements represent a small portion of the total production capacity of our outside foundries  assembly and test facilities and our sub contractors may reallocate capacity to other customers even during periods of high demand for our products 
these foundries may allocate or move production of our products to different foundries under their control  even in different locations  which may be time consuming  costly  and difficult  have an adverse affect on quality  yields  and costs  and require us and or our customers to re qualify the products  which could open up design wins to competition and result in the loss of design wins and design ins 
if our sub contractors are unable or unwilling to continue manufacturing our products in the required volumes  at acceptable quality  yields and costs  and in a timely manner  our business will be substantially harmed 
as a result  we would have to identify and qualify substitute contractors  which would be time consuming  costly and difficult 
this qualification process may also require significant effort by our customers  and may lead to re qualification of parts  opening up design wins to competition  and loss of design wins and design ins 
any of these circumstances could substantially harm our business 
in addition  if competition for foundry  assembly and test capacity increases  our product costs may increase and we may be required to pay significant amounts or make significant purchase commitments to secure access to production services 
the nature of our production process is complex  which reduces identification of problems until well into the production cycle or in some cases  after the product has been shipped 
the manufacture of semiconductors is a complex process  and it is often difficult for semiconductor foundries to achieve acceptable product yields 
product yields depend on both our product design and the manufacturing process technology unique to the semiconductor foundry 
since low yields may result from either design or process difficulties  identifying yield problems can only occur well into the production cycle  when an actual product exists that can be analyzed and tested 
further  we only test our products after they are assembled  as their high speed nature makes earlier testing difficult and expensive 
as a result  defects often are not discovered until after assembly 
this could result in a substantial number of defective products being assembled and tested or shipped  thus lowering our yields and increasing our costs 
these risks could result in product shortages or increased costs of assembling  testing or even replacing our products 
although we test our products before shipment  they are complex and may contain defects and errors 
in the past we have encountered defects and errors in our products 
because our products are sometimes integrated with products from other vendors  it can be difficult to identify the source of any particular problem 
delivery of products with defects or reliability  quality or compatibility problems  may damage our reputation and our ability to retain existing customers and attract new customers 
in addition  product defects and errors could result in additional development costs  diversion of technical resources  delayed product shipments  increased product returns  warranty and product liability claims against us that may not be fully covered by insurance 
any of these circumstances could substantially harm our business 
we face foreign business  political and economic risks because a majority of our products and our customers products are manufactured and sold outside of the united states 
a substantial portion of our business is conducted outside of the united states  and as a result  we are subject to foreign business  political and economic risks 
nearly all of our products are manufactured in taiwan or elsewhere in asia  and for the year ended december  and  and  respectively  of our revenue was generated from customers and distributors located outside of the united states  primarily in asia 
we anticipate that sales outside of the united states will continue to account for a substantial portion of our revenue in future periods 
accordingly  we are subject to international risks  including  but not limited to difficulties in managing from afar  political and economic instability  including international tension in iraq  korea and the china strait and lack of normal diplomatic relationships between the united states and taiwan  less developed infrastructures in newly industrializing countries  susceptibility of foreign areas to terrorist attacks  bias against foreign  especially american  companies  difficulties in collecting accounts receivable  expense and difficulties in protecting our intellectual property in foreign jurisdictions  difficulties in complying with multiple  conflicting and changing laws and regulations  including export requirements  tariffs  import duties  visa restrictions  environmental laws and other barriers  exposure to possible litigation or claims in foreign jurisdictions  and competition from foreign based suppliers and the existence of protectionist laws and business practices that favor these suppliers  such as withholding taxes on payments made to us 
these risks could adversely affect our business and our results of operations 
in addition  original equipment manufacturers that design our semiconductors into their products sell them outside of the united states 
this exposes us indirectly to foreign risks 
because sales of our products are denominated exclusively in united states dollars  relative increases in the value of the united states dollar will increase the foreign currency price equivalent of our products  which could lead to a reduction in sales and profits in that country 
the success of our business depends upon our ability to adequately protect our intellectual property 
we rely on a combination of patent  copyright  trademark  mask work and trade secret laws  as well as nondisclosure agreements and other methods  to protect our proprietary technologies 
we have been issued patents and have a number of pending patent applications 
however  we cannot assure you that any patents will be issued as a result of any applications or  if issued  that any claims allowed will protect our technology 
in addition  we do not file patent applications on a worldwide basis  meaning we do not have patent protection in some jurisdictions 
it is possible that existing or future patents may be challenged  invalidated or circumvented and effective patent  copyright  trademark and trade secret protection may be unavailable or limited in foreign countries 
it may be possible for a third party to copy or otherwise obtain and use our products or technology without authorization  develop similar technology independently or design around our patents in the united states and in other jurisdictions 
it is also possible that some of our existing or new licensing relationships will enable other parties to use our intellectual property to compete against us 
legal actions to enforce intellectual property rights tend to be lengthy and expensive  and the outcome often is not predictable 
as a result  despite our efforts and expenses  we may be unable to prevent others from infringing upon or misappropriating our intellectual property  which could harm our business 
our participation in the digital display working group requires us to license some of our intellectual property for free  which may make it easier for others to compete with us in the dvi pc market 
we are a promoter of the digital display working group  which published and promotes the dvi specification 
our strategy includes establishing the dvi specification as the industry standard  promoting and enhancing this specification and developing and marketing products based on this specification and future enhancements 
as a result we must license for free specific elements of our intellectual property to others for use in implementing the dvi specification  and we may license additional intellectual property for free as the digital display working group promotes enhancements to the dvi specification 
accordingly  companies that implement the dvi specification in their products can use specific elements of our intellectual property for free to compete with us 
our participation as a founder in the working group developing hdmi requires us to license some of our intellectual property  which may make it easier for others to compete with us in the market 
in april  together with sony  philips  thomson  toshiba  matsushita and hitachi  we announced the formation of a working group to define the next generation digital interface specification for consumer electronics products 
version of the specification was published for adoption on december  the hdmi specification combines high definition video and multi channel audio in one digital interface and uses silicon image s patented underlying tmds technology along with intel s hdcp as the basis for the interface 
the founders of the working group have signed a founder s agreement in which each commits to license certain intellectual property to each other  and to adopters of the specification 
our strategy includes establishing the hdmi specification as the industry standard  promoting and enhancing this specification and developing and marketing products based on this specification and future enhancements 
as a result we must license specific elements of our intellectual property to others for use in implementing the hdmi specification  and we may license additional intellectual property as the hdmi founders group promotes enhancements to the hdmi specification 
accordingly  companies that implement the hdmi specification in their products can use specific elements of our intellectual property to compete with us 
although there will be license fees and royalties associated with the adopters agreements  there can be no assurance that such license fees and royalties will adequately compensate us for having to license our intellectual property 
fees and royalties received during the early years of adoption will be used to cover costs we incur to promote the hdmi standard and to develop and perform interoperability tests  in addition  after an initial period  the hdmi founders may reallocate the license fees and royalties amongst themselves to reflect each founder s relative contribution of intellectual property to the hdmi specification 
we have granted intel rights with respect to our intellectual property  which could allow intel to develop products that compete with ours or otherwise reduce the value of our intellectual property 
we have entered into a patent cross license agreement with intel in which each of us granted the other a license to use the grantor s patents  except for identified types of products 
we believe that the scope of our license to intel excludes our current products and anticipated future products 
intel could  however  exercise its rights under this agreement to use our patents to develop and market other products that compete with ours  without payment to us 
additionally  intel s rights to our patents could reduce the value of our patents to any third party who otherwise might be interested in acquiring rights to use our patents in such products 
finally  intel could endorse competing products  including a competing digital interface  or develop its own proprietary digital interface 
any of these actions could substantially harm our business and results of operations 
we are and may continue to become the target of securities class action suits which could result in substantial costs and divert management attention and resources 
securities class action suits are often brought against companies  particularly technology companies  following periods of volatility in the market price of their securities 
defending against these suits  even if meritless  can result in substantial costs to us and could divert the attention of our management 
we and certain of our officers and directors  together with certain investment banks  have been named as defendants in a securities class action suit filed against us on behalf of purchasers of our securities between october  and december  it is alleged that the prospectus related to our initial public offering was misleading because it failed to disclose that the underwriters of our initial public offering had solicited and received excessive commissions from certain investors in exchange for agreements by investors to buy our shares in the aftermarket for predetermined prices 
due to inherent uncertainties in litigation  we cannot accurately predict the outcome of this litigation 
we believe that these claims are without merit and we intend to defend vigorously against them 
however  these claims and any other that may be brought  even if meritless  could require us to incur expenses and could divert our management s attention and resources 
in addition  any unfavorable outcome of this possible litigation could adversely impact our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we are currently engaged in intellectual property litigation that is time consuming and expensive to prosecute 
we may become engaged in additional intellectual property litigation that could be time consuming  maybe be expensive to prosecute or defend  and could adversely affect our ability to sell our product 
in recent years  there has been significant litigation in the united states and in other jurisdictions involving patents and other intellectual property rights 
this litigation is particularly prevalent in the semiconductor industry  in which a number of companies aggressively use their patent portfolios to bring infringement claims 
in addition  in recent years  there has been an increase in the filing of so called nuisance suits  alleging infringement of intellectual property rights 
these claims may be asserted as counterclaims in response to claims made by a company alleging infringement of intellectual property rights 
these suits pressure defendants into entering settlement arrangements to quickly dispose of such suits  regardless of merit 
in addition  as is common in the semiconductor industry  from time to time we have been notified that we may be infringing certain patents or other intellectual property rights of others 
responding to such claims  regardless of their merit  can be time consuming  result in costly litigation  divert management s attention and resources and cause us to incur significant expenses 
as each claim is evaluated  we may consider the desirability of entering into settlement or licensing agreements 
no assurance can be given that settlements will occur or that licenses can be obtained on acceptable terms or that litigation will not occur 
in the event there is a temporary or permanent injunction entered prohibiting us from marketing or selling certain of our products  or a successful claim of infringement against us requiring us to pay damages or royalties to a third party  and we fail to develop or license a substitute technology  our business  results of operations or financial condition could be materially adversely affected 
in april  we filed suit against genesis microchip for infringement of one of our us patents 
at that time  we also filed a complaint against genesis for unlawful trade practices related to the importation of articles infringing our patent 
in february  our motion to dismiss the unlawful trade practices complaint was granted and we filed an amended complaint against genesis alleging infringement of two of our us patents 
these patents relate to our dvi receiver products  which generate a significant portion of our revenue 
the amended complaint seeks a declaration that genesis has infringed our patents  that genesis s behavior is not licensed  an injunction to halt the importation  sale  manufacture and use of genesis dvi receiver chips that infringe our patents  and monetary damages 
in april  genesis answered and made counterclaims against us for non infringement  license  patent invalidity  fraud  antitrust  unfair competition and patent misuse 
we filed a motion to dismiss certain of genesis s counterclaims 
in addition  we filed a motion to bifurcate trial of the counterclaims to the extent the court does not dismiss them 
in may  the court granted our motion to dismiss certain of the counterclaims  with leave to amend 
genesis re filed counterclaims against us for fraud and patent misuse 
we filed another motion to dismiss these counterclaims 
in august  the court granted our motion and dismissed genesis s re filed counterclaims with prejudice 
in september  we filed a motion for summary judgment  upon which the court has yet to rule 
in october  both parties filed several more motions for summary judgment  upon which the court has yet to rule 
several dispositive motions have subsequently been filed under seal and were heard by the court in march  the court has yet to rule on these motions 
depending on the outcome of such motions  a trial date may be set  the case may be dismissed  or other orders may be entered 
we intend to prosecute our position vigorously until this matter is resolved 
there can be no assurance that we will prevail in this litigation 
while this litigation is pending  genesis can use the technology covered by these patents to develop products that might compete with ours 
if we are unsuccessful in this litigation  we could be unable to prevent genesis or others from using the technology covered by this patent 
even if we do prevail in this litigation  uncertainties regarding the outcome prior to that time may reduce demand for our products 
in addition  disputes may occur regarding whether any intellectual property licenses were granted and the scope of any such licenses  based on our interactions in various standards bodies  including the digital display working group and for hdmi 
these disputes may result in additional costly and time consuming litigation or the license of additional elements of our intellectual property for free 
any potential intellectual property litigation against us could also force us to do one or more of the following stop selling products or using technology that contain the allegedly infringing intellectual property  attempt to obtain a license to the relevant intellectual property  which license may not be available on reasonable terms or at all  and attempt to redesign products that contain the allegedly infringing intellectual property 
if we are forced to take any of these actions  we may be unable to manufacture and sell our products 
we may be exposed to liability for monetary damages  the extent of which would be very difficult to accurately predict 
in addition  we may be exposed to customer claims  for potential indemnity obligations  and to customer dissatisfaction and a discontinuance of purchases of our products while the litigation is pending 
any of these consequences could substantially harm our business and results of operations 
we have entered into  and may again be required to enter into  patent or other intellectual property cross licenses 
many companies have significant patent portfolios or key specific patents  or other intellectual property in areas in which we compete 
many of these companies appear to have policies of imposing cross licenses on other participants in their markets  which may include areas in which we compete 
as a result  we have been required  either under pressure of litigation or by significant vendors or customers  to enter into cross licenses or non assertion agreements relating to patents or other intellectual property 
this permits the cross licensee  or beneficiary of a non assertion agreement  to use certain or all of our patents and or certain other intellectual property for free to compete with us 
we must attract and retain qualified personnel to be successful  and competition for qualified personnel is increasing in our market 
our success depends to a significant extent upon the continued contributions of our key management  technical and sales personnel  many of who would be difficult to replace 
the loss of one or more of these employees could harm our business 
although we have entered into a limited number of employment contracts with certain executive officers  we generally do not have employment contracts with our key employees 
we do not have key person life insurance for any of our key personnel 
our success also depends on our ability to identify  attract and retain qualified technical  sales  marketing  finance and managerial personnel 
competition for qualified personnel is particularly intense in our industry and in our location 
this makes it difficult to retain our key personnel and to recruit highly qualified personnel 
we have experienced  and may continue to experience  difficulty in hiring and retaining candidates with appropriate qualifications 
to be successful  we need to hire candidates with appropriate qualifications and retain our key executives and employees 
the pressure on our stock price has had an impact on our ability to offer competitive equity based incentives to current and prospective employees  thereby affecting our ability to attract and retain highly qualified technical personnel 
if these adverse conditions continue  we may not be able to hire or retain highly qualified employees in the future and this could harm our business 
in addition  new regulations proposed by the nasdaq national market requiring shareholder approval for all stock option plans  as well as new regulations proposed by the new york stock exchange prohibiting nyse member organizations from giving a proxy to vote on equity compensation plans unless the beneficial owner of the shares has given voting instructions  could make it more difficult for us to grant options to employees in the future 
there have been several proposals on whether and or how to account for stock options 
to the extent that new regulations make it more difficult or expensive to grant options to employees  we may incur increased cash compensation costs or find it difficult to attract  retain and motivate employees  either of which could harm our business 
we use contractors to provide services to the company  which often involves contractual complexity  tax and employment law compliance  and being subject to audits and other governmental actions 
we have been audited for our contracting policies in the past  and may be in the future 
burdening our ability to freely use contractors to provide services to the company may increase the expense of obtaining such services  and or require us to discontinue using contractors and attempt to find  interview  and hire employees to provide similar services 
such potential employees may not be available in a reasonable time  or at all  or may not be hired without undue cost 
in the past  we implemented mandatory unpaid company wide shutdowns as a cost reduction measure  but we may not continue to implement these programs 
in the last two fiscal years  we have implemented mandatory company wide shutdowns 
although these shutdown periods represent a cost savings to us  they may be perceived negatively by our customers  vendors and employees 
we currently intend to implement a company wide shutdown in the first quarter of  and another during the second half of in addition  we may continue to implement company wide shutdowns in future periods  which may negatively impact employee morale or the perception of our company by our customers and vendors 
if we elect not to implement these shutdowns  our operating expenses will increase 
our workforce reductions may seriously harm our business 
in connection with the program we began in the third quarter of to focus our business on products and technology in which we have  or believe we can achieve  a leadership position  we have implemented three workforce reductions  eliminating a total of positions 
as a result of the elimination of these positions  our marketing  sales and customer support capabilities could be reduced  our ability to respond to unexpected challenges may be impaired  and we may be unable to take advantage of new opportunities 
these workforce reductions  or future workforce reductions  if any  may reduce employee morale and create concern among existing employees about job security  which could lead to increased turnover 
workforce reductions may also raise concerns among customers  suppliers and other corporate partners regarding our continued viability 
further  these workforce reductions may subject us to the risk of litigation  which could be costly to defend  divert the attention of management and subject us to possible liability for damages 
industry cycles may strain our management and resources 
cycles of growth and contraction in our industry may strain our management and resources 
to manage these industry cycles effectively  we must improve operational and financial systems  train and manage our employee base  successfully integrate operations and employees of businesses we acquire or have acquired  attract  develop  motivate and retain qualified personnel with relevant experience  and adjust spending levels according to prevailing market conditions 
if we cannot manage industry cycles effectively  our business could be seriously harmed 
our operations and the operations of our significant customers  third party wafer foundries and third party assembly and test subcontractors are located in areas susceptible to natural disasters 
our operations are headquartered in the san francisco bay area  which is susceptible to earthquakes  and the operations of cmd  which we acquired  are based in the los angeles area  which is also susceptible to earthquakes 
tsmc and umc  the outside foundries that produce the majority of our semiconductor products  are located in taiwan 
advanced semiconductor engineering  or ase  one of the subcontractors that assembles and tests our semiconductor products  is also located in taiwan 
for the year ended december   customers and distributors located in taiwan generated of our revenue and customers and distributors located in japan generated of our revenue 
for  customers and distributors located in taiwan generated of our revenue and customers and distributors located in japan generated of our revenue 
both taiwan and japan are susceptible to earthquakes  typhoons and other natural disasters 
our business would be negatively affected if any of the following occurred an earthquake or other disaster in the san francisco bay area or the los angeles area damaged our facilities or disrupted the supply of water or electricity to our headquarters or our irvine facility  an earthquake  typhoon or other disaster in taiwan or japan resulted in shortages of water  electricity or transportation  limiting the production capacity of our outside foundries or the ability of ase to provide assembly and test services  an earthquake  typhoon or other disaster in taiwan or japan damaged the facilities or equipment of our customers and distributors  resulting in reduced purchases of our products  or an earthquake  typhoon or other disaster in taiwan or japan disrupted the operations of suppliers to our taiwanese or japanese customers  outside foundries or ase  which in turn disrupted the operations of these customers  foundries or ase and resulted in reduced purchases of our products or shortages in our product supply 
our implementation of a new erp system may negatively affect our business 
in order to respond to the growth we anticipate in our business  we have decided implement a new enterprise resource planning erp system to replace the multiple  sometimes non interoperable systems currently used in various aspects of our business 
we have entered into commitments to purchase software licenses and services  many of which we expect to be expensed and introduced during future periods  particularly our second fiscal quarter of the erp system will affect numerous operational and financial systems  reporting and processes 
even after introduction of the new system  it will need to be tested further 
in the event that the erp system is delayed  lacks necessary features  or has runtime errors  or we are unable to train our personnel to use the erp system in an efficient and timely manner  our business could be adversely affected 
moreover  there can be no assurance that the erp system will be able to support the anticipated growth of our business 
additionally  systems conversions can be disruptive to a company s business 
changes in environmental rules and regulations could increase our costs and reduce our revenue 
several jurisdictions are considering whether to implement rules that would require that certain products  including semiconductors  be made lead free 
we anticipate that some jurisdictions may finalize and enact such requirements 
some jurisdictions are also considering whether to require abatement or disposal obligations for products made prior to the enactment of any such rules 
although several of our products are available to customers in a lead free condition  most of our products are not lead free 
any requirement that would prevent or burden the development  manufacture or sales of lead containing semiconductors would likely reduce our revenue for such products and would require us to incur costs to develop substitute lead free replacement products  which may take time and may not always be economically or technically feasible  and may require disposal of non compliant inventory 
in addition  any requirement to dispose or abate previously sold products would require us to incur the costs of setting up and implementing such a program 
provisions of our charter documents and delaware law could prevent or delay a change in control  and may reduce the market price of our common stock

quantitative and qualitative disclosures of market risk interest rate risk our cash equivalents and short term investments consist primarily of fixed income securities that are subject to interest rate risk and will decline in value if interest rates increase 
due to the short duration of our cash equivalents and short term investments  an immediate change in interest rates would not be expected to have a material effect on our near term results of operations or financial condition 
our long term capital lease obligations bear interest at fixed rates  therefore  our results of operations would not be affected by immediate changes in interest rates 
also  components of our stock compensation expense are tied to our stock price 
changes in our stock price can have a significant affect on the amount recorded as stock compensation expense 
foreign currency exchange risk all of our sales are denominated in us dollars  and substantially all of our expenses are incurred in us dollars  thus limiting our exposure to foreign currency exchange risk 
we currently do not enter into forward exchange contracts to hedge exposures denominated in foreign currencies and do not use derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes 
the direct effect of an immediate change in foreign currency exchange rates should not have a material effect on our future operating results or cash flows  however  a long term increase in foreign currency rates would likely result in increased wafer  packaging  assembly or testing costs 
additionally  many of our foreign distributors price our products in the local currency of the countries in which they sell 
therefore  significant strengthening of the us dollar relative to those foreign currencies could result in reduced demand or lower us dollar prices for our products  which would negatively affect our operating results
