refer to note to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for further discussion of these accounting standards 
critical accounting policies the company believes that there are several accounting policies that are critical to understanding the company s historical and future performance  as these policies affect the reported amount of revenue 
table of contents and other significant areas involving management s judgments and estimates 
these significant accounting policies relate to revenue recognition  software development  other than temporary declines in the market value of investments  allowance for doubtful accounts and potential impairments of goodwill 
these policies and the company s procedures related to these policies are described in detail below and under specific areas within the discussion and analysis of the company s financial condition and results of operations 
in addition  note to the accompanying financial statements further expands upon the company s accounting policies 
revenue recognition revenues are derived primarily from the sale of clinical financial and administrative information systems and solutions 
the components of the system sales revenues are the licensing of computer software  installation  subscription content and the sale of computer hardware and sublicensed software 
the components of support  maintenance and service revenues are software support and hardware maintenance  remote hosting and outsourcing  training  consulting and implementation services 
the company recognizes revenue in accordance with the provisions of statement of position sop no 
 software revenue recognition  as amended by sop no 
 sop and clarified by staff accounting bulletin sab revenue recognition in financial statements 
sop no  as amended  generally requires revenue earned on software arrangements involving multiple elements to be allocated to each element based on the relative fair values of those elements 
revenue from multiple element software arrangements is recognized using the residual method 
under the residual method  revenue is recognized in a multiple element arrangement when company specific objective evidence of fair value exists for all of the undelivered elements in the arrangement ie professional services  software support  hardware maintenance  hardware and sublicensed software  but does not exist for one or more of the delivered elements in the arrangement ie software solutions 
the company allocates revenue to each element in a multiple element arrangement based on the element s respective fair value  with the fair value determined by the price charged when that element is sold separately 
specifically  the company determines the fair value of the maintenance portion of the arrangement based on the renewal price of the maintenance charged to clients  professional services portion of the arrangement  other than installation services  based on hourly rates which the company charges for these services when sold apart from a software license  and the hardware and sublicensed software based on the prices for these elements when they are sold separately from the software 
if evidence of the fair value cannot be established for the undelivered elements of a license agreement  the entire amount of revenue under the arrangement is deferred until these elements have been delivered or objective evidence can be established 
inherent in the revenue recognition process are significant management estimates and judgments  which influence the timing and the amount of revenue recognition 
the company provides several models for the procurement of its clinical  financial and administrative information systems 
the predominant method is a perpetual software license agreement  project related installation services  implementation and consulting services  computer hardware and sublicensed software and software support 
for those arrangements involving the use of services  the company uses the percentage of completion method of accounting  following the guidance in the aicpa statement of position no 
sop  accounting for performance of construction type and certain production type contracts 
the company provides installation services  which include project scoping services  conducting pre installation audits and creating initial environments 
because installation services are deemed to be essential to the functionality of the software  software license and installation services fees are recognized over the software installation period using output measures which reflect direct labor hours incurred  beginning at software delivery and culminating at completion of installation  typically a three to six month process 
the company also provides implementation and consulting services  which include consulting activities that fall outside of the scope of the standard installation services 
these services vary depending on the scope and complexity requested by the client 
examples of such services may include additional database consulting  system configuration  project management  testing assistance  network consulting and post conversion review services 
implementation and consulting services generally are not deemed 
table of contents to be essential to the functionality of the software  and thus do not impact the timing of the software license recognition  unless software license fees are tied to implementation milestones 
in those instances  the portion of the software license fee tied to implementation milestones is deferred until the related milestone is accomplished and related fees become billable and non forfeitable 
implementation fees are recognized over the service period  which may extend from six months to three years 
remote hosting and outsourcing services are marketed under long term arrangements generally over periods of five to years 
revenues from these arrangements are recognized as the services are performed 
software maintenance fees are marketed under annual and multi year arrangements and are recognized as revenue ratably over the contracted maintenance term 
hardware maintenance revenues are billed and recognized monthly over the contracted maintenance term 
subscription and content fees are generally marketed under annual and multi year agreements and are recognized ratably over the contracted terms 
hardware and sublicensed software sales are generally recognized upon delivery to the client 
the company also offers its solutions on an application service provider asp or a term license basis  making available company software functionality on a remote processing basis from the company s data centers 
the data centers provide system and administrative support as well as processing services 
revenue on software and services provided on an asp or term license basis is recognized on a monthly basis over the term of the contract 
the company capitalizes related direct costs consisting of third party costs and direct software installation and implementation costs 
these costs are amortized over the term of the arrangement 
in limited cases where the company has contractually agreed to develop new or customized software code for a client  the company utilizes percentage of completion accounting in accordance with sop deferred revenue is comprised of deferrals for license fees  maintenance and other services for which payment has been received and for which the service has not yet been performed 
long term deferred revenue  at december   represents amounts received from license fees  maintenance and other services to be earned or provided beginning in periods on or after december  software development costs costs incurred internally in creating computer software solutions are expensed until technological feasibility has been established upon completion of a detailed program design 
thereafter  all software development costs are capitalized and subsequently reported at the lower of amortized cost or net realizable value 
capitalized costs are amortized based on current and expected future revenue for each software solutions with minimum annual amortization equal to the straight line amortization over the estimated economic life of the software solution 
the company is amortizing capitalized costs over five years 
the company expects that major software information systems companies  large information technology consulting service providers and systems integrators  internet based start up companies and others specializing in the health care industry may offer competitive products or services 
the pace of change in the health care information systems market is rapid and there are frequent new product introductions  product enhancements and evolving industry standards and requirements 
as a result  the capitalized software solutions may become less valuable or obsolete and could be subject to impairment 
investments the company accounts for its investments in equity securities  which have readily determinable fair values as available for sale 
available for sale securities are reported at fair value with unrealized gains and losses reported  net of tax  as a separate component of accumulated other comprehensive income 

table of contents for realized gains and losses on available for sale investments  the company utilizes the specific identification method as the basis to determine cost 
investments in the common stock of certain affiliates over which the company exerts significant influence are accounted for by the equity method 
the company has certain other minority equity investments in non publicly traded securities 
these investments are generally carried at cost as the company owns less than of the voting equity and does not have the ability to exercise significant influence over these companies 
the balance of these investments at december  and december  was  and  respectively 
these investments are inherently high risk as the market for technologies and content by these companies are usually early stage at the time of the investment by the company and such markets may never be significant 
the company could lose its entire investment in certain or all of these companies 
the company monitors these investments for impairment and makes appropriate reductions in carrying values when necessary 
the company reviews all equity securities for declines in fair value 
if such declines are considered to be other than temporary  the cost basis of the individual security is written down to fair value as a new cost basis  and the amount of the write down is included in earnings concentrations substantially all of the company s cash and cash equivalents and short term investments  are held at three major us financial institutions 
the majority of the company s cash equivalents consist of us government federal agency securities  short term marketable securities and overnight repurchase agreements 
deposits held with banks may exceed the amount of insurance provided on such deposits 
generally these deposits may be redeemed upon demand and  therefore  bear minimal risk 
substantially all of the company s clients are integrated delivery networks  hospitals and other healthcare related organizations 
if significant adverse macro economic factors were to impact these organizations it could materially adversely affect the company 
the company s access to certain software and hardware components is dependent upon single and sole source suppliers 
the inability of any supplier to fulfill supply requirements of the company could affect future results 
allowance for doubtful accounts the company performs ongoing credit evaluations of its clients and generally does not require collateral from its clients 
the company maintains an allowance for potential losses on a specific identification basis and based on historical experience and management s judgments 
goodwill effective december   the company adopted the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
as a result  goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives are no longer amortized but are evaluated for impairment annually or whenever there is an impairment indicator 
all goodwill is assigned to a reporting unit  where it is subject to an impairment test based on fair value 
the company completed its review of the company s goodwill values in the second quarter of as a result of this review  the company determined that goodwill arising from the acquisition of mitch cooper and associates was impaired due to declining demand and margins in this business 
mitch cooper and associates was a supply chain re engineering consulting practice 
the impairment charge to reflect this goodwill at fair value was  net of tax  and is reflected as a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle as of the beginning of the company used a discounted cash flow analysis to determine the fair value of the reporting units 
the company completed three acquisitions subsequent to june   which resulted in approximately  million of goodwill that was not amortized in accordance with sfas for the years ended and  earnings included  and  of amortization of goodwill  net of tax  respectively 
goodwill amounted to  and  at december  and december   respectively 

table of contents factors that may affect future results of operations  financial condition or business statements made in this report  the annual report to shareholders in which this report is made a part  other reports and proxy statements filed with the securities and exchange commission  communications to shareholders  press releases and oral statements made by representatives of the company that are not historical in nature  or that state the company s or management s intentions  hopes  beliefs  expectations or predictions of the future  may constitute forward looking statements within the meaning of section e of the securities and exchange act of  as amended the exchange act 
forward looking statements can often be identified by the use of forward looking terminology  such as could  should  will  will be  will lead  will assist  intended  continue  believe  may  expect  hope  anticipate  goal  forecast  plan  or estimate or variations thereof or similar expressions 
forward looking statements are not guarantees of future performance or results 
they involve risks  uncertainties and assumptions 
it is important to note that any such performance and actual results  financial condition or business  could differ materially from those expressed in such forward looking statements 
factors that could cause or contribute to such differences include  but are not limited to  those discussed below as well as those discussed elsewhere in reports filed with the securities and exchange commission 
other unforeseen factors not identified herein could also have such an effect 
the company undertakes no obligation to update or revise forward looking statements to reflect changed assumptions  the occurrence of unanticipated events or changes in future operating results  financial condition or business over time 
quarterly operating results may vary the company s quarterly operating results have varied in the past and may continue to vary in future periods 
quarterly operating results may vary for a number of reasons including accounting policy changes mandated by regulating entities including  but not limited to  any accounting policy change concerning the expensing of options  demand for the company s software solutions and services  the company s long sales cycle  potentially long installation and implementation cycle for these larger  more complex and costlier systems and other factors described in this section and elsewhere in this report 
as a result of health care industry trends and the market for the company s cerner millennium solutions  a large percentage of the company s revenues are generated by the sale and installation of larger  more complex and costlier systems 
the sales process for these systems is lengthy and involves a significant technical evaluation and commitment of capital and other resources by the client 
the sale may be subject to delays due to clients internal budgets and procedures for approving large capital expenditures and by competing needs for other capital expenditures and deploying new technologies or personnel resources 
delays in the expected sale or installation of these large contracts may have a significant impact on the company s anticipated quarterly revenues and consequently its earnings  since a significant percentage of the company s expenses are relatively fixed 
these larger  more complex and costlier systems are installed and implemented over time periods ranging from approximately one month to three years and may involve significant efforts both by the company and the client 
the company recognizes revenue upon the completion of standard milestone conditions and the amount of revenue recognized in any quarter depends upon the company s and the client s ability to meet these project milestones 
delays in meeting these milestone conditions or modification of the contract relating to one or more of these systems could result in a shift of revenue recognition from one quarter to another and could have a material adverse effect on results of operations for a particular quarter 
in addition  support payments by clients for the company s solutions generally do not commence until the solution is in use 
the company s revenues from system sales historically have been lower in the first quarter of the year and greater in the fourth quarter of the year  primarily as a result of the clients year end efforts to make all final capital expenditures for the current year 
stock price may be volatile the trading price of the company s common stock may be volatile 
the market for the company s common stock may experience significant price and volume fluctuations in response to a number of factors including actual or anticipated quarterly variations in operating results  rumors about the company s performance or software solutions  changes in expectations of future financial performance or changes in estimates of securities analysts  governmental regulatory action  health care reform measures  client relationship developments  changes occurring in the securities 
table of contents markets in general and other factors  many of which are beyond the company s control 
as a matter of policy  the company does not generally comment on rumors 
furthermore  the stock market in general  and the market for software  health care and high technology companies in particular  has experienced extreme volatility that often has been unrelated to the operating performance of particular companies 
these broad market and industry fluctuations may adversely affect the trading price of the company s common stock  regardless of actual operating performance

changes in the health care industry the health care industry is highly regulated and is subject to changing political  economic and regulatory influences 
for example  the balanced budget act of public law contains significant changes to medicare and medicaid and began to have its initial impact in due to limitations on reimbursement  resulting cost containment initiatives  and effects on pricing and demand for capital intensive systems 
in addition  the health insurance portability and accountability act of hipaa will have a direct impact on the health care industry by requiring identifiers and standardized transactions code sets and necessary security and privacy measures in order to ensure the protection of patient health information 
these factors affect the purchasing practices and operation of health care organizations 
federal and state legislatures have periodically considered programs to reform or amend the us health care system at both the federal and state level and to change health care financing and reimbursement systems 
these programs may contain proposals to increase governmental involvement in health care  lower reimbursement rates or otherwise change the environment in which health care industry participants operate 
health care industry participants may 
table of contents respond by reducing their investments or postponing investment decisions  including investments in the company s software solutions and services 
many health care providers are consolidating to create integrated health care delivery systems with greater market power 
these providers may try to use their market power to negotiate price reductions for the company s software solutions and services 
as the health care industry consolidates  the company s client base could be eroded  competition for clients could become more intense and the importance of acquiring each client becomes greater 
significant competition the market for health care information systems is intensely competitive  rapidly evolving and subject to rapid technological change 
the company believes that the principal competitive factors in this market include the breadth and quality of system and software solution offerings  the stability of the information systems provider  the features and capabilities of the information systems  the ongoing support for the system and the potential for enhancements and future compatible software solutions 
certain of the company s competitors have greater financial  technical  product development  marketing and other resources than the company and some of its competitors offer software solutions that it does not offer 
the company s principal existing competitors include ge medical systems  siemens medical solutions health services corporation  idx systems corporation  mckesson corporation  eclipsys corporation  medical information technology  inc meditech and epic systems corporation  each of which offers a suite of software solutions that compete with many of the company s software solutions and services 
there are other competitors that offer a more limited number of competing software solutions 
in addition  the company expects that major software information systems companies  large information technology consulting service providers and system integrators  internet based start up companies and others specializing in the health care industry may offer competitive software solutions or services 
the pace of change in the health care information systems market is rapid and there are frequent new software solution introductions  software solution enhancements and evolving industry standards and requirements 
as a result  the company s success will depend upon its ability to keep pace with technological change and to introduce  on a timely and cost effective basis  new and enhanced software solutions and services that satisfy changing client requirements and achieve market acceptance 
proprietary technology may be subjected to infringement claims or may be infringed upon the company relies upon a combination of license agreements  confidentiality procedures  employee nondisclosure agreements and technical measures to maintain the confidentiality and trade secrecy of its proprietary information 
the company also relies on trademark and copyright laws to protect its intellectual property 
the company has initiated a patent program but currently has a very limited patent portfolio 
as a result  the company may not be able to protect against misappropriation of its intellectual property 
in addition  the company could be subject to intellectual property infringement claims as the number of competitors grows and the functionality of its software solutions and services overlaps with competitive offerings 
these claims  even if not meritorious  could be expensive to defend 
if the company becomes liable to third parties for infringing their intellectual property rights  it could be required to pay a substantial damage award and to develop noninfringing technology  obtain a license or cease selling the software solutions that contain the infringing intellectual property 
government regulation the united states food and drug administration the fda has declared that software products intended for the maintenance of data used in making decisions regarding the suitability of blood donors and the release of blood or blood components for transfusion are medical devices under the federal food  drug and cosmetic act act and amendments to the act 
as a consequence  the company is subject to extensive regulation by the fda with regard to its blood bank software 
if other of the company s software solutions are deemed to be actively regulated medical devices by the fda  the company could be subject to extensive requirements governing pre and post marketing requirements including pre market notification clearance prior to marketing 
complying with these fda regulations 
table of contents would be time consuming and expensive 
it is possible that the fda may become more active in regulating computer software that is used in health care 
following an inspection by the fda in march of  the company received a form fda notice of inspectional observations alleging non compliance with certain aspects of fda s quality system regulation with respect to the company s pathnet hnac blood bank transfusion and donor products the blood bank products 
the company subsequently received a warning letter  dated april   as a result of the same inspection 
the company responded promptly to the fda and undertook a number of actions in response to the form and warning letter including an audit by a third party of the company s blood bank products and improvements to cerner s quality system 
a copy of the third party audit was submitted to the fda in october of and  at the request of the fda  additional information and clarification were submitted to the fda in january of there can be no assurance  however  that the company s actions taken in response to the form and warning letter will be deemed adequate by the fda or that additional actions on behalf of the company will not be required 
in addition  the company remains subject to periodic fda inspections and there can be no assurances that the company will not be required to undertake additional actions to comply with the act and any other applicable regulatory requirements 
any failure by the company to comply with the act and any other applicable regulatory requirements could have a material adverse effect on the company s ability to continue to manufacture and distribute its software solutions 
the fda has many enforcement tools including recalls  seizures  injunctions  civil fines and or criminal prosecutions 
any of the foregoing could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  results of operations or financial condition 
product related liabilities many of the company s software solutions provide data for use by health care providers in providing care to patients 
although no such claims have been brought against the company to date regarding injuries related to the use of its software solutions  such claims may be made in the future 
although the company maintains product liability insurance coverage in an amount that it believes is sufficient for its business  there can be no assurance that such coverage will cover a particular claim that may be brought in the future  prove to be adequate or that such coverage will continue to remain available on acceptable terms  if at all 
a successful claim brought against the company  which is uninsured  or under insured could materially harm its business  results of operations or financial condition 
system errors and warranties the company s systems  particularly the cerner millennium versions  are very complex 
as with complex systems offered by others  the company s systems may contain errors  especially when first introduced 
although the company conducts extensive testing  it has discovered software errors in its software solutions after their introduction 
the company s systems are intended for use in collecting and displaying clinical information used in the diagnosis and treatment of patients 
therefore  users of the company software solutions have a greater sensitivity to system errors than the market for software products generally 
the company s agreements with its clients typically provide warranties against material errors and other matters 
failure of a client s system to meet these criteria could constitute a material breach under such contracts allowing the client to cancel the contract and obtain a refund and or damages  or could require the company to incur additional expense in order to make the system meet these criteria 
the company s contracts with its clients generally limit the company s liability arising from such claims but such limits may not be enforceable in certain jurisdictions or circumstances 
anti takeover defenses the company s charter  bylaws  shareholders rights plan and certain provisions of delaware law contain certain provisions that may have the effect of delaying or preventing an acquisition of the company 
such provisions are intended to encourage any person interested in acquiring the company to negotiate with and obtain the approval of the board of directors in connection with any such transaction 
these provisions include a a board of directors that is staggered into three classes to serve staggered three year terms  b blank check preferred stock  c supermajority voting provisions  d inability of shareholders to act by written consent or call a special meeting  e limitations on the ability of shareholders to nominate directors or make proposals at shareholder meetings and f triggering the exercisability of stock purchase rights on a discriminatory basis  which may invoke extensive economic and voting dilution of a potential acquirer if its beneficial ownership of the company s 
table of contents common stock exceeds a specified threshold 
certain of these provisions may discourage a future acquisition of the company not approved by the board of directors in which shareholders might receive a premium value for their shares 
risks associated with the company s global operations the company markets  sells and services its software solutions globally 
the company has established offices around the world  including in north america  europe and in the asia pacific region 
the company will continue to expand its global operations and enter new global markets 
this expansion will require significant management attention and financial resources to develop successful direct and indirect global sales and support channels 
in some countries  the company s success will depend in part on its ability to form relationships with local partners 
there is a risk that the company may sometimes choose the wrong partner 
for these reasons  the company may not be able to maintain or increase global market demand for its software solutions 
global operations are subject to inherent risks  and the company s future results could be adversely affected by a variety of uncontrollable and changing factors 
these include greater difficulty in collecting accounts receivable and longer collection periods  difficulties and costs of staffing and managing foreign operations  the impact of economic conditions outside the united states  unexpected changes in regulatory requirements  certification requirements  reduced protection of intellectual property rights in some countries  potentially adverse tax consequences  political instability  trade protection measures and other regulatory requirements  service provider and government spending patterns  natural disasters  war or terrorist acts  poor selection of a partner in a country  and political conditions which may threaten the safety of associates or the continued presence of the company in these countries
