critical accounting policies and estimates our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states  which require us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and the related disclosures 
we believe that the following critical accounting policies  among others  affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
we periodically evaluate our long lived assets  including our investments in real estate  for impairment indicators 
our judgments regarding the existence of impairment indicators are based on factors such as operational performance  market conditions and legal factors 
future events could occur which would cause us to conclude that impairment indicators exist and an impairment loss is warranted 
the valuation of financial instruments under statement of financial accounting standards no 
 disclosures about fair value of financial instruments sfas no 
and statement no 
sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the fair value of the instruments 
where possible  we base the fair values of our financial instruments  including our derivative instruments  on listed market prices and third party quotes 
where these are not available  we base our estimates on other factors relevant to the financial instrument 
real estate is recorded at cost less accumulated depreciation 
depreciation is computed on the straight line basis over the estimated useful lives of the assets 
we use a year estimated life for buildings acquired and structural and land improvements  a ten to fifteen year estimated life for building upgrades and a three to seven year estimated life for furniture  fixtures and equipment 
expenditures for ordinary maintenance and repairs are expensed to operations as incurred and significant renovations and improvements that improve the asset and extend the useful life of the asset are capitalized over their estimated useful life 
the determination of useful lives  salvage value  and depreciation method used are in conformity with gaap 
however  the useful lives  salvage value  and customary depreciation method used for land improvements and other significant assets may significantly and materially overstate the depreciation of the underlying assets and therefore understate the net income of the company 
in addition  the financial accounting standards board fasb is currently reviewing the methods of depreciation and cost capitalization for all industries and in june issued fasb exposure draft  accounting in interim and annual financial statements for certain costs and activities related to property  plant and equipment  the implementation of which  if issued  could also have a material effect on the company s results of operations 
certain costs  primarily legal costs  relative to our efforts to effectively change the use and operations of several properties subject to rent control see note are currently classified in other assets 
these costs  to the extent these efforts are successful  are capitalized to the extent of the established value of the revised project and included in the net investment in real estate for the appropriate properties see note 
to the extent these efforts are not successful  these costs will be expensed 
in addition  we capitalize certain costs  primarily legal costs  related to entering into lease agreements which govern the term under which we may enter into leases with individual tenants and which are expensed over the term of the lease agreement 
in january  the fasb issued interpretation no 
 consolidation of variable interest entities 
the interpretation requires a variable interest entity to be consolidated by a company if that company is subject to a majority of the risk of loss from the variable interest entity s activities or entitled to receive a majority of the entity s residual returns or both 
the consolidation requirements of interpretation apply immediately to variable interest entities created after january  the consolidation requirements apply to older entities in the first fiscal year or interim period beginning after june  the company will adopt fin in the third quarter of we have not yet determined the effect the adoption of the interpretation will have on the company 
we have chosen to account for our stock compensation in accordance with apb no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  based upon the intrinsic value method  which results in no compensation expense for options issued with an exercise price equal to or exceeding the market value of the common shares on the date of grant 
we will elect to account for our stock compensation in accordance with sfas no 
and its amendment sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  effective in the first quarter of  which will result in compensation expense being recorded based on the fair value of the stock option compensation issued 
we have not yet determined the effect the statement will have on the company

funds from operations ffo  a non gaap financial performance measure  was redefined by nareit in april  as net income computed in accordance with gaap  before allocation to minority interests  excluding gains or losses from sales of property  plus real estate depreciation and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures 
the company computes ffo in accordance with the nareit definition  which may differ from the methodology for calculating ffo utilized by other equity reits and  accordingly  may not be comparable to such other reits computations 
funds available for distribution fad is defined as ffo less non revenue producing capital expenditures and amortization payments on mortgage loan principal 
the company believes that ffo and fad are useful to investors as a measure of the performance of an equity reit because  along with cash flows from operating activities  financing activities and investing activities  they provide investors an understanding of the ability of the company to incur and service debt and to make capital expenditures 
ffo and fad in and of themselves do not represent cash generated from operating activities in accordance with gaap and therefore should not be considered an alternative to net income as an indication of the company s performance or to net cash flows from operating activities as determined by gaap as a measure of liquidity and are not necessarily indicative of cash available to fund cash needs
