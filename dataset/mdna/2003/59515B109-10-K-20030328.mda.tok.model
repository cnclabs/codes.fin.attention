critical accounting policies 
while the listing below is not inclusive of all of the company s accounting policies  the company s management believes that the following policies are those which are most critical and embody the most significant management judgments and the uncertainties affecting their application and the likelihood that materially different amounts would be reported under different conditions or using different assumptions 
these critical policies are sales returns and other allowances and allowance for doubtful accounts 
the preparation of financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amount of assets and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
specifically  management must make estimates of potential future product returns related to current period product revenues 
the company s sales arrangements do not generally include acceptance provisions or clauses 
additionally  the company does not typically grant its distributors or other customers price protection rights or rights to return products bought  other than normal and customary rights of return for defects in materials or workmanship  and is not obligated to accept product returns for any other reason 
actual returns have not historically been significant 
management analyzes historical returns  current economic trends and changes in customer demand when evaluating the adequacy of its sales returns and other allowances 
similarly  the company s management must make estimates of the uncollectibility of its accounts receivables 
management specifically analyzes accounts receivable  historical bad debts  customer concentrations  customer credit worthiness  current economic trends and changes in its customers payment terms when evaluating the adequacy of its allowance for doubtful accounts 
the company s accounts receivable at december  totaled million  net of the allowance for doubtful accounts of million 
inventory valuation 
the preparation of the company s financial statements requires careful determination of the appropriate dollar amount of the company s inventory balances 
such amount is presented as a current asset in the company s balance sheet and is a direct determinant of cost of goods sold in the statement of operations and therefore has a significant impact on the amount of net income reported in an accounting period 
the basis of accounting for inventories is cost  which is the sum of expenditures and charges  both direct and indirect  incurred to bring the inventory quantities to their existing condition and location 
the company s inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market  with cost determined using the first in  first out fifo method  which assumes that inventory quantities are sold in the order in which they are manufactured or purchased 
the company utilizes standard costs as a management tool 
the company s standard cost valuation of its inventories is adjusted at regular intervals to reflect the approximate cost of the inventory under fifo 
the determination of the indirect charges and their allocation to the company s work in process and finished goods inventories is complex and requires significant management judgment and estimates 
material differences may result in the valuation of the company s inventories and in the amount and timing of the company s cost of goods sold and resulting net income for any period if management made different judgments or utilized different estimates 
on a periodic basis  management reviews its inventory quantities on hand for obsolescence  physical deterioration  changes in price levels and the existence of quantities on hand which may not reasonably be expected to be used or sold within the normal operating cycles of the company s operations 
to the extent that any of these conditions are believed to exist or the utility of the inventory quantities in the ordinary course of business is no longer as great as their carrying value  a reserve against the inventory valuation is established 
to the extent that this reserve is established or increased during an accounting period  an expense is recorded in the company s statement of operations  generally in cost of good sold 
significant management judgment is required in determining the amount and adequacy of this reserve 
in the event that actual results differ from management s estimates or these estimates and judgments are revised in future periods  the company may need to establish additional reserves which could materially impact the company s financial position and results of operation 
as of december   the company s inventories totaled million  net of reserves for slow moving and obsolete inventories of million 
management believes that the company s inventory valuation  together with the recorded reserves for slow moving and obsolete inventories  results in carrying the inventory at the lower of cost or market 
accounting for income taxes 
in conjunction with preparing the company s consolidated financial statements  management is required to estimate the company s income tax liability in each of the jurisdictions in which the company operates 
this process involves estimating the company s actual current tax exposure together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items for tax and accounting purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets or liabilities which are reflected in the company s consolidated balance sheet 
management must also assess the likelihood that the company s deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income 
to the extent that management believes that recovery is not likely  a valuation allowance must be established and reviewed in each accounting period 
increases in the valuation allowance in an accounting period require that the company record an expense within its tax provision in its consolidated statement of operations 
decreases in the valuation allowance in an accounting period require that the company reverse previously recorded valuation allowances resulting in a corresponding benefit within its tax provision and its consolidated statement of operations 
significant management judgment is required in determining the company s provision for income taxes  its deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowance recorded against the company s net deferred tax assets 
at december   the company s net deferred tax assets totaled million 
the company has recorded a valuation allowance of million as of december   due to uncertainties related to the company s ability to utilize some of its deferred tax assets  primarily consisting of net operating loss carryforwards  before they expire 
the valuation allowance is based on management s estimates of taxable income by jurisdiction in which the company operates and the period over which the deferred tax assets will be recoverable 
in the event that actual results differ from these estimates or these estimates are adjusted in future periods  the company may need to adjust this valuation allowance which could materially impact the company s financial position and results of operation 
valuation of long lived and intangible assets and goodwill 
the company assesses the impairment of identifiable intangibles  long lived assets and related goodwill whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable based on estimates of future undiscounted cash flows 
factors that are considered by management in performing this assessment include  but are not limited to  the following the company s performance relative to historical or projected future operating results  the company s intended use of acquired assets or the company s strategy for its overall business  and industry or economic trends 
in the event that the carrying value of intangibles  long lived assets and related goodwill is determined to be impaired  such impairment is measured using a discount rate determined by management to be commensurate with the risk inherent in the company s current business model 
net intangible assets  long lived assets and goodwill  including property and equipment  amounted to million as of december  effective january   the company implemented statement of financial account standard sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  and as a result  ceased to amortize its goodwill of approximately million but continues to amortize other intangible assets 
goodwill amortization expense recorded during amounted to approximately million 
in lieu of amortization  the company was required to perform an initial impairment review of its goodwill as of january  and will conduct an impairment review thereafter at least annually 
the company has chosen june th as its annual impairment test date 
the company s transitional impairment test was as of january  and the impairment test performed as of june  indicated that no impairment loss was necessary

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company s operating results and cash flows are subject to fluctuations from changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates 
the company s cash and cash equivalents are short term  highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less consisting entirely of us government securities or government backed securities 
these investments are classified in accordance with sfas  accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities  as available for sale securities and are stated at cost  which approximates market 
as a result of the short term nature of the company s cash and cash equivalents  a change of market interest rates does not impact the company s operating results or cash flow 
the assets and liabilities of the company s united kingdom subsidiary are translated into us dollars at current exchange rates  and revenues and expenses are translated at average exchange rates 
international sales by the company during were million 
approximately million of the company s international sales in were billed and paid in foreign currencies 
currency translations on international sales that are billed and paid in foreign currencies could be adversely affected in the future by the relationship of the us dollar with foreign currencies 
the effect of foreign currency transactions was not material to the company s results of operations for the year ended december  the company may in the future export or import increased amounts of products payable in foreign currencies  exposing the company to increased risks on fluctuations in currency exchange rates 
the company s greatest sensitivity with respect to market risk is to changes in the general level of us interest rates and its effect upon the company s interest expense 
at december   the company had long term debt totaling million that bears interest at a floating rate approximating the prime rate or libor 
because these rates are variable  an increase in interest rates would result in additional interest expense and a reduction in interest rates would result in reduced interest expense 
the company does not use derivative instruments for trading purposes or to hedge its market risks  and the use of such instruments would be subject to strict approvals by the company s senior officers 
therefore  the company s exposure related to such derivative instruments is not expected to be material to the company s financial position  results of operations or cash flows
