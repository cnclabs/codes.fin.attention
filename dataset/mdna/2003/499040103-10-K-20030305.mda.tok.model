critical accounting policies and estimates general 
management s discussion and analysis of its financial condition and results of operations are based upon the company s consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires the company to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenue and expenses  cash flows and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an ongoing basis  management evaluates its estimates  including those related to incentives  bad debts  inventories  investments  intangible assets  income taxes  financing arrangements  restructuring  long term service contracts  pensions and other postretirement benefits  and contingencies and litigation 
management bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
management believes the following critical accounting policies affect its more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition 
revenue recognition varies by source 
advertising revenue is recognized when advertisements are published 
circulation revenue is recognized when the newspaper is delivered to the customer 
other revenue is recognized when the related product or service has been delivered 
revenue is recorded net of estimated incentive offerings  including special pricing agreements  promotions and other volume based incentives 
revisions to these estimates are charged to income in the period in which the facts that give rise to the revision become known 
bad debts 
the company maintains a reserve account for estimated losses resulting from the inability of its customers to make required payments 
if the financial condition of the company s customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
the company uses a combination of the percentage of sales and the aging of accounts receivable methods to establish allowances for losses on accounts receivable 
payment in advance for some advertising and circulation revenue and credit background checks  have assisted the company in maintaining historical bad debt losses to less than of revenue 
equity and cost method investment valuation and accounting 
the company holds minority interests in companies having operations or technology in areas within its strategic focus and records these investments at cost 
the company records an investment impairment charge when it believes an investment has experienced a decline in value that is other than temporary 
future adverse changes in market conditions or poor operating results of underlying investments could result in losses or an inability to recover the carrying value of the investments 
in these cases  an impairment charge could be required in the future 
goodwill and intangible impairment 
the company must assess  at least annually  potential impairment of its goodwill and purchased intangible assets 
this asset impairment review assesses the fair value of the assets based on the future cash flows the assets are expected to generate 
an impairment loss is recognized when estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset plus net proceeds expected from disposition of the asset if any are less than the carrying value of the asset 
this approach uses estimates of future market growth  forecasted revenue and costs  expected periods the assets will be utilized and appropriate discount rates 
such evaluations of impairment of long lived assets including goodwill and purchased intangible assets are an integral part of  but not limited to  the company s strategic reviews of the business and operations performed in conjunction with restructuring actions 
if the estimated fair value of the asset is less than its carrying value  an impairment loss will be recognized in an amount equal to the difference 
if these estimates or their related assumptions change in the future  the company may be required to record impairment charges for these assets 
the company must also record its share of impairment charges recorded by its equity method investees 
restructuring 
due to the slowing economy and the resulting decline in advertising revenue  the company in the second quarter of announced a work force reduction program affecting the majority of its newspapers 
the work force reduction plan eliminated approximately  positions and the company recorded a pre tax expense in june of million in reserves in connection with the restructuring 
this expense included estimates pertaining to employee separation costs and the settlement of certain contractual obligations in accordance with the emerging issues task force eitf  liability recognition for certain employee termination benefits and other costs to exit an activity 
as of june   the plan was complete and substantially all payments were made 
pension and postretirement benefits 
the company has significant pension and postretirement benefit costs and credits that are developed from actuarial valuations 
these valuation assumptions include health care cost trend rates  salary growth  long term return on plan assets  discount rates and other factors 
the company s health care cost trend assumptions are developed based on historical cost data  the near term outlook and an assessment of likely long term trends 
the salary growth assumptions reflect the company s long term actual experience and future and near term outlook 
long term return on plan assets is determined based on historical results of the portfolio and management s expectation of the current economic environment 
the discount rate assumption is based on current investment yields on aa rated corporate long term bond yields 
actual results that differ from these assumptions are accumulated and amortized over the future life of the plan participants 
for an explanation of these assumptions  see note pension and other postretirement benefit plans on page while the company believes that the assumptions used are appropriate  significant differences in actual experience or significant changes in assumptions would affect the company s pension and other postretirement benefits costs and obligations 
self insurance 
the company is self insured for the majority of its group health insurance costs 
the company relies on claims experience and the advice of consulting actuaries and administrators in determining an adequate liability for self insurance claims 
income taxes 
the company records incomes taxes in accordance with sfas accounting for income taxes 
the company maintains a liability to cover the cost of additional tax exposure items on the filing of federal and state income tax returns 
the company files a federal consolidated income tax return and state consolidated  combined or separate returns depending upon the state requirements 
each of these filing jurisdictions may audit the tax returns filed and propose adjustments 
adjustments arise from a variety of factors  including different interpretation of statutes and regulations 
legal

see note commitments and contingencies on page for further information 
management reviews and determines which liabilities  if any  arising from these claims and litigation could have a material adverse effect on the company s consolidated financial position  liquidity  results of operations or properties 
management assesses the likelihood of any adverse judgments or outcomes as well as potential ranges of probable losses 
determination of the amount of reserves required for these contingencies is made after analysis and discussion with counsel

two additional significant expenses relate to the investment in careerbuilder llc 
they were a a million charge in the first quarter for severance expense and other costs resulting from the relocation of offices and abandonment of certain assets  and b an million charge 
per share after tax associated with the conversion of careerbuilder from a corporation into a limited liability company 
during the third quarter  career holdings was converted from a c corporation to a limited liability company llc 
the conversion resulted in a taxable gain to career holdings to the extent the fair value of its assets was greater than the tax basis on the date of the conversion 
there was no book or gaap basis gain upon this conversion 
accordingly  career holdings recorded a tax expense and owes taxes of approximately million 
knight ridder recorded its share of this expense as part of the loss from equity investments 
career holdings conversion to an llc also triggered the recognition of a tax loss for knight ridder 
since the acquisition of its interest in career holdings  knight ridder has recorded tax benefits in the form of deferred taxes for its share of the losses arising from career holdings operating results 
the conversion allows knight ridder to recognize these losses for income tax purposes because the conversion is treated as a sale of the stock of career holdings for its fair market value 
this generated a capital loss for knight ridder  which can be carried back and applied against taxes paid by knight ridder in prior years 
this will result in a tax refund claim of approximately million when knight ridder files its income tax returns for because the company had previously recorded the impact of these losses for financial statement reporting  the recognition of the tax loss will not impact knight ridder s gaap earn effective tax rate reflected in the financial statements 
following the conversion to an llc  knight ridder s share of career holdings operating results will be included in knight ridder s consolidated tax returns 
unlike c corporations  which are separate entities subject to income tax  llcs generally are not taxable entities  and their operating results are included in those of its members
