item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amount of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
the most significant estimates and assumptions relate to our allowance for doubtful accounts  assessment of inventory impairment  warranty reserves  revenue recognition  assessment of goodwill impairment and stock based compensation 
allowance for doubtful accounts we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
these allowances are determined by analyzing historical data and trends 
our policy is to record a minimum reserve based on a formula requiring past due customer accounts be reserved for at an increasing percentage based on their age from the invoice date 
in addition to the minimum calculated reserve  we analyze our customers ability to pay based on their financial condition or other factors 
if we believe a customer s ability to pay is impaired we will record an additional reserve for these accounts 
if actual losses are greater than estimated amounts or if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  future results from operations could be adversely affected 
the provision for doubtful accounts is recorded in selling  general and administrative expenses 
inventory we write down the value of our inventory by our estimate of the difference between the cost of the inventory and its net realizable value 
our estimate takes into account projected sales of the inventory on hand and the age of the inventory in stock 
in addition  we assess the value of older model products when new product introductions may reduce their net realizable value 
if actual future demand or market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management  additional inventory write downs may be required 
the provision for write down of inventory is recorded in cost of revenues 
warranties we offer warranties on some products for various periods of time 
at the time of the sale  we establish a reserve for the estimated cost of warranties based on our best estimate of the amounts necessary to settle future and existing claims using historical data on products sold as of the balance sheet date 
the cost of warranties is affected by the length of the warranty  the product s failure rates and the customer s usage 
if the actual cost of warranties differs from our estimated amounts  future results of operations could be adversely affected 
we record warranty expense in cost of revenues 
revenue recognition we derive revenues primarily from the sale of products and to a lesser extent the provision of services and rental of equipment 
when complex installation of our products is required  revenue is recognized upon completion of the installation 
in all other situations revenue is recognized when title is transferred and there is no further obligation to the customer 
our service revenues are derived from parts and supplies  in house and field repairs  service contracts and customer education 
we sell service contracts on our products when the warranty period expires 
we recognize revenues from these service contracts ratably over the terms of the contracts due to the lack of historical data available regarding the timing of when the actual services were provided 
in the future  we may compile this information which could cause us to recognize service revenue over a different period 
goodwill impairment we adopted the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards sfas  goodwill and other intangible assets effective december  sfas requires companies to perform a transitional test and an annual test to determine whether there was any impairment of goodwill 
these tests involve determining the estimated fair value of the company s reporting units by measuring the net present value of their future cash flows 
if the net present value of estimated cash flows is less than the book value of the reporting unit we would perform step two of the goodwill impairment analysis  which could result in the write down of goodwill 
as of december   we had million of goodwill including million in our respiratory technologies segment  million in our critical care segment  million in our neurocare segment and million in our medical and surgical products segment 
we performed the transitional and annual tests in and have determined that there is no impairment of goodwill 
in performing this test  we used our internal operating and capital budgets  which are based on such assumptions as new product introductions  growth in sales of existing products  margin improvements  operating cost control  savings from past restructuring efforts  equipment replacement dates and building capacity needs 
we discounted our estimated cash flows using our estimated cost of capital 
if any of our assumptions are incorrect or if our cost of capital rises  it could result in an impairment of goodwill  which would require a charge to earnings 
stock based compensation stock options are granted to key employees and non employee directors 
upon vesting  an option becomes exercisable  meaning  an employee or director can purchase a share of the company s common stock at a price that is equal to the closing share price on the day of grant 
sfas  accounting for stock based compensation  permits companies either to continue accounting for stock options under accounting principles board apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  or to adopt a fair value based method to measure compensation cost 
under apb no 
 which we have elected to continue using  there is no compensation cost if  on the date of grant  the option s exercise price is equal to or greater than the share price 
under sfas  an option s fair value is estimted on the date of grant  and the value is expensed evenly over the vesting period 
if we had accounted for stock based compensation under the sfas fair value based method  net income would have been reduced by million  million and million for  and  respectively 
in order to estimate an options fair value under sfas  we use the black scholes option valuation model 
the option valuation model requires a number of assumptions  including future stock price volatility and expected option life the amount of time until the options are exercised or expire 
expected option life is based on actual exercise activity from previous option grants 
volatility is calculated based upon stock price movements over a period of time 
additionally  our share price on the day of grant influences the option value 
the higher the share price  as compared to the grant price  the more the option is worth 
changes in the option value after the day of grant are not reflected in expense 
any change in these assumptions could significantly impact the values produced by the option valuation model and  consequently  the pro forma effects disclosed in the summary of significant accounting policies footnote to the consolidated financial statements 
operations in order to align our segments with management focus  in the fourth quarter of we began reporting operations in four segments respiratory technologies  critical care  neurocare and medical and surgical products 
prior to this change  respiratory technologies and critical care were reported as one segment called respiratory care 
due to the method in which the segment data was collected in  we have determined that it is impracticable to restate the year segment data 
therefore  in the following discussions  respiratory technologies and critical care are included under respiratory care in the year  as well as  in the comparison of the year ended december  to the year ended december  in addition  in september  the company announced its plan to exit the patient monitoring business by divesting medical data electronics mde 
the consolidated financial statements have been restated to present mde as a discontinued operation 
we derive revenues primarily from the sale of products and to a lesser extent the provision of services and rental of equipment 
when complex installation is required  revenue from products is recognized upon completion of the installation 
in all other situations  revenue is recognized when title is transferred and there is no further obligation to the customer 
our service revenues are derived from parts and supplies  in house and field repairs  service contracts and customer education 
we sell service contracts on our products when the warranty period expires 
we recognize revenues from these service contracts ratably over the terms of the contracts 
we rent our products  primarily in the respiratory technologies segment  to hospitals and other customers for periods ranging from two weeks to over a year 
we recognize rental revenues ratably over the terms of the rental contract 
the respiratory technologies segment develops  manufactures  markets  services and rents products for the diagnosis and treatment of respiratory  pulmonary and sleep related disorders 
the critical care segment develops  manufactures  markets and services products to treat respiratory insufficiency caused by illness  injury or premature birth 
the neurocare segment principally develops  manufactures  markets and services a comprehensive line of neurodiagnostic  vascular and audiology systems 
the medical and surgical products segment develops  manufactures and markets disposable products  specialty medical products and polyurethanes 
results of operations the following table sets forth line items from our consolidated statements of income as percentages of total revenues for the periods indicated year ended december  december  december  revenues costs and operating expenses cost of revenues selling  general and administrative expenses research and development expenses restructuring costs purchased in process research and development operating income other expenses  net provision for income taxes income from continuing operations year ended december  compared with year ended december  revenues revenues increased in to million 
of this increase million was contributed by respiratory technologies  million from critical care and million from neurocare 
these increases were offset by a decrease of million from medical and surgical products 
our revenue increases were driven by a number of factors including increased volume  sales of new products  the weakening of the dollar against the euro and a fourth quarter acquisition 
offsetting these increases were a higher percentage of products sold to lower price markets  primarily homecare and international  and decreased sales to latin america caused by the economic climate in that region 
cost of revenues and gross margin cost of revenues increased over to million 
gross margin percentage decreased percentage points to from in our decrease in gross margin percentage points was due to a combination of factors including a higher percentage of total sales to lower price channels  and the consolidation of some our manufacturing operations in which temporarily resulted in duplicate labor costs 
we also recorded additional write downs of inventory in based on our projections of a higher percentage of our future sales coming from new products  which in some cases will displace sales of older products 
increases in property and earthquake insurance  which are included in manufacturing overhead  also had an impact on gross margin 
in addition  a larger percentage of our total labor costs were attributable to health insurance benefits in and we expect the increase in health insurance premiums to continue 
offsetting these decreases were synergies achieved in our manufacturing operations  partially due to the consolidations of our manufacturing operations in  a weakening of the dollar against the euro and the impact of the licensing revenue related to pulmonetics 
selling  general and administrative expenses selling  general and administrative expenses increased over to million 
as a percentage of revenues selling  general and administrative expenses were in compared with in increases in selling  general and administrative expenses were due to the inclusion of eme electro medical equipment limited s eme expenses from their acquisition in october and the impact of the first full year of being an independent public company 
this included the establishment of a separate and independent corporate function and all the associated costs such as a management team  a board of directors  annual report preparation  printing and mailing  as well as legal  audit and listing fees 
in addition  increases in all insurance expenses  including our first full year of directors and officers liability insurance  contributed to the increase in selling  general and administrative expenses 
we expect this increase in insurance expense to continue in the near term 
offsetting these increases were the absence of goodwill amortization  reduced expenses from the termination of the corporate services arrangement with thermo electron and lower incentive compensation expense 
research and development expenses research and development expense decreased to million 
as a percentage of revenues  research and development expense was in compared with in the decrease can be attributed to the movement of several large projects from the development stage into commercialization and a reimbursement from the european union for a completed research and development project at erich jaeger 
in addition  a large payment to a third party contract research organization in did not recur in restructuring costs we incurred million in restructuring costs in both and restructuring expenses in included a non cash charge of million to write down the value of a vacated facility in our neurocare segment 
other restructuring expenses in included million for the consolidation of manufacturing facilities in new hampshire and colorado with our main neurocare manufacturing facility in wisconsin 
associated with these consolidations were employee terminations  retention bonuses  employee relocations  recruiting costs  facility closing costs  as well as inventory and asset relocations 
we also incurred restructuring costs of million related to employee terminations in our medical and surgical products segment 
additional restructuring costs included million for the cost of exiting long term leases in europe and million for the severance of former executives 
in  restructuring expenses were primarily employee severance costs connected with the consolidation of our european facilities and expense reduction programs in the us 
also included in these expenses was a retention program put in place by our former parent company and the termination of former executives 
purchased in process research and development the company recorded million in expense for purchased in process research and development iprd related to the acquisition of eme as required by financial interpretation no 
fin  accounting for business combinations 
backlog backlog decreased or million from the end of to the end of decreases of million in respiratory technologies and million in neurocare were partially offset by increases of million and million in critical care and medical and surgical products  respectively 
reductions in both respiratory technologies and neurocare were due to adjustments to the opening balances resulting from applying a uniform definition of firm orders across all segments  as well as shortfalls resulting from economic climate in latin america 
neurocare was also affected by a number of large eeg orders booked in late  as well as a decline in volume by our distributor in japan 
the increase in critical care comes from the addition of eme in and orders for avea 
the increase in medical and surgical products can be attributed to strong volume growth across all product lines in our tecomet business 
provision for income taxes our effective tax rate was in compared to in the effective tax rate in exceeded the statutory federal income tax rate of primarily because of the impact of state income taxes and the nondeductible purchased iprd associated with our acquisition of eme  partially offset by the tax benefit attributable to export sales 
the impact of iprd on our effective tax rate was percentage point 
the effective tax rate in exceeded the statutory federal income tax rate primarily because of the impact of state income taxes and nondeductible amortization of goodwill  partially offset by the tax benefit attributable to export sales 
discontinued operations in the third quarter of  we decided to exit the patient monitoring business and divest our mde business unit 
we have recorded a million million after tax charge to write down the value of mde 
mde  which was previously reported in the medical and surgical products segment  is now recorded as a discontinued operation in all years presented 
segment information the following table shows revenues contributed by each of our operating segments  expressed in absolute dollars in thousands and as percentages of total revenues for the periods presented year ended operating segment december  december  december  respiratory technologies   critical care   respiratory care    neurocare    medical and surgical products    total revenues    respiratory technologies revenues increased to million 
this increase was a result of increased volume across all product lines as well as a weakening of the dollar against the euro 
also increasing revenues were sales of new products such as the vmax spectra  which was launched in late and the orion cpap and hiox  both launched in in addition  health management systems hms  our clinical service business  had significant revenue gains 
operating income increased to million primarily due to increased gross profits on higher sales 
also contributing to the increase  were lower research and development expenses due to the movement of several large research projects  such as the vmax spectra  into commercialization in  and lower restructuring costs in offsetting these increases in operating income were increased selling  general and administrative expenses due to additional commissions on increased sales  higher insurance expense  and an increase in the provision for bad debts offset by the absence of goodwill amortization and lower incentive compensation expense 
critical care revenues increased to million 
this increase was driven by the acquisition of eme in the fourth quarter of and by sales of our new products  avea and vela  in the second half of in the case of avea  the sales were primarily to international distributors for use as demonstration equipment to solicit new orders 
in addition  we shipped a higher percentage of sales to lower price markets 
operating income decreased to million 
the decrease was due primarily to a larger percentage of our sales being made to lower price channels and write downs on excess and obsolete inventory 
these write downs were based on lower sales projections for certain older model products 
the decrease in operating income was also due to higher selling  general and administrative expenses due to the inclusion of eme expenses in the fourth quarter  increased insurance expense  and an increased provision for bad debts offset by the absence of goodwill amortization and lower incentive compensation in also contributing to the decrease in operating income were increased research and development expenses in the first three quarters of due to avea and vela 
neurocare revenues increased to million due to the introduction of several new products during including audera  audioscreener  and snap 
offsetting this increase was a decrease in sales to latin america  traditionally a strong market for the segment and a decrease in the sales of older product lines being replaced by audera and audioscreener 
operating income more than doubled in to million primarily due to lower selling  general and administrative expenses resulting from our restructuring efforts and the absence of goodwill amortization in in addition  our research and development expense decreased due to lower overhead expense attributable to the consolidation of research facilities in wisconsin 
in addition  we licensed technologies from third parties for two of our new products  as opposed to internally generating the technology 
medical and surgical products revenue from continuing operations decreased to million 
the decrease was due to a number of factors including lower sales of clean suits to a large semiconductor manufacturer and decreased sales of polyurethane resin and film to our industrial and consumer products customers 
we believe that the general economic downturn has affected our industrial and consumer products customers sales  which in turn have affected their purchases from us 
we believe that this market has reached its low point and we expect an increase in sales in the decrease was offset by increases in sales of enteral feeding tubes  other disposable medical products  orthopedic implants and the components for a left ventricular assist device 
operating income increased to million due to lower manufacturing expenses in our orthopedic implant and polyurethane businesses as a result of restructuring efforts  as well as the absence of goodwill amortization in offsetting these factors were higher selling  general and administrative expenses due to increased insurance and duplicative facility expense in the fourth quarter of resulting from the move of our thermedics business into its new facility 
year ended december  compared with year ended december  revenues revenues increased to million in from million in increases in revenues of million in the respiratory care segment and million in the medical and surgical products segment were offset by a decrease in revenues of million in the neurocare segment 
we estimate that approximately million of our revenues in were attributable to demand for year compliant products that we were unable to ship in  including million in the respiratory care segment and million in the neurocare segment 
revenues in the respiratory care segment increased to million in from million in revenues increased primarily due to an increase in international demand for ventilation products 
backlog increased to million at december  from million at december  due to the increased demand described above 
revenues in the neurocare segment decreased to million in from million in  primarily due to the completion of shipments in of year compliant products that had been ordered in backlog decreased to million from million due to disruptions caused by our european restructuring in the fourth quarter of revenues in the medical and surgical products segment increased to million in from million in the increase resulted primarily from million of higher sales of orthopedic implants and million from medical resins and tubing  as well as increased demand for film used in the manufacture of secure glass for adverse weather conditions and security applications 
higher revenues also resulted from increased sales of feeding tubes 
backlog decreased to million from million primarily due to a lack of orders from a major customer of orthopedic devices who was evaluating its suppliers following a merger 
costs and gross margin our gross margin was and in and  respectively 
improvements in the respiratory care segment margins and flat margins in the medical and surgical products segment were offset by lower margins in the neurocare segment 
the respiratory care segment improvements were primarily due to the impact of the sales increase mentioned above and the consolidation and other restructuring efforts discussed below 
the neurocare segment was adversely affected by lower sales volume in resulting in a higher proportion of fixed manufacturing costs to revenues and by reduced margins due to competitive pricing pressure 
these negative pressures were partially offset by cost reduction programs begun by management in late selling  general and administrative expenses selling  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenues were and in and  respectively 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased to million in from million in we incurred approximately million of additional selling  general and administrative expenses to establish corporate office functions necessary in becoming a public company 
research and development expenses research and development expenses increased million to million in from million in the increase was primarily due to higher research and development expenses for new products in existing and emerging markets  including several new sleep therapy products and new ventilator platforms 
we also invested in the development of in licensed technologies 
restructuring costs we recorded restructuring and other unusual costs of million in compared to million in of the total million restructuring and other unusual costs incurred in  million was for severance costs related to the reduction of approximately employees across all functions and million was for employee retention costs for employees  principally key management team members  to help assure their availability at least through the distribution date of our common stock  which occurred on november  as of december   all but one of the employees covered by a retention agreement remained with our company 
the remaining costs incurred included million for abandoned facility costs and million for other restructuring costs 
the million of charges in included million in the respiratory care segment  in the neurocare segment  million in the medical and surgical products segment and million in the corporate office 
provision for income taxes our effective tax rate was in compared to in the effective tax rate in both years exceeded the statutory federal income tax rate of primarily because of the impact of state income taxes and nondeductible amortization of goodwill  partially offset by the tax benefit attributable to export sales 
liquidity and capital resources cash generated from operating activities was million for our primary source of cash was net income of million and non cash charges totaling million  including the write down of mde to its net realizable value 
this source of cash was reduced by a million increase in inventory largely in our critical care segment  as a result of production stock and demonstration inventory built in anticipation of the avea and vela launches  a million increase in accounts receivable due to increased sales volume and a million decline in accounts payable due to the absence of management incentive payment accruals and the timing of vendor payments 
cash used in investing activities was million for the cash use is primarily attributable to our two acquisitions  capital spending and purchases of intangible assets 
cash expended for the acquisitions in  net of cash acquired  was million 
expenditures for the purchase of property  plant and equipment totaled million  including million for computer equipment at hms  million for the establishment of the corporate office and purchases of other office equipment  million for a manufacturing facility for our thermedics business and million in purchases of manufacturing and research and development equipment 
in addition  the company purchased million of licenses for custom software used in our products 
during  our financing activities provided cash of million 
this cash source relates primarily to the net drawings on our credit facility during the year in the amount of million offset by the repayment of the million note payable to thermo electron 
our consolidated working capital was million at december   compared to million at december  our cash and cash equivalents totaled million at december  and december  we currently have a three year  million revolving credit facility with a syndicate of seven banks 
under the facility  there are options under which we can borrow funds that determine the interest rate charged 
these options include borrowings at libor plus a spread or at the prime rate plus a spread 
under the libor option  the interest rate depends on the term selected which can be no more than one year  and is fixed for that term 
under the prime rate option  the interest rate fluctuates based on the prime rate during the period which any amount is outstanding under that option 
at december   there was million outstanding under the facility at a weighted average interest rate 
our ability to access the credit facility is dependent on complying with the debt covenants that are part of that agreement 
the covenants include a maximum ratio of debt to earnings before interest taxes and depreciation and amortization ebitda of  a minimum ratio of ebitda to interest expense of  maximum annual capital expenditures of million and a minimum level of stockholders equity 
we believe that the credit facility  planned equity offering  disposition of mde and cash flow from operations will generate capital resources sufficient to meet the capital requirements of our business for at least the next twelve months and to pay interest as it becomes due on the credit facility 
while we are currently in compliance with the debt covenants under the credit facility and expect to be able to meet the requirements in the future  failure to satisfy any of the conditions would require us to renegotiate the facility on terms that may not be as favorable or could require us to repay any outstanding principal balance 
if required to repay the credit facility  we may not have sufficient capital resources to repay the amounts outstanding 
as a result  we would need to seek alternative funding sources  either through public or private financing or other arrangements  to repay this debt 
our ability to maintain the existing credit facility or to obtain other debt or equity financing will depend on a number of factors  including market conditions  our operating performance and investor interest 
as a result  we cannot assure that we will have sufficient capital resources and we may be required to revise our business plan to reduce expenditures  including curtailment of our growth strategies  product development strategies and acquisition strategies 
beyond the next twelve months  our capital requirements will depend on many factors  including the rate of our sales growth  market acceptance of our new products  research and development spending  the success of our product development efforts  capital spending policies of our customers  government spending policies and general economic conditions 
our expected capital expenditures in are million 
although we are not a party to any agreement or letter of intent with respect to a potential acquisition transaction  we may enter into acquisitions or strategic arrangements in the future that may require us to seek additional debt or equity financing 
contractual obligations the table below sets forth amounts due under the credit facility which expires in may  as well as future minimum annual rentals attributable to noncancellable operating leases payment due dates thereafter total millions of dollars short term credit facility operating leases although there is no requirement to repay the credit facility prior to  the company intends to reduce principal drawn on the facility as cash becomes available 
the irs rulings with respect to the spin off distribution of our common stock by thermo electron contemplate a public offering of to of our stock prior to november  we may be unable to complete a public offering for a number of reasons  including adverse market conditions or adverse developments in our business 
if we are unable to complete a public offering  we may be required to revise our business plan to reduce expenditures  including curtailment of our growth strategies  product development strategies and acquisition strategies 
in addition  if we do not conduct an offering by november   the distribution could become taxable 
thermo electron may assert that we are responsible for any resulting tax liability if the liability can be attributed to certain actions by us 
relationship with former parent company in connection with the spinoff distribution  we entered into a transition services agreement under which thermo electron s corporate staff provided us with certain administrative services 
thermo electron provided us with these services in a manner consistent with the services that thermo electron provided to us prior to the distribution 
in return  we paid thermo electron a fee equal to of our consolidated revenues for the period from november  through december   for the first quarter of and for the second quarter of  plus out of pocket and third party expenses 
the transition services agreement stated that thermo electron s corporate staff would provide us with corporate record keeping  legal  treasury  employee benefit  internal audit  executive compensation  real estate and information systems services through december   financial reporting and securities compliance services through march   tax related services through april  and risk management services through june  for these services we were charged million in and million in the transition services agreement provided that thermo electron  at its discretion  would provide us with additional services specifically requested by us  such as acquisition and offering support services  on terms upon which we and thermo electron mutually agree 
we were party to a corporate services arrangement with thermo electron through november  under which thermo electron s corporate staff provided certain administrative services  including certain legal advice and services  risk management  certain employee benefit administration  tax advice and preparation of tax returns  centralized cash management and certain financial and other services  for which we have paid thermo electron annually an amount equal to of our consolidated revenues 
effective april  the fee under this agreement was reduced to through the spinoff date 
for these services we were charged million and million in and  respectively 
these amounts were recorded as selling  general and administrative expenses 
for additional items such as employee benefit plans  insurance coverage and other identifiable costs  thermo electron has charged us based upon costs attributable to our company 
on the spinoff date  the corporate services arrangement with thermo electron was terminated and was replaced with the transition services agreement described above 
recent accounting pronouncements see note to the consolidated financial statements for a complete description of the effect of recent accounting pronouncements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates  which could affect our future results of operations and financial condition 
we manage our exposure to these risks through our regular operating and financing activities 
we generally view our investment in international subsidiaries with a functional currency other than our reporting currency as long term 
our investment in international subsidiaries is sensitive to fluctuations in currency exchange rates 
the functional currencies of our international subsidiaries are denominated principally in the euro  sterling and yen 
the effect of a change in currency exchange rates on our net investment in international subsidiaries is reflected in the accumulated other comprehensive income loss component of stockholder investment 
a reduction in year end functional currency exchange rates  relative to the us dollar  would result in a million reduction of stockholder investment 
our cash  cash equivalents and variable rate short term obligations are sensitive to changes in interest rates 
interest rate changes would result in a change in interest income and expense due to the difference between the current interest rates on cash  cash equivalents and the variable rate short term obligations and the rate that these financial instruments may adjust to in the future 
a increase in interest rates would have resulted in additional interest expense of million
