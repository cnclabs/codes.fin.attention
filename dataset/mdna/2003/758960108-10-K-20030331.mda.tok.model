the company s income from its contract with patlex is variable and is based upon revenues derived by patlex from the licensing of two laser patents  the first of which expires in november and the second of which expires in may while the amount of the income is uncertain and patlex has not provided the company with any projections  the company currently estimates that it will have quarterly revenues of approximately  in and and  in the agreement with oxo provides for a royalty of  during  after which no further royalties shall be payable 
other license agreements are expected to provide gross revenues of approximately   and  during  and  respectively  after which such gross revenues will decrease significantly 
in addition  no further sales of licensing properties are anticipated 
expenses from the licensing of licensing related activities consist principally of amounts paid to licensors at contractually stipulated percentages of the company s specific patent and product revenues and  in addition  include expenses related to the administration  enforcement  maintenance and prosecution of patent  trademarks and license rights and related licenses 
these expenses decreased by  in as compared to and by  in as compared to as a percentage of licensing revenues  these expenses were  and in  and  respectively 
the decrease in both and is principally due to a decline in client expenses related to the revenue decrease and a decrease in licensing related salaries and benefits as the company focused on managing existing relationships 
selling  general and administrative expenses these expenses increased by  in the year ended december  as compared to the increase is primarily due to expenses associated with the repositioning of the company  which totaled approximately  management incentive compensation of  and the fact that a portion of the remaining selling  general and administrative expense was allocated to discontinued operations in selling  general and administrative expenses decreased by  in the year ended december  as compared to the decrease is primarily attributable to a reduction in payroll and payroll related expenses

the company has a claim for a tax refund estimated at  based upon the capital loss generated from the sale of its wholly owned subsidiary  ril  which can be carried back against capital gains recognized by the company during the preceding three tax years 
this tax benefit is dependent upon the company s tax basis in ril which must be calculated under the irs consolidated tax return regulations 
these regulations are complex and require an analysis of the company s federal consolidated tax returns and related information over the period of time in which ril has been a member of the company s consolidated tax group 
the refund claim is potentially subject to audit and approval by the internal revenue service 
in connection with the repositioning of the company  the company is required to pay taxes on the built in gains of assets transferred to it from subsidiaries that are no longer members of the company s consolidated tax group 
in addition  because of the uncertainty of collection of the variable purchase price relating to the sale of ril  it has not allocated any cost basis to this contract right for financial reporting basis but has estimated the value for tax purposes 
such built in gains  which are based upon the excess of the fair market value of the assets transferred over their tax basis and the estimated value of the sale of ril  constitute taxable income and are included in the company s tax provision related to discontinued operations and deferred tax assets see note 
inflation the company s income from licensing operations has not in the past been materially affected by inflation 
likewise  while currency fluctuations can influence licensing related revenues  the diversity of foreign income sources tends to offset individual changes in currency valuations 
future income from current licensing activities is expected to be derived from domestic sources only
