introduction as described in note to the accompanying consolidated financial statements included in item of this annual report on form k  registrant has restated its financial statements for the years ended december  and in connection with a deferred tax analysis of registrant s tax accounts performed in  registrant determined that it had miscalculated its net accumulated deferred income taxes and current tax payable account over several years  resulting in taxes on income not being recognized in the proper period  and overstating registrant s net deferred tax liabilities and current taxes payable 
registrant further determined that the amount of the overstatements  which totaled approximately million and million for awr and scw  respectively  arose in prior years and that prior years financial statements should be restated to reduce net accumulated deferred income taxes  taxes payable and the related tax expense to reflect amounts currently due and deferred

for the year ended december   fully diluted earnings were per common share as compared to per common share for the comparable period of earnings per common share reflect the to stock split of common shares completed on june  for both periods 
water operating revenues increased by in to million from the million reported in due to an increase of in consumption 
there were no significant water rate increases effective during differences in temperature and rainfall in registrant s service areas will impact sales of water to customers and may cause fluctuations in registrant s revenues and earnings between comparative periods

electric revenues increased by to million in as compared to million in the increases reflected i a rate increase of effective may  and an additional increase effective august  authorized by the cpuc to recover previously under collected energy costs  ii rate increases to cover purchased power costs under various power supply agreements  and iii an increase of in kilowatt hour consumption  primarily due to heavier use of snow making machines at ski resorts in the area in the fourth quarter of for further information  see the section entitled electric energy situation in california in part ii  item in management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation 
registrant relies upon rate increases for water and electric services approved by regulatory bodies in california and arizona in order to recover operating expenses and provide for a return on invested and borrowed capital used to fund utility plant 
without such adequate rate relief granted in a timely manner  revenues and earnings can be negatively impacted 
for more information  see the section entitled regulatory matters in part ii  item in management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation 
purchased water costs in increased by to million as compared to million in  reflecting an increase in purchased water volume resulting from i higher water consumption  ii additional purchased water necessary in to replace pumped water supply lost due to wells being removed from service as a result of water quality issues and mechanical problems  particularly in scw s orange county and san dimas customer service areas  iii refunds received from scw s wholesale water suppliers during of approximately  for which there was no counterpart in  and iv costs of approximately million  incurred most significantly in connection with the trucking of water  in scw s wrightwood customer service area due to a sudden and unexplained drop in groundwater level in the area during the early part of the third quarter of registrant has had to take a number of wells out of service from time to time due to various causes  including contamination by third parties 
changes in the water resource mix between water supplied from purchased sources and that supplied from registrant s own wells can increase actual supply related costs relative to the supply related costs approved for recovery through rates  thereby impacting earnings either negatively or positively 
registrant has the opportunity to change the supply related costs recovered through rates by application to the appropriate regulatory body 
registrant believes that its applications for recovery of supply related costs accurately reflect the water supply situation as it is known at the time 
however  it is impossible to adequately protect earnings from adverse changes in supply costs related to unforeseen contamination
