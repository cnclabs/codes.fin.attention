risk based capital requirements in order to enhance the regulation of insurer solvency  the naic has adopted a model law to implement risk based capital rbc requirements for life insurance companies 
the requirements are designed to monitor capital adequacy and to raise the level of protection that statutory surplus provides for policyholders 
the model law measures four major areas of risk facing life insurers i the risk of loss from asset defaults and asset value fluctuation  ii the risk of loss from adverse mortality and morbidity experience  iii the risk of loss from mismatching of asset and liability cash flow due to changing interest rates and iv business risks 
insurers having less statutory surplus than required by the rbc model formula will be subject to varying degrees of regulatory action depending on the level of capital inadequacy 
based on the formula adopted by the naic  all of the company s insurance subsidiaries adjusted capital exceeded the levels at which the company would be required to take corrective action by a substantial amount as of december  assessments against insurers insurance guaranty association laws exist in all states  the district of columbia and puerto rico

erisa considerations on december   the us supreme court issued its opinion in john hancock mutual life insurance company v 
harris trust and savings bank holding that certain assets in excess of amounts necessary to satisfy guaranteed obligations held by john hancock in its general account under a participating group annuity contract are plan assets and therefore subject to certain fiduciary obligations under the employee retirement income security act of  as amended erisa 
erisa requires that fiduciaries perform their duties solely in the interest of erisa plan participants and beneficiaries  and with the care  skill  prudence and diligence that a prudent person acting in a like capacity and familiar with such matters would use in the conduct of an enterprise of a like character and with like aims 
the court imposed erisa fiduciary obligations to the extent that the insurer s general account is not reserved to pay benefits under guaranteed benefit policies ie benefits whose value would not fluctuate in accordance with the insurer s investment experience 
the secretary of labor issued final regulations on january   providing guidance for the purpose of determining  in cases where an insurer issues one or more policies backed by the insurer s general account to or for the benefit of an employee benefit plan  which assets of the insurer constitute plan assets for purposes of erisa and the irc 
the regulations apply only with respect to a policy issued by an insurer to an erisa plan on or before december  in the case of such a policy  most provisions of the regulations are applicable on july  generally  where the basis of a claim is that insurance company general account assets constitute plan assets  no person will be liable under erisa or the irc for

on september   the second circuit us court of appeals held that hancock by following the terms of the contract did not violate its fiduciary duty when it refused to rollover free funds or revalue plan liabilities 
however  the court said it did violate fiduciary duties by exercising discretionary management decisions in matters not addressed by the contract which included investment of plan funds in its general account and allocation of the returns on investments and expenses among its client accounts

business outlook as part of the company s disclosure procedures  the company has incorporated a business outlook section as a part of its quarterly earnings release  conference call and md a 
as such  the following statements  which were published on february  as part of the company s earnings release  are forward looking  based on business conditions that existed as of december  due to the inherent difficulty in forecasting changes in interest rates  short term performance of the equity markets  as measured by the s p index  and the related performance of the company s separate account assets  the information provided below incorporates a range of possible results that are intended to illustrate the sensitivity of the company s revenue and earnings to the ultimate performance of the equity markets 
to the extent that actual interest rates and equity market performance varies from that assumed in the illustration below  actual results will vary accordingly 
interest spreads should be in a range to basis points in the individual annuity segment and to basis points in the institutional products segment 
for the full year  should the equity markets and the related performance of our separate account assets achieve a return of to percent per quarter for the full year and interest spreads perform as noted above  net operating income per diluted share should be within a range of to 
utilizing the same equity market assumptions noted above  revenue growth should be within a range of to percent and return on equity should be within a range of to percent for the full year the company s ability to meet the indicated outlook is subject to the factors described in the introduction section immediately above 
toward the end of each quarter  the company has a quiet period when it no longer publishes or updates its current outlook and company representatives will not comment concerning the company s financial results or expectations 
the quiet period will extend until the day when the company s next earnings release is published 
prior to the start of the next quiet period  april   investors can continue to rely on the earnings release and web site as still being the company s current expectations on matters covered  unless the company publishes a notice stating otherwise 
critical accounting policies and recently issued accounting pronouncements in preparing the consolidated financial statements  management is required to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses for the reporting period 
actual results could differ significantly from those estimates 
the most critical estimates include those used in determining dac for investment products and universal life insurance products  the value of business acquired voba  impairment losses on investments  valuation allowances for mortgage loans on real estate and federal income taxes 
see note to the consolidated financial statements included in the f pages of this report for a discussion of the company s significant accounting policies  including recently issued accounting pronouncements 
in addition  the following discussion of modified coinsurance arrangements relates to tentative guidance that could affect the company s accounting  if finalized 
although disclosure of the impact of proposed guidance issued by standard setting bodies is not appropriate in the footnotes to 
table of contents nationwide financial services  inc 
and subsidiaries financial statements issued in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america gaap  it is included herein as this tentative guidance is related solely to the company s industry and could change the accounting for such arrangements in the future 
on february  the fasb s derivatives implementation group issued tentative guidance related to the bifurcation of an embedded derivative within a reinsurer s receivable and ceding company s payable arising from a modified coinsurance arrangement dig b 
paragraph a of fasb statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities sfas indicates that an embedded derivative must be separated from the host contract if the economic characteristics and risks of the embedded derivative instrument are not clearly and closely related to the economic characteristics and risks of the host contract 
dig b indicates that bifurcation is necessary in a modified coinsurance arrangement because the yield on the receivable and payable is based on a specified proportion of the ceding company s return on either its general account assets or a specified block of those assets  rather than the overall creditworthiness of the ceding company 
status of the guidance provided in dig b related to modified coinsurance arrangements will remain tentative until it is formally cleared by the fasb and incorporated in an fasb staff implementation guide  which is contingent upon an amendment of sfas being issued 
as such  the company is still evaluating the impact that this guidance may have on its financial results 
the total amount of reserves that the company holds under modified coinsurance arrangements is million 
deferred policy acquisition costs for investment products and universal life insurance products the costs of acquiring business  principally commissions  certain expenses of the policy issue and underwriting department and certain variable sales expenses that relate to and vary with the production of new and renewal business have been deferred 
dac is subject to recoverability testing at the time of policy issuance and loss recognition testing at the end of each reporting period 
for investment products principally individual and group annuities and universal life insurance products  dac is being amortized with interest over the lives of the policies in relation to the present value of estimated future gross profits from projected interest margins  asset fees  cost of insurance  policy administration and surrender charges  less policy benefits and policy maintenance expenses 
the dac asset related to investment products and universal life insurance products is adjusted to reflect the impact of unrealized gains and losses on fixed maturity securities available for sale as described in note b to the consolidated financial statements included in the f pages to this report 
the most significant assumptions that are involved in the estimation of future gross profits include future net separate account performance  surrender lapse rates  interest margins and mortality 
the company s long term assumption for net separate account performance is percent 
if actual net separate account performance varies from the percent assumption  the company assumes different performance levels over the next three years  such that the mean return equals the long term assumption 
this process is referred to as a reversion to the mean 
the assumed net separate account return assumptions used in the dac models are intended to reflect what is anticipated 
however  based on historical returns of the s p index  the company s policy regarding the reversion to the mean process does not permit such returns to be below zero percent or in excess of percent during the three year reversion period 
changes in assumptions can have a significant impact on the amount of dac reported for investment products and universal life insurance products and their related amortization patterns 
in the event actual experience differs from assumptions or assumptions are revised  the company is required to record an increase or decrease in dac amortization expense dac unlocking  which could be significant 
in general  increases in the estimated general and separate account returns result in increased expected future profitability and may lower the rate of dac amortization  while increases in lapse surrender and mortality assumptions reduce the expected future profitability of the underlying business and may increase the rate of dac amortization 

table of contents nationwide financial services  inc 
and subsidiaries due to the magnitude of dac balance related to the individual variable annuity business  the sensitivity of the calculation to minor changes in the underlying assumptions and the related volatility that could result in the reported dac balance without meaningful improvement in its reasonableness  the company evaluates the appropriateness of the individual variable annuity dac balance within pre set parameters 
should the recorded balance of individual variable annuity dac fall outside of these parameters for a prescribed period of time  or should the recorded balance fall outside of these parameters and the company determines it is not reasonably possible to get back within this period of time  assumptions are required to be unlocked and the dac is recalculated using revised best estimate assumptions 
otherwise  dac is not unlocked to reflect updated assumptions 
in the event dac assumptions are unlocked and revised  the company will continue to use the reversion to the mean process 
for other investment products and universal life insurance products  dac is set each quarter to reflect revised best estimate assumptions  including the use of a reversion to the mean methodology over the next three years as it relates to net separate account performance 
any resulting dac unlocking adjustments are reflected currently in the consolidated financial statements 
as part of the regular quarterly analysis of dac  at the end of the third quarter of  the company determined that using actual experience to date and assumptions consistent with those used in the second quarter of  its individual variable annuity dac balance would be outside a pre set parameter of acceptable results 
the company also determined that it was not reasonably possible that the dac would return to an amount within the acceptable parameter within a prescribed period of time 
accordingly  the company unlocked its dac assumptions for individual variable annuities and reduced the dac asset to the amount calculated using the revised assumptions 
because the company unlocked the net separate account growth rate assumption for individual variable annuities for the three year reversion period  the company unlocked that assumption for all investment products and variable universal life insurance products to be consistent across product lines 
therefore  the company recorded an acceleration of dac amortization totaling million before tax  or million  net of million of federal income tax benefit  which has been reported in the following segments in the amounts indicated  net of tax individual annuity million  institutional products million and life insurance million 
the acceleration of dac amortization was the result of unlocking certain assumptions underlying the calculation of dac for investment products and variable universal life insurance products 
the most significant assumption changes were the resetting of the company s anchor date for reversion to the mean calculations to september   resetting the assumption for net separate account growth to percent during the three year reversion period for all investment products and variable life insurance products and increasing future lapses and costs related to guaranteed minimum death benefits gmdb on individual variable annuity contracts 
these adjustments were primarily driven by the sustained downturn in the equity markets 
value of business acquired as a result of the acquisition of nationwide provident see note to the consolidated financial statements included in the f pages of this report and the application of purchase accounting  the company reports an intangible asset representing voba 
voba reflects the estimated fair value of the business in force and represents the portion of the purchase price that is allocated to the value of the right to receive future cash flows from the life insurance and annuity contracts existing as of the closing date of the nationwide provident acquisition 
the value assigned to voba is supported by an independent valuation study that was commissioned by the company and executed by a team of qualified valuation experts  including actuarial consultants 
the expected future cash flows used in determining such value were based on actuarially determined projections  by each major line of business  of future policy and contract charges  premiums  mortality and morbidity  separate 
table of contents nationwide financial services  inc 
and subsidiaries account performance  surrenders  changes in reserves  operating expenses  investment income and other factors 
these projections took into account all known or expected factors at the valuation date  based on the judgment of management 
the actual experience on purchased business may vary from projections due to differences in renewal premiums  investment spreads  investment gains or losses  mortality and morbidity costs  or other factors 
amortization of voba occurs with interest over the anticipated lives of the major lines of business ranging from to years in relation to estimated gross profits  gross margins or premiums  as appropriate 
if estimated gross profits  gross margins or premiums differ from expectations  the amortization of voba is adjusted on a retrospective or prospective basis  as appropriate 
the voba asset related to investment products and universal life insurance products is also adjusted for the impact of net unrealized gains and losses on securities available for sale had such gains and losses been realized and allocated to the product lines 
as described in note b to the consolidated financial statements included in the f pages of this report  each year  the recoverability of voba is evaluated and if the evaluation indicates that the existing insurance liabilities  together with the present value of future net cash flows from the blocks of business acquired  is insufficient to recover voba  the difference is charged to expense as accelerated amortization of voba 
impairment losses on investments management regularly reviews its fixed maturity and equity securities portfolio to evaluate the necessity of recording impairment losses for other than temporary declines in the fair value of investments 
a number of criteria are considered during this process including  but not limited to  the current fair value as compared to amortized cost or cost  as appropriate  of the security  the length of time the security s fair value has been below amortized cost cost  and by how much  specific credit issues related to the issuer and current economic conditions 
also  the company estimates the cash flows over the life of purchased beneficial interests in securitized financial assets 
based on current information and events  if the company estimates that the fair value of its beneficial interests is not greater than or equal to its carrying value and if there has been a decrease in the estimated cash flows since the last revised estimate  considering both timing and amount  then an other than temporary impairment is recognized and the purchased beneficial interest is written down to fair value 
other than temporary impairment losses result in a permanent reduction of the cost basis of the underlying investment 
impairment losses are recorded on long lived assets used in operations when indicators of impairment are present and the undiscounted cash flows estimated to be generated by those assets are less than the assets carrying amount 
significant changes in the factors the company considers when evaluating investments for impairment losses could result in a significant change in impairment losses reported in the consolidated financial statements 
valuation allowances on mortgage loans on real estate the company provides valuation allowances for impairments of mortgage loans on real estate based on a review by portfolio managers 
mortgage loans on real estate are considered impaired when  based on current information and events  it is probable that the company will be unable to collect all amounts due according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement 
when the company determines that a loan is impaired  a provision for loss is established equal to the difference between the carrying value and the estimated value of the mortgage loan 
estimated value is based on the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the loan s effective interest rate  or the fair value of the collateral  if the loan is collateral dependent 
loans in foreclosure and loans considered impaired are placed on non accrual status 

table of contents nationwide financial services  inc 
and subsidiaries interest received on non accrual status mortgage loans on real estate is included in net investment income in the period received 
the valuation allowance account for mortgage loans on real estate is maintained at a level believed adequate by the company to absorb estimated credit losses 
the company s periodic evaluation of the adequacy of the allowance for losses is based on past loan loss experience  known and inherent risks in the portfolio  adverse situations that may affect the borrower s ability to repay  the estimated value of the underlying collateral  composition of the loan portfolio  current economic conditions and other relevant factors 
significant changes in the factors the company considers in determining the valuation allowance on mortgage loans on real estate could result in a significant change in the provision for valuation allowance reported in the consolidated financial statements 
federal income taxes the company provides for federal income taxes based on amounts the company believes it will ultimately owe

cost of insurance charges are assessed on the net amount at risk on universal life insurance policies 
the net amount at risk is equal to a policy s death benefit minus the related policyholder account value 
the amount charged is based on the insured s age and other underwriting factors 
the increase in cost of insurance charges is due primarily to growth in the net amount at risk related to corporate and individual investment life insurance reflecting the addition of nationwide provident  new sales  favorable persistency on policies sold in prior periods  and equity market declines which lowered policyholder account values

benefits and expenses interest credited to policyholder account values totaled billion in compared to billion in and billion in and principally relates to fixed annuities  both individual and institutional  funding agreements backing the company s medium term note program and certain life insurance products 
the growth in interest credited over the past two years reflects the increase in policy reserves for these products  partially offset by lower crediting rates in response to lower market interest rates 
crediting rates in the individual annuity segment have declined in and new crediting rates for most products are at  or near  contractual minimums  while in  crediting rates remained flat despite declining market interest rates  reflecting competitive market conditions 
other benefits and claims include policyholder benefits in excess of policyholder account balances for universal life and individual deferred annuities and net claims and provisions for future policy benefits for traditional life insurance products and immediate annuities

the company also determined that it was not reasonably possible that the dac would return to an amount within the acceptable parameter within a prescribed period of time 
accordingly  the company unlocked its dac assumptions for individual variable annuities and reduced the dac asset to the amount calculated using the revised assumptions 
because the company unlocked the net separate account growth rate assumption for individual variable

and subsidiaries annuities for the three year reversion period  the company unlocked that assumption for all investment products and variable universal life insurance products to be consistent across product lines 
therefore  the company recorded an acceleration of dac amortization totaling million  before tax  or million  net of million of tax benefit  which has been reported in the following segments in the amounts indicated  net of tax individual annuity million  institutional products million and life insurance million 
the acceleration of dac amortization was the result of unlocking certain assumptions underlying the calculation of dac for investment products and variable universal life insurance products 
the most significant assumption changes were the resetting of the company s anchor date for reversion to the mean calculations to september   resetting the assumption for net separate account growth to percent during the three year reversion period for all investment products and variable life insurance products and increasing future lapses and costs related to gmdb on individual variable annuity contracts 
these adjustments were primarily driven by the sustained downturn in the equity markets

pre tax operating income  net operating income or similar measures are commonly used in the insurance industry as a measure of ongoing earnings performance 
the excluded items are important in understanding the company s overall results of operations 
pre tax operating income or net operating income should not be viewed as substitutes for income from continuing operations before federal income taxes and cumulative effect of adoption of accounting principles or net income determined in accordance with gaap  and it should be noted that the company s definition of these non gaap financial measures may differ from that used by other companies 
the company believes that the presentation of these non gaap financial measures as they are measured for management purposes enhances the understanding of the company s results of operations by highlighting the results from ongoing operations  on a pre and post tax basis  and the underlying profitability factors of the company s business 
the company excludes net realized gains and losses on investments not related to securitizations  hedging instruments and hedged items  net of tax  from these non gaap financial measures because such items are often the result of a single non recurring event which may or may not be at the company s discretion

sales or similar measures are commonly used in the insurance industry as a measure of business generated in the period 
the company has not provided a reconciliation of sales to a comparative gaap financial measure because it does not believe there is a similar gaap financial measure as it relates to its industry  as described below 
sales should not be viewed as a substitute for revenues determined in accordance with gaap  and the company s definition of sales might differ from that used by other companies 
sales generate customer funds managed and administered  which ultimately drive revenues 
sales are primarily comprised of statutory premiums and deposits on individual and group annuities and life insurance products sold to a diverse customer base 
statutory premiums and deposits are calculated in accordance with accounting practices prescribed or permitted by regulatory authorities and then adjusted to arrive at sales 
sales also include deposits on administration only group pension plans 
revenues are generated from both current and previous sales that are in force during part of the reporting period and are reported as policy charges  life insurance premiums  net investment income and other revenues 
because revenues are generated primarily based on charges against the in force or surrendering contracts based on a fraction of the value of the contract and sales relate primarily to the amount of premiums and deposits received in a period  the company does not believe a reconciliation of these amounts would be meaningful 
sales are stated net of internal replacements  which in the company s opinion provides a more meaningful disclosure of sales 
in addition  sales exclude funding agreements issued under the company s medium term note program  large case bank owned life insurance boli  large case pension plan acquisitions  and deposits into nationwide employee and agent benefit plans 
although these products contribute to asset and earnings growth  they do not produce steady production flow that lends itself to meaningful comparisons and are therefore excluded from sales

nfs is a holding company whose principal asset is the common stock of nlic 
the principal sources of funds for nfs to pay interest  dividends and operating expenses are existing cash and investments  and dividends from nlic and other subsidiaries 
state insurance laws generally restrict the ability of insurance companies to pay cash dividends in excess of certain prescribed limitations without prior approval 
the ability of nlic to pay dividends is subject to restrictions set forth in the insurance laws and regulations of the state of ohio  its domiciliary state 
state of ohio insurance laws require life insurance companies to seek prior regulatory approval to pay a dividend if the fair market value of the dividend  together with that of other dividends made within the preceding months  exceeds the greater of i of statutory basis policyholders surplus as of the prior december or ii the statutory basis net income of the insurer for the prior year

and subsidiaries to disapprove payment within days after being notified  nlica may not pay any cash dividends or other non stock distributions to nfs during any month period if the total payments would exceed the same criteria as outlined two paragraphs above as it relates to nlic s limitations 
also  in connection with the acquisition of nationwide provident  the pennsylvania insurance department ordered that no dividends could be paid out of nlica for a period of three years without prior approval 
the statutory capital and surplus of nlica as of december  was million  while statutory net loss for the year ended december  was million 
nfs currently does not expect such regulatory requirements to impair its ability to pay interest  dividends  operating expenses and principal in the future

the company had borrowed million under this agreement as of december  a primary liquidity concern with respect to annuity and life insurance products is the risk of early policyholder withdrawal 
the company mitigates this risk by offering variable products where the investment risk is transferred to the policyholder  charging surrender fees at the time of withdrawal for certain products  applying a market value adjustment to withdrawals for certain products in the company s general account  and monitoring and matching anticipated cash inflows and outflows 
for individual annuity products billion of reserves as of december  the surrender charge is generally calculated as a percentage of the deposits made and is assessed at declining rates during the first seven years after a deposit is made 
for group annuity products billion of reserves as of december   the surrender charge amounts and periods can vary significantly  depending on the terms of each contract and the compensation structure for the producer 
generally  surrender charge percentages for group products are less than individual products because the company incurs lower expenses at contract origination for group products 
in addition  over ninety percent of the general account group annuity reserves are subject to a market value adjustment at withdrawal 
life insurance policies  while subject to withdrawal  are less susceptible to withdrawal than annuity products because policyholders generally must undergo a new underwriting process and may incur a surrender fee in order to obtain a new insurance policy 
the short term and long term liquidity requirements of the company are monitored regularly to match cash inflows with cash requirements 
the company periodically reviews its short term and long term projected sources and uses of funds and the asset liability  investment and cash flow assumptions underlying these projections

interest rate risk fluctuations in interest rates can potentially impact the company s earnings  cash flows and the fair value of its assets and liabilities 
generally  in a declining interest rate environment  the company may be required to reinvest the proceeds from matured and prepaid investments at rates lower than the overall yield of the portfolio  which could reduce interest spread income 
in addition  minimum guaranteed crediting rates typically or on certain annuity contracts could result in a reduction of the company s interest spread income in the event market interest rates remain at  or decline further from  december  levels 
the average crediting rate of fixed annuity products during was and for the individual annuity and institutional products segments  respectively  well in excess of the guaranteed rates 
however  crediting rates on new individual annuity business issued in december were at  or near  minimum guaranteed crediting rates 
the company mitigates this risk by investing in assets with maturities and durations that match the expected characteristics of the liabilities and by investing in mortgage and asset backed securities with limited prepayment exposure 
also  the company is part of an industry effort to lower the statutorily required minimum guaranteed interest crediting rate on future annuity issues 
conversely  a rising interest rate environment could result in a reduction of interest spread income or an increase in policyholder surrenders 
existing general account investments supporting annuity liabilities have a weighted average maturity of approximately years as of december  and therefore  the change in yield of the portfolio will lag changes in market interest rates 
this lag is increased if the rate of prepayments of securities slows 
to the extent the company sets renewal rates based on current market rates  this will result in reduced interest spreads 
alternatively  if the company sets renewal crediting rates while attempting to maintain a desired spread from the portfolio yield  the rates offered by the company may be less than new money rates offered by competitors 
this difference could result in an increase in surrender activity by policyholders 
if the company were unable to fund the surrenders with its cash flow from operations  the company may be required to sell investments  which likely would have declined in value due to the increase in interest rates 
the company mitigates this risk by offering products that assess surrender charges and or market value adjustments at the time of surrender  by investing in assets with maturities and durations that match the expected characteristics of the liabilities  and by investing in mortgage and asset backed securities with limited prepayment exposure 
asset liability management strategies to manage interest rate risk the company employs an asset liability management approach tailored to the specific requirements of each of its products 
each product line has an investment strategy based on its specific characteristics 
the strategy establishes asset maturity and duration  quality and other guidelines 
for fixed maturity securities and mortgages  the weighted average maturity is based on repayments  which are scheduled to occur under the terms of the asset 
for mortgage and asset backed securities  repayments are determined using the current rate of repayment of the underlying mortgages or assets and the terms of the securities

and subsidiaries for individual immediate annuities having future benefits  which cannot be changed at the option of the policyholder  the underlying assets are managed in a separate pool 
the duration of assets and liabilities in this pool are kept as close together as possible 
for assets  the repayment cash flows  plus anticipated coupon payments  are used in calculating asset duration 
future benefits and expenses are used for liabilities 
as of december   the average duration of assets in this pool was years and the average duration of the liabilities was years 
individual immediate annuity policy reserves on this business were billion as of december because the timing of the payment of future benefits on the majority of the company s business can be changed by the policyholder  the company employs cash flow testing techniques in its asset liability management process 
in addition  each year the company s annuity and insurance business is analyzed to determine the adequacy of the statutory basis reserves supporting such business 
this analysis is accomplished by projecting the anticipated cash flows from such business and the assets required to support such business under a number of possible future interest rate scenarios 
the first seven of these scenarios are required by state insurance regulation 
projections are also made using additional scenarios  which involve more extreme fluctuations in future interest rates and equity markets 
finally  to get a statistical analysis of possible results and to minimize any bias in the predetermined scenarios  additional projections are made using randomly generated interest rate scenarios 
for the company s cash flow testing process  interest rates for day treasury bills ranged from to under the predetermined scenarios and to under the random scenarios 
interest rates for longer maturity treasury securities had comparable ranges 
the values produced by each projection are used to determine future gains or losses from the company s annuity and insurance business  which  in turn  are used to quantify the adequacy of the company s statutory basis reserves over the entire projection period 
the results of the company s cash flow testing indicated that the company s statutory basis reserves were adequate as of december  use of derivatives to manage interest rate risk the company is exposed to changes in the fair value of fixed rate investments commercial mortgage loans and corporate bonds due to changes in interest rates 
to manage this risk  the company enters into various types of derivative instruments to minimize fluctuations in fair values resulting from changes in interest rates 
the company principally uses interest rate swaps and short eurodollar futures to manage this risk 
under interest rate swaps  the company receives variable interest rate payments and makes fixed rate payments  thereby creating floating rate investments 
short eurodollar futures change the fixed rate cash flow exposure to variable rate cash flows 
with short eurodollar futures  if interest rates rise fall  the gains losses on the futures adjust the fixed rate income on the investments  thereby creating floating rate investments 
as a result of entering into commercial mortgage loan and private placement commitments  the company is exposed to changes in the fair value of the commitment due to changes in interest rates during the commitment period 
to manage this risk  the company enters into short treasury futures 
with short treasury futures  if interest rates rise fall  the gains losses on the futures will offset the change in fair value of the commitment 
floating rate investments commercial mortgage loans and corporate bonds expose the company to fluctuations in cash flow and investment income due to changes in interest rates 
to manage this risk  the company enters into receive fixed  pay variable over the counter interest rate swaps or long eurodollar futures strips to convert the variable rate investments to a fixed rate 
in using interest rate swaps  the company receives fixed interest rate payments and makes variable rate payments  thereby creating fixed rate assets

and subsidiaries long eurodollar futures change the variable rate cash flow exposure to fixed rate cash flows 
with long eurodollar futures  if interest rates rise fall  the losses gains on the futures are used to reduce fluctuations in the variable rate income on the investments  thereby creating fixed rate investments 
foreign currency risk management in conjunction with the company s medium term note program  from time to time  the company issues both fixed and variable rate liabilities denominated in foreign currencies 
as a result  the company is exposed to changes in fair value of the liabilities due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates 
to manage these risks  the company enters into cross currency interest rate swaps to convert these liabilities to a variable us dollar rate 
for a fixed rate liability  the cross currency interest rate swap is structured to receive a fixed rate  in the foreign currency  and pay a variable us dollar rate  generally month libor 
for a variable rate foreign liability  the cross currency interest rate swap is structured to receive a variable rate  in the foreign currency  and pay a variable us dollar rate  generally month libor 
the company is exposed to changes in fair value of fixed rate investments denominated in a foreign currency due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates 
to manage this risk  the company uses cross currency interest rate swaps to convert these assets to variable us dollar rate instruments 
cross currency interest rate swaps on assets are structured to pay a fixed rate  in the foreign currency  and receive a variable us dollar rate  generally month libor 
cross currency interest rate swaps in place against each foreign currency obligation or investment hedge the company against adverse currency movements with respect to both period interest payments and principal repayment 
characteristics of interest rate sensitive financial instruments the following table provides information about the company s financial instruments as of december  that are sensitive to changes in interest rates

and subsidiaries additional information about the characteristics of the financial instruments and assumptions underlying the data presented in the table above are as follows mortgage and asset backed securities the maturity year is determined based on the terms of the securities and the current rate of prepayment of the underlying pools of mortgages or assets 
the company limits its exposure to prepayments by purchasing less volatile types of mbss and abss see management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations investments fixed maturity securities 
other fixed maturity securities and mortgage loans on real estate the maturity year is determined based on the maturity date of the security or loan 
deferred fixed annuities the maturity year is based on the expected date of policyholder withdrawal  taking into account actual experience  current interest rates and contract terms 
included are group annuity contracts representing billion of general account liabilities as of december   which are generally subject to market value adjustment upon surrender and which may also be subject to surrender charges 
of the total group annuity liabilities  billion were in contracts where the crediting rate is reset quarterly  billion were in contracts that adjust the crediting rate on an annual basis with portions resetting in each calendar quarter and billion were in contracts where the crediting rate is reset annually on january fixed annuity policy reserves of billion relate to funding agreements issued in conjunction with the company s medium term note program where the crediting rate is either fixed for the term of the contract or variable  based on an underlying index 
included in deferred fixed annuities are certain individual annuity contracts  which are also subject to surrender charges calculated as a percentage of the deposits made and assessed at declining rates during the first seven years after a deposit is made 
also included in deferred fixed annuities are million of participating group annuity contracts 
as of december   individual annuity general account liabilities totaling billion were in contracts where the crediting rate is reset periodically  with portions resetting in each calendar quarter and billion that reset annually 
individual fixed annuity policy reserves of billion are in contracts that adjust the crediting rate every five years 
the average crediting rate is calculated as the difference between the projected yield of the assets backing the liabilities and a targeted interest spread 
however  for certain individual annuities the credited rate is also adjusted to partially reflect current new money rates 
immediate annuities included are non life contingent contracts in payout status where the company has guaranteed periodic  typically monthly  payments 
the maturity year is based on the terms of the contracts 
short term debt  long term debt and capital and preferred securities of subsidiary trusts the maturity year is the stated maturity date of the obligation 
while certain obligations are callable  either at a premium or with a make whole provision  the company currently has no plans to call the obligations prior to the stated maturity date 
derivative financial instruments the maturity year is based on the terms of the related contracts 
interest rate swaps include cross currency interest rate swaps that eliminate all foreign currency exposure the company has with existing assets and liabilities 
cross currency interest rate swaps in place against each foreign currency obligation hedge the company against adverse currency movements with respect to both period interest payments and principal repayment 
underlying details by currency have therefore been omitted 
variable swap rates and settlement prices reflect rates and prices in effect as of december

and subsidiaries equity market risk asset fees calculated as a percentage of the separate account assets are a significant source of revenue to the company 
as of december   of separate account assets were invested in equity mutual funds 
gains and losses in the equity markets will result in corresponding increases and decreases in the company s separate account assets and the reported asset fee revenue 
in addition  a decrease in separate account assets may decrease the company s expectations of future profit margins due to a decrease in asset fee revenue and or an increase in gmdb claims  which may require the company to accelerate the amortization of deferred policy acquisition costs 
the company s individual variable annuity contracts offer gmdb features 
the gmdb generally provides a benefit if the annuitant dies and the policyholder contract value is less than a specified amount  which may be based on the premiums paid less amounts withdrawn or a policyholder contract value on a specified anniversary date 
a decline in the stock market causing the policyholder contract value to fall below this specified amount  which varies from contract to contract based on the date the contract was entered into as well as the gmdb feature elected  will increase the net amount at risk  which is the gmdb in excess of the policyholder contract value  which could result in additional gmdb claims 
as of december   the net amount at risk  net of amounts reinsured  was billion
