during we made no dock to dock sales  which historically were not included in net sales due to our accounting policy of recording only the commission on such transactions as a reduction to cost of sales in our consolidated statements of operations 
dock to dock sales represent bulk sales of pharmaceuticals to self warehousing chain pharmacies for which we act only as an intermediary in the order and subsequent delivery of products to the customers warehouses 
the commission on dock to dock sales is typically lower than the gross profit realized on sales of products from inventory 
dock to dock sales were million during gross profit gross profit decreased million to million  or  for  compared to the corresponding period of the prior year

the ratio of operating expenses to net sales for was  a basis point increase from the comparable period of the prior year

as a percentage of net sales  net interest expense increased to from for  compared to the corresponding period of the prior year 
the increase in net interest expense was primarily the result of higher average borrowing levels driven by higher average investment in inventory 
securitization termination costs in march  we entered into a new credit facility that resulted in the termination of the existing accounts receivable securitization agreement 
as a result  a one time charge of million was incurred during the third quarter of these costs were associated with eliminating a million fixed rate component of the accounts receivable securitization program

fiscal year ended june  compared with the fiscal year ended june  net sales net sales increased million to billion  or for compared with the prior year  with growth primarily from independent and regional pharmacies and from national accounts 
sales to independent and regional pharmacies increased million to billion  or  a result of the addition of dhi for a full year with million of net sales with the balance of the increase split relatively evenly between increase in sales to existing customers and the addition of new customers 
national accounts sales increased million to billion  or in  we used proceeds from our equity offering primarily to capitalize on opportunities in this trade class 
sales to other healthcare providers increased million to million  or 
we made replenishment purchases and investment purchases with our largest supplier in  including both forward purchasing and attractively priced purchasing opportunities 
we continue to make replenishment and forward purchases  but do not anticipate any attractively priced purchasing opportunities in the near future  with this supplier 
in addition  we made million in dock to dock sales in that are not included in net sales 
it is our accounting policy to record only the commission on such transactions as a reduction to cost of sales in our consolidated statements of operations 
dock to dock sales represent bulk pharmaceutical sales delivered from manufacturers directly to self warehousing chain pharmacies  we act only as an intermediary 
our commission on dock to dock sales is typically lower than the gross profit we realize on sales of products from inventory 
dock to dock sales were million during gross profit gross profit increased million to million  or for compared with the prior year 
as a percentage of net sales  gross margin increased from to for compared with the prior year 
the slight increase in gross margin percentage  due to the inclusion of pbi  was partially offset by competitive forces and a slightly higher mix of national accounts  which normally have lower gross margins

income tax provision our effective income tax rate was for compared with for these rates differed from statutory blended federal and state rates primarily because the amortization of intangible assets was not deductible for federal and state income tax purposes 
our effective rate was slightly higher than the corresponding period in due to the impact of the sales mix on the blended state income tax rate 
minority interest we began recording minority interest during as a result of our additional investment in pbi in july prior to  we accounted for our investment under the equity method and recorded our portion of the pbi earnings accordingly 
liquidity and capital resources on march   the company entered into a new million credit facility 
the credit facility  an asset based senior secured revolving credit facility  increased our available credit from million to million 
the new single credit facility replaced a million revolving bank line of credit and a million accounts receivable securitization program 
under the credit facility  the total amount of loans and letters of credit outstanding at any time cannot exceed the lesser of an amount based on percentages of eligible receivables and inventories the borrowing base formula 
total credit available at june  was approximately million of which approximately million was unused 
the interest rate on the new credit facility is based on the day london interbank offering rate libor plus a factor based on certain financial criteria 
the interest rate was at june  under the terms of the credit facility  we are required to comply with certain financial covenants  including those related to a fixed charge coverage ratio and tangible net worth 
we are also limited in our ability to make loans and investments  enter into leases  or incur additional debt  among other things  without the consent of its lenders 
we are in compliance with the debt covenants as of june  the new credit facility resulted in the termination of the existing accounts receivable securitization agreement 
as a result  a one time charge of million was incurred during the third fiscal quarter of these costs were associated with eliminating a million fixed rate component of the accounts receivable securitization program that had an interest rate of 
under the provisions of sfas no 
 accounting for transfers and servicing of financial assets and extinguishments of liabilities  as amended by sfas no 
 accounting for transfers and servicing of financial assets and extinguishments of liabilities the accounts receivable sold under the agreement were removed from the consolidated balance sheet 
the amount of undivided interests in accounts receivable sold were million at june  we generally meet our working capital requirements through a combination of internally generated funds  borrowings under the revolving line of credit and trade credit from our suppliers 
we use the following ratios as key indicators of our liquidity and working capital management june  june  working capital s   current ratio to to working capital is total current assets less total current liabilities on our balance sheet 
the current ratio is calculated by dividing total current assets by total current liabilities 
working capital and current ratio at june  are higher than june  levels 
receivables increased as a result of the termination of the securitization program combined with decreases in both inventory and accounts payable that are tied to timing of inventory receipts and related payments 
we invested million in capital assets in compared with million in the expenditures were primarily related to leasehold improvements associated with our new corporate offices 
the expenditures were primarily related to implementing the erp computer system 
this system integrates sales order  inventory  and transportation management  customer service  accounts payable and receivable  general ledger  and financial reporting 
we believe that continuing investment in capital assets is necessary to achieve our goal of improving operational efficiency  thereby enhancing our productivity and profitability 
net cash outflows from financing activities totaled million for with net cash inflows of million in during  repayments under our revolving line of credit related to the decrease in inventory levels combined with our purchase of treasury stock produced this result 
during  proceeds from our secondary stock offering were partially offset by increased repayments under our revolving credit agreement 
stockholders equity increased to million at june  from million at june   due to the net earnings during the period offset by the impact of our purchase of treasury stock during the year 
we believe that funds available under the new credit facility  together with internally generated funds  will be sufficient to meet our capital requirements for the foreseeable future 
inflation we prepare our consolidated financial statements on the basis of historical costs and they do not reflect changes in the relative purchasing power of the dollar 
because we take advantage of purchasing opportunities in anticipation of price increases forward purchasing  we believe that our gross profits generally increase when manufacturers increase the prices of products we distribute 
our gross profits may decline if manufacturers increase prices more slowly 
generally  we pass price increases through to customers  therefore reducing the negative effect of inflation 
during the past three years  we have offset other non inventory cost increases such as payroll  supplies and services by increasing volume and improving productivity 
recent trends sales in the national accounts trade class declined in reflecting the impact of fewer attractively priced purchase opportunities  particularly from one supplier  and the impact of fewer product price increases 
sales in the national accounts trade class have fallen below expectations in the first two months of  as fewer than anticipated product price increases enacted by pharmaceutical manufacturers have resulted in lower activity in this trade class 
changes in manufacturers inventory management practices resulting in reduced availability of product have also impacted revenues in this trade class 
fewer than anticipated product price increases also resulted in lower gross profit margin in the independent and regional pharmacies trade class during the first two months of however  during this period sales trends in the trade class show continued growth  with sales increases of approximately  which partially offsets the effect of lower gross profit margins 
the company believes this sales growth reflects improved regional and independent retail pharmacy industry sales trends in the company s service territory and the impact of new business 
critical accounting policies the methods  estimates and judgments we use in applying the accounting policies most critical to our financial statements have a significant impact on our reported results 
the us securities and exchange commission has defined the most critical accounting policies as the ones that are most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results  and require us to make our most difficult and subjective judgments 
based on this definition  our most critical policies include the following inventory valuation  accounts receivable  valuation of goodwill and other intangible assets accounting for stock options  and our former accounts receivable securitization program 
we also have other key accounting policies including policies for revenue recognition 
we believe that these other policies either do not generally require us to make estimates and judgments that are as difficult or as subjective as the others listed above  or are less likely to have a significant impact on our reported results of operations for a given period
