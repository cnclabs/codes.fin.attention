item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes contained elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
general our products and services are marketed in states to over  customers that are engaged in a variety of industries  many of which may be counter cyclical to each other 
demand for our products generally is subject to changes in the united states economy and economic trends affecting our customers and the industries in which they compete in particular 
certain of these industries  such as the oil and gas industry  are subject to volatility while others  such as the petrochemical industry and the construction industry  are cyclical and materially affected by changes in the economy 
as a result  we may experience changes in demand within particular markets  segments and product categories as changes occur in our customers respective markets 
our growth strategy in the past focused on a combination of acquisitions  such as the acquisition of the electrical contractor segment  and internal growth 
we have curtailed our acquisition efforts and are focusing on internal growth 
key elements of our internal growth strategy include leveraging existing customer relationships  expanding product offerings to new and existing customers  reducing costs through consolidated purchasing programs and centralized product distribution centers  centralizing certain customer service and inside sales functions  reducing costs by converting selected branches from full warehouse and customer service operations to sales centers  designing and implementing innovative solutions to address the procurement and supply needs of our customers and using our traditional distribution and integrated supply capabilities to increase sales in each area 
results will be dependent on our success in executing our internal growth strategy and  to the extent we complete any acquisitions  our ability to integrate such acquisitions

diluted loss earnings per share year ended december  compared to year ended december  sales 
revenues for decreased million  or  to approximately million from million in sales for the mro segment decreased million  or primarily due to slowing of the overall economy 
reduced sales of bearing products accounted for approximately one half of the decline in sales for the mro segment 
sales for the electrical contractor segment decreased by million  or  when compared to this decrease is the result of the sale  during august  of the majority of the assets of a business in san antonio  texas  which accounted for approximately two thirds of the sales of the electrical contractor segment  combined with a slow down in the construction business for electrical contractors 
gross profit 
gross profit as a percentage of sales increased by approximately for  when compared to the increase can be primarily attributed to increased margins for the electrical contractor segment 
gross profit as a percentage of sales for the electrical contractor segment increased to for  up from in this increase resulted from the sale of the business in san antonio  texas which had lower gross profit margins 
gross profit as a percentage of sales for the mro segment increased to for  up from for this increase can be primarily attributed to increased margins in fluid handling products sold by the mro segment 
selling  general and administrative 
selling  general and administrative expense for decreased by approximately million  or  when compared to this decrease is primarily attributable to reduced litigation costs  communication expenses  bad debt expense  payroll and payroll related expenses 
as a percentage of revenue  the selling  general and administrative expense increased by approximately to from for this increase is primarily attributable to non variable costs being spread over a smaller revenue amount 
operating income 
operating income for increased by approximately million  or  when compared to this increase is the net of a million decrease in operating income for the mro segment and a million improvement in operating income for the electrical contractor segment 
the reduced operating income for the mro segment is the result of lower sales and gross profit partially offset by reduced selling  general and administrative expenses 
the improvement for the electrical contractor segment is primarily the result of the sale during august of the business in san antonio  texas  which was not profitable 
interest expense 
interest expense for decreased by million to million from million for this decline results from lower interest rates for when compared to as well as a lower average debt balance 
income taxes 
as of december   we have recorded net deferred tax assets of million representing the future tax benefits of certain accruals not currently deductible 
we believe it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets will be realized as these reserves are recovered and reduce future taxable income 
for information concerning the provision for current and deferred income taxes as well as information regarding differences between the effective tax rates and statutory rates  see note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements

selling  general and administrative 
selling  general and administrative expense for declined million  or  to approximately million from million in as a percentage of revenue  the expense declined to from for this decrease is primarily attributable to reduced compensation related expenses resulting from reduced headcount 
operating income 
excluding the million of non recurring operating charges recorded in the fourth quarter of  operating income for increased million  million for the electrical contractor segment and million for the mro segment  when compared to the same period in this improved operating income for the mro segment is primarily the result of reduced selling  general and administrative expenses 
the operating loss for the electrical contractor segment decreased to million for  from million for  excluding the million of non recurring charges in the reduced operating loss for the electrical contractor segment results from the sale during august of the majority of the assets of a business which was not profitable 
interest expense 
interest expense for decreased by million to million from million for this decline results from lower interest rates as well as a lower average debt balance for when compared to other income 
other income was approximately million lower in than in due primarily to million of gains on the sale of two warehouse facilities during net income 
excluding the non recurring charges and the gains on the sale of two warehouse facilities in  net income increased by approximately million in from a loss of approximately million in liquidity and capital resources general as a distributor of mro products and electrical contractor products  we require significant amounts of working capital to fund inventories and accounts receivable 
additional cash is required for capital items such as information technology and warehouse equipment 
we also require cash to pay our lease obligations and to service our debt 
under the credit facility  all available cash is generally applied to reduce outstanding borrowings  with operations funded through borrowings under the credit facility 
the credit facility consists of three secured lines of credit and a term loan with various of our subsidiaries 
the credit facility provides for borrowings up to an aggregate of the lesser of i a percentage of the collateral value based on a formula set forth therein or ii million  and matures april  interest accrues at prime plus on approximately million of the credit facility  and prime plus on the term portion of the credit facility 
the prime rate at december   was 
the credit facility is secured by receivables  inventory  real estate and machinery and equipment 
the credit facility contains customary affirmative and negative covenants as well as financial covenants that are measured monthly and require that we maintain a certain cash flow and other financial ratios 
from time to time we have not been in compliance with certain covenants under the credit facility  including the monthly minimum earnings requirement and the monthly fixed charge coverage ratio 
at december   we were in compliance with these covenants 
although we expect to be able to comply with the covenants of the credit facility  there can be no assurance that in the future we will be able to do so or that our lender will be willing to waive such non compliance or further amend such covenants 
in addition to the million of cash at december   we had million available for borrowings under the amended credit facility at december  we generated cash in operating activities of approximately million in as compared to million in cash provided during this change between the two years is primarily attributable to accounts receivable decreasing by million in  versus accounts receivable declining by million in we used cash in investing activities of approximately million during as compared to approximately million in cash generated in this decrease is primarily attributed to the sale of certain assets of the electrical contractor segment for million in cash in we had capital expenditures of approximately million for the fiscal year ended december   as compared to million during capital expenditures during were related primarily to computer equipment 
capital expenditures during were primarily related to computer software and computer equipment 
our internal cash flow projections indicate our cash generated from operations and available under our credit facility will meet our normal working capital needs during however  we will require additional debt or equity financing to meet our future debt service obligations  which may include additional bank debt or the public or private sale of equity or debt securities 
in connection with such financing  we may be required to issue securities that substantially dilute the interest of our shareholders 
as described above  all of our credit facility matures on or before april  we will need to extend the maturity of  or replace our credit facility on or before april  however  we may not be able to renew and extend or replace the credit facility 
any extended or replacement facility may have higher interest costs  less borrowing capacity  more restrictive conditions and could involve equity dilution 
our ability to obtain a satisfactory credit facility may depend  in part  upon the level of our asset base for collateral purposes  our future financial performance and our ability to obtain additional equity 
we would require additional capital to fund any future acquisitions 
at this time  we do not plan to grow through acquisitions unless the market price of our common stock rises to levels that will make acquisitions accretive to our earnings or we generate excess cash flow 
we also may pursue additional equity or debt financing to fund future acquisitions  although we may not be able to obtain additional financing on attractive terms 
discussion of critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires us to make estimates and assumptions in determining the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
the significant estimates made by us in the accompanying financial statements relate to reserves for accounts receivable collectibility  inventory valuations and self insured medical claims 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
critical accounting policies are those that are both most important to the portrayal of a company s financial position and results of operations  and require management s subjective or complex judgments 
below is a discussion of what we believe are our critical accounting policies 
also  see note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition we recognize revenues when an agreement is in place  price is fixed  title for product passes to the customer or services have been provided  and collectibility is reasonably assured 
allowance for doubtful accounts provisions to the allowance for doubtful accounts are made monthly and adjustments are made periodically as circumstances warrant based upon the expected collectibility of all such accounts 
inventory inventory consists principally of finished goods and is priced at lower of cost or market  cost being determined using both the first in  first out fifo and the last in  first out lifo method 
reserves are provided against inventory for estimated obsolescence based upon the aging of the inventory and market trends 
income taxes in accordance with sfas  accounting for income taxes  we have recorded a net deferred tax asset of million as of december  we believe it is more likely than not that this net deferred tax asset will be realized based primarily on the assumption of future taxable income 
management periodically re evaluates these estimates as events and circumstances change 
together with the effects of the matters discussed above  these factors may significantly impact the company s results of operations from period to period 
recent accounting pronouncements see note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for discussion of recent accounting pronouncements 
inflation we do not believe the effects of inflation have any material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition 
we attempt to minimize inflationary trends by passing manufacturer price increases on to the customer whenever practicable 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our market risk results from volatility in interest rates 
this risk is monitored and managed 
our exposure to interest rate risk relates primarily to our debt portfolio 
to limit interest rate risk on borrowings  we target a portfolio within certain parameters for fixed and floating rate loans taking into consideration the interest rate environment and our forecasted cash flow 
this policy limits exposure to rising interest rates and allows us to benefit during periods of falling interest rates 
our interest rate exposure is generally limited to our credit facility
