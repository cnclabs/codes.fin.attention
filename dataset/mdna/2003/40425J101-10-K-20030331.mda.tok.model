item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations critical accounting policies revenue recognition 
we principally recognize revenue for our service offerings when third party payors remit payment to the company s customers 
this policy is in effect because our fees are principally contingent upon our customers collections from third parties 
under this revenue recognition policy  our operating results may vary significantly from quarter to quarter due to the timing of such collections by our customers and the fact that a significant portion of our operating expenses are fixed 
accounting for income taxes 
we have generated net operating losses for tax purposes each of the last four years 
these losses generated cumulative federal net operating loss carryforwards of million as of december  in addition  due to our restructuring efforts certain charges written off in the current year are not currently deductible for income tax purposes 
these differences result in gross deferred tax assets 
we must assess the likelihood that the gross deferred tax assets  net of any deferred tax liabilities  will be recovered from future taxable income and to the extent we believe the recovery is not likely  we have established a valuation allowance 
significant management judgment is required in determining this valuation allowance 
we have recorded a valuation allowance of million as of december   due to uncertainties related to our ability to utilize some of our net deferred tax assets  primarily consisting of certain net operating loss carryforwards before they expire 
the valuation allowance is based on our estimate of taxable income and the period over which the net deferred tax assets will be recoverable 
in the event that these estimates differ or we adjust these estimates in future periods we may need to establish an additional valuation allowance which could materially impact our financial position and results of operations 
conversely  if we are profitable in the future at levels which cause management to conclude that it is more likely than not that we will realize all or a portion of the net deferred tax assets  for which a valuation is currently provided  we would record the estimated net realizable value of the net deferred tax asset at that time and would then provide income taxes at a rate equal to our combined federal and state effective rate of approximately 
the net deferred tax asset as of december  was million  net of a valuation allowance of million 
valuation of long lived and intangible assets and goodwill 
goodwill  representing the excess of acquisition costs over the fair value of net assets of acquired businesses  is not amortized but is reviewed for impairment at least annually and written down only in the periods in which it is determined that the recorded value is greater than the fair value 
for the purposes of performing this impairment test  our business segments are our reporting units 
the fair values of those reporting units  to which goodwill has been assigned  is compared with their recorded values 
if recorded values are less than the fair values  no impairment is indicated 
goodwill acquired in business combinations completed before july  had been amortized through december  on a straight line basis over a period of ten to forty years 
long lived assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
factors we consider important which could trigger an impairment review include the following o significant underperformance relative to expected historical or projected future operating results  o significant changes in the manner of our use of the acquired assets or the strategy for our overall business  o significant negative industry or economic trends  o significant decline in our stock price for a sustained period  and o our market capitalization relative to net book value 
we determine the recoverability of the carrying value of our long lived assets based on a projection of the estimated undiscounted future net cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset 
when we determine that the carrying value of long lived assets may not be recoverable  we measure any impairment by comparing the carrying amount of the asset with the fair value of the asset 
for identifiable intangibles we determine fair value based on a projected discounted cash flow method using a discount rate reflective of our cost of funds 
in  statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets became effective and as a result  we ceased to amortize approximately million of goodwill which would have resulted in approximately  of amortization in no impairment loss resulted from the initial goodwill impairment test  or from the annual impairment test that was performed during estimating valuation allowances and accrued liabilities  such as bad debts  and restructuring charges 
the preparation of financial statements requires our management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amount of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reported period 
specifically  management must make estimates of the uncollectability of our accounts receivable 
management specifically analyzes accounts receivable and analyzes historical bad debts  customer concentrations  customer credit worthiness  current economic trends and changes in our customer payment terms when evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts 
the accounts receivable balance was million  net of allowance for doubtful accounts of million as of december management has estimated a certain amount of charges as of december  related to restructuring activities 
we have recorded an estimated liability based on a reasonable assessment of the probable costs to be incurred 
as additional information becomes available in  we may revise the estimates 
such revisions in estimates of the potential restructuring liabilities could materially impact the results of operation and financial position 
discontinued operations 
the accompanying financial statements are prepared using discontinued operations accounting for our discontinued decision support group dsg and payor systems group psg businesses 
under discontinued operations accounting  amounts are accrued for estimates of our expected liabilities related to discontinued operations through their eventual discharge 
the dsg business was sold in december at december   the psg business s remaining liabilities principally consisted of lease termination and related facility costs  and employee severance expenses 
at december   substantially all liabilities have been liquidated and any adjustments related to costs to be incurred during the close down or losses from operations  have been reflected in the estimated gain on disposal of discontinued operations 
in the event that any liabilities should arise from these discontinued operations  there could be a material impact on our financial position and results of operations 
the above listing is not intended to be a comprehensive list of all of our accounting policies 
in many cases  the accounting treatment of a particular transaction is specifically dictated by accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america  with no need for management s judgment in their application 
there are also areas in which the audited consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included in this form k contain accounting policies and other disclosures required by accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
strategic review in late fiscal year we began a strategic examination of our operating businesses and general infrastructure 
during the s our business plan focused on growth through mergers with and purchases of several businesses  such that at the beginning of we were operating two divisions  each containing two business units or groups 
the revenue services division included the provider revenue services group and the payor revenue services group 
the software division included the decision support group and the payor systems group 
we were incurring operating losses and had not achieved operational synergies or effective marketing and selling opportunities across our operating units 
the strategic review was undertaken to implement a focused business plan  divest non strategic assets and reduce infrastructure and overhead costs 
divestitures and monetization of non strategic assets as a fundamental element of the strategic review we completed the following divestitures sale of edi business 
in january we sold our electronic transaction processing edi business  consisting of substantially all the assets of our wholly owned subsidiary  quality medi cal adjudication  incorporated  and certain assets of its wholly owned subsidiary  health receivables management  inc the sale price of million resulted in a pre tax loss of  this business  which operated in the provider revenue services group  was a commodity billing service  and we determined the service was more appropriately purchased from specialized external vendors 
sale of cdr business 
in july we sold our credit balance audit business through the sale of substantially all the assets of our wholly owned subsidiary  cdr associates  inc the sale price of million resulted in pre tax gain of million 
the business was not core to the technology based third party liability processing business of the payor revenue services group  and consequently we sought to monetize this non strategic asset through its sale 
sale of health care microsystems  inc 
in december we sold our wholly owned subsidiary  health care microsystems  inc which operated as our decision support group 
the sale price of million resulted in a pre tax gain of million 
we had originally entered the software business in through our merger with hcm  a company that furnished microcomputer based distributed decision support software systems and consulting services  to healthcare providers and payors 
we determined this business was not critical to our strategy of providing business office outsourcing services 
in  we increased the estimated gain on the disposal of this segment by  reflecting the favorable resolution of certain operating liabilities 
as this business was a separate reportable segment  representing a separate class of customer and major business  its operating results are presented as discontinued operations for all periods presented 
closure of payor systems group psg our payor systems group  which consisted of health information systems corporation and its sole operating subsidiary  health systems architects  inc  furnished various information technology based consulting and other services  and software products to managed care organizations 
in march the psg business received notification from its development partner  canceling their participation in our managed care system development initiative 
as a consequence  we recognized a restructuring charge of million and an asset impairment charge of million associated with the psg business 
later in june the psg business received a cancellation notice from its largest customer 
in light of these events  we determined to proceed with an orderly closure of psg by accelerating a wind down of its remaining operations 
in  we received a million contract termination fee  which was not included in the disposal estimate 
additionally  in  we reduced the estimated loss on disposal of this segment by  based on the actual operating results of psg 
as this business was a separate reportable segment  representing a separate class of customer and major business  its operating results are presented as discontinued operations for all periods presented 
at the end of calendar year  we completed our strategic review and are now organized around two core businesses  accordis and health management systems  with a business plan focused on growing revenues and reaching profitability 
restructuring charges  asset impairments  and other items in addition to the business divestitures and closure discussed above we incurred several other charges in fiscal year resulting from the strategic review of our business operations  infrastructure  and management team 
in particular o in april  we incurred a restructuring charge of  for facility exit costs and employee severance costs associated with the closure of our washington  dc office 
o throughout we incurred million in compensation costs for severance and retention bonuses that were paid during the year  resulting from our divestiture efforts and headcount reduction efforts 
o in december  we incurred a restructuring charge of million consisting of  for severance costs associated with reductions in the information technology and facilities maintenance departments  and million for facility exit costs associated with a plan to reduce the amount of office space we occupy at our headquarters in new york city 
this office space reduction effort culminated in our executing a sublease in january  resulting in an additional restructuring charge of  in december for facility exit costs 
o in december  we recognized a charge of million for the impairment of goodwill resulting from the acquisition of the global business unit 
this impairment charge was based on a recoverability analysis which had been triggered by the significant underperformance of the unit relative to the expected historical results and the current projections of future operating results 
the impairment charge was measured based on the projected discounted future cash flows from the business unit over the remaining fifteen year amortization period of the goodwill using a discount rate reflective of our cost of funds 
years ended december  and the following table sets forth  for the periods indicated  certain items in our consolidated statements of operations expressed as a percentage of revenue revenue cost of services compensation data processing occupancy direct project costs other operating costs restructuring costs impairment of assets amortization of intangibles total cost of services operating loss gain on sale of assets net interest income loss from continuing operations before income taxes income tax expense benefit loss from continuing operations net income loss from discontinued operations net income loss revenue for the year ended december  was million  an increase of million or compared to revenue of million in the prior fiscal year ended december  health management systems  which provides third party liability identification and recovery services to state medicaid agencies  generated revenue of million in  a million or increase over the prior year revenue of million 
this increase primarily reflected million of revenue during the current year from five new state clients  including a contract re award with an expanded scope of services 
in addition  revenue increased by million across the comparable client base reflecting specific non recurring revenue opportunities with certain clients based on their particular needs  differences in the timing of when client projects were completed in the current year compared with the prior year  and changes in the volume  yields and scope of client projects 
these non recurring revenue opportunities are generally situations where we have an opportunity to earn additional revenue from a client which we do not expect will recur in the current year or which did not exist in the prior year 
these increases were partially offset by a million decrease in revenue resulting from the sale of the business of our former cdr associates subsidiary in july accordis  which provides outsourced business office services for hospitals  generated revenue of million in  a million or increase from the prior year revenue of million 
this increase primarily consisted of million of revenue from new customers since the prior year period  and a million increase with three customers resulting from an expansion in the scope of services provided 
in addition  revenue increased by million across the comparable client base reflecting specific non recurring revenue opportunities with certain clients based on their particular needs  differences in the timing of when client projects were completed in the current year compared with the prior year  and changes in the volume and yields of client projects 
these increases were partially offset by a decrease in revenue of million associated with terminated or inactive customer relationships 
operating expenses as a percentage of revenue were in the current year compared to in the prior year and for were million  a decrease of million  or  compared to prior year operating expenses of million 
operating expenses in included a  restructuring charge and  as discussed in more detail below  operating expenses were adversely impacted by several non recurring charges  restructuring costs  asset impairments  write offs and higher service development initiatives 
compensation expense as a percentage of revenue was in the current year compared to in the prior year and for was million  an increase of million  or from the prior year period expense of million 
this increase resulted from an increase in staff  reflective of the growth in revenues and general increases in compensation rates  partially offset by a decrease of million from the sale of the business of our former cdr associates subsidiary in july at december   we had employees  compared to employees at december  data processing expense as a percentage of revenue was in the current fiscal year compared to in the prior fiscal year and for was million  a decrease of million or compared to the prior year expense of million 
the prior year costs included a a charge of million associated with the write off of an internally developed software initiative based on our assessment of the project s future prospects  b a related charge of million for external software commitments which had been integral to the same project but were no longer of value to us  and c a charge of  for two unrelated software assets that were no longer in use 
partially offsetting these decreases was a current year charge of  for the disposal and impairment of hardware and software items resulting from the termination of an unrelated service initiative 
occupancy expense as a percentage of revenue was in the current year compared to in the prior year and for was million  a decrease of  or from the prior year expense of million 
this decrease was principally due to reductions in utilities  services and other expenses generally as a result of prior year reductions in space 
direct project expense as a percentage of revenue was in the current year compared to in the prior year and for was million  an increase of  or from the prior fiscal year expense of million 
this increase reflects an  increase in expense related to accordis  and a  decrease in expense related to health management systems 
the accordis increase was principally due to increased expenses associated with a increase in revenue 
the decrease related to health management systems reflects a  reduction in marketing partner expenses partially offset by increased expenses associated with a increase in revenues 
other operating expenses as a percentage of revenue were in the current year compared to in the prior year and for were million  a decrease of million or compared to the prior year expense of million 
consulting and professional fees including related travel costs decreased by  from million in to million in  principally due to two service development and system enhancement and reconfiguration activities that were terminated in the second quarter of during  we recognized bad debt expense of million related to a receivable due from the district of columbia 
see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
restructuring costs as a percentage of revenue were in the current year compared to in the prior year and in were  a decrease of million from restructuring costs in reflect the net of a total charge of million in december  consisting of million for facility exit costs to vacate one floor at our headquarters in new york city  and  for severance costs associated with reductions in the information technology and facilities maintenance departments  a net charge of  for facility exit costs and employee termination costs associated with the closure of our washington  dc office in march  and in october  a  reduction to the restructuring charge incurred in october associated with a facility consolidation initiative that was subsequently not undertaken 
restructuring costs in reflect an additional  restructuring charge associated with reducing the amount of office space we occupy at our headquarters in new york city based on an executed sublease and an additional  in facility exit costs associated with the closure of our washington  dc office 
in december  we recognized an impairment of assets charge of million for the full impairment of goodwill which arose from our acquisition of global s computerized medical record based processing system business 
the impairment charge was measured based on the projected discounted future cash flows from the business unit over the remaining year amortization period of the goodwill using a discount rate reflective of our cost of funds 
operating loss for the year ended december  was million compared to million for the prior year 
the accordis operating loss was million for the year ended december  compared to an operating loss of million in the prior year 
health management systems had an operating profit of million for the year ended december  compared to an operating loss of million in the prior year 
the decrease in the accordis operating loss largely reflects several non recurring items in including million in data processing charges associated with a specific internal development initiative as discussed above  and the million bad debt charge related to a receivable from the district of columbia 
the return of health management systems to operating profitability largely reflects the increase in revenue discussed above  and the prior year reflecting non recurring charges including a million goodwill impairment charge for the global business and the  restructuring charge associated with closing the washington dc office 
in  we recognized a net gain on sale of assets of million from the sale of the edi business in january and the cdr business in july the sale of the edi business resulted in a loss of  on a sale price of million  the sale of the cdr business resulted in a gain of million on a sale price of million 
in and  we did not recognize any income tax benefit against our losses from continuing operations or the net income losses from discontinued operations  but did recognize in a current income tax expense of  from the gain on sale of hcm 
this absence of an income tax benefit in reflects an increase in our valuation allowance for the recovery of our net deferred income tax assets 
we have incurred significant taxable losses the last several years 
most of our deferred income tax assets are in the form of net operating loss carryforwards 
a recoverability analysis was performed based on our recent taxable loss history and projections of future taxable operating results 
net interest income of  in fiscal year compared with  in the prior year reflects a shift to shorter term investments and a reduction in market interest rates 
loss from continuing operations was million in the current year compared with a loss of million in the prior year 
the million reduction in loss largely reflects the reduction of non recurring charges  restructuring charges  asset impairments and asset write offs during the current fiscal year discussed above 
discontinued operations as more fully discussed in item and note b of the notes to consolidated financial statements  we reported the results of our payor systems group psg and decision support group dsg as discontinued operations for all periods presented 
income from discontinued operations in of million was principally attributable to a million contract termination fee which was not included in the original loss on disposal estimate for psg  a reduction in the estimated loss on disposal of psg of  based on actual operating results  and  resulting from the favorable resolution of certain operating liabilities 
loss from discontinued operations for fiscal year was million 
the year loss from discontinued operations reflects a restructuring charge of million and an asset impairment charge of million incurred in the psg business during april  upon the loss of its development partner 
the restructuring charge related to the write off of the subject development initiative and related employee terminations and facility exit costs 
the asset impairment charge related to the write off of goodwill and other intangibles resulting from our prior acquisition of the psg business 
we determined to close psg in july  and the estimated loss on disposal of  represents the anticipated loss during the wind down period 
we sold our wholly owned subsidiary  health care microsystems  inc  which had operated as dsg  in december  recognizing a gain  after income tax expense  of million on a sale price of million 
thus  net loss on discontinued operations was million in change in fiscal year end in october  our board of directors approved a change in our fiscal year to december st from october st 
the change was made retroactive to january  as a result of this change  we have presented the transition period of november  to december  all prior fiscal years are presented with an october st year end date 
consequently  in the following discussions of results of operations  we compare the december  results with the prior year october  results 
year ended december  and fiscal year ended october  continuing operations the following table sets forth  for the periods indicated  certain items in our consolidated statements of operations expressed as a percentage of revenue revenue cost of services compensation data processing occupancy direct project costs other operating costs restructuring costs impairment of assets other charges amortization of intangibles total cost of services operating loss gain on sale of assets net interest income loss from continuing operations before income taxes and cumulative effect of change in accounting principle income tax benefit loss from continuing operations before cumulative effect of change in accounting principle net income loss from discontinued operations loss before cumulative effect of change in accounting principle cumulative effect of change in accounting principle  net of tax benefit net loss revenue for the fiscal year ended december  was million  a decrease of million or compared to revenue of million in the prior fiscal year ended october  health management systems  which provides third party liability identification and recovery services to state medicaid agencies  generated revenue of million in  a million or increase over the prior year revenue of million 
this increase reflected million in additional revenue from expanded services for four existing clients  million in new revenue from initiation of services for one new client  and other revenue from expansion of services with several other clients 
these increases were partly offset by a decrease of million resulting from the termination of one client relationship and another million decrease reflecting a reduction in service revenues with another existing client 
the sale of the cdr business had a negligible impact on revenues  as the sold business still functions as a subcontractor to us 
accordis  which outsources accounts receivable management services for hospitals  generated revenue of million in  an million or decrease from the prior year revenue of million 
this decrease consisted of a million reduction resulting from the sale of our edi business at the start of the fiscal year  a million decrease related to the termination of one client relationship  and a million reduction resulting from a non recurring one time revenue opportunity with a client in the prior fiscal year 
operating expenses as a percentage of revenue were in compared to in the prior fiscal year and for were million  an increase of  or less than  compared to prior year operating expenses of million 
on a comparative basis  included a half year of operating expenses for the cdr business that was sold in july  while the prior year included a full year of operating expenses for our edi business that was sold at the beginning of the impact on operating expenses from the sale of the cdr business was substantially offset by increased subcontractor fees  as the sold business still functions as a subcontractor in support of our health management systems business 
the sale of the edi business did result in a reduction of operating expenses  although we incurred an increase in subcontractor fees for services provided by the acquiror of this business  in support of several projects in our accordis business 
as discussed in more detail below  fiscal year operating expenses were adversely impacted by several non recurring charges  restructuring costs  asset impairments  write offs and increased product development initiatives 
compensation expense as a percentage of revenue was in compared to in the prior fiscal year and for was million  a decrease of million  or from the prior year period expense of million 
of this total decrease  million was occasioned by the sale of our edi and cdr businesses 
we experienced additional compensation expense decreases from our headcount reduction efforts and in our employee benefit plans 
these decreases were mitigated by compensation increases of million in non recurring severance and retention bonuses associated with our headcount reduction efforts and an increase in performance bonus grants 
at december   we had employees  compared to employees at october  data processing expense as a percentage of revenue was in compared to in the prior fiscal year and for was million  an increase of million or compared to the prior fiscal year expense of million 
data processing expense in included three non recurring charges 
we incurred a charge of million associated with the write off of internally developed software initiatives  of which million had been additions in these internal software initiatives were abandoned based on our assessment of the projects future prospects 
related to a particular internal development initiative  we also incurred a charge of million for external software commitments which had been integral to the project  but were now no longer of value to us 
lastly  we recognized a charge of  for several other external software purchases that were no longer in use 
these expense increases were offset in part by a  decrease in equipment rental  software license and supply costs reflecting our efforts to reduce infrastructure costs across our information technology operations and a  decrease occasioned by the sale of our edi and cdr businesses 
occupancy expense as a percentage of revenue was in compared to in the prior fiscal year and for was million  a decrease of million or from the prior fiscal year expense of million 
this decrease includes  resulting from the sale of our edi and cdr businesses   for the closure of our washington  dc office  and a net  from a new lease agreement at our headquarters in new york city which removed one floor from the company s prime lease obligation 
additional reductions of approximately  in were primarily related to telephone and utilities costs  generally as a function of reductions in space and headcount 
direct project expense as a percentage of revenue was in compared to in the prior fiscal year and for was million  a decrease of  or from the prior fiscal year expense of million 
this decrease is reflective of a million reduction in expense related to accordis  partially offset by a million increase in expense related to health management systems 
the accordis decrease was a function of the district of columbia client relationship in fiscal year that was substantially serviced through a subcontractor 
we did not have business with the district of columbia in fiscal year in addition  a decrease of  resulted from the sale of our edi business 
these decreases in accordis were partly offset by an increase of  in subcontractor service fees incurred for the types of services previously fulfilled internally by the edi operations which were sold at the beginning of the increase in health management systems direct project expense reflects a million increase for subcontractor service fees incurred for the types of services previously fulfilled internally by our cdr operations sold in july and also reflects the increase in revenues compared to fiscal year other operating expenses as a percentage of revenue was in compared to in the prior fiscal year and for were million  an increase of million or compared to the prior fiscal year expense of million 
during  we recognized bad debt expense of million related to a receivable due from the district of columbia 
see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
expenses in reflect a million increase in consulting and professional service fees mostly associated with system enhancement and product development efforts 
in  we also incurred a charge of  in the form of an advance that was expensed to reflect the termination of a business relationship with a marketing partner  and a charge of  for stock option compensation expense related to a stock option grant to two members of the board of directors 
these cost increases were partly offset by a million expense reduction resulting from the sale of our edi and cdr businesses 
restructuring costs as a percentage of revenue were in compared to in the prior fiscal year and in were million 
this charge reflects the net of a total charge of million in december  consisting of million for facility exit costs to vacate one floor at our new york city headquarters  and  for severance costs associated with reductions in the information technology and facilities maintenance departments  a net charge of  for facility exit costs and employee termination costs associated with the closure of our washington  dc office in march  and in october  a  reduction to the restructuring charge incurred in october associated with a facility consolidation initiative that was subsequently not undertaken 
restructuring costs in fiscal year of  represented  in employee termination costs  principally for reductions in our information systems operations department and  for facility exit costs for space consolidation 
in december  we recognized an impairment of assets charge of million for the full impairment of goodwill which arose from our acquisition of global s computerized medical record based processing system business 
the impairment charge was measured based on the projected discounted future cash flows from the business unit over the remaining year amortization period of the goodwill using a discount rate reflective of our cost of funds 
in  we incurred other charges of million related to the separation agreement with our former chief executive officer 
operating loss for the year ended december  was million compared to million for the fiscal year ended october  the accordis operating loss was million for the year ended december  compared to an operating loss of million in the prior year 
health management systems had an operating loss of million for the year ended december  compared to an operating loss of in the prior year 
the increase in the accordis operating loss largely reflects the decrease in revenue discussed above  the total million in data processing charges associated with a specific internal development initiative as discussed above  and the million bad debt charge related to a receivable from the district of columbia 
the decrease in the health management systems operating loss largely reflects the increase in revenue discussed above  almost entirely offset by the million goodwill impairment charge for the global business and the  restructuring charge associated with closing the washington dc office 
in  we recognized a net gain on sale of assets of million from the sale of our edi business in january and our cdr business in july the sale of the edi business resulted in a loss of  on a sale price of million  the sale of the cdr business resulted in a gain of million on a sale price of million 
in  we did not recognize any income tax benefit against our losses from continuing operations or the net losses from discontinued operations  but did recognize a current income tax expense of  from the gain on sale of hcm 
this absence of an income tax benefit reflects an increase in our valuation allowance for the recovery of our net deferred income tax assets 
we have incurred significant taxable losses the last several years 
most of our deferred income tax assets are in the form of net operating loss carryforwards 
the recoverability analysis was performed based on our recent taxable loss history and projections of future taxable operating results 
net interest income of  in fiscal year compared with million in the prior year reflected our generally lower average balances in cash and short term investments during the year 
loss from continuing operations was million in compared with a loss of million in the prior year 
the million increased loss largely reflected the non recurring charges  restructuring charges  asset impairments and asset write offs during discussed above 
discontinued operations as more fully discussed in item and note b of the notes to consolidated financial statements  we reported the results of psg and dsg as discontinued operations for all periods presented 
loss from discontinued operations for was million  compared to income of million in the prior year 
the loss from discontinued operations is reflective of a restructuring charge of million and an asset impairment charge of million incurred in the psg business during april  upon the loss of its development partner 
the restructuring charge related to the write off of the subject development initiative and related employee terminations and facility exit costs 
the asset impairment charge related to the write off of goodwill and other intangibles resulting from our prior acquisition of the psg business 
we determined to close psg in july  and the estimated loss on disposal of  represents the anticipated loss during the wind down period 
we sold our wholly owned subsidiary  hcm  which had operated as dsg  in december  recognizing a gain  after income tax expense  of million on a sale price of million 
thus  net loss on discontinued operations was million in compared to net income of million in the prior year 
cumulative effect of accounting change as previously reported  we implemented a change in accounting with regard to revenue generated from clients seeking reimbursement from third party payors where our fees are contingent upon the client s collections from third parties 
effective at the beginning of fiscal year  we began to recognize revenue pertaining to such clients once the third party payor had remitted payment to its client 
this eliminated our unbilled account receivables and substantially reduced the related deferred tax liabilities 
the cumulative effect of this change in accounting principle as of the beginning of our fiscal year was a charge of million  net of tax benefit 
see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
net loss was million in or per common share compared to a loss of million or per common share in the prior fiscal year 
liquidity and capital resources historically  our principal sources of funds are operations and the remaining proceeds from our initial public offering in at december   our cash and short term investments and net working capital were million and million  respectively 
although we expect that operating cash flows will be a primary source of liquidity  the current significant cash and short term investment balances and working capital position are also fundamental sources of liquidity and capital resource 
the current cash and short term investment balances are more than sufficient to meet our short term funding needs that are not met by operating cash flows 
operating cash flows could be adversely effected by a decrease in demand for our services 
our typical customer relationship  however  usually has a duration of several years  such that we do not expect any current decrease in demand 
we estimate that we will purchase approximately million of property and equipment during  which is consistent with the amounts purchased during recent years 
the payments due by period for our contractual obligations  consisting principally of facility lease obligations and equipment rental and software license obligations  are as follows in thousands less than total one year years years after years we have entered into sublease arrangements for some of our facility obligations and expect to receive the following rental receipts in thousands less than total one year years years after years for the year ended december   cash provided by operations was  compared with cash used by operations of  for the prior year 
during the current year  cash used in investing activities was  reflecting million of property and equipment purchases  which was substantially offset by the maturity of million of short term investments 
cash provided by financing activities was  reflecting  from the exercise of stock options and the issuance of stock under the employee stock purchase plan and  from the partial repayment of a note receivable from an officer  which amounts were partially offset by  used to repurchase our common stock in the open market 
during the current year  cash provided by discontinued operations was million  principally reflecting a termination fee received from a former customer of psg 
on may   the board of directors authorized us to repurchase such number of shares of our common stock that have an aggregate purchase price not in excess of  during  we purchased  shares on the open market at a total cost of  through march   we purchased an additional  shares on the open market at a total cost of  cumulatively since the inception of the repurchase program  we have repurchased  shares having an aggregate purchase price of  inflation historically  inflation has not been a material factor affecting our revenue  and general operating expenses have been subject to normal inflationary pressure 
however  our business is labor intensive 
wages and other employee related expenses increase during periods of inflation and when shortages in the skilled labor market occur 
we also have a performance based bonus plan to foster retention of and incent certain employees 
new accounting pronouncements in june  the financial accounting standards board issued statement no 
 accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities sfas 
sfas supercedes emerging issues task force issue no 
 liability recognition for certain employee termination benefits and other costs to exit and activity including certain costs incurred in a restructuring and required that a liability for the cost associated with an exit or disposal activity be recognized when the liability is incurred  as opposed to the date of an entity s commitment to an exit plan 
the provisions of sfas are effective for exit or disposal activities that are initiated after december  and do not affect amounts currently reported in our consolidated financial statements 
sfas will affect the types and timing of costs included in future restructuring programs  if any

all forward looking statements are inherently uncertain as they are based on various expectations and assumptions concerning future events and they are subject to numerous known and unknown risks and uncertainties which could cause actual events or results to differ materially from those projected 
due to those uncertainties and risks  prospective investors are urged not to place undue reliance on written or oral forward looking statements of the company 
we undertake no obligation to update or revise this safe harbor compliance statement for forward looking statements to reflect future developments 
in addition  we undertake no obligation to update or revise forward looking statements to reflect changed assumptions  the occurrence of unanticipated events or changes to future operating results over time 
we provide the following risk factor disclosure in connection with our continuing effort to qualify our written and oral forward looking statements for the safe harbor protection of the reform act and any other similar safe harbor provisions 
important factors currently known to management that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in forward looking statements include the following our operating results are subject to significant fluctuations due to variability in the timing of when we recognize contingency fee revenue and other factors 
as a result  you will not be able to rely on our operating results in any particular period as an indication of our future performance our revenue and consequently our operating results may vary significantly from period to period as a result of a number of factors  including the loss of customers due to consolidation in the healthcare industry  fluctuations in sales activity given our sales cycle of approximately three to eighteen months  and general economic conditions as they affect healthcare providers and payors 
further  we have experienced fluctuations in our revenue of up to between reporting periods due to the timing of periodic revenue enhancement projects and the timing and delays in third party payors adjudication of claims and ultimate payment to our clients where our fees are contingent upon such collections 
the extent to which future revenue fluctuations could occur due to these factors is not known and cannot be predicted 
as a result  our results of operations are subject to significant fluctuations and our results of operations for any particular quarter or fiscal year may not be indicative of results of operations for future periods 
a significant portion of our operating expenses are fixed  and are based primarily on revenue and sales forecasts 
any inability on our part to reduce spending or to compensate for any failure to meet sales forecasts or receive anticipated revenues could magnify the adverse impact of such events on our operating results 
we are subject to claims if our service offerings contain errors or experience failures or do not meet customer expectations and could lose customers and revenue the healthcare claiming environment is complex 
on behalf of our clients  our accordis buiness processes a very high volume of transactions in this environment 
from time to time we have been subject to claims by clients and could be subject to claims by clients in the future for errors in our service offerings  primarily for failures to secure reimbursement amounts otherwise payable to our clients 
we have often resolved such claims by providing additional services to the client or by reducing fees on additional projects 
there can be no assurance that contractual limitations of our responsibility for damages will be effective in these situations or that clients will not seek significant damages for errors in our services 
further  these performance failures could result in a loss of customers and resulting loss of revenue 
in addition  service performance failures could result in a delay in market acceptance for our services  diversion of development resources  damage to our reputation or increased service costs 
we are currently discussing with an accordis client a claim for damages based on the client s assertion that it has been significantly financially harmed by errors in our service 
we are currently assessing the claim both internally and with the client and believe that it is likely that the claim will be settled in a manner that will not adversely affect our financial position  results of operations  or ongoing relationship with the client 
however  there can be no assurances that the claim will be settled or that the client will not seek to hold us responsible for a substantial amount of alleged damages 
the majority of our contracts with customers may be terminated for convenience the majority of our contracts with customers are terminable upon short notice for the convenience of either party 
although to date none of our material contracts have ever been terminated under these provisions  we cannot assure you that a material contract will not be terminated for convenience in the future 
any termination of a material contract  if not replaced  could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we face significant competition for our services competition for our services is intense and is expected to increase 
increased competition could result in reductions in our prices  gross margins and market share 
we compete with other providers of healthcare information management and data processing services  as well as healthcare consulting firms 
some competitors have formed business alliances with other competitors that may affect our ability to work with some potential customers 
in addition  if some of our competitors merge  a stronger competitor may emerge 
current and prospective customers also evaluate our capabilities against the merits of their existing information management and data processing systems and expertise 
major information management systems companies  including those specializing in the healthcare industry  that do not presently offer competing services may enter our markets 
many of our competitors and potential competitors have significantly greater financial  technical  product development  marketing and other resources  and market recognition than we have 
as a result  our competitors may be able to respond more quickly to new or emerging technologies  changes in customer requirements and changes in the political  economic or regulatory environment in the healthcare industry 
in addition  several of our competitors may be in a position to devote greater resources to the development  promotion  and sale of their services than us 
simplification of the healthcare transfer payment process could reduce the need for our services the complexity of the healthcare transfer payment process  and our experience in offering services that improve the ability of our customers to recover incremental revenue through that process  have been contributing factors to the success our service offerings 
complexities of the healthcare transfer payment process include multiple payors  the coordination and utilization of clinical  operational  financial and or administrative review instituted by third party payors in an effort to control costs and manage care 
if the payment processes associated with the healthcare industry are simplified  the need for our services  or the price customers are willing to pay for our services  could be reduced 
we are subject to government regulation in our collections services the collection industry in the united states is regulated both at the federal and state level 
in addition to specific regulation regarding debts for healthcare services and among other collection regulations the federal fair debt collection practices act ffdcpa regulates any person who regularly collects or attempts to collect  directly or indirectly consumer debts owed or asserted to be owed to another person 
the ffdcpa establishes specific guidelines and procedures that debt collectors must follow in communicating with consumer debtors  including the time  place and manner of such communications and places restrictions on communications with individuals other than consumer debtors in connection with the collection of any consumer debt 
additionally  the ffdcpa contains various notice and disclosure requirements and prohibits unfair or misleading representations by debt collectors 
many states require that we be licensed at a debt collection company and we believe that we currently hold applicable licenses from all states where required 
if we fail to comply with applicable laws and regulations  it could result in the suspension or termination of our ability to conduct collections  which would have a material adverse effect on us 
changes in the united states healthcare environment could have a material negative impact on our revenue and net income the healthcare industry in the united states is subject to changing political  economic and regulatory influences that may affect the procurement practices and operations of healthcare organizations 
our services are designed to function within the structure of the healthcare financing and reimbursement system currently being used in the united states 
during the past several years  the healthcare industry has been subject to increasing levels of governmental regulation of  among other things  reimbursement rates  certain capital expenditures  and data confidentiality and privacy 
from time to time  certain proposals to reform the healthcare system have been considered by congress 
these proposals  if enacted  may increase government involvement in healthcare  lower reimbursement rates and otherwise change the operating environment for our clients 
healthcare organizations may react to these proposals and the uncertainty surrounding such proposals by curtailing or deferring their retention of service providers such as us 
see also item business healthcare reform and regulatory matters for additional discussion on this topic 
we cannot predict what impact  if any  such proposals or healthcare reforms might have on our results of operations  financial condition or business 
our business is subject to extensive and complex governmental regulations and violations of any of those regulations could result in significant penalties most of the services offered by our accordis business involve the billing and collection of healthcare claims 
these services require the interpretation and application of sometimes ambiguous reimbursement regulations under various government entitlement programs such as medicaid and medicare 
in addition  during the past several years  federal and state governments have placed an increased emphasis on detecting and eliminating fraud and abuse in medicare  medicaid  and other health care programs 
violation of health care billing laws or regulations governing our services could result in the imposition of substantial civil or criminal penalties  including temporary or permanent exclusion from participation in government health care programs such as medicare and medicaid  and loss of customers 
the interpretation and application of the healthcare reimbursement rules to particular customer patient accounting environments involves judgment 
if a regulatory agency were to disagree with certain judgments we have made or will make in providing healthcare billing services to a customer we could be subject to penalties  or fines or other sanctions by regulators 
in addition we could find it necessary to alter or eliminate some of our services 
certain provisions in our certificate of incorporation could discourage unsolicited takeover attempts  which could depress the market price of our common stock our certificate of incorporation authorizes the issuance of up to  shares of blank check preferred stock with such designations  rights and preferences as may be determined by our board of directors 
accordingly  our board of directors is empowered  without shareholder approval  to issue preferred stock with dividend  liquidation  conversion  voting or other rights  which could adversely affect the voting power or  other rights of holders of our common stock 
in the event of issuance  preferred stock could be utilized  under certain circumstances  as a method of discouraging  delaying or preventing a change in control 
although we have no present intention to issue any shares of preferred stock  we cannot assure you that we will not do so in the future 
in addition  our by laws provide for a classified board of directors  which could also have the effect of discouraging a change of control 
adverse resolution of pending litigation may cause us to incur a significant loss we are party to a pending legal proceeding as described under item business legal proceedings in which the plaintiffs are seeking damages in the amount of million  plus interest 
although we believe that we have meritorious defenses to the claims of liability or for damages in this action against us  we cannot assure you that an outcome favorable to us will be reached in this litigation or that additional lawsuits will not be filed against us 
further  we cannot assure you that this lawsuit will not have a disruptive effect upon the operations of our business  that the defense of the lawsuit will not consume the time and attention of our senior management  or that the resolution of the lawsuit or future lawsuits will not have a material adverse effect upon our results of operations  financial position and cash flow 
adverse resolution of ongoing investigation by the united states attorney s office will cause adverse impact on revenue and expense levels over the near  and an adverse resolution could cause a material adverse effect on our business thereafter on january   we announced that we had received a subpoena issued under the health insurance portability and accountability act of from the united states attorney s office for the southern district of new york in connection with an investigation relating to possible federal health care offenses 
the subpoena seeks the production of certain documents from january to present relating to medical reimbursement claims submitted by us to medicare  medicaid and other federal healthcare programs  particularly on behalf of a significant client of accordis 
at this point in the investigation  the united states attorney s office has not filed any complaint asserting any violations of law 
we are cooperating fully with the investigation and are in the process of assembling and producing the documents called for by the subpoena 
our board of directors has appointed a special committee to oversee our response to the investigation 
we are not able to give any assurances as to the duration or outcome of the investigation or as to the effect that any proceedings that may be brought by the government may have on our financial condition or results of operations 
the initiation of proceedings against us  even if we are ultimately successful in defending ourself  could have a material adverse effect on our business 
over the near term  we anticipate that revenue and expense levels will be adversely affected as management undertakes to comply with the demands of data gathering and review of the matters covered by the subpoena
