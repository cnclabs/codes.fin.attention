item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion of our consolidated results of operations and cash flows for the years ended december   and and consolidated financial condition as of december  and should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the related notes included elsewhere in this document 
overview we generate revenue from sales of national and local advertising time on television and radio stations and advertising on our billboards and in our publication 
advertising rates are  in large part  based on each media s ability to attract audiences in demographic groups targeted by advertisers 
we recognize advertising revenue when commercials are broadcast and outdoor advertising services and publishing services are provided 
we do not obtain long term commitments from our advertisers and  consequently  they may cancel  reduce or postpone orders without penalties 
we pay commission expense to agencies on local  regional and national advertising 
our revenue reflects deductions from gross revenue for commissions to these agencies 
univision currently owns approximately of our common stock 
we operate in four reportable segments television broadcasting  radio broadcasting  outdoor advertising and newspaper publishing 
as of the date of filing this report  we own and or operate primary television stations that are located primarily in the southwestern united states 
we own and or operate radio stations fm and am located primarily in arizona  california  colorado  florida  illinois  nevada  new mexico and texas 
our outdoor advertising segment consists of approximately  advertising faces located primarily in los angeles and new york 
our newspaper publishing operation consists of the newspaper el diario la prensa in new york 
the comparability of our results between  and is significantly affected by businesses we acquired in those years 
our net revenue for the year ended december   was million 
of that amount  revenue generated by our television segment accounted for  revenue generated by our radio segment accounted for  revenue generated by our outdoor segment accounted for  and revenue generated by our publishing segment accounted for 
several factors may adversely affect our performance in any given period 
seasonal revenue fluctuations are common in the broadcasting and outdoor advertising industries and are due primarily to variations in advertising expenditures by both local and national advertisers 
our business is also affected by general trends in the national economic environment  as well as economic changes in the local or regional markets in which we operate 
the effects of the economic downturn could continue to affect adversely our advertising revenues  causing our operating income to be reduced 
our primary expenses are employee compensation  including commissions paid to our sales staffs and our national representative firms  marketing  promotion and selling  technical  local programming  engineering and general and administrative 
our local programming costs for television consist of costs related to producing local newscasts in most of our markets 
as a result of the acquisitions we consummated in recent years  approximately of our total assets and of our net assets are intangible 
we periodically review our long lived assets  including intangible assets and goodwill related to those acquisitions to determine potential impairment 
to date  we have determined that no impairment of long lived assets or goodwill exists 
in making this determination  the assumptions about future cash flows on the assets under evaluation are critical 
some stations under evaluation have had limited relevant cash flow history due to planned conversion of format or upgrade of station signal 
the assumptions about increasing cash flows after conversion reflect management s estimates of how these stations are expected to perform based on similar stations and markets and possible proceeds from the sale of the assets 
if these expected increases or sale proceeds are not realized  impairment losses may be recorded in the future 
please see notes and to notes to consolidated financial statements regarding the effects of our adoption of sfas no 
during  we acquired four television stations one in each of el paso  texas  corpus christi  texas  san angelo  texas and salinas monterey  california for an aggregate purchase price of approximately million 
additionally  we acquired four radio stations one in each of denver  colorado  aspen  colorado  dallas  texas and las vegas  nevada for an aggregate purchase price of approximately million 
we evaluated the transferred set of activities  assets  inputs and processes in each of these acquisitions and determined that the items excluded were significant and that each of these acquisitions was not considered a business 
on october   we exchanged the assets of our television station keat lp in amarillo  texas for the assets of univision s station wuth ca in hartford  connecticut 

table of contents on december   we entered into an asset purchase agreement with big city radio to acquire three radio stations in los angeles  california for million and  shares of our class a common stock

segment operating profit loss is defined as operating profit loss before corporate expenses and non cash stock based compensation 
we evaluate the performance of our operating segments based on the following years ended december  change to change to in thousands net revenue television radio outdoor publishing consolidated direct expenses television radio outdoor publishing consolidated selling  general and administrative expenses television radio outdoor publishing consolidated depreciation and amortization television radio outdoor publishing consolidated segment operating profit loss television radio outdoor publishing consolidated corporate expenses non cash stock based compensation operating profit loss broadcast cash flow television radio outdoor publishing consolidated ebitda as adjusted total assets television radio outdoor publishing consolidated 
table of contents years ended december  in thousands capital expenditures television radio outdoor publishing consolidated percentage not meaningful broadcast cash flow means operating income loss before corporate expenses  depreciation and amortization and non cash stock based compensation 
ebitda as adjusted means broadcast cash flow less corporate expenses 
we use the term ebitda as adjusted because that measure does not include non cash stock based compensation 
we evaluate and project the liquidity and cash flows of our business using several measures  including broadcast cash flow and ebitda as adjusted 
we consider these measures as important indicators of liquidity relating to our operations  as they eliminate the effects of non cash depreciation and amortization and non cash stock based compensation awards 
we use these measures to evaluate liquidity and cash flows improvement from year to year as they eliminate non cash expense items 
we that believe our investors should use these measures because they may provide a better comparability of our liquidity to that of our competitors 
our calculation of ebitda as adjusted included herein is substantially similar to the measures used in the financial covenants included in our bank credit facility and in the indenture governing our senior subordinated notes 
in those instruments  ebitda as adjusted is referred to as operating cash flow and consolidated cash flow  respectively 
under our bank credit facility  we cannot incur additional indebtedness if the incurrence of such indebtedness would result in our ratio of total debt to operating cash flow having exceeded to on a pro forma basis for the prior full four quarters 
under the indenture  the corresponding ratio of total indebtedness to consolidated cash flow cannot exceed to on the same basis 
the actual ratios of total indebtedness to each of operating cash flow and consolidated cash flow were as follows in each case for the year ended december  to   to   to   to  and  to we entered into the bank credit facility in september and issued our senior subordinated notes in march  so we were not subject to the same calculations and covenants in prior years 
for consistency of presentation  however  the foregoing historical ratios assume that our current definitions had been applied for all periods 
while we and many in the financial community consider broadcast cash flow and ebitda as adjusted to be important  they should be considered in addition to  but not as a substitute for or superior to  other measures of liquidity and financial performance prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america  such as cash flows from operating activities  operating income and net income 
in addition  our definitions of broadcast cash flow and ebitda as adjusted differ from those of many companies reporting similarly named measures 
year ended december  compared to year ended december  consolidated operations net revenue 
net revenue increased to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december   an increase of million 
of that increase  million was attributable to a increase in net revenue from the television and radio stations that we owned and or operated during both of the years ended december  and the increase from those same stations was attributable to increased advertising sold referred to as inventory in our industry and increased rates for that inventory 
the overall increase in net revenue was also partially attributable to our acquisitions  a full year of operations of our acquisitions and our telefutura affiliates  which together accounted for million of the overall increase  and increased publishing revenue  which accounted for million of the overall increase 
the overall increase was partially offset by a reduction of million as a result of reduced outdoor net revenue 
the overall increase was also partially offset by million of net revenue in from radio stations that we owned for part of but had sold by the end of we currently anticipate that a full year of operations from our acquisitions and the revenues generated from any acquisitions will contribute to an overall increase in our net revenue for we also currently anticipate that overall ratings for our television and radio stations will continue to increase in future periods 
together with the continued rise in the number of advertisers purchasing spanish language advertising  we believe that these ratings increases will result in greater demand for our inventory 
we expect that this increased demand will  in turn  allow us to increase our rates  resulting in continued increases in net revenue in future periods 
these anticipated increases in net revenue could  however  be offset by the effects of any terrorist attack or significant us military action abroad  as the advertising industry historically has experienced a measurable drop in sales under such circumstances 

table of contents direct operating expenses 
direct operating expenses increased to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december   an increase of million 
of that increase  million was attributable to a increase in direct operating expenses from the television and radio stations that we owned and or operated during both of the years ended december  and the increase from those same stations was primarily attributable to increases in the cost of ratings services and commissions and national representation fees associated with the increase in net revenue for those stations 
the overall increase in direct operating expenses was also partially attributable to our acquisitions  a full year of operations of our acquisitions and our telefutura affiliates  which together accounted for million of the overall increase  and increased publishing direct operating expenses  which accounted for million of the overall increase 
the overall increase was partially offset by million of direct operating expenses in from radio stations that we owned for part of but had sold by the end of the overall increase was also partially offset by a reduction of million resulting from reduced outdoor direct operating expenses 
as a percentage of net revenue  direct operating expenses remained unchanged at for each of the years ended december  and we currently anticipate that  as our net revenue increases in future periods  our direct operating expenses correspondingly will continue to increase 
however  we expect that net revenue increases will outpace direct operating expense increases such that direct operating expenses as a percentage of net revenue will decrease in future periods 
selling  general and administrative expenses 
selling  general  and administrative expenses increased to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december   an increase of million 
the increase was partially attributable to the settlement of a contract dispute with our former radio national representation firm  interep national radio sales  inc  which accounted for million of the increase 
the increase was also partially attributable to an increase in selling  general and administrative expenses  excluding the interep settlement  from the television and radio stations that we owned and or operated during both of the years ended december  and the increase of million from those same stations was primarily attributable to increased insurance costs  increased marketing and promotion costs and higher sales bonuses associated with the increase in net revenue for those stations 
the overall increase in selling  general and administrative expenses was also partially attributable to our acquisitions  a full year of operations of our acquisitions and our telefutura affiliates  which together accounted for million of the overall increase and increased publishing expenses  which accounted for million of the overall increase 
the overall increase was partially offset by million of selling  general and administrative expenses in from stations that we owned for part of but had sold by the end of as a percentage of net revenue  selling  general and administrative expenses were for the year ended december  and for the year ended december  selling  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net revenue increased due to the additional cost of the interep settlement 
excluding the interep settlement  selling  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net revenue remained unchanged at for each of the years ended december  and on a same station basis  excluding the interep settlement  selling  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net revenue decreased to for the year ended december  from for the year ended december  although we currently anticipate that selling  general and administrative expenses will increase in future periods  we expect that net revenue increases will outpace selling  general and administrative expense increases such that selling  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net revenue will decrease in future periods 
corporate expenses 
corporate expenses increased to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december   an increase of million 
the increase was primarily attributable to increased legal costs associated with the third party information request that we received in connection with the proposed merger between univision and hispanic broadcasting corporation 
the increase was also attributable to increased insurance costs and bonuses associated with the increase in ebitda as adjusted 
as a percentage of net revenue  corporate expenses remained unchanged at for each of the years ended december  and we currently anticipate that corporate expenses will increase in future periods  primarily due to increased insurance costs 
nevertheless  we expect that these increases will be outpaced by net revenue increases such that corporate expenses as a percentage of net revenue will decrease in future periods 
depreciation and amortization 
depreciation and amortization decreased to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december   a decrease of million 
this decrease was primarily due to the adoption of sfas no 
 which resulted in a decrease of million of amortization expense 
we had initially classified our univision television network affiliation agreement as an indefinite life intangible asset under sfas no 
this agreement has an initial term of years and expires in the agreement includes multiple  successive renewal options  and we currently expect the agreement to be renewed indefinitely 
however  upon further review of sfas no 
 we reevaluated our initial classification and determined that the univision network affiliation agreement does not meet the 
table of contents strict requirements for classification as an indefinite life intangible asset because we do not have the unilateral right to renew the agreement indefinitely 
we have revised the classification and will amortize this intangible asset over the remaining term of the agreement  retroactive to january   the date on which we adopted sfas no 
please see notes and to notes to consolidated financial statements 
non cash stock based compensation 
non cash stock based compensation decreased to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december   a decrease of million 
non cash stock based compensation consists primarily of compensation expense relating to restricted and unrestricted stock awards granted to our employees during the second quarter of operating income loss 
as a result of the above factors  we had operating income of million for the year ended december   compared to an operating loss of million for the year ended december  the change to operating income was primarily due to the decrease in amortization expenses as a result of adopting sfas no 
interest expense  net 
interest expense increased to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december   an increase of million 
the increase was primarily due to the higher rate of interest on our senior subordinated notes as compared to the rate of interest on borrowings under our bank credit facility 
the increase was also attributable to increased borrowings and higher interest income in the prior year 
income tax benefit 
our expected tax rate is approximately of pre tax income or loss  adjusted for permanent tax differences 
for the years ended december  and  the tax benefit was less than the expected of the pre tax loss because of the non deductible portion of certain items  including non cash stock based compensation for financial statement purposes that will not be deductible for tax purposes  state taxes  foreign taxes  the expected disallowance of state net operating loss carryforward amounts and meals and entertainment 
we currently have approximately million in net operating loss carryforwards expiring through that we expect will be utilized prior to their expiration 
net income loss 
net loss decreased to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december   a decrease of million 
this decrease was primarily the result of the reduction of amortization expense in the amount of million due to the adoption of sfas no

as a percentage of net revenue  ebitda as adjusted increased to for the year ended december  from for the year ended december  we currently anticipate that ebitda as adjusted will continue to increase in future periods  both in absolute dollars and as a percentage of net revenue  as we believe that net revenue increases will outpace the increases in direct operating  selling  general and administrative and corporate expenses 
broadcast cash flow means operating income loss before corporate expenses  depreciation and amortization and non cash stock based compensation 
ebitda as adjusted means broadcast cash flow less corporate expenses 
we use the term ebitda as adjusted because that measure does not include non cash stock based compensation 
we evaluate and project the liquidity and cash flows of our business using several measures  including broadcast cash flow and ebitda as adjusted 
we consider these measures as important indicators of liquidity relating to our operations  as they eliminate the effects of non cash depreciation and 
table of contents amortization and non cash stock based compensation awards 
we use these measures to evaluate liquidity and cash flows improvement from year to year as they eliminate non cash expense items 
we believe that our investors should use these measures because they may provide a better comparability of our liquidity to that of our competitors 
our calculation of ebitda as adjusted included herein is substantially similar to the measures used in the financial covenants included in our bank credit facility and in the indenture governing our senior subordinated notes 
in those instruments  ebitda as adjusted is referred to as operating cash flow and consolidated cash flow  respectively 
under our bank credit facility  we cannot incur additional indebtedness if the incurrence of such indebtedness would result in our ratio of total debt to operating cash flow having exceeded to on a pro forma basis for the prior full four quarters 
under the indenture  the corresponding ratio of total indebtedness to consolidated cash flow cannot exceed to on the same basis 
the actual ratios of total indebtedness to each of operating cash flow and consolidated cash flow were as follows in each case for the year ended december  to   to   to   to  and  to we entered into the bank credit facility in september and issued our senior subordinated notes in march  so we were not subject to the same calculations and covenants in prior years 
for consistency of presentation  however  the foregoing historical ratios assume that our current definitions had been applied for all periods 
while we and many in the financial community consider broadcast cash flow and ebitda as adjusted to be important  they should be considered in addition to  but not as a substitute for or superior to  other measures of liquidity and financial performance prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america  such as cash flows from operating activities  operating income and net income 
in addition  our definitions of broadcast cash flow and ebitda as adjusted differ from those of many companies reporting similarly named measures 
cash flow net cash flow provided by operating activities increased to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  net cash flow provided by operating activities increased to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  net cash flow used in investing activities increased to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  during the year ended december   we acquired media properties for a total of million  consisting primarily of radio station kxpk fm in denver  colorado for million  radio station ktcy fm in dallas  texas for million  television station ktfn tv in el paso  texas for million and radio station krrn fm in las vegas  nevada for million 
we made a deposit of million for radio stations kssc fm  kssd fm and ksse fm in los angeles  california and made net capital expenditures of million 
net cash flow from financing activities increased to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  during the year ended december   we received net proceeds from the sale of our senior subordinated notes of million 
we used a portion of those proceeds to repay all of our indebtedness under our bank credit facility in the amount of million 
we also made payments on other long term liabilities in the amount of million 
additionally  we borrowed million under our bank credit facility for acquisitions and received net proceeds of million from the exercise of stock options issued under our omnibus equity incentive plan and from the sale of shares issued under the employee stock purchase plan  or the purchase plan 

table of contents during  we anticipate that our maintenance capital expenditures will be approximately million  and our digital television capital expenditures will be approximately million 
we anticipate paying for these capital expenditures out of net cash flow from operations 
as part of the transition from analog to digital television  full service television station owners may be required to stop broadcasting analog signals and relinquish their analog channels to the fcc by if the market penetration of digital television receivers reaches certain levels by that time 
we currently expect that the cost to complete construction of digital television facilities for our full service television stations between and will be approximately million  with the majority of those costs to be incurred in and in addition  we will be required to broadcast both digital and analog signals through this transition period  but we do not expect those incremental costs to be significant 
we intend to finance the conversion to digital television out of cash flow from operations 
the amount of our anticipated capital expenditures may change based on future changes in business plans  our financial condition and general economic conditions 
we continually review  and are currently reviewing  opportunities to acquire additional television and radio stations  as well as other opportunities targeting the hispanic market in the united states 
we expect to finance any future acquisitions through funds generated from operations  borrowings under our bank credit facility and additional debt and equity financing 
any additional financing  if needed  might not be available to us on reasonable terms or at all 
any failure to raise capital when needed could seriously harm our business and our acquisition strategy 
if additional funds are raised through the issuance of equity securities  the percentage of ownership of our existing stockholders will be reduced

the series a mandatorily redeemable convertible preferred stock is convertible into class a common stock at the option of the holder at anytime 
if  however  the holders elect not to convert and we are required to pay the redemption price in  we anticipate that we would finance such payment with borrowings under our bank credit facility or the proceeds of any debt or equity offering

application of critical accounting policies critical accounting policies are defined as those that are the most important to the accurate portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations 
critical accounting policies require management s subjective judgment and may produce materially different results under different assumptions and conditions 
we have discussed the development and selection of these critical accounting policies with the audit committee of our board of directors  and the audit committee has reviewed and approved our related disclosure in this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
the following are our critical accounting policies goodwill and other intangible assets effective january  we adopted the provisions of sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  and determined each of our operating segments to be a reporting unit 
upon adoption  we assigned all of our assets and liabilities to our reporting units and ceased amortizing goodwill and our indefinite life intangible assets 
we believe that our broadcast licenses and long term time brokerage agreements are indefinite life intangible assets 
see notes and to our consolidated financial statements regarding our adoption of sfas no 
we believe that the accounting estimates related to the fair value of our reporting units and indefinite life intangible assets and our estimates of the useful lives of our long lived assets are critical accounting estimates because goodwill and other intangible assets are our most significant assets  amortization expense is a significant component of our operating expenses  and the impact that recognizing an impairment would have on the assets reported on our balance sheet  as well as on our net loss  could be material 
accordingly  the assumptions about future cash flows on the assets under evaluation are critical 
beginning january   goodwill and indefinite life intangible assets are tested annually for impairment or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the assets might be impaired 
in assessing the recoverability of goodwill and indefinite life intangible assets  we must make assumptions about the estimated future cash flows and other factors to determine the fair value of these assets 
assumptions about future revenue and cash flows require significant judgment because of the current state of the economy and the fluctuation of actual revenue and the timing of expenses 
we develop future revenue estimates based on projected ratings increases  planned timing of signal strength upgrades  planned timing of promotional events  customer commitments and available advertising time 
estimates of future cash flows assume that expenses will grow at rates consistent with historical rates 
alternatively  some stations under evaluation have had limited relevant cash flow history due to planned conversion of format or upgrade of station signal 
the assumptions about cash flows after conversion reflect estimates of how these stations are expected to perform based on similar stations and markets and possible proceeds from the sale of the assets 
if the expected cash flows are not realized  impairment losses may be recorded in the future 

table of contents for goodwill  the impairment evaluation includes a comparison of the carrying value of the reporting unit  including goodwill to that reporting unit s fair value 
if the reporting unit s estimated fair value exceeds the reporting unit s carrying value  no impairment of goodwill exists 
if the fair value of the reporting unit does not exceed the unit s carrying value  then an additional analysis is performed to allocate the fair value of the reporting unit to all of the assets and liabilities of that unit as if that unit had been acquired in a business combination and the fair value of the unit was the purchase price 
if the excess of the fair value of the reporting unit over the fair value of the identifiable assets and liabilities is less than the carrying value of the unit s goodwill  an impairment charge is recorded for the difference 
similarly  the impairment evaluation for indefinite life intangible assets includes a comparison of the asset s carrying value to the asset s fair value 
when the carrying value exceeds fair value an impairment charge is recorded for the amount of the difference 
an intangible asset is determined to have an indefinite useful life when there are no legal  regulatory  contractual  competitive  economic  or any other factors that may limit the period over which the asset is expected to contribute directly or indirectly to the future cash flows of the company 
in addition  each reporting period  we evaluate the remaining useful life of an intangible asset that is not being amortized to determine whether events and circumstances continue to support an indefinite useful life 
if an intangible asset that is not being amortized is determined to have a finite useful life  the asset will be amortized prospectively over the estimated remaining useful life and accounted for in the same manner as intangible assets subject to amortization 
long lived assets  including intangibles subject to amortization depreciation and amortization of our long lived assets is provided using accelerated and straight line methods over their estimated useful lives 
changes in circumstances such as the passage of new laws or changes in regulations  technological advances  changes to the company s business model or changes in the capital strategy could result in the actual useful lives differing from initial estimates 
in those cases where the company determines that the useful life of a long lived asset should be revised  the company will depreciate the net book value in excess of the estimated residual value over its revised remaining useful life 
factors such as changes in the planned use of equipment  customer attrition  contractual amendments or mandated regulatory requirements could result in shortened useful lives 
long lived assets and asset groups are evaluated for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable 
the estimated future cash flows are based upon  among other things  assumptions about expected future operating performance and may differ from actual cash flows 
long lived assets evaluated for impairment are grouped with other assets to the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows of other groups of assets and liabilities 
if the sum of the projected undiscounted cash flows excluding interest is less than the carrying value of the assets  the assets will be written down to the estimated fair value in the period in which the determination is made 
allowance for doubtful accounts we evaluate the collectibility of our trade accounts receivable based on a number of factors 
in circumstances where we are aware of a specific customer s inability to meet its financial obligations to us  a specific reserve for bad debts is estimated and recorded which reduces the recognized receivable to the estimated amount we believe will ultimately be collected 
in addition to specific customer identification of potential bad debts  bad debt charges are recorded based on our recent past loss history and an overall assessment of past due trade accounts receivable amounts outstanding 
deferred taxes deferred taxes are provided on a liability method whereby deferred tax assets are recognized for deductible temporary differences and deferred liabilities are recognized for taxable temporary differences 
temporary differences are the differences between the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and their tax bases 
deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance when it is determined to be more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
in evaluating the need for a valuation allowance  we consider future taxable income  resolution of tax uncertainties and prudent and feasible tax planning strategies 
if we determine that we would not be able to realize all or part of our deferred tax assets in the future  an adjustment to the carrying value of the deferred tax assets would be charged to income in the period in which such determination was made 
revenue recognition television and radio revenue related to the sale of advertising is recognized at the time of broadcast 
network compensation from univision s primary network is recognized ratably over the period of the agreement 
revenue for outdoor advertising space is recognized ratably over the term of the contract  which is typically less than months 
publishing advertising revenue is recognized when advertisements are published and circulation revenue is recognized based on the date of publication  net of provisions for related returns 
stock based compensation as allowed by sfas no 
 we have elected to continue to account for our employee stock based compensation plan using the intrinsic value method in accordance with accounting principles board apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  and related interpretations  which does not require compensation to be recorded if the consideration to be received is at least equal to the fair value of the common stock to be received at the measurement date 
additional information for additional information on our significant accounting policies  please see note to notes to consolidated financial statements 
pending accounting pronouncements 
table of contents in january  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued interpretation no 
 consolidation of variable interest entities fin 
this interpretation clarifies existing accounting principles related to the preparation of consolidated financial statements when the equity investors in an entity do not have the characteristics of a controlling financial interest or when the equity at risk is not sufficient for the entity to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support from others parties 
fin requires a company to evaluate all existing arrangements to identify situations where a company has a variable interest  commonly evidenced by a guarantee arrangement or other commitment to provide financial support  in a variable interest entity  commonly a thinly capitalized entity  and further determine when such variable interests require a company to consolidate the variable interest entities financial statement with its own 
we are required to perform this assessment by september  and consolidate any variable interest entities for which we will absorb a majority of the entities expected losses or receive a majority of the expected residual gains 
we have not yet performed this assessment  however we are not aware of any material variable interest entity we may be required to consolidate 
in june  the fasb issued sfas no 
accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal of activities 
sfas no 
addresses financial accounting and reporting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities 
the provisions of sfas no 
are effective for exit or disposal activities initiated after december  we do not expect the adoption of sfas no 
to have a material effect on our financial position or operating results 
in june  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for asset retirement obligations  which addresses financial accounting and reporting for obligations associated with the retirement of tangible long lived assets and the associated asset retirement costs 
this statement is effective for us beginning january  we do not expect that the adoption of this standard will have a material impact on our financial statements 
impact of inflation we believe that inflation has not had a material impact on our results of operations for each of our fiscal years in the three year period ended december  however  there can be no assurance that future inflation would not have an adverse impact on our operating results and financial condition 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk general market risk represents the potential loss that may impact our financial position  results of operations or cash flows due to adverse changes in the financial markets 
we are exposed to market risk from changes in the base rates on our variable rate debt 
we may enter into derivative financial instrument transactions such as swaps or interest rate caps  in order to manage or reduce our exposure to risk from changes in interest rates 
under no circumstances do we enter into derivatives or other financial instrument transactions for speculative purposes 
our credit facilities require us to maintain an interest rate protection agreement  if we exceed certain leverage ratios  as defined in the agreement 
interest rates our bank term loan bears interest at a variable rate of libor as of december  plus 
as of december   we had million of variable rate bank debt 
as of december   we were not required to hedge any of our outstanding variable rate debt by using an interest rate cap 
based on our overall interest rate exposure on our libor loans as of december  a change of in interest rates would have an impact of approximately million on a pre tax earnings and pre tax cash flows over a one year period
