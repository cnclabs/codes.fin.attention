overview sciquest provides technology  services and domain expertise to optimize procurement and materials management for the life sciences  higher education and industrial research markets 
sciquest solutions enable research intensive organizations to reduce costs  improve the quality and the speed of the process of innovation by helping them find and acquire resources and manage the lifecycle of critical assets 
we were incorporated in november and commenced operations in january during  we focused on developing our business model and the required technology 
we did not begin to recognize any revenues until we launched our public e commerce marketplace in beginning with our acquisition of emax solution partners  inc emax in  we have offered software products to the scientific products industry 
in  we discontinued our order processing services as we focused on providing software products and services 
we are continually evaluating our product offerings with regard to meeting our customers requirements and to acceptance in the marketplace 
also  we review the current and long term profitability of each product 
our investment in each product is dependent upon its profitability potential 
periodically  we will decide to increase or decrease the investment  or even divest a product  based upon these reviews and analyses 
accordingly  in march we are refocusing our expenditures to support our procurement product platform 
as a result  we are reducing costs in other areas 
these cost reductions will result in the elimination of approximately full time positions 
we expect to complete this reduction in the second quarter of sources of revenue sciquest generates revenues by charging license  subscription and maintenance fees for the use of its technology 
sciquest also offers professional services related to these solutions  for activities such as project implementation and training 
in addition  sciquest receives revenue from scientific supply manufacturers for converting their paper catalogs into an electronic format  enhancing or enriching the data and distributing the information as directed by the suppliers 
revenues consist of sales of software licenses and fees for implementation  customization and maintenance services related to these software licenses  sales of scientific products in e commerce transactions originating on our web sites from through  sales of scientific equipment during  advertising revenues from our web sites  and advertising revenues from the biosupplynet source book  an annual catalog of industry suppliers 
we expect that sales of software licenses and fees for implementation  customization and maintenance services related to these software licenses will be the primary source of revenues in future periods 
advertising revenues are recognized ratably over the period in which the advertisement is displayed 
revenues from advertising included in the source book are recognized at the date the source book is published and distributed  which historically has been in the second quarter of the fiscal year 
we realize revenue from the sale of licenses to our software products  the implementation and customization of our software products and the sale of maintenance and support contracts 
we recognize revenues from the sale of licenses to our software products and implementation and customization  that is deemed to be essential to the functionality of these software products  on a percentage of completion basis over the period of the customization and implementation services  which generally ranges from three to nine months 
we recognize revenues from the sale of maintenance and support contracts ratably over the period of the maintenance and support agreements  which is typically twelve months 
revenues from the sale of standardized versions of software are recognized upon customer acceptance in accordance with statement of position  software revenue recognition 
in addition  we sell subscriptions to our hosted e procurement solutions 
the implementation services and the total subscription fees attributable to our hosted solutions are recognized ratably over the term of the agreement 
recent acquisitions textco  inc on february   we purchased all of the outstanding stock of textco  inc in exchange for the issuance of  shares of our common stock with a value of approximately  based on the average market price over the five day period beginning two days before and ending two days after the acquisition date  cash payments in the amount of  including  for acquisition related expenses and the assumption of  in net liabilities of textco

of the total purchase price   was allocated to the developed software technology and  was allocated to non competition agreements 
these assets are being amortized over a period of two to three years 
an insignificant amount of purchase price was allocated to the tangible assets 
the purchase of textco expanded our software product offerings into the early stages of drug discovery research via biological research software and increased penetration into targeted biotechnology  pharmaceutical and research organizations 
textco s products are used by molecular biologists 
installations include commercial and academic research organizations and research universities 
textco s two primary products  gene construction kit and gene inspector  provide users with an intuitive  graphical technology for gene cloning projects  dna sequence analyses and experiment tracking via electronic notebooks 
groton neochem on march   we purchased substantially all of the assets of groton neochem for cash payments in the amount of  including  for acquisition related expenses and the assumption of  in net liabilities 
this acquisition was accounted for using the purchase method of accounting 
the results of groton neochem s operations have been included in the consolidated financial statements since the date of acquisition 
the entire purchase price  approximately  was allocated to developed software technology  which is being amortized over the estimated useful life of the software  which is three years 
the groton neochem products are an additional step in our strategy of building a comprehensive set of enterprise solutions for high throughput research 
these solutions facilitate the capture  organization  management  analysis and presentation of data by integrating advanced software and analytical instrument technology 
the employment agreements of key personnel include incentive payments of up to approximately  based upon the december  employment status of personnel payable upon achievement of cumulative revenue targets during the first year 
the payments may be made in the form of cash  stock or a combination of both depending upon our election 
highermarkets  inc on june   we purchased all of the outstanding stock of highermarkets  inc in exchange for the issuance of  shares of our common stock with a value of approximately  based on the average market price over the five day period beginning two days before and ending two days after the acquisition date  cash payments of acquisition related expenses of  and the assumption of  in net liabilities of highermarkets

common stock of  shares related to the incentive payments has been placed in escrow 
since the cumulative revenue targets were achieved  the escrowed incentive payments have been earned  with the stock valued at  this additional purchase price amount was allocated to the customer agreements 
of the total purchase price   was allocated to fixed assets   to the developed software technology and  to customer agreements 
these assets are being amortized over a period of two to four years 
in addition  approximately  of the total purchase price was allocated to cash and investments leaving  allocated to various current assets 
the purchase of highermarkets expanded our software product offerings into the higher education marketplace via the highermarkets hosted procurement solutions designed to meet the unique needs of this industry 
highermarkets products are used by researchers and procurement departments of universities  colleges  research institutions and other post secondary education entities 
the textco and groton neochem acquisitions were not significant 
therefore  pro forma financial information has only been presented for the highermarkets acquisition see note to the consolidated financial statements 
restructuring as part of a restructuring program announced in november  we reduced our workforce by approximately 
in connection with this reduction  we recorded a charge of approximately million in the fourth quarter of related to separation benefits paid to those affected employees and the write down of assets related to unprofitable business lines 
in the first and second quarters of  we further reduced the number of full time employees by approximately and people  respectively 
the second quarter reduction was part of a restructuring program announced in june  which included charges of approximately million for separation benefits to those affected employees  million of asset writedowns and approximately million of other costs and lease obligations relating to the unprofitable business lines to be eliminated 
due to the additional excess occupancy costs resulting from both an increase in the amount of unutilized rental space and an increase in the estimated number of months before receiving anticipated sublease proceeds because of the depressed local commercial real estate markets  we reevaluated the provision for excess office capacity and increased the charge for restructuring by million during change in business procedure affecting revenue reporting prior to may   we took legal title to the scientific products that we purchased from our suppliers and that  in turn  were sold to our customers in e commerce transactions 
as of may   we no longer took legal title to these products 
instead  we acted as an agent on behalf of the customer  and title passed directly from the supplier to the customer 
this change allowed us to reduce or eliminate some of our general and administrative expenses  such as product insurance  regulatory compliance  sales tax filings and other related order processing costs 
we continued to be responsible for the collection of the receivables and to bear the resulting credit risk 
since we acted as an agent for the customer and not as the primary obligor in the transaction for orders after may   we no longer recorded sales of scientific products and scientific equipment in e commerce transactions on a gross basis 
for each sale  we recognized revenue in the amount of the net commission that we earned for processing the transaction and or payment for services 
as a result of this change in our method of reporting revenue  we recorded much lower gross revenues from e commerce transactions after may   however  our gross profit from e commerce transactions was not materially affected although our gross margin as a percentage of related net revenue increased 
during the second half of  we finalized the process of discontinuing our order processing services to our customers 
thus the level of e commerce transactions was reduced and eventually eliminated during the last half of application of critical accounting policies our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles utilized in the us our significant accounting policies are fully described in note to the consolidated financial statements included under item of form k 
however  certain of our accounting policies are particularly important to the portrayal of our financial position and results of operations and require a higher degree of judgment and complexity 
while the estimates and judgments associated with the application of these policies may be affected by different assumptions and conditions  we believe the estimates and judgments associated with the reported amounts are appropriate in the circumstances 
our management has discussed each of the estimates and judgments described below with the auditcommittee of the board of directors and has received input from the members of the committee on these estimates and judgments 
the following is a summary of our more significant accounting policies and how they impact our financial statements 
license fees and other professional services revenue 
we sell software licenses and provide professional services to implement and configure the software to meet customer needs 
we record the revenue from the sale of software licenses and custom development and implementation services under fixed fee contracts using the percentage of completion method over the term of the development and implementation services 
therefore  the amount of revenue recognized is sensitive to the estimates to complete the remaining services 
these estimates are reviewed and revised monthly 
estimates are based on project managers detailed implementation plans predicated on significant historical experience 
if increases in projected costs to complete are sufficient to create an overall loss on an in process contract  the entire estimated loss is charged against income in the period the estimated loss is initially identified 
revenue from the sale of standardized versions of our software is recorded upon customer acceptance 
we also sell maintenance contracts  which are recognized over the term of the arrangement 
in addition  we sell subscriptions to our hosted e procurement solutions 
the implementation services and the total subscription fees attributable to our hosted solutions are recognized ratably over the term of the agreement 
development costs 
development costs include expenses to develop  enhance  manage  monitor and operate our web sites and costs of managing and integrating data on our web sites and developing hosted software to be licensed 
we capitalize internal use software development costs and amortize them over the estimated life of the related application  which generally ranges from three months to two years 
the amount being capitalized and the amount amortized is dependent upon our ability to track and capture all application development costs associated with these multiple projects and our ability to estimate accurately their useful lives  respectively 
capitalized software costs 
software development costs related to software products sold to customers are required to be capitalized beginning when a product s technological feasibility has been established and ending when a product is available for general release to customers 
these capitalized costs are then amortized over the estimated useful life of the related application  which is generally a period of two to four years 
the amount being capitalized and the amount amortized is dependent upon our ability to track and capture all application development costs associated with these multiple projects and our ability to estimate accurately their useful lives  respectively 
allowance for doubtful accounts 
we bear all risk of loss on credit sales of products in e commerce transactions as well as sales of licenses and professional services 
the allowance for doubtful accounts at december  represents approximately of total gross accounts receivable 
management s estimate is developed from analysis of each individual customer account 
based on current economic conditions and historical experience  we believe that the allowance is adequate 
however  if general economic conditions worsen  it could negatively impact the ability of customers to pay their obligations to us 
prior to june   we had a receivable from a customer that was within the final months of a multi year equipment financing arrangement that began during we maintained a security interest through ucc filings in the underlying equipment 
during the second quarter of  the customer failed to make payments in a timely manner  and accordingly  we initiated legal action 
during the third quarter of  a settlement was reached  whereby we received cash of  and the return of substantially all of the underlying collateral 
the net value of this receivable approximately  was reclassified from accounts receivable to inventory and is presented in the prepaid expenses and other current assets classification of the consolidated balance sheet as of december  deferred customer acquisition costs 
deferred customer acquisition costs relate to common stock warrants given to several key suppliers and buyers of scientific products 
the amount of deferred customer acquisition costs is and will be adjusted in each reporting period based on changes in the fair value of the underlying common stock until the warrants are fully vested and non forfeitable 
deferred customer acquisition costs will be amortized as a non cash charge to sales and marketing expense over the term of the related contractual relationship using a cumulative catch up method 
the terms of the contractual relationships range from three to five years 
the value of these warrants is adjusted each reporting period based upon the closing trading price of our common stock at each balance sheet date 
as discussed above  changes in our closing trading price from one reporting period to the next will affect our amortization of these costs  and consequently  our results of operations 
because the amortization of these costs is dependent upon the trading price of our common stock  we cannot predict the future impact of this amortization on our results from operations 
however  due to the reduced number of warrants outstanding as of december   we do not anticipate the amortization in future periods to be material 
goodwill and intangible asset valuation 
we have historically evaluated the recoverability of goodwill and other intangible assets recorded on our balance sheet based on the estimated future undiscounted cash flows attributable to the assets or asset groups to which such goodwill and intangible assets relate 
we test the carrying value of goodwill annually and identifiable intangible assets when a triggering event indicates the carrying value of those identifiable intangibles may exceed the anticipated undiscounted cash flows 
we base the estimated future cash flows on actual operating budgets and other assumptions that management deems reasonable 
however  because we transitioned our revenue model from e commerce transactions to a software and related services model in  there is limited history with which to base future estimated cash flows 
if future operations are below our current expectations  we may need to revise these cash flow estimates downward  which may then require a writedown 
any resulting writedown may be material to our financial position and results of operations 
new accounting standards require a change in the methodology for measuring impairment by estimating fair value by using a discounted cash flow approach rather than an undiscounted cash flow approach see notes and to the consolidated financial statements 
the assumptions used in discounting cash flows attributable to the reporting units or asset groups to which goodwill and intangible assets relate  could have a material impact on our estimates of the recoverability and fair value of these assets and  in turn  impact the necessity and magnitude of a future impairment charge 
we adopted statement of financial accounting standards no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets sfas no 
effective january  this statement addresses accounting and reporting for acquired goodwill and intangible assets 
in accordance with the transitional provisions of sfas no 
 we determined that the carrying value of goodwill and related assets exceeded their fair value 
as a result  we recognized a charge to income of  per share  as the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle during the first quarter of as of the end of each period presented  all of our intangible assets had definitive lives and were being amortized accordingly 
we evaluate the recoverability of our intangible assets subject to amortization in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  sfas no 

sfas no 
requires long lived assets to be reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying amount may not be recoverable 
an impairment is recognized in the event that the net book value of an asset exceeds the sum of the future undiscounted cash flows attributable to such asset or the business to which such asset relates and the net book value exceeds fair value 
the impairment amount shall be measured as the amount by which the carrying amount of a long lived asset or asset group exceeds its fair value 
in march  we acquired all of the outstanding common and preferred stock of emax solution partners  inc and allocated  of the purchase price to trademarks 
subsequently  the value of the trademarks was being amortized to expense over a three year period 
during the first quarter of  we discontinued utilizing the emax trademarks  and accordingly  determined that the carrying value of the trademarks had been impaired 
as a result  we recognized a charge to income of  the unamortized balance at march   per share in the first quarter of restructuring 
as noted above  we previously announced two restructuring programs in prior years involving exiting certain unprofitable business lines 
various estimates developed from assumptions are involved in calculating the restructuring charges  especially related to lease obligations 
generally accepted accounting principles require that continuing lease obligations no longer providing economic benefit be calculated and offset by estimated sublease proceeds obtainable for the property 
estimating the potential sublease proceeds is dependent upon our ability to predict general and local economic market conditions 
due to the additional excess occupancy costs resulting from both an increase in the amount of unutilized rental space and an increase in the estimated number of months before receiving anticipated sublease proceeds because of the depressed local commercial real estate markets  we reevaluated the provision for excess office capacity and increased the charge for restructuring by million during gross versus net e commerce revenues presentation 
as noted above  prior to may   we took legal title to the products that we purchased from our suppliers and that in turn  were sold to customers in e commerce transactions 
because we were the primary obligor in these transactions  we recorded the revenue on a gross basis  whereby we recorded the price at which we sold the products to the customer as gross revenue and the amount we paid the supplier was recorded as cost of sales 
subsequent to may   when we stopped taking legal title to the product  we were no longer the primary obligor 
instead  we acted as an agent on behalf of the customer  and title passed directly from the supplier to the customer 
therefore  we no longer recorded the transaction revenue on a gross basis 
for each sale  we recognized revenue in the amount of the net commission that we earned for processing the transaction 
in addition  during  we completed the transition away from the e commerce transaction processing business model 
as a result of the above  we recognized no revenues from e commerce transactions in internal controls our chief executive officer and chief financial officer have reviewed our company s disclosure controls and procedures as of a date within days prior to this report the evaluation date 
based on this review  these officers believe that such disclosure controls and procedures as of the evaluation date were adequate to ensure that material information relating to our company  including its consolidated subsidiaries  is made known to management by others within the company and its consolidated subsidiaries 
there were no significant changes in internal controls or in other factors that could significantly affect internal controls subsequent to the evaluation date 
results of operations the following table sets forth certain operating data as a percentage of total revenues for the periods indicated

during the years ended december  and  we recognized million and million  respectively  of revenue from fees from licenses and other professional services 
these amounts include revenue related to advertising sold in the biosupplynet source book of  and  respectively  which is recorded annually when the source book is published 
e commerce transaction revenues were million for the year ended december  as we previously discussed  effective may   we discontinued taking legal title to products we purchased from our suppliers and  in turn  sold to our customers 
as a result  for products sold after may   we recorded revenue as the net commission that we earned for processing the transaction 
therefore  revenues for the year ended december  were composed of sales prior to may   totaling million  which were recorded on a gross basis and million representing the commissions earned on transactions processed after may  the total value of scientific product transactions processed during the year ended december  was million 
there were no e commerce transaction revenues in during the year ended december   two customers accounted for and  respectively  of gross revenues 
there can be no assurance that these customers will continue to purchase at these levels 
cost of revenues cost of revenues for license fees and other professional services primarily consist of personnel costs for employees who work directly on the development and implementation of customized electronic research solutions and who provide maintenance to customers as well as the amortization of capitalized software development costs 
cost of revenues relating to the biosupplynet source book consists primarily of printing  publishing and distribution of the source book 
cost of e commerce revenues related to transactions for orders placed prior to may  primarily consists of the purchase price of scientific products sold in these transactions and related shipping costs for these products 
cost of revenues for license fees and other professional services for the years ended december  and were million and million  respectively  of which million and million  respectively  related to the amortization of capitalized software development costs 
also included in the cost of revenues for license fees and other professional services were the costs related to the biosupplynet source book of  and  during the years ending december  and  respectively 
cost of e commerce revenues was million for the year ended december  we discontinued our order processing services during the second half of therefore  there were no costs of e commerce revenues in gross profit gross profit decreased to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  gross profit from licenses and professional fees was million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively  of which million and million  respectively  related to license fees and  and  respectively  were derived from the source book 
the reduction in gross margin is primarily attributable to increased amortization of acquired and capitalized software development costs due to technology added from recent acquisitions and our enterprise substance manager software 
gross profit on the sale of scientific products and equipment was million for the year ended december   which represented approximately a gross profit 
the gross profit percentage on all products sold would have been for the year ended december   had we continued to take legal title to products sold 
there were no sales of scientific products in operating expenses development expenses 
development expenses consist primarily of personnel and related costs to develop  operate and maintain our software  aggregate data and the amortization of capitalized development costs 
development costs decreased to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  this decrease resulted from decreased expenses required to develop our e commerce fulfillment system and list suppliers products on our web sites as we transitioned out of the order processing business model 
we reduced our development costs related to our e commerce business as we focused on selling software and services 
during the years ended december  and  we capitalized approximately million and million  respectively  of certain costs related to software and web site development projects 
we expect our development expenses to decrease in as compared to as a result of personnel reductions 
included in development cost is the amortization of non cash stock based employee compensation expense  which totaled million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
this is primarily due to stock options that had been issued to employees with exercise prices less than fair value on the date of grant since december  deferred compensation recorded due to the issuance of such stock options is charged to stock based employee compensation expense over the vesting term of the options 
sales and marketing expenses 
sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of salaries and other related costs for sales and marketing personnel  travel expenses  public relations expenses and marketing materials 
sales and marketing expenses decreased to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  this decrease resulted primarily from reducing the number of sales and marketing personnel to market our products and services and from reducing advertising and promotion expenses for our e commerce marketplace and from a credit of million related to the non cash stock based customer acquisition costs described below 
sales and marketing expenses for years ended december  and include million and million  respectively  of amortization of non cash stock based employee compensation 
also included in sales and marketing expenses for the years ended december  and is amortization benefit expense of non cash stock based customer acquisition costs of million and million  respectively 
stock based customer acquisition costs represent the amortization of deferred customer acquisition costs that were initially recorded in november upon the issuance of common stock warrants to key suppliers and customers 
the value of these warrants is adjusted each reporting period based upon the closing trading price of our common stock at each balance sheet date 
decreases in our closing trading price from one reporting period to the next will likely result in a benefit  and increases in our closing trading price will likely result in charges to expense 
because the amortization of these costs is dependent upon the trading price of our common stock  we cannot predict the future impact of this amortization on our results from operations 
we expect our sales and marketing expenses in  apart from the amortization of stock based customer acquisition costs  to be somewhat higher than  as we expand our sales and marketing efforts to introduce and sell the new products that we have acquired and developed 
general and administrative expenses 
general and administrative expenses consist primarily of personnel and related costs for our general corporate functions  including finance  accounting  legal  human resources  investor relations  facilities  amortization of intangibles and non cash stock based employee compensation 
general and administrative expenses decreased to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  general and administrative expenses in includes amortization of goodwill and other intangible assets of million  as compared to million of amortization of other intangible assets in  relating primarily to our march acquisition of emax 
there was no goodwill amortization during as a result of the change in accounting for goodwill as discussed in note of the consolidated financial statements 
as a result of the discontinued use of the emax trademarks  only million of the related amortization was recorded in as discussed in note of the consolidated financial statements 
general and administrative expenses also include a charge of million and million relating to non cash stock based employee charges in the years ended december  and  respectively 
general and administrative expenses before these non cash charges decreased by million  primarily due to reduced personnel 
we expect general and administrative expenses in to be comparable to the level 
restructuring 
in june  we announced a restructuring of our business to essentially eliminate outsourced procurement services 
the restructuring included the elimination of certain unprofitable business lines and a resultant reduction in workforce of approximately half of the employees located in the united states 
the total restructuring charge in was million and included approximately million for employee separation benefits  million of assets and approximately million of other costs and lease obligations relating to the unprofitable business lines to be eliminated 
during  we increased the charge for restructuring by million to reflect the additional excess occupancy costs we anticipate incurring until we are able to sublet the excess office space 
impairment of intangible assets 
we evaluate the recoverability of our intangible assets subject to amortization in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets sfas no 

sfas no 
requires long lived assets to be reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying amount may not be recoverable 
an impairment is recognized in the event that the net book value of an asset exceeds the sum of the future undiscounted cash flows attributable to such asset or the business to which such asset relates and its net book value exceeds fair value 
the impairment amount is measured as the amount by which the carrying amount of a long lived asset asset group exceeds its fair value 
in march  we acquired all of the outstanding common and preferred stock of emax and allocated  of the purchase price to trademarks 
subsequently  we were amortizing the value of the trademarks to expense over a three year period 
during the first quarter of  we discontinued utilizing the emax trademarks and  accordingly  determined that the carrying value of the trademarks had been impaired 
as a result  we recognized a charge to income of  the unamortized balance at march   per share in the first quarter of see note of the consolidated financial statements for additional discussion 
other income expense other income expense primarily consists of interest income earned on cash deposited in money market accounts and other short and long term investments partially reduced by interest expense incurred on capital lease and debt obligations 
net other income expense decreased to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  this decrease was primarily from reduced interest income resulting from our use of cash and investments to fund operations during and as well as a reduction in interest rates between the comparative periods 
we expect net interest income to continue to be lower in than in cumulative effect of accounting change we adopted statement of financial accounting standards no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets sfas no 
effective january  this statement addresses accounting and reporting for acquired goodwill and intangible assets 
in accordance with the transitional provisions of sfas no 
 we determined that the carrying value of goodwill and related assets exceeded their fair value 
as a result  we recognized a charge to income of  per share of goodwill impairment as the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle during the first quarter of net loss net loss decreased to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  year ended december  and revenues revenues for the years ended december  and have been derived primarily from the sale of licenses to our software products  the implementation and customization of our software products and from the sale of scientific products and scientific equipment in e commerce transactions 
during the years ended december  and  we recognized million and million  respectively  of revenue from fees from licenses and other professional services 
these amounts include revenue related to advertising sold in the biosupplynet source book of  and  respectively 
such revenue is recorded annually when the source book is published 
e commerce revenues decreased to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  as we previously discussed  effective may   we discontinued taking legal title to products we purchased from our suppliers and  in turn  sold to our customers 
as a result  for products sold after may   we record revenue as the net commission that we earn for processing the transaction 
therefore  revenues for the year ended december  were comprised of sales prior to may   totaling million  which were recorded on a gross basis and commissions earned on transactions for orders placed on or after may  totaling million 
the value of product transactions for which we did not take title was million 
therefore  the total value of scientific product transactions processed during the year ended december  was million 
this is compared to million of sales of scientific products and million of scientific equipment during the year ended december  there were no sales of scientific equipment in during the year ended december   three customers accounted for  and  respectively  of gross revenues 
there can be no assurance that these customers will continue to purchase at these levels 
cost of revenues cost of revenues for license fees and other professional services primarily consist of personnel costs for employees who work directly on the development and implementation of customized electronic research solutions and who provide maintenance to customers as well as the amortization of capitalized software development costs 
cost of revenues relating to the biosupplynet source book consists primarily of printing  publishing and distribution of the source book 
cost of e commerce revenues related to transactions for orders placed prior to may  primarily consists of the purchase price of scientific products sold in these transactions and related shipping costs for these products 
cost of revenues for license fees and other professional services for the years ended december  and was million and million  respectively  of which million and million  respectively  related to the amortization of capitalized software development costs 
also included in the cost of revenues for license fees and other professional services are the costs related to the biosupplynet source book of  and  during the years ending december  and  respectively 
cost of e commerce revenues decreased to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  the primary reasons for this decrease were that we stopped taking legal title to products sold as of may  and that we substantially reduced e commerce transaction volume during the cost of products related to sales for which we did not take title was million 
therefore  the cost of e commerce revenues would have been million had we continued to take legal title to products sold and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
cost of scientific equipment for the year ended december  was million 
there were no sales of scientific equipment in gross profit gross profit decreased to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  gross profit from licenses and professional fees was million and million  for the years ended december  and  respectively  of which million and million  respectively  related to license fees and  and  respectively  were derived from the source book 
gross profit on the sale of scientific products and equipment was million and million  which represented approximately and  for the years ended december  and  respectively 
this increase in the gross margin percentage resulted  in part  because we stopped taking legal title to products sold on or after may  this had the effect of increasing the gross profit percentage for the year  without any effect on the gross profit dollars 
the gross profit percentage on all products sold would have been for the year ended december   had we continued to take legal title to products sold 
operating expenses development expenses 
development expenses consist primarily of personnel and related costs to develop  operate and maintain our software  aggregate data and the amortization of capitalized development costs 
development costs decreased to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  this decrease resulted from decreased expenses required to develop our e commerce fulfillment system and list suppliers products on our web sites as we transitioned out of the order processing business model 
we reduced our development costs related to our e commerce business as we focused on selling software and services 
during the years ended december  and  we capitalized approximately million and million  respectively  of certain costs related to software and web site development projects 
included in development cost is the amortization of non cash stock based employee compensation expense  which totaled million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
this is primarily due to stock options that had been issued to employees with exercise prices less than fair value on the date of grant since december  deferred compensation recorded due to the issuance of such stock options is charged to stock based employee compensation expense over the vesting term of the options 
sales and marketing expenses 
sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of salaries and other related costs for sales and marketing personnel  travel expenses  public relations expenses and marketing materials 
sales and marketing expenses decreased to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  this decrease resulted primarily from reducing the number of sales and marketing personnel to market our products and services and from reducing advertising and promotion expenses for our e commerce marketplace 
sales and marketing expenses for years ended december  and include million and million  respectively  of amortization of non cash stock based employee compensation 
also included in sales and marketing expenses for the years ended december  and is amortization expense benefit of non cash stock based customer acquisition costs of million and million  respectively 
stock based customer acquisition costs represent the amortization of deferred customer acquisition costs that were initially recorded in november upon the issuance of common stock warrants to key suppliers and customers 
the value of these warrants is adjusted each reporting period based upon the closing trading price of our common stock at each balance sheet date 
decreases in our closing trading price from one reporting period to the next will likely result in a benefit  and increases in our closing trading price will likely result in charges to expense 
because the amortization of these costs is dependent upon the trading price of our common stock  we cannot predict the future impact of this amortization on our results from operations 
general and administrative expenses 
general and administrative expenses consist primarily of personnel and related costs for our customer care department and general corporate functions  including finance  accounting  legal  human resources  investor relations  facilities  amortization of goodwill and non cash stock based employee compensation 
general and administrative expenses decreased to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  general and administrative expenses include an increase in goodwill amortization of million relating primarily to our acquisition of emax in march there was no goodwill amortization related to emax during the first three months of this increase in goodwill amortization is offset by reduced personnel and related costs in these functional areas 
amortization of goodwill  resulting primarily from the acquisition of emax in march  and other intangibles was million and million during the years ended december  and  respectively 
general and administrative expenses also include a charge of million and million relating to non cash stock based employee charges in the years ended december  and  respectively 
general and administrative expenses before these non cash charges decreased by million  primarily due to reduced personnel 
purchased in process research and development 
for the year ended december   we recognized an in process research and development charge of million as a result of the acquisition of emax 
based on management s valuation of emax and its assets  we allocated million of the emax purchase price of million to software products being developed by emax that had not reached technological feasibility and had no alternative use at the date of the acquisition of emax 
we did not acquire any in process research and development in restructuring 
in june  we announced a restructuring of our business to essentially eliminate outsourced procurement services 
the restructuring included the elimination of certain unprofitable business lines and a resultant reduction in workforce of approximately half of the employees located in the united states 
the total restructuring charge was million and included approximately million for employee separation benefits  million of assets and approximately million of other costs and lease obligations relating to the unprofitable business lines to be eliminated 
in november  we reduced our workforce by approximately 
in connection with this reduction  we recorded a charge of approximately million in the fourth quarter of related to separation benefits paid to those affected employees and the write down of assets related to unprofitable business lines that management decided to eliminate 
other income expense other income expense consists of interest income earned on cash deposited in money market accounts and other short and long term investments partially reduced by interest expense incurred on capital lease obligations 
net interest income decreased to million for the year ended december  from net interest income of million for the year ended december  this decrease resulted from our use of cash and investments to fund operations during and and a reduction in interest rates during income tax benefit income tax benefit decreased to zero for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  the decrease in income tax benefit was the result of the reduction in net deferred tax liabilities to zero during the year ended december  net loss net loss decreased to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  quarterly results of operations the following is a table of our unaudited quarterly statement of operations data for each of the periods indicated 
this information is unaudited  but in our opinion  has been prepared substantially on the same basis as our audited financial statements  which are included elsewhere in this report 
all necessary adjustments  consisting only of normal recurring adjustments  have been included in these amounts to present fairly the unaudited quarterly results of operations

we expect our quarterly operating results to vary significantly in the future due to a variety of factors  many of which are outside our control 
our revenues decreased in and as we transitioned our business from processing e commerce transactions to providing software and related services 
liquidity and capital resources we have primarily funded our operations through private placements of our preferred stock during and and our initial public offering  which closed in november as of december   we had total cash and investments of million  which is comprised of cash and cash equivalents of million  short term investments of million and long term investments of million 
cash used in operating activities was million and million during the years ended december  and  respectively 
cash used in operating activities was principally for the development of our software solutions  our sales and marketing efforts  administration and operations for support of our growth  payments to our suppliers for purchases of scientific products in and the development of our e commerce marketplace in cash provided used by investing activities during the years ended december  and was million and million  respectively 
cash used in investing activities has primarily been comprised of purchases of investments in us government obligations  commercial paper and corporate bonds  net of maturities  purchases of computer equipment and the capitalization of certain costs associated with the development of our web sites and with the development of research software systems 
cash was primarily provided from the maturity of investments 
cash used by financing activities during the years ended december  and was million and million  respectively 
during the year ended december   we borrowed million and repaid lease obligations of million 
during and  we repurchased  and  shares of its common stock for and million  respectively 
during the years ended december  and  we received approximately million and million  respectively  in proceeds from exercises of stock options and warrants and from purchases under the employee stock purchase plan 
over the last months we have incurred cumulative operating losses of million and used million of cash in operations 
we have reduced our spending to an average of million for net cash used in operating activities for each of the last six quarters following our restructuring 
based on this spending level  adjusted for our anticipated additional capital needs  we believe that our existing cash and investments of million at december  will be sufficient to satisfy our cash requirements for more than the next year 
there are significant uncertainties  based on recent economic conditions and our limited operating experience as a software and related services provider  as to whether debt or equity financing will be available if we are required to seek additional funds 
even if we are able to secure funds in the debt or equity markets  we may not be able to do so on terms that are favorable or acceptable to our stockholders 
any additional equity financing  if available  would likely result in substantial dilution to our existing stockholders 
if we are unable to raise additional capital to continue to support our operations  we might be required to scale back  delay or discontinue one or more of our product offerings  which could have a material adverse effect on our business 
reduction or discontinuation of any one of our business components or product offerings could result in additional charges  which would be reflected in the period of the reduction or discontinuation 
related party transactions in february  we guaranteed an  loan for mr 
m 
scott andrews  a member of the board of directors and co founder 
we secured the loan with a certificate of deposit in a like amount 
the loan bears interest at prime rate and becomes payable in full in february we have agreed to reimburse mr 
andrews for interest paid on this loan 
the transaction was approved by a majority of our disinterested directors 
in  we reimbursed mr 
andrews for interest payments totaling  the sarbanes oxley act of prohibits companies from extending credit or arranging for the extension of credit for any director or executive officer in the form of a personal loan 
credit arrangements that were in place prior to this act may be maintained  but not renewed 
accordingly  we are fully compliant with this act and will not renew our guarantee after the maturity of this loan 
as this loan approaches the repayment date  it is likely that mr 
andrews will sell a portion of his shares of our common stock to repay the guaranteed loan 
in february  we renewed our guarantee of a loan by mr 
james j

we agreed to reimburse mr

in  we reimbursed mr 
scheuer for interest payments totaling  new accounting pronouncements in june  the financial accounting standards board issued statement of financial accounting standard no 
 business combinations  which requires that all business combinations be accounted for by the purchase method  thereby eliminating the pooling method  that assets including intangible assets be recognized and valued apart from goodwill  and that additional disclosures be made regarding business combinations and the resulting allocation of purchase price 
our adoption of this standard did not have a material impact on the consolidated financial position or results of operations 
in june  the financial accounting standards board issued statement of financial accounting standard no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  sfas no 
the major provisions of which include the ceasing of amortization of goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets  the testing for impairment of goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets at least annually  and the removal of the restriction that the maximum amortization period of intangible assets with finite lives be limited to years 
the provisions of sfas no 
were effective beginning with our fiscal year 
any impairment losses from the initial application were to be reported as a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle in accordance with apb opinion no 
 accounting changes 
we adopted sfas no 
effective january   and in accordance with its transitional provisions  we determined that the carrying value of goodwill and related assets exceeded their fair value 
as a result  we recognized a charge to income of  per share  as the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle during the first quarter of as of the end of each period presented  all of our intangible assets had definitive lives and were being amortized accordingly 
in june  the financial accounting standards board issued statement of financial accounting standard no 
 accounting for asset retirement obligations sfas no 

sfas no 
requires recording the fair value of a liability for an asset retirement obligation in the period in which it is incurred  and a corresponding increase in the carrying value of the related long lived asset 
over time  the liability is accreted using the original discount rate when the liability was initially recognized  and the capitalized cost is depreciated over the useful life of the related asset 
upon settlement of the liability  it is either settled for its recorded amount or a gain or loss upon settlement is recorded 
the provisions of sfas no 
will be effective for fiscal years beginning after june  the adoption of sfas no 
is not expected to have any impact on our financial statements or results of operations 
in october  the financial accounting standards board issued statement of financial accounting standard no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets sfas no 

sfas no 
 while retaining the fundamental recognition and measurement provision of sfas no 
 establishes a primary asset approach to determining the cash flow estimation period for a group of assets and liabilities 
similarly  sfas no 
retains the basic provisions of apb opinion no 
 but broadens the presentation to include a component of an entity 
in addition  discontinued operations are no longer measured on a net realizable value basis and future operating losses are no longer recognized before they occur 
rather  discontinued operations are carried at the lower of carrying amount or fair value less cost to sell 
application of the provisions of sfas no 
was required beginning with our fiscal year 
the adoption of sfas no 
did not have a material impact on our financial statements or results of operations 
in june  the financial accounting standards board issued statement of financial accounting standard no 
 accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities sfas no 

sfas no 
nullifies emerging issues task force issue no 
 liability recognition for certain employee termination benefits and other costs to exit an activity including certain costs incurred in a restructuring eitf no 

sfas no 
requires that a liability for a cost associated with an exit or disposal activity be recognized when the liability is incurred 
this is in contrast to eitf that required recognition of a liability upon an entity s commitment to an exit plan 
sfas no 
concludes that a commitment  by itself  does not create a present obligation meeting the definition of a liability 
this statement establishes fair value as the objective for initial measurement of the liability 
the provisions of sfas no 
are effective for exit or disposal activities that are initiated after december  the adoption of sfas no 
is not expected to have any impact on our financial statements or results of operations 
in november  the financial accounting standards board issued financial accounting series fasb interpretation no 
 guarantor s accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees  including indirect guarantees of indebtedness of others an interpretation of fasb statements no 
  and and rescission of fasb interpretation no 
fin no 

fin no 
elaborates on the disclosures to be made by a guarantor in its interim and annual financial statements regarding its obligations under certain guarantees that it has issued 
it also clarifies that a guarantor is required to recognize  at the inception of a guarantee  a liability for the fair value of the obligation undertaken in issuing the guarantee 
the initial recognition and initial measurement provisions of fin no 
are applicable on a prospective basis to guarantees issued or modified after december   irrespective of the guarantor s fiscal year end 
the disclosure requirements are effective for financial statements of interim or annual periods ending after december  the interpretive guidance incorporated without change from interpretation continues to be required for financial statements for fiscal years ending after june  the effective date of interpretation the adoption of fin no 
is not expected to have any impact on our financial statements or results of operations 
the required disclosures for the year ended december  are presented in note of the consolidated financial statements 
in december  the financial accounting standards board issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure an amendment of fasb statement no 
sfas no 
which amends fasb statement no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  to provide alternative methods of transition for an entity that voluntarily changes to the fair value based method of accounting for stock based employee compensation 
it also amends the disclosure provisions of that statement to require prominent disclosure about the effects on reported net income of an entity s accounting policy decisions with respect to stock based employee compensation 
sfas no 
amends accounting principles board opinion no 
 interim financial reporting  to require prominent disclosure in interim financial information 
the provisions of sfas no 
are effective for financial statements for fiscal years ending after december  with the interim reporting provisions effective for reporting periods beginning after december  the adoption of sfas no 
did not have any material impact on our financial statements or results of operations 
the required disclosures for the year ended december  are presented in note of the consolidated financial statements 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk most of our cash equivalents  short term and long term investments and capital lease obligations are at fixed interest rates  therefore the fair value of these investments is affected by changes in market interest rates 
however  because our investment portfolio is primarily comprised of investments in us government obligations and high grade commercial paper  an immediate change in market interest rates would not have a material effect on the fair market value of our portfolio 
therefore  we would not expect our operating results or cash flows to be affected to any significant degree by a sudden change in market interest rates 
factors that may affect future results our future operating results may vary substantially from period to period based on a number of factors 
the price of our common stock will fluctuate in the future  and an investor in our common stock is subject to a variety of risks  including but not limited to the specific risks identified below 
current and prospective investors are strongly urged to carefully consider the various cautionary statements and risks set forth below and elsewhere in this report 
since we have a limited operating history with our current business model  forecasting future performance may be difficult 
our business model has evolved considerably since our company s inception 
for instance  we launched our public e commerce marketplace in april beginning with our acquisition of emax in march  we have increasingly focused our efforts on providing software products and services to enhance research operations for pharmaceutical  biotechnology and other research based organizations 
we discontinued our order processing services in in  we acquired the business operations of textco  groton neochem and highermarkets  each of which added new products and or target markets to our business model 
accordingly  we have only a limited operating history on which to evaluate our current business model 
as a result of our limited operating history and the evolving nature of our business model  we may be unable to accurately forecast our revenues 
we incur expenses based predominantly on operating plans and estimates of future revenues 
revenues to be generated from newly developed and evolving activities will be particularly difficult to forecast accurately 
our expenses are to a large extent fixed 
we may be unable to adjust our spending in a timely manner to compensate for any unexpected revenue shortfalls 
accordingly  a failure to meet our revenue projections will have an immediate and negative impact on profitability 
finally  we cannot be certain that our evolving business model will be successful  particularly in light of our limited operating history 
we have a history of losses and anticipate incurring losses in the future 
we may not achieve profitability 
we incurred a net loss of million for the year ended december  to date  we have not realized any profits  and as of december   we had an accumulated deficit of million 
we expect to incur substantial operating losses and continued negative cash flow from operations for the foreseeable future 
in fact  we expect to continue generating losses through at least we may not be able to increase revenues sufficiently to achieve profitability 
our future profitability and cash flows are dependent upon our ability to control expenses 
our operating plan to achieve profitability is based upon estimates of our future expenses 
for instance  we significantly reduced our development expenses  certain sales and marketing expenses and general and administrative expenses since if our future expenses are greater than anticipated  our ability to achieve profitability when expected may be negatively impacted 
in addition  greater than anticipated expenses may negatively impact our cash flows  which could cause us to expend our capital faster than anticipated 
while we expect our existing capital to be sufficient for more than the next year  lower than expected cash flows due to increased expenses could require us to raise additional capital or significantly reduce expenses in order to maintain our operations 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to raise such funds on favorable terms  or at all 
also  a large percentage of our expenses are relatively fixed  which may make it difficult to reduce expenses significantly in the future 
our future profitability and cash flows are also dependent upon our ability to achieve revenue growth 
our operating plan to achieve profitability is based upon estimates of our revenues and assumes that we will achieve license fee and related revenues that substantially exceed historical levels 
our ability to achieve this projected revenue growth is largely dependent on the results of our sales efforts 
in  we restructured our sales and marketing teams in an effort to increase our revenue generation  and we intend to increase certain sales and marketing expenses in we cannot assure you that our sales force will be successful in achieving the sales levels required to achieve profitability 
if our future revenues are less than anticipated  our ability to achieve profitability when expected may be negatively impacted 
in addition  lower than anticipated revenues may negatively impact our cash flows  which could cause us to expend our capital faster than anticipated 
while we expect our existing capital to be sufficient for more than the next year  lower than expected cash flows as a result of lower revenues could require us to raise additional capital in order to maintain our operations 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to raise such funds on favorable terms  or at all 
we are investing significantly in developing and acquiring new product and service offerings with no guarantee of success 
expanding our product and service offerings is an important component of our business strategy 
as such  we are expending a significant amount of our resources in these development and acquisition efforts 
for instance  in  we acquired additional products through our textco  groton neochem and highermarkets acquisitions 
any new offerings that are not favorably received by prospective customers could damage our reputation or brand name 
expansion of our services will require us to devote a significant amount of time and money and may strain our management  financial and operating resources 
we cannot assure you that our development efforts will result in commercially viable products or services 
in addition  we may bear development and acquisition costs in current periods that do not generate revenues until future periods  if at all 
we expect to focus our future development efforts on our procurement product platform  which will result in reduced development efforts in other areas 
to the extent that we incur expenses that do not result in increased current or future revenues  our earnings may be materially and adversely affected 
sales to larger customers may result in long sales cycles and decrease our profit margins 
sales to large enterprise buyers are an important element of our business strategy 
as we sell sophisticated solutions to larger organizations  we expect the average time from initial contact to final approval to be significant 
during this sales cycle  we may expend substantial funds and management resources without any corresponding revenue 
if approval is delayed or does not occur  our financial condition and operating results for a particular period may be adversely affected 
approvals are subject to delays over which we have little or no control  including the following potential customers internal approval processes  budgetary constraints for information technology spending  implementation of systems integration solutions  customers concerns about implementing a new strategy and method of doing business  and seasonal and other timing effects 
sales to large accounts may result in lower profit margins than other sales as larger customers typically have greater leverage in negotiating the price and other terms of business relationships 
we also typically incur costs associated with customization of our products and services with a sale to a large account 
if we do not generate sufficient revenues to offset any lower margins or these increased costs  our operating results may be materially and adversely affected 
also  the time between billing and receipt of revenues is often longer when dealing with larger accounts due to increased administrative overhead 
we have relied  and continue to rely  on a limited number of large customers for a significant portion of our revenues 
losing one or more of these customers may adversely affect our revenues 
we expect that for the foreseeable future we will generate a significant portion of our revenues from a limited number of large customers 
during the year ended december   two customers accounted for and  respectively  of our total revenues 
in addition  large individual transactions with these customers may represent an increasing percentage of our revenues 
these large transactions are often non recurring  making it difficult to predict future transactions 
the failure of one or more large transactions to occur in any given period may materially and adversely affect our revenues for that period 
if we lose any of our large customers or if we are unable to add new large customers  our revenues will not increase as expected 
in addition  our reputation and brand name would be harmed 
this customer concentration may also increase our accounts receivable credit risk from time to time 
the failure by any large customer to make payments when due would negatively impact our cash flows 
for instance  we had a receivable from a customer that was within the final months of a multi year equipment financing arrangement that began during we maintained a security interest through ucc filings in the underlying equipment 
during the second quarter of  the customer failed to make payments in a timely manner  and accordingly  we initiated legal action 
during the third quarter of  a settlement was reached  whereby we received cash of  and the return of substantially all of the underlying collateral 
the net value of this receivable approximately  was reclassified from accounts receivable to inventory and is presented in the prepaid expenses and other current assets classification of the consolidated balance sheet as of december  if it is subsequently determined that the returned equipment has a lower resale value than currently estimated  additional charges against operating results may be required 
unless a broad range of purchasers and suppliers of scientific products adopt our products and services  we will not be successful 
our success will require  among other things  that our solutions gain broad market acceptance by purchasers and suppliers of scientific products 
for example  purchasers may continue managing assets and purchasing products through their existing methods and may not adopt new technology solutions because of their comfort with current purchasing and asset management procedures  the costs and resources required to adopt new business procedures  reductions in capital expenditures or information technology spending  security and privacy concerns  or general reticence about technology or the internet 
if we do not successfully market the sciquest brand  our business may suffer 
we believe that establishing  maintaining and enhancing the sciquest brand is critical in expanding our customer base 
some of our competitors already have well established brands 
promotion of our brand will depend largely on continuing our sales and marketing efforts and providing high quality products and services to our enterprise customers 
we reduced our spending on sales and marketing significantly beginning in the fourth quarter of and through this reduction in spending could materially and adversely affect our sales and marketing efforts 
while we intend to increase certain sales and marketing expenses in  we cannot assure you that these additional expenses will be successful in generating additional revenue 
we also launched a new marketing campaign in the second half of we cannot be certain that our new marketing efforts will be successful in marketing the sciquest brand 
if we are unable to successfully promote our brand  or if we incur substantial expenses in attempting to do so  our revenues and earnings could be materially and adversely affected 
our future revenue growth could be impaired if our investment in indirect sales channels for our products is unsuccessful 
we have invested significant time and other resources in developing indirect sales channels for our products through relationships with companies such as sct  microsoft solomon great plains and e i cooperative 
we cannot assure you that our indirect sales channels will be successful or that we will be able to develop additional indirect sales channels 
if these sales channels do not result in significant amounts of sales  our ability to achieve our revenue projections may be impaired 
as we develop additional indirect sales channels  we may experience conflicts with our direct sales force to the extent that these sales channels target the same customer bases 
successful management of these potential conflicts will be necessary in order to maximize our revenue growth 
if we are not able to successfully integrate our systems with the internal systems of our customers  our operating costs and relationships with our suppliers and buyers will be adversely affected 
a key component of all services is the efficiencies created for suppliers and buyers through our products and services 
in order to create these efficiencies  it will often be necessary that our systems integrate with customers internal systems  such as inventory  customer service  technical service  high through put screening and robotic systems and financial systems 
in addition  there is little uniformity in the systems used by our customers 
if these systems are not successfully integrated  relationships with our customers will be adversely affected  which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
if we are unable to adapt our products and services to rapid technological change  our revenues and profits could be materially and adversely affected 
rapid changes in technology  products and services  user profiles and operating standards occur frequently 
these changes could render our proprietary technology and systems obsolete 
we must continually improve the performance  features and reliability of our products and services  particularly in response to our competition 
we expect to focus our future development efforts on our procurement product platform 
this will result in reduced development efforts for other product areas  which could result in those products becoming less competitive over time 
our success will depend  in part  on our ability to enhance our existing products and services  develop new services and technology that address the increasingly sophisticated and varied needs of our target markets  and respond to technological advances and emerging industry standards and practices on a cost effective and timely basis 
we cannot be certain of our success in accomplishing the foregoing 
if we are unable  for technical  legal  financial or other reasons  to adapt to changing market conditions or buyer requirements  our market share could be materially and adversely affected 
the market for technology solutions is highly competitive  which makes achieving market share and profitability more difficult 
the market for technology solutions in the pharmaceutical  biotechnology  industrial research and higher education markets is new  rapidly evolving and intensely competitive 
we experience competition from multiple sources  which makes it difficult for us to develop a comprehensive business strategy that addresses all of these competitive factors 
competition is likely to intensify as this market matures 
as competitive conditions intensify  competitors may devote greater resources to marketing and promotional campaigns  devote substantially more resources to product development  secure exclusive arrangements with customers that impede our sales  and enter into strategic or commercial relationships with larger  more established and well financed companies 
in addition  new technologies and the expansion of existing technologies may increase competitive pressures 
as a result of increased competition  we may experience reduced operating margins  as well as loss of market share and brand recognition 
we may not be able to compete successfully against current and future competitors 
these competitive pressures could have a material adverse effect on our revenue growth and earnings 
our future revenue growth may be adversely affected by a significant reduction in spending in the life sciences  industrial research and higher education markets 
we derive a significant portion of our revenue from the life sciences  industrial research and higher education markets  primarily through fees for our software products and services 
we expect our future growth to depend on spending levels in these markets 
in addition  many companies have reduced spending on information technology products in response to current economic conditions 
any significant reduction in spending in the life sciences  industrial research and higher education markets may have a material adverse effect on our revenues 
our computer and telecommunications systems are in a single location  which makes them more vulnerable to damage or interruption 
substantially all of our computer and telecommunications systems are located in the same geographic area 
these systems are vulnerable to damage or interruption from fire  flood  power loss  telecommunications failure  break ins and similar events 
while we have business interruption insurance  this coverage may not adequately compensate us for lost business 
although we have implemented network security measures  our systems  like all systems  are vulnerable to computer viruses  physical or electronic break ins and similar disruptions 
these disruptions could lead to interruptions  delays and loss of data with respect to our hosted products 
any of these occurrences could have a material adverse effect on our revenues 
if we are unable to protect our intellectual property rights  our business could be materially and adversely affected 
any misappropriation of our technology or the development of competing technology could seriously harm our business 
we regard a substantial portion of our software products as proprietary and rely on a combination of copyright  trademark and trade secrets  customer license agreements and employee and third party confidentiality agreements to protect our proprietary rights 
these protections may not be adequate  and we cannot assure you that they will prevent misappropriation of our intellectual property  particularly in foreign countries where the laws may not protect proprietary rights as fully as do the laws of the united states 
other companies could independently develop similar or competing technology without violating our proprietary rights 
the process of enforcing our intellectual property rights through legal proceedings would likely be burdensome and expensive  and our ultimate success could involve a high degree of risk 
our products  trademarks and other proprietary rights may infringe on the proprietary rights of third parties  which may expose us to litigation 
while we believe that our products  trademarks and other proprietary rights do not infringe upon the proprietary rights of third parties  we cannot guarantee that third parties will not assert infringement claims against us in the future  particularly with respect to technology that we acquire through acquisitions of other companies 
any such claims could require us to enter into a license agreement or royalty agreement with the party asserting a claim 
even the successful defense of an infringement claim could result in substantial costs and diversion of our management s efforts 
we are dependent on proprietary content and technology licensed from third parties  the loss of which could be costly 
we license a portion of the content and proprietary technology for our products and services from third parties 
these third party licenses may not be available to us on favorable terms  or at all  in the future 
in addition  we must be able to successfully integrate this content and proprietary technology in a timely and cost effective manner to create an effective finished product 
if we fail to obtain the necessary third party licenses on favorable terms or are unable to successfully integrate this content and proprietary technology on favorable terms  it could have a material adverse effect on our business operations 
product defects or software errors in our products could adversely affect our business due to costly redesigns  production delays and customer dissatisfaction 
design defects or software errors in our products may cause delays to product introductions or reduce customer satisfaction  either of which could materially and adversely affect our product sales and revenues 
our software products are highly complex and may contain design defects or software errors from time to time that may be difficult to detect or correct 
in addition  our products are often critical to our customers business operations  which may magnify the impact of any design defects or software errors 
although we have license agreements with our customers that contain provisions designed to limit our exposure to potential claims and liabilities arising from customers  these provisions may not effectively protect us against all claims 
in addition  claims arising from customer dissatisfaction could significantly damage our reputation and sales efforts 
if we fail to attract and retain key employees  our business may suffer 
a key factor of our success will be the continued services and performance of our executive officers and other key personnel 
if we lose the services of any of our executive officers  our financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected 
we do not have long term employment agreements with any of our key personnel 
our success also depends upon our ability to identify  hire and retain other highly skilled technical  managerial  editorial  sales  marketing and customer service professionals 
competition for such personnel is intense 
we cannot be certain of our ability to identify  hire and retain sufficiently qualified personnel 
for example  we may encounter difficulties in attracting a sufficient number of qualified software developers 
failure to identify  hire and retain necessary technical  managerial  editorial  merchandising  sales  marketing and buyer service personnel could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
many of our key executives and other employees have been employed by us for two years or less 
if our employees do not work well together or some of our employees do not succeed in their designated roles  our financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected 
we cannot be certain that our management  operational and financial resources will be adequate to support our future operations 
the failure to integrate successfully businesses that we have acquired or may acquire could adversely affect our business 
we have acquired and intend to continue acquiring complementary businesses 
in particular  we acquired emax in  and textco  highermarkets and the assets of groton neochem in an element of our strategy is to broaden the scope and content of our products and services through the acquisition of existing products  technologies  services and businesses 
acquisitions entail numerous risks  including the integration of new operations  products  services and personnel  the diversion of resources from our existing businesses  sites and technologies  the inability to generate revenues from new products and services sufficient to offset associated acquisition costs  the maintenance of uniform standards  controls  procedures and policies  accounting effects that may adversely affect our financial results  the impairment of employee and customer relations as a result of any integration of new management personnel  dilution to existing stockholders from the issuance of equity securities  and liabilities or other problems associated with an acquired business 
we may have difficulty in effectively assimilating and integrating these businesses  or any future joint ventures  acquisitions or alliances  into our operations 
any difficulties in the process could disrupt our ongoing business  distract our management and employees  increase our expenses and otherwise adversely affect our business 
any problems we encounter in connection with our acquisitions could have a material adverse effect on our business 
our planned growth from international customers will require financial resources and management attention and could have a negative effect on our earnings 
we are investing resources and capital to expand our sales activities internationally  particularly in europe 
the expansion will require financial resources and management attention and could have a negative effect on our earnings 
we cannot be assured that we will be successful in creating international demand for our solutions and services 
in addition  our international business may be subject to a variety of risks  including  among other things  increased costs associated with maintaining international marketing efforts  applicable government regulation  fluctuations in foreign currency  difficulties in collecting international accounts receivable and the enforcement of intellectual property rights 
we cannot assure you that these factors will not have an adverse effect on future international sales and earnings 
in addition  the business customs and regulations in foreign countries may require changes in our business model 
in addition  we are currently contemplating registering our trademarks in other countries 
we cannot be assured that we will be able to do so 
significant fluctuation in the market price of our common stock could result in securities class action claims against us 
significant price and value fluctuations have occurred with respect to the securities of technology companies 
our common stock price has been volatile and is likely to be volatile in the future 
in the past  following periods of downward volatility in the market price of a company s securities  class action litigation has often been pursued against such companies 
if similar litigation were pursued against us  it could result in substantial costs and a diversion of our management s attention and resources 
the price of our common stock could result in the delisting of our stock from the nasdaq smallcap market  which could adversely affect the trading of our common stock 
on october   we transferred the listing of our common stock from the nasdaq national market to the nasdaq smallcap market 
in order to satisfy nasdaq s minimum listing maintenance requirements for both the nasdaq national market and the nasdaq smallcap market  we must satisfy various financial tests  including maintaining a minimum closing bid price of at least 
transferring to the nasdaq smallcap market enables us to take advantage of the extended grace period provided by the nasdaq smallcap market to meet the minimum per share closing bid price requirement for continued listing 
as a result of this transfer  the closing bid price of our common stock must be above for a minimum of consecutive trading days by july  in order to avoid initiation of procedures to delist our common stock from the nasdaq smallcap market 
if the closing bid price of our common stock is above for a minimum of consecutive trading days by july   we will be eligible for transfer to the nasdaq national market under its continued listing requirements 
we cannot be assured that the closing bid price of our common stock will rise and remain above in the future to permit us to maintain our nasdaq smallcap market listing or to regain our listing on the nasdaq national market 
if our common stock is delisted from the nasdaq smallcap market  it would be listed on the otc bulletin board  which is viewed by most investors as a less desirable and less liquid marketplace 
thus  delisting from the nasdaq smallcap market could make trading our common stock more difficult for investors  potentially leading to further declines in share prices 
we intend to seek approval at our annual meeting of stockholders for our board of directors to be given the authority to implement a reverse stock split in an effort to increase our common stock price by reducing the number of shares outstanding 
however  we cannot assure you that we will obtain the necessary stockholder approval to implement the reverse stock split or that the reverse stock split will result in a higher common stock price over an extended period of time 
in addition  the reduced number of shares of common stock resulting from the reverse stock split could adversely affect the liquidity of our common stock 
new accounting rules could be proposed that could adversely affect our reported financial results 
our financial statements are prepared based on generally accepted accounting principles and sec accounting rules 
these principles and rules are subject to change from time to time for various reasons 
while we believe we meet all current financial reporting requirements  we cannot predict at this time whether any initiatives will be proposed or adopted that would require us to change our accounting policies 
any change to generally accepted accounting principles or sec rules could adversely affect our reported financial results 
items a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk most of our cash equivalents  short term and long term investments and capital lease obligations are at fixed interest rates  therefore the fair value of these investments is affected by changes in market interest rates 
however  because our investment portfolio is primarily comprised of investments in us government obligations and high grade commercial paper  an immediate change in market interest rates would not have a material effect on the fair market value of our portfolio 
therefore  we would not expect our operating results or cash flows to be affected to any significant degree by the effect of a sudden change in market interest rates on our investment portfolio
