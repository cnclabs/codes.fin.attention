the company expects these factors will continue to exert downward pressures on pricing in gross profit 
gross profit decreased to of sales in from of sales in this decrease reflects a decline in total sales relative to the fixed nature of certain costs included in cost of sales  continued unit price deterioration of cd and dvd media and a continued shift in the company s product mix to products that contain a higher content of low margin packaging materials 
pricing pressures and product mix changes are expected to continue to exert downward pressure on the company s gross profit margins in in the company s form q for the quarter ended september   the company reported that it was in the final stages of negotiations with philips corporation for a reduction in the royalty rate available under philips compliance reward program 
the company expected these negotiations to be completed by december  and that the reduced rates would be retroactive to july  these expectations were based on the company s assessment of the status of the negotiations as well assurances to this effect from philips 
the company did not complete these negotiations as of year end and adjusted its philips royalty rates for all of to those in effect under the existing agreement 
as a result  fourth quarter cost of sales includes approximately  of royalty expenses related to the third quarter 
while these negotiations are ongoing  the company can not guarantee that it will reach agreement for a reduction in the philips royalty rate 
the company s inability to successfully complete these negotiations could result in further downward pressure on the company s gross profit margins as cd and dvd unit prices have begun to reflect the anticipated reduction in costs associated with this change in the royalty rates

as a result of this write down  the company did not recognize any portion of microgistix losses in the current year income taxes 
the effective income tax rate for was  compared to in due to the decline in earnings before income taxes  income and deductions that are permanently treated differently for book and tax purposes have a larger relative effect in than in when measured as a percentage of the lower pretax results

market risk foreign currency 
a portion of the company s operations are located in ireland and canada 
a majority of the company s sales from its canadian operations  and a portion of the related costs  are denominated in us dollars 
as a result  the company has limited exposure to the canadian currency 
the majority of sales revenues and related costs in its ireland operations are denominated in euros 
foreign currency transaction gains and losses are reflected in the company s financial statements and have historically not been material to the company s results of operations or financial condition 
however  the company anticipates it will continue to incur exchange gains and losses from foreign operations in the future which may be significant depending on factors such as changes in foreign currency or weak economic conditions in foreign markets 
in addition  sales of products and services are directly impacted by the value of the us dollar relative to other currencies 
interest 
as of december   the company had total outstanding debt of million  with interest rates that are tied to the prime rate or libor 
therefore  the company is exposed to interest rate risk for these borrowings based on fluctuations in the interest rates 
based upon the outstanding indebtedness as of december   an increase in the interest rates of would cause a corresponding increase in annual interest expense of less than million 
inflation historically  inflation has not had a material impact on the company

there can be no assurance that the company will be able to pass on any increased material and labor costs to its customers in the future 
outlook this section should be read in conjunction with the section titled cautionary statement for purposes of the safe harbor provisions of the private securities litigation reform act of included in part i of this form k the company believes that worldwide demand for cds and its other services has declined due to the economic slowdown in the personal computer hardware and software markets and the continuing uncertainty in the worldwide economy 
pricing strategies of competitors and general economic factors affecting demand in the personal computer hardware and software industry directly impact the company 
in addition  a substantial part of the company s revenue and unit volume is derived from a small number of key customers in these industries  including microsoft and aol  and revenues and operating income will be significantly lower than expected if the company cannot retain these customers 
unit prices will likely continue to decline due to the overcapacity in the industry 
if market demand and unit prices continue to decline  the company s revenues will be directly and adversely impacted and capacities will be further underutilized 
in addition  if the company does not respond rapidly to technological changes  it is subject to the loss of some of its customer base  which will materially and adversely effect revenue
