item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
special note certain statements set forth below under this caption constitute forward looking statements within the meaning of the private securities litigation reform act of see forward looking information may prove inaccurate on page for additional factors relating to such statements 
overview the company classifies its business activities into four fundamental segments north american outsourcing  international outsourcing  database marketing and consulting  and corporate activities 
these segments are consistent with the company s management of the business and generally reflect its internal financial reporting structure and operating focus 
north american outsourcing consists of customer management services provided in the us and canada while international outsourcing consists of all other countries 
database marketing and consulting provides outsourced database management  direct marketing and related customer retention services for automobile dealerships and manufacturers 
included in corporate activities are the elimination of intercompany transactions  general corporate expenses and operational management expenses not attributable to any other segment 
segment accounting policies are the same as those used in the consolidated financial statements 
there are no significant transactions between the reported segments for the periods presented 
teletech generates its revenues primarily by providing customer management solutions 
the company s fully outsourced customer management centers serve either multiple clients multi client centers or one dedicated client dedicated centers 
the company bills for its services based primarily on the amount of time teletech representatives devote to a client s program  and revenues are recognized as services are provided 
the company also derives revenues from consulting services  including the sale of customer management center and customer management technology  automated customer support  database management  systems integration and web based applications 
these consulting and technology revenues historically have not been a significant component of the company s revenues 
the company seeks to enter into multi year contracts with its clients that cannot be terminated for convenience except upon the payment of a termination fee 
the majority of the company s revenues are  and the company anticipates that the majority of its future revenues will continue to be  from multi year contracts 
however  the company does provide some programs on a short term basis and the company s operations outside of north america are characterized by shorter term contracts 
the company s ability to enter into new multi year contracts  particularly large complex opportunities  may be dependent upon the macroeconomic environment in general and the specific industry environments in which its customers are operating 
a weakening of the us and or global economy could cause longer sales cycles or delays in closing new business opportunities 
as a result of a weakening global economy  the company has continued to encounter delays in both the ramp up of certain existing client programs as well as the closing of sales opportunities for large customer care programs during both and teletech s profitability is significantly influenced by its customer management center capacity utilization 
the company seeks to optimize new and existing capacity utilization during both peak weekday and off peak night and weekend periods to achieve maximum fixed cost absorption 
historically  the majority of the company s revenues have been generated during peak periods 
teletech may be adversely impacted by idle capacity in its fully outsourced centers if prior to the opening or expansion of a customer management center  the company has not contracted for the provision of services or if a client program does not reach its intended level of operations on a timely basis 
in addition  the company can also be adversely impacted by idle capacity in its facilities management contracts 
in a facilities management contract  the company does not incur the costs of the facilities and equipment  however  the costs of the management team supporting the customer management center are semi fixed in nature  and absorption of these costs will be negatively impacted if the customer management center has idle capacity 
the company attempts to plan the development and opening of new customer management centers to minimize the financial impact resulting from idle capacity 
in planning the opening of new centers or the expansion of existing centers  management considers numerous factors that affect its capacity utilization  including anticipated expirations  reductions  terminations or expansions of existing programs  and the size and timing of new client contracts that the company expects to obtain 
the company continues to concentrate its marketing efforts toward obtaining larger  more complex  strategic customer management programs 
as a result  the time required to negotiate and execute an agreement with the client can be significant 
to enable the company to respond rapidly to changing market demands  implement new programs and expand existing programs  teletech may be required to commit to additional capacity prior to the contracting of additional business  which may result in idle capacity 
teletech targets capacity utilization in its fully outsourced centers at of its available workstations during the weekday period 
during and  the company carried approximately four customer management centers of global excess capacity above and beyond normal expected levels 
from time to time the company assesses the expected long term capacity utilization of its centers 
accordingly  the company may  if deemed necessary  consolidate  or close under performing centers in order to maintain or improve targeted utilization and margins 
during  the company s corporate and north american outsourcing segments recorded restructuring charges associated with the termination of approximately administrative employees and the impairment of a property lease totaling approximately million and million  respectively 
additionally  the company s international outsourcing segment recorded a loss on the closure of customer management centers in spain and canada of approximately million 
these charges are reflected on separate line items in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations 
the company records costs specifically associated with client programs as costs of services 
these costs  which include direct labor wages and benefits  telecommunication charges and certain facility costs are primarily variable in nature 
all other expenses of operations  including technology support  sales and marketing  human resource management and other administrative functions and customer management center operational expenses that are not allocable to specific programs  are recorded as selling  general and administrative sg a expenses 
sg a expenses tend to be either semi variable or fixed in nature 
the majority of the company s operating expenses have consisted of labor costs 
representative wage rates  which comprise the majority of the company s labor costs  have been and are expected to continue to be a key component of the company s expenses 
some of the company s contracts with its clients contain clauses allowing adjustment of billing rates in accordance with wage inflation 
the cost characteristics of teletech s fully outsourced programs differ significantly from the cost characteristics of its facilities management programs 
under facilities management programs  customer management centers and the related equipment are owned by the client but are staffed and managed by teletech 
accordingly  facilities management programs have higher costs of services as a percentage of revenues and lower sg a expenses as a percentage of revenues than fully outsourced programs 
additionally  the cost characteristics of the company s dedicated centers differ from the cost characteristics of its multi client centers 
dedicated centers have lower sg a expenses than multi client centers as they do not require as many resources for management and other administrative functions 
accordingly  multi client centers have higher sg a as a percentage of revenues than dedicated centers 
as a result  the company expects its overall gross margin will continue to fluctuate on a quarter to quarter basis with the mix of multi client  dedicated and facility management program revenues 
management believes the company s operating margin  which is income from operations expressed as a percentage of revenues  is a better measure of profitability on a period to period basis than gross margin 
operating margin is less subject to fluctuation from revenue mix 
results of operations the following table sets forth certain income statement data as a percentage of revenues revenues costs of services sg a expenses depreciation and amortization income from operations other income expense provision for income taxes net income loss compared to revenues 
revenues increased million  or  to  million in from million in the revenue increase primarily resulted from a new client program in the north american outsourcing segment

costs of services 
costs of services increased million  or  to million in from million in costs of services increased to of revenue in from in costs of services as a percentage of revenue have been adversely impacted by several factors 
the first is the launch of the previously mentioned new north american outsourcing program 
the terms of the contract contemplated work being transitioned from existing high cost locations to lower labor cost markets over time 
accordingly  the hourly rates paid by the client to the company decline during the first two years of the contract period eventually leveling off for the remainder of the contract based on a transition plan 
due to higher call volumes than originally anticipated  the company has not transitioned work to lower cost markets as quickly as the original plan contemplated 
as a result  costs of services as a percentage of revenue have been negatively impacted 
the company expects the transition plan will be completed during the second factor adversely impacting costs of services has been european margins  primarily due to pricing pressure in spain 
as previously discussed  the company did exit certain unprofitable contracts in spain during the year  and spain margins did improve subsequent to these actions 
finally  costs of services were adversely impacted by deterioration of margins at percepta  primarily due to price concessions sought by ford 
ford has advised the company that such concessions were in line with the price concessions ford received from its other vendors

taxes on income increased million to million in from million in primarily due to the company establishing a valuation allowance against certain deferred tax asset balances in its international outsourcing segment during this resulted in the company recording tax expense despite reporting a book loss 
during  the company also recorded tax expense while reporting a book loss due to the non deductibility of equity losses from the investment in ehi for part of the year combined with the relatively small pre tax loss amount

upon adoption of sfas no

revenues from corporate activities decreased by approximately million due to the closure of the company s pamet river subsidiary in september  the sale of the company s enhansiv subsidiary to a group of investors in the fourth quarter of and the closure of its digital creators subsidiary in the first quarter of costs of services 
costs of services increased million  or  to million in from million in costs of services increased to of revenue in from in the increase in costs of services as a percentage of revenue between years is primarily due to deterioration in european margins and the benefit of certain one time contract restructurings that positively impacted margins 
selling  general and administrative 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased million  or  to million in from million in as a percentage of revenues  selling  general and administrative expenses increased to in from in the increase between years as a percentage of revenue was primarily the result of an increase in excess capacity in the company s multi client centers between years

the effect of the change in working capital accounts on the consolidated statements of cash flows between years of approximately million is primarily the result of improved accounts receivable collections 
accounts receivable decreased as a result of more aggressive collection procedures 
the company s days sales outstanding decreased from days at december  to days at december  the company used million in investing activities during in  the company s capital expenditures were million  a decrease of million from other uses of cash for investing activities in were primarily related to capitalized software activities incurred in the database marketing and consulting segment 
in  investing activities that provided cash flow were the sale of available for sale securities and the liquidation of short term investments 
historically  capital expenditures have been  and future capital expenditures are anticipated to be  primarily for the development of customer management centers  technology deployment and systems integrations 
the company currently expects total capital expenditures in to be approximately million to million 
the company expects its capital expenditures will be used primarily to open or expand several non us customer management centers  maintenance capital for existing centers and internal technology projects 
such expenditures will be financed with internally generated funds and existing cash balances 
the level of capital expenditures incurred in will primarily be dependent upon new client contracts obtained by the company and the corresponding need for additional capacity 
in addition  if the company s future growth is generated through facilities management contracts  the anticipated level of capital expenditures could be reduced 
cash used in financing activities in was million 
this primarily resulted from the stock repurchase program authorized by the board of directors for the purchase of up to million of the company s common stock  which the company completed during in december  the company s board of directors authorized the continuation of the same repurchase program authorizing the purchase of up to an additional million of the company s common stock 
additional uses of cash were for payments under long term debt and capital lease agreements 
proceeds from financing activities were generated by the exercise of stock options and employee stock purchases 
in  cash provided by financing activities of million resulted primarily from net debt borrowings 
the company has a revolving credit agreement the revolver with a syndicate of five banks 
under terms of the revolver  the company may borrow up to million with the ability to increase the borrowing limit by an additional million within three years from the closing date of the revolver october 
the revolver matures on december  at which time a balloon payment for the principal amount is due  however there is no penalty for early prepayment 
the revolver bears interest at a variable rate based on libor 
the interest rate will also vary based on company leverage ratios 
at december  the interest rate was per annum 
the revolver is unsecured but is guaranteed by all of the company s domestic subsidiaries 
at december  there were no borrowings under the revolver 
subsequent to december   the company borrowed million under the revolver to acquire the company s corporate headquarters building 
a significant restrictive covenant under the revolver requires the company to maintain a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio as defined in the agreement 
from time to time  the company engages in discussions regarding restructurings  dispositions  mergers  acquisitions and other similar transactions 
any such transaction could include  among other things  the transfer  sale or acquisition of significant assets  businesses or interests  including joint ventures  or the incurrence  assumption or refinancing of indebtedness  and could be material to the financial condition and results of operations of the company 
there is no assurance that any such discussions will result in the consummation of any such transaction 
in december  the company and state street bank and trust company state street consummated a lease transaction for the company s new corporate headquarters  whereby state street acquired the property at south peoria street  englewood  colorado the property 
simultaneously  state street leased the property to teletech services corporation tsc  a wholly owned subsidiary of the company 
as part of the transaction  state street formed a special purpose entity to purchase the property and hold the associated equity and debt from a group of banks 
the debt held by this entity was approximately million at december  the company s lease on the property had a four year term and expired in december as mentioned above  subsequent to year end  the property lease was terminated when the company purchased the property from state street for million using proceeds from the revolver 
management believes the cash on hand  anticipated cash flows from operations and availability under the revolver are sufficient to fund planned operations for the foreseeable future 
at december   the company had the following contractual obligations amounts in thousands contractual obligations less than year years years over years total long term debt and senior notes    capital lease obligations   operating lease commitments     residual value guarantee on headquarters  total      reflected on accompanying consolidated balance sheets 
not reflected on accompanying consolidated balance sheets 
subsequent to year end  the company repaid the synthetic lease and purchased its headquarters building 
in the first quarter of  the company violated a financial debt covenant in its synthetic lease agreement and revolver that required it to maintain at least one dollar of net income each quarter 
the violation resulted from the goodwill impairment upon adoption of sfas no 
waivers were obtained from both the synthetic lease and revolver lenders  and the new revolver agreement completed in october eliminated the one dollar quarterly net income covenant 
in the fourth quarter of  the company violated two financial debt covenants in its synthetic lease agreement that required it to maintain at least one dollar of net income each quarter and a certain fixed charge coverage ratio 
the violations resulted from the impairment loss the company recorded during the quarter 
in february  the company prepaid  without penalty  the million synthetic lease agreement and cured the default 
also in the fourth quarter  the company failed to meet the fixed charge coverage ratio covenant in its revolver agreement and the fixed charge coverage and leverage ratio covenants in its senior notes agreement and has obtained waivers from both lenders 
there is no assurance that the company will not violate financial covenants in the future and  in the event of a default  no assurance that the company will be successful in obtaining waivers 
client concentrations the company s five largest clients accounted for  and of its revenues for the years ended december   and  respectively 
in addition  these five clients accounted for an even greater proportional share of the company s consolidated earnings 
the profitability of these clients varies greatly based upon the specific contract terms with any particular client  and the relative contribution of any single client to consolidated earnings is not always proportional to the relative revenue contribution on a consolidated basis 
the risk of this concentration is mitigated  in part  by the long term contracts the company has with its largest clients 
the contracts with these clients expire between and additionally  a particular client can have multiple contracts with different expiration dates 
although the company has historically renewed its contracts with its largest customers  there is no assurance that future contracts will be renewed  or if renewed  will be on terms as favorable as the existing contracts 
as with any contract driven business  the company does experience contracts not being renewed in the normal course of its operations 
in these circumstances  the company pursues several alternatives to mitigate the impact including replacing the business with new contracts  improving operating margins through greater efficiencies and achieving other cost reductions 
as previously discussed  the usps did not renew their relationship with the company 
services provided to the usps will ramp down during the first half of revenues from the usps totaled million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the loss of the usps is not expected to have a material adverse effect on the company s operations or financial position 
under the terms of the original contract with verizon relating to its clec business  there were certain minimum monthly volume commitments at pre determined hourly billing rates minimum commitments 
as previously announced  when the clec work was redirected to other verizon business units during  verizon continued to honor the contractual terms of its minimum commitments 
while the terms negotiated by these business units were generally at lower hourly billing rates than the minimum commitments  verizon has continued to meet its financial obligations associated with minimum commitments 
in some instances  volume associated with new work is also offset against the minimum commitments 
in addition  certain minimum commitments were bought out with cash  and these settlement payments have been amortized over the life of such minimum commitments 
with the renewal of the verizon wireless contract in december  and assuming business volume continues at its current rate  our expectation is that the minimum commitments will be satisfied and  accordingly  expire between and the amount of minimum commitments satisfied by verizon in excess of the payments attributed to the new work  together with amortized settlement payments  was million in it is expected that this amount will decline to approximately million in  million in  and will further decrease thereafter 
the loss of the minimum commitments is not expected to have a material adverse effect on the company s operating results or financial position 
the anticipated decline could have an adverse affect on the company s operating results in unless the profits earned from the minimum commitments are replaced with other business of comparable profitability  margins are improved through greater operating efficiencies  and other cost reductions are achieved  all of which are being pursued by management 
critical accounting policies the company has identified the policies below as critical to its business and results of operations 
the impact and any associated risks related to these policies on the company s business is discussed throughout management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations where such policies affect reported and expected financial results 
for a detailed discussion on the application of these and other accounting policies  see note to the consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition 
the revenue recognition policy is significant because revenue is a key component of operating results 
the company follows very specific and detailed guidelines in measuring revenue 
the company recognizes revenue at the time services are performed 
in certain circumstances  the company receives payment in advance of providing service 
accordingly  amounts billed but not earned under these contracts are excluded from revenue and included in customer advances and deferred income 
derivatives 
mitigating economic risk associated with changes in foreign currencies is important to the company 
the ability to qualify for hedge accounting allows the company to match the gains and losses from changes in the fair market value of the derivative securities used for hedging activities with the operating results being hedged 
while the company expects that its derivative instruments will continue to meet the conditions for hedge accounting  if hedges did not qualify as highly effective or if the company did not believe that forecasted transactions would occur  the changes in the fair value of the derivatives used as hedges would be reflected in earnings 
the company does not believe it is exposed to more than a nominal amount of credit risk in its hedging activities  as the counterparties are established  well capitalized financial institutions 
foreign currency translation 
a substantial amount of the company s operations are conducted outside of the united states 
the assets and liabilities of the company s foreign subsidiaries  whose functional currency is other than the us dollar  are translated at the exchange rates in effect on the reporting date  and income and expenses are translated at the weighted average exchange rate during the period 
the net effect of translation gains and losses is not included in determining net income  but is accumulated as a separate component of stockholders equity 
foreign currency transaction gains and losses are included in determining net income 
intercompany loans are generally treated as permanently invested and settlement is not planned or anticipated in the foreseeable future 
contract acquisition costs 
amounts paid to or on behalf of clients to obtain long term contracts are capitalized if incurred within months of commencement of operations and amortized on a straight line basis over the term of the contract as a reduction to revenue commencing with the date of the first revenues from the contract 
in certain circumstances  costs may be estimated at the inception of operations and subsequently revised based on actual costs incurred 
the company s accounting policy is to limit the amount of capitalized costs for a given contract to the lesser of the estimated ongoing future cash flows from the contract or the termination fees the company would receive in the event of early termination of the contract by the customer 
the company s entitlement to termination fees may  however  be subject to challenge if a customer were to allege that the company was in breach of contract 
restructuring and impairment charges 
the company periodically assesses the profitability and utilization of its customer management centers along with the overall profitability of the company 
as a result  the company has historically chosen to close under performing centers and make reductions in force to enhance future profitability 
under the previous accounting guidance  the company recorded the anticipated charges at the time a plan was approved by management or the board of directors 
in june  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities  which specifies that a liability for a cost associated with an exit or disposal activity be recognized when the liability is incurred instead of upon commitment to a plan 
sfas no 
is effective january  additionally  sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  contains a broadened definition of a discontinued operation 
it is possible that future exit or disposal activities of the company could be classified as a discontinued operation which would require restatement of historical financial statements 
the company adopted sfas no 
effective january  the recoverability of goodwill and long lived assets is dependent upon the company s ability to generate sufficient future cash flow 
recent accounting pronouncements in june  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for asset retirement obligations  which establishes accounting standards for recognition and measurement of a liability for an asset retirement obligation and the associated asset retirement cost 
this statement is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after june  management does not believe adoption will have a material effect on the company s financial position 
in april  the fasb issued sfas no 
 recission of fasb statements no 
 and  amendment of fasb statement no 
 and technical corrections  which eliminated inconsistency between required accounting for sale leaseback transactions and the required accounting for certain lease modifications that have economic effects that are similar to sale leaseback transactions 
this statement is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after may  management does not believe adoption will have a material effect on the company s financial position 
in june  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities  which specifies that a liability for a cost associated with an exit or disposal activity be recognized when the liability is incurred instead of recognized at the date of an entity s commitment to an exit plan 
this statement is effective for exit or disposal activities that are initiated after december  management does not believe adoption will have a material effect on the company s financial position 
in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure 
sfas no 
provides alternative methods of transition for a voluntary change to the fair value based method of accounting for stock based employee compensation 
sfas no 
also required that disclosures of the pro forma effect of using the fair value method of accounting for stock based employee compensation be displayed more prominently and in a tabular format 
the company has implemented all required disclosures of sfas in this form k filing 
additionally  sfas no 
requires disclosure of the pro forma effect in interim financial statements 
the transition requirements of sfas no 
are effective for the company s fiscal year the company does not plan to transition to a fair value method of accounting for stock based employee compensation 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk represents the risk of loss that may impact the financial position  results of operations or cash flows of the company due to adverse changes in financial and commodity market prices and rates 
the company is exposed to market risk in the areas of changes in us interest rates  foreign currency exchange rates as measured against the us dollar and changes in the market value of its investment portfolio 
these exposures are directly related to its normal operating and funding activities 
as of december   the company has entered into forward financial instruments to manage and reduce the impact of changes in certain foreign currency rates with several financial institutions 
the company has also entered into an interest rate swap agreement to manage its cash flow risk on the lease for the property as the lease payments are based on variable monthly interest 
interest rate risk the interest on the revolver is variable based on libor and  therefore  affected by changes in market interest rates 
at december   there were no amounts outstanding on the revolver 
foreign currency risk the company has operations in foreign countries 
revenues and expenses from these operations are typically denominated in local currency  thereby creating exposures to changes in exchange rates 
the changes in the exchange rate may positively or negatively affect the company s revenues and net income attributed to these subsidiaries 
for the years ended december   and  revenues from non us countries represented  and of consolidated revenues  respectively 
the company has contracted with several commercial banks to acquire a total of million canadian dollars through november at a fixed price in us dollars of million 
there is no material difference between the fixed exchange ratio and the current exchange ratio of the us canadian dollar 
if the us canadian dollar exchange rates were to change from year end levels  the company would not incur a material loss on the contract 
fair value of debt and equity securities the company s did not have any material investments in debt or equity securities at december
