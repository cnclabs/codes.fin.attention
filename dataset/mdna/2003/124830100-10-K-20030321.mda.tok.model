first  an additional month of operations in related to the jacobs properties combined with improvements in leasing and occupancy at the jacobs properties  contributed million to the increase 
second  the additional nine properties opened or acquired during and contributed million to the increase 
third  continued improvement in leasing and occupancy at existing properties contributed million to the increase 
the above increases include an increase in lease termination fees of million to million in compared to million in these increases were offset by reductions in revenues of million related to the properties sold during and million related to the three properties that were contributed to a joint venture early in management  leasing and development fees increased million in compared to primarily due to growth in management and leasing fees from unconsolidated affiliates that were acquired in the jacobs transaction and from an unconsolidated affiliate that began operations during interest and other revenues increased million due to growth in certain operations of the company s taxable reit subsidiaries

depreciation and amortization expense increased by million due to the additional month related to the jacobs properties and million related to the other nine properties opened or acquired during and these increases were offset by a total of million related to both the properties sold during and the three properties contributed to a joint venture 
the increase is also attributable to depreciation on the capital expenditures made during and in connection with the company s ongoing renovations and expansions of existing properties to maintain their competitive positions in their respective trade areas 
general and administrative expenses increased million  primarily due to additional salaries and benefits for the personnel added to manage the properties acquired during and increased professional fees and the costs to move the company to its new corporate headquarters also contributed to the increase 
interest expense decreased million due primarily to reductions of debt with net proceeds of million from the march common stock offering and net proceeds of million from the june preferred stock offering 
gain on sales of real estate assets the net gain on sales of million in was related to total gains of million on seven outparcel sales and total losses of million on three outparcel sales

therefore  the results of operations for reflect a significant increase when compared to the results of operations for the company disposed of six properties during and properties during  which offsets the increases from the acquisitions and openings discussed above

revenues approximately million of the increase was attributable to the properties acquired from jacobs that are accounted for on a consolidated basis 
approximately million of the increase resulted from the other eight new properties opened or acquired during and these increases were offset by a decrease in revenues of million related to the properties sold during and improved occupancies  improved operations and increased rents in the company s operating portfolio generated approximately million of the increase in revenues 
additionally  lease termination fees increased by million to million in from million in interest and other revenues increased primarily due to growth in certain operations of the company s taxable reit subsidiary  which contributed million to the increase 
expenses property operating expenses  including real estate taxes and maintenance and repairs  increased in as a result of the new properties opened or acquired during and the company s cost recovery ratio  not including bad debt expense of million  was in compared with in due to decreases in occupancy and the bankruptcy of tenants who were replaced on a short term basis with tenants whose recovery clauses are more restrictive

gain on sales of real estate assets gain on sales includes million of gains related to six community centers that were sold in additional gains were generated by sales of outparcels including sales at the lakes mall in muskegon  mi  which opened in august equity in earnings of unconsolidated affiliates the increase in equity in earnings was the result of acquiring a non controlling interest in four malls and one associated center in three partnerships from jacobs 
all of these are accounted for using the equity method of accounting 
the increase was offset by decreases resulting from the cessation of operations at parkway place in huntsville  al  while it was redeveloped  and by the acquisition of the remaining ownership interest in madison square mall in huntsville  al 
since the company now owns a interest in madison square mall  its results have been included in the consolidated financial statements since the date the remaining interest was acquired 
extraordinary loss extraordinary loss increased since the company retired more higher interest rate debt subject to prepayment penalties in than it did in the extraordinary loss in consisted of prepayment penalties of million and the write off of unamortized deferred financing costs of million 
performance measurements the shopping center business is  to some extent  seasonal in nature with tenants achieving the highest levels of sales during the fourth quarter because of the holiday season 
the malls earn most of their temporary rents rents from short term tenants  during the holiday period 
thus  occupancy levels and revenue production are generally the highest in the fourth quarter of each year 
results of operations realized in any one quarter may not be indicative of the results likely to be experienced over the course of the fiscal year 
the company classifies its regional malls into two categories malls that have completed their initial lease up stabilized malls and malls that are in their initial lease up phase non stabilized malls 
the non stabilized mall category currently includes springdale mall  a redevelopment project in mobile  al  arbor place mall in atlanta douglasville  ga  which opened in october  the lakes mall in muskegon  mi  which opened in august  and parkway place in huntsville  al  which opened in october and is owned in a joint venture with a third party

cash flows cash provided by operating activities increased million due to i one additional month of operations for the properties acquired from jacobs on january   ii the addition of the nine new properties opened or acquired since february and iii the acquisitions of additional interests in columbia place during these increases were offset by reductions in results of operations related to the properties that have been sold since february and the three properties in which the company contributed of its interest to a joint venture

three community centers and the office building were sold for a gain and two community centers were sold at a loss 
in addition  the company sold seven outparcels for gains and two outparcels and a department store building for losses  which resulted in a net gain of million in other capital expenditures the company prepares an annual capital expenditure budget for each property that is intended to provide for all necessary recurring and non recurring capital improvements 
the company believes that its operating cash flows  which include reimbursements from tenants  will provide the necessary funding for such capital improvements 
these cash flows will be sufficient to cover tenant finish costs associated with renewing or replacing current tenant leases as their leases expire and capital expenditures that will not be reimbursed by tenants 
including its share of unconsolidated affiliates capital expenditures  the company spent million in for tenant allowances  which generate increased rents from these tenants over the terms of their leases 
deferred maintenance expenditures  a majority of which are recovered from the tenants  were million for deferred maintenance expenditures included million for resurfacing and improved lighting of parking lots  million for roof repairs and replacements and million for various other expenditures 
renovation expenditures were million in  a portion of which is recovered from tenants 
deferred maintenance expenditures are billed to tenants as common area maintenance expense  and most are recovered over a to year period

other the company believes the properties are in compliance  in all material respects  with federal  state and local ordinances and regulations regarding the handling  discharge and emission of hazardous or toxic substances 
the company has not been notified by any governmental authority  and is not otherwise aware  of any material noncompliance  liability or claim relating to hazardous or toxic substances in connection with any of its present or former properties 
therefore  the company has not recorded any material liability in connection with environmental matters 
critical accounting policies a critical accounting policy is one that is both important to the presentation of a company s financial condition and results of operations and requires significant judgment or complex estimation processes 
the company believes that its most significant accounting policies are those related to its accounting for the development of real estate assets and evaluating long lived assets for impairment 
the company capitalizes predevelopment project costs paid to third parties 
all previously capitalized predevelopment costs are expensed when it is no longer probable that the project will be completed 
once development of a project commences  all direct costs incurred to construct the project  including interest and real estate taxes are capitalized 
additionally  certain general and administrative expenses are allocated to the projects and capitalized based on the personnel assigned to the development project  and the investment in the project relative to all development projects 
once a project is completed and placed in service  it is depreciated over its estimated useful life 
buildings and improvements are depreciated generally over years and leasehold improvements are amortized over the lives of the applicable leases or the estimated useful life of the assets  whichever is shorter 
ordinary repairs and maintenance are expensed as incurred 
major replacements and improvements are capitalized and depreciated over their estimated useful lives 
the company periodically evaluates its real estate assets to determine if there has been any impairment in their carrying values and records impairment losses if the undiscounted cash flows estimated to be generated by those assets are less than the assets carrying amounts or if there are other indicators of impairment 
at december   the company did not own any real estate assets that were impaired 
recent accounting pronouncements as described in note to the consolidated financial statements  the financial accounting standards board has issued certain statements  which are effective beginning in impact of inflation in the last three years  inflation has not had a significant impact on the company because of the relatively low inflation rate 
substantially all tenant leases do  however  contain provisions designed to protect the company from the impact of inflation 
these provisions include clauses enabling the company to receive percentage rent based on tenants gross sales  which generally increase as prices rise  and or escalation clauses  which generally increase rental rates during the terms of the leases 
in addition  many of the leases are for terms of less than years which may enable the company to replace existing leases with new leases at higher base and or percentage rent if rents of the existing leases are below the then existing market rate 
most of the leases require the tenants to pay their share of operating expenses  including common area maintenance  real estate taxes and insurance  which reduces the company s exposure to increases in costs and operating expenses resulting from inflation 
funds from operations funds from operations ffo is defined by the national association of real estate investment trusts nareit as net income computed in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states excluding gains or losses on sales of operating properties  plus depreciation and amortization  and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures 
adjustments for ffo from unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures are calculated on the same basis 
the company defines ffo available for distribution to common shareholders as defined above by nareit less preferred dividends and gains or losses on outparcel sales 
the company computes ffo in accordance with the nareit recommendation concerning finance costs and non real estate depreciation 
the company s method of calculating ffo may be different from methods used by other reits and  accordingly  may not be comparable to such other reits 
the company believes that ffo provides an additional indicator of the financial performance of the properties 
the use of ffo as an indicator of financial performance is influenced not only by the operations of the properties and interest rates  but also by the capital structures of the company and the operating partnership 
accordingly  ffo will be one of the significant factors considered by the board of directors in determining the amount of cash distributions the operating partnership will make to its partners  including the reit 
ffo does not represent cash flow from operations as defined by accounting principles generally accepted in the united states  is not necessarily indicative of cash available to fund all cash flow needs and should not be considered as an alternative to net income for purposes of evaluating the company s operating performance or to cash flow as a measure of liquidity 
ffo increased in by million  or  to million compared to million in the increase in ffo is primarily attributable to reduced interest expense  the results of operations of the properties added to the portfolio and a full twelve months of operations for the properties acquired from jacobs compared to eleven months in these increases were offset by reductions related to operating properties that were sold or contributed to a joint venture 
additionally  lease termination fees were million more in as compared to ffo would have increased by million and million in and  respectively  if the company included outparcel sales in its computation of ffo 
the company s calculation of ffo is as follows in thousands year ended december  net income available to common shareholders   add depreciation and amortization from consolidated properties   depreciation and amortization from unconsolidated affiliates   depreciation and amortization from discontinued operations  minority interest in earnings of operating partnership   extraordinary loss on extinguishment of debt   less minority investors share of depreciation and amortization in shopping center properties   gain on disposal of discontinued operations depreciation and amortization of non real estate assets gain on sales of real estate assets   funds from operations   item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company has exposure to interest rate risk on its debt obligations and interest rate instruments 
based on the company s share of consolidated and unconsolidated variable rate debt in place at december   excluding debt fixed using an interest rate swap agreement  a increase or decrease in interest rates on this variable rate debt would increase or decrease cash flows by approximately million and  due to the effect of capitalized interest  annual earnings by approximately million
