overview national instruments designs  develops  manufactures and markets instrumentation and automation software and hardware for general commercial  industrial and scientific applications 
the company offers hundreds of products used to create virtual instrumentation systems for measurement and automation 
the company has identified a large and diverse market for test and measurement t m and industrial automation ia applications 
the company s products are used in a variety of applications from research and development to production testing  monitoring and industrial control 
in test and measurement applications  the company s products can be used to monitor and control traditional instruments or to create computer based instruments that can replace traditional instruments 
in industrial automation applications  the company s products can be used in the same ways as in test and measurement and can also be used to integrate measurement functionality with process automation capabilities 
the company sells to a large number of customers in a wide variety of industries 
no single customer accounted for more than of the company s sales in  or the company has been profitable in every year since however  there can be no assurance that the company s net sales will grow or that the company will remain profitable in future periods 
as a result  the company believes historical results of operations should not be relied upon as indications of future performance 
results of operations the following table sets forth  for the periods indicated  the percentage of net sales represented by certain items reflected in the company s consolidated statements of income years ended december  net sales north america europe asia pacific consolidated net sales cost of sales gross profit operating expenses sales and marketing research and development general and administrative total operating expenses operating income other income expense interest income interest expense net foreign exchange loss and other income before income taxes provision for income taxes net income net sales 
in  net sales for the company s products were million  a increase from the level achieved in  which followed a decrease in net sales of in from the level achieved in the company believes the increase in sales in is primarily attributable to the introduction of new and upgraded products and an increased market acceptance of the company s products in asia 
the company believes the decrease in sales in was primarily attributable to the approximate decline in the sales of certain hardware products that are used to control traditional instruments  which resulted from the worsening of the industrial economy and the severe deterioration of sales of traditional instruments by other vendors used in test and measurement applications 
north american revenue was million in  flat with  following a decrease in from european revenue was million in  a decrease of from  following a decrease in from asia pacific revenue grew to million in  which followed a increase in over levels 
the company believes that approximately of the decrease in revenue in europe in is attributable to the decrease in sales of the company s hardware products that are used to control traditional instruments  the result of the downturn in the industrial economy  and that approximately of the decrease in revenue in europe is due to the weakening of the company s euro exchange rate 
see the discussion below for more information concerning the impact of foreign currency fluctuations on sales growth 
the company believes that approximately of the increase in sales and in the revenue growth rate in asia pacific in is attributable to the introduction of new and upgraded products  an expanded customer base  an increased field sales force  and approximately of the increase is attributable to the company s favorable hedge position with regard to the japanese yen 
international sales sales to customers outside of north america accounted for  and of the company s consolidated net sales for  and  respectively 
the company intends to continue to expand its international operations by increasing its presence in existing markets  adding a market presence in some new geographical markets and continuing the use of distributors to sell its products in some countries 
sales made by the company s direct sales offices in europe and asia pacific are denominated in local currencies  and accordingly  the us dollar equivalent of these sales is affected by changes in the weighted average value of the us dollar 
this weighted average is calculated as the percentage change in the value of the currency relative to the us dollar  multiplied by the proportion of international sales recorded in the particular currency 
between and  this weighted average value of the us dollar decreased by  causing an equivalent increase in the us dollar value of the company s foreign currency sales and expenses 
if the weighted average value of the us dollar during had been the same as that in  on a pro forma basis  the company s sales for would have been flat with sales from pro forma european sales for would have decreased by from sales 
pro forma asia pacific sales for would have increased by over sales 
since most of the company s international operating expenses are also incurred in local currencies  the change in exchange rates had the effect of increasing operating expenses million in the preceding pro forma amounts and percentages are not presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles but are presented for comparative purposes 
gross profit 
as a percentage of sales  gross profit represented  and in  and  respectively 
the relatively high software content of the company s products is demonstrated in the gross margins achieved by the company 
in  the lower margin is attributable to the reduced sales of certain hardware products that are used to control traditional instruments and an increase in the company s overall manufacturing costs due to the ramp up of the company s hungarian production facility 
there can be no assurance that the company will maintain its historical margins 
the company believes its current manufacturing capacity is adequate to meet current needs 
sales and marketing 
sales and marketing expense in was flat with  which followed a decrease of in from sales and marketing personnel increased by during from  at december  to  at december  sales and marketing expense as a percentage of revenue was in  down from in and up from in the company expects sales and marketing expenses in future periods to increase in absolute dollars  and to fluctuate as a percentage of sales based on recruiting  initial marketing and advertising campaign costs associated with major new product releases and entry into new market areas  investment in web sales and marketing efforts  increasing product demonstration costs and the timing of domestic and international conferences and trade shows 
research and development 
research and development expense in increased compared to following an increase of in over the increase in research and development costs in absolute amounts in each period was primarily due to increases in personnel costs from hiring of additional product development engineers 
research and development personnel increased from at december  to at december  the company plans to continue making a significant investment in research and development in order to remain competitive and support revenue growth 
the company capitalizes software development costs in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for the costs of computer software to be sold  leased  or otherwise marketed 
the company amortizes such costs over the related product s estimated economic useful life  generally three years  beginning when a product becomes available for general release 
software amortization expense totaled million  million and million during  and  respectively 
software development costs capitalized during such years were million  million and million  respectively 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements for a description of intangibles 
general and administrative 
general and administrative expenses in increased from  which followed a decrease of in from the increase in general and administrative expenses in from is attributable to increased litigation costs of million associated with a legal action brought by the company against the mathworks  inc in to enforce the company s intellectual property rights  compared to a gain of approximately million in recorded upon the settlement of a previous case with cognex corporation 
the company expects to continue to incur significant litigation expenses in related to patent litigation with the mathworks 
a significant amount of the decrease in general and administrative costs in was due to reduced intellectual property defense costs  the result of the net recovery of million of intellectual property defense costs accrued in the prior year  and to operational efficiencies resulting from continued systems improvement 
implementation of information systems to support the company s new research and development facility  upgrading its worldwide business applications suite to oracle s latest web based release i and continued investment in the company s web presence were the main areas of focus for investment in the information systems department in general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenue increased to during from during the company expects that general and administrative costs will increase in absolute amounts and will fluctuate as a percentage of revenue as the company continues to invest in maintaining its existing systems  protecting its intellectual property  developing the infrastructure for the new hungarian manufacturing facility  and developing web based commerce and management information systems 
during the fourth quarter of  the company and trilogy software  inc trilogy settled a dispute regarding trilogy s buy out of the lease of the company s millenium office building which resulted in a gain of approximately million from lease termination 
as a result of additional facility lease consolidation  the company incurred lease termination costs of approximately million in the fourth quarter of in the fourth quarter of  the company contributed approximately milion to the national instruments foundation  a c charitable foundation established in for the purpose of continued promotion of scientific and engineering research and education at higher education institutions worldwide 
two of the four directors of the national instruments foundation are current officers of national instruments 
interest income and expense 
interest income decreased in from  which followed a decrease of in from the decrease in interest income in was primarily due to lower yields on the company s investments 
the primary source of interest income is from the investment of the company s cash 
net cash provided by operating activities in totaled million 
net foreign exchange gain loss 
the company experienced net foreign exchange losses of  in  compared to losses of million in and losses of million in these results are attributable to movements between the us dollar and the local currencies in countries in which the company s subsidiaries are located 
the company recognizes the local currency as the functional currency of its international subsidiaries 
the company utilizes foreign currency forward contracts to hedge a majority of its foreign currency denominated receivables in order to reduce its exposure to significant foreign currency fluctuations 
the company typically limits the duration of its receivables foreign currency forward contracts to days 
the company also utilizes foreign currency forward contracts and foreign currency purchased option contracts in order to reduce its exposure to fluctuations in future foreign currency cash flows 
the company purchases these contracts for up to of its forecasted cash flows in selected currencies primarily the euro  yen and pound sterling and limits the duration of these contracts to months 
the foreign currency purchased option contracts are purchased at the money or out of the money 
as a result  the company s hedging activities only partially address its risks in foreign currency transactions  and there can be no assurance that this strategy will be successful 
the company does not invest in contracts for speculative purposes 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements for a description of the company s forward and purchased option contracts and hedged positions 
the company s hedging strategy increased the foreign exchange loss for december  by million and reduced the net foreign exchange loss for december  by million 
provision for income taxes 
the provision for income taxes reflects an effective tax rate of in and in and the decrease in the effective rate resulted from income tax benefits attributable to the extraterritorial income exclusion and a change in the distrubion of income among taxing jurisdictions  particularly the impact of the company s new manufacturing facility in hungary 
the effective tax rate is lower than the us federal statutory rate of primarily as a result of the extraterritorial income exclusion  tax exempt interest and reduced tax rates in certain foreign jurisdictions 
liquidity and capital resources the company is currently financing its operations and capital expenditures through cash flow from operations 
at december   the company had working capital of approximately million compared to million at december accounts receivable increased to million at december  from million at december   as a result of higher sales levels in the fourth quarter of compared to the fourth quarter of receivable days outstanding at december  increased to days from days at december  consolidated inventory balances have increased to million at december  from million at december  the increase in inventory was due to the planned increase in finished goods and safety stock inventory which enabled the company to reduce delivery time of products to customers thereby increasing customer satisfaction 
inventory turns of per year for represent a decrease from turns of per year for cash used in includes million for the purchase of property and equipment  million for the repurchase of approximately  shares of common stock and million for capitalization of software development costs 
during  the company completed construction of  and moved into a  sq 
ft 
office building mopac c located on its north austin campus 
the total cost for the new building  including furniture  fixtures and equipment was approximately million 
the company consolidated its leaseholds upon completion of its move into mopac c during the fourth quarter of all the company s buildings are free from lien 
the company currently expects to fund expenditures for capital requirements as well as liquidity needs created by changes in working capital from a combination of available cash and short term investment balances and internally generated funds 
the company estimates that its budgeted capital expenditures over the next fiscal year will be approximately million 
as of december   the company had no debt outstanding 
the company believes that the cash flow from operations  if any  existing cash balances and short term investments  will be sufficient to meet its cash requirements for at least the next twelve months 
cash requirements for periods beyond the next twelve months will depend on the company s profitability  its ability to manage working capital requirements and its rate of growth 
the following summarizes the company s contractual cash obligations as of december  in thousands payments due by period total beyond long term debt capital lease obligations operating leases    other long term obligations total contractual cash obligations    the following summarizes the company s other commercial commitments as of december  in thousands amount of commitment expiration by period total beyond guarantees   other commercial commitments   total commercial commitments   financial risk management the company s international sales are subject to inherent risks  including fluctuations in local economies  difficulties in staffing and managing foreign operations  greater difficulty in accounts receivable collection  costs and risks of localizing products for foreign countries  unexpected changes in regulatory requirements  tariffs and other trade barriers  difficulties in the repatriation of earnings and burdens of complying with a wide variety of foreign laws 
the company s sales outside of north america are denominated in local currencies  and accordingly  the company is subject to the risks associated with fluctuations in currency rates 
in particular  increases in the value of the dollar against foreign currencies decrease the us dollar value of foreign sales requiring the company either to increase its price in the local currency  which could render the company s product prices noncompetitive  or to suffer reduced revenues and gross margins as measured in us dollars 
these dynamics have adversely affected revenue growth in international markets in previous years 
the company s foreign currency hedging program includes both foreign currency forward and purchased option contracts to reduce the effect of exchange rate fluctuations 
however  the hedging program will not eliminate all of the company s foreign exchange risks 
see net foreign exchange gain loss and note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
the marketplace for the company s products dictates that many of the company s products be shipped very quickly after an order is received 
as a result  the company is required to maintain significant inventories 
therefore  inventory obsolescence is a risk for the company due to frequent engineering changes  shifting customer demand  the emergence of new industry standards and rapid technological advances including the introduction by the company or its competitors of products embodying new technology 
while the company maintains valuation allowances for excess and obsolete inventories and management continues to monitor the adequacy of such valuation allowances  there can be no assurance that such valuation allowances will be sufficient 
the company has no debt or off balance sheet debt 
as of december   the company has non cancelable operating lease obligations of approximately million and contractual purchase commitments with various suppliers of general components and customized inventory components of approximately million 
as of december   the company has outstanding guarantees for payment of foreign operating leases  customs and foreign grants totaling approximately million 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
at december   the company did not have any relationships with any unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships  such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities  which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes 
as such  the company is not exposed to any financing  liquidity  market or credit risk that could arise if the company were engaged in such relationships 
market risk the company is exposed to a variety of risks  including foreign currency fluctuations and changes in the market value of its investments 
in the normal course of business  the company employs established policies and procedures to manage its exposure to fluctuations in foreign currency values and changes in the market value of its investments 
foreign currency hedging activities 
the company s objective in managing its exposure to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations is to reduce the impact of adverse fluctuations in such exchange rates on the company s earnings and cash flow 
accordingly  the company utilizes purchased foreign currency option contracts and forward contracts to hedge its exposure on anticipated transactions and firm commitments 
the principal currencies hedged are the euro  british pound and japanese yen 
the company monitors its foreign exchange exposures regularly to ensure the overall effectiveness of its foreign currency hedge positions 
however  there can be no assurance the company s foreign currency hedging activities will substantially offset the impact of fluctuations in currency exchange rates on its results of operations and financial position 
based on the foreign exchange instruments outstanding at december   an adverse change defined as in the asian currencies and in all other currencies in exchange rates would result in a decline in the aggregate fair market value of all instruments outstanding of approximately million 
however  as the company utilizes foreign currency instruments for hedging anticipated and firmly committed transactions  management believes that a loss in fair value for those instruments will be substantially offset by increases in the value of the underlying exposure 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements for a description of the company s financial instruments at december  and short term investments 
the fair value of the company s investments in marketable securities at december  was million 
investments with maturities beyond one year may be classified as short term based on their highly liquid nature and because such marketable securities represent the investment of cash that is available for current operations 
the company s investment policy is to manage its investment portfolio to preserve principal and liquidity while maximizing the return on the investment portfolio through the full investment of available funds 
the company diversifies the marketable securities portfolio by investing in multiple types of investment grade securities 
the company s investment portfolio is primarily invested in short term securities with at least an investment grade rating to minimize interest rate and credit risk as well as to provide for an immediate source of funds 
based on the company s investment portfolio and interest rates at december   a basis point increase or decrease in interest rates would result in a decrease or increase of approximately  respectively  in the fair value of the investment portfolio 
although changes in interest rates may affect the fair value of the investment portfolio and cause unrealized gains or losses  such gains or losses would not be realized unless the investments are sold 
non audit services prior to adoption of the sarbanes oxley act of  the company s audit committee modified its charter to require pre approval of all non audit services by its auditor  pricewaterhousecoopers llp including the following tax research and consultations  international tax consulting  tax assistance and compliance in international locations  assistance with transfer pricing  expatriate tax services  consultations and assistance with other taxes including state and local taxes  sales and use taxes  customs and duties  review of intercompany agreements  and assistance with international manufacturing tax issues 
the company is currently monitoring the developments regarding new regulations as a result of the recent adoption of the sarbanes oxley act of  and will comply with any new requirements

 interim financial reporting  to require disclosure in the summary of significant accounting policies of the effects of an entity s accounting policy with respect to stock based employee compensation on reported net income and earnings per share in annual and interim financial statements 
the adoption of sfas no 
did not have a material effect on the company s financial position or results of operations 
critical accounting policies the company s critical accounting policies are as follows o revenue recognition revenue from the sale and licensing of products is generally recognized on the date the product is shipped to the customer 
revenue related to the sale of maintenance contracts is deferred and amortized on a straight line basis over the service period 
o estimating allowances  specifically sales returns  the allowance for doubtful accounts and the valuation allowance for excess and obsolete inventories the preparation of financial statements requires the company to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amount of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reported period 
specifically  the company must make estimates of potential future product returns related to current period product revenue 
management analyzes historical returns  current economic trends  and changes in customer demand and acceptance of our products when evaluating the adequacy of the sales returns and other allowances 
significant management judgments and estimates must be made and used in connection with establishing the sales returns and other allowances in any accounting period 
the allowance for sales returns was million at december  material differences may result in the amount and timing of the company s revenue for any period if management made different judgments or utilized different estimates 
similarly  our management must make estimates of the uncollectability of our accounts receivables 
management specifically analyzes accounts receivable and analyzes historical bad debts  customer concentrations  customer credit worthiness and current economic trends when evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts 
the allowance for doubtful accounts was million at december  the company writes down its inventory for estimated obsolescence or unmarketable inventory equal to the difference between the cost of inventory and estimated market value based on assumptions on future demands and market conditions 
the valuation allowance for excess and obsolete inventories was million at december  if actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management  additional inventory write downs may be required 
o accounting for costs of computer software the company capitalizes costs related to the development and acquisition of certain software products 
capitalization of costs begins when technological feasibility has been established and ends when the product is available for general release to customers 
amortization is computed on an individual product basis for those products available for market and has been recognized based on the product s estimated economic life  generally three years 
at each balance sheet date  the unamortized costs are reviewed by management and reduced to net realized value when necessary 
as of december   unamortized capitalized software development costs was million 
o valuation of long lived and intangible assets the company assesses the impairement of identifiable intangibles  long lived assets and related goodwill whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
factors considered important which could trigger an impairment review include the following o significant underperformance relative to expected historical or projected future operating results  o significant changes in the manner of the company s use of the acquired assets or the strategy for the overall business  o significant negative industry or economic trends  o the company s market capitalization relative to net book value 
when it is determined that the carrying value of intangibles  long lived assets and related goodwill may not be recoverable based upon the existence of one or more of the above indicators of impairment  the measurement of any impairment is determined and the carrying value is reduced as appropriate 
as of december   the company had net goodwill of approximately million 
factors affecting the company s business us global economic slowdown 
as occurred in and  the markets in which the company does business could again experience the negative effects of a slowdown in the us and or global economies 
the company could also be subject to or impacted by acts of terriorism and or the effects that a war or us military action would have on the us and or global economies 
the worsening of the us or global economies could result in reduced purchasing and capital spending in any of the markets served by the company which could have a material adverse effect on the company s operating results 
budgets 
the company has established an operating budget for the company s spending for could exceed this budget due to a number of factors  including additional marketing costs for conferences and tradeshows  increased costs from the over hiring of product development engineers or other personnel  increased manufacturing costs resulting from component supply shortages and or component price fluctuations  additional litigation expenses related to intellectual property litigation 
any future decreased demand for our products could result in decreased revenue and could require the company to revise its budget and reduce expenditures 
exceeding the established operating budget or failing to revise its budget in response to any decrease in revenue could have a material adverse effect on the company s operating results 
risk of component shortages 
as has occurred in the past  and as may be expected to occur in the future  supply shortages of components used in our products  including sole source components  can result in significant additional costs and inefficiencies in manufacturing 
if the company is unsuccessful in resolving any such component shortages  it will experience a significant impact on the timing of revenue and or an increase in manufacturing costs  either of which would have a material adverse impact on the company s operating results 
fluctuations in quarterly results 
the company s quarterly operating results have fluctuated in the past and may fluctuate significantly in the future due to a number of factors  including changes in the mix of products sold  the availability and pricing of components from third parties especially sole sources  the timing of orders  level of pricing of international sales  fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates  the difficulty in maintaining margins  including the higher margins traditionally achieved in international sales  and changes in pricing policies by the company  its competitors or suppliers 
specifically  if the local currencies in which the company sells weaken against the us dollar  and if the local sales prices cannot be raised  the company will experience a deterioration of its gross and net profit margins 
if the us dollar strengthens in the future  it could have a material adverse effect on gross and net profit margins 
as has occurred in the past and as may be expected to occur in the future  new software products of the company or new operating systems of third parties on which the company s products are based  often contain bugs or errors that can result in reduced sales and or cause the company s support costs to increase  either of which could have a material adverse impact on the company s operating results 
furthermore  the company has significant revenues from customers in industries such as semiconductors  automated test equipment  telecommunications  aerospace  defense and automotive which are cyclical in nature 
downturns in these industries could have a material adverse effect on the company s operating results 
in recent years  with the exception of  the company s revenues have been characterized by seasonality  with revenues typically being relatively constant in the first  second and third quarters  growing in the fourth quarter and being relatively flat or declining from the fourth quarter of the year to the first quarter of the following year 
the company believes the seasonality of its revenue results from the international mix of its revenue and the variability of the budgeting and purchasing cycles of its customers throughout each international region 
in addition  total operating expenses have in the past tended to be higher in the second and third quarters of each year  due to recruiting and significantly increased intern personnel expenses 
new product introductions and market acceptance 
the market for the company s products is characterized by rapid technological change  evolving industry standards  changes in customer needs and frequent new product introductions  and is therefore highly dependent upon timely product innovation 
the company s success is dependent in part on its ability to successfully develop and introduce new and enhanced products on a timely basis to replace declining revenues from older products  and on increasing penetration in domestic and international markets 
in the past  the company has experienced significant delays between the announcement and the commercial availability of new products 
any significant delay in releasing new products could have a material adverse effect on the ultimate success of a product and other related products and could impede continued sales of predecessor products  any of which could have a material adverse effect on the company s operating results 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to introduce new products in accordance with announced release dates  that new products will achieve market acceptance or that any such acceptance will be sustained for any significant period 
failure of new products to achieve or sustain market acceptance could have a material adverse effect on the company s operating results 
moreover  there can be no assurance that the company s international sales will continue at existing levels or grow in accordance with the company s efforts to increase foreign market penetration 
risks associated with increased development of web site 
the company has devoted significant resources in developing its web site as a key marketing and sales tool and expects to continue to do so in the future 
there can be no assurance that the company will be successful in its attempt to leverage the web to increase sales 
the company hosts its web site internally 
failure to successfully maintain the web site and to protect it from hackers could have a significant adverse impact on the company s operating results 
operation in intensely competitive markets 
the markets in which the company operates are characterized by intense competition from numerous competitors  some of which are divisions of large corporations having far greater resources than the company  and the company expects to face further competition from new market entrants in the future 
a key competitor is agilent technologies inc agilent 
agilent offers its own line of instrument controllers  and also offers hardware and software add on products for third party desktop computers and workstations that provide solutions that directly compete with the company s virtual instrumentation products 
agilent is aggressively advertising and marketing products that are competitive with the company s products 
because of agilent s strong position in the instrumentation business  changes in its marketing strategy or product offerings could have a material adverse effect on the company s operating results 
the company believes its ability to compete successfully depends on a number of factors both within and outside its control  including new product introductions by competitors  product pricing  quality and performance  success in developing new products  adequate manufacturing capacity and supply of components and materials  efficiency of manufacturing operations  effectiveness of sales and marketing resources and strategies  strategic relationships with other suppliers  timing of new product introductions by the company  protection of the company s products by effective use of intellectual property laws  general market and economic conditions  and government actions throughout the world 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to compete successfully in the future 
management information systems 
during  the company devoted significant resources to implementing information systems to support its new research and development facility on its austin campus 
the company also devoted significant resources to upgrading its japanese office s business applications suite to oralcle s latest web based release i  and to continued development of web offerings 
in  the company will be focusing on upgrading its us office s business applications suite to oracle s latest web based release i  and will continue to devote significant resources to the development of the web 
failure to successfully implement these initiatives could have a material adverse effect on the company s operating results 
the company relies on three primary regional centers for its management information systems 
as with any information system  unforeseen issues may arise that could affect management s ability to receive adequate  accurate and timely financial information  which in turn could inhibit effective and timely decisions 
furthermore  it is possible that one or more of the company s three regional information systems could experience a complete or partial shutdown 
if such a shutdown occurred near the end of a quarter it could impact the company s product shipments and revenues  as product distribution is heavily dependent on the integrated management information systems in each region 
accordingly  operating results in that quarter would be adversely impacted 
the company is working to achieve reliable regional management information systems to control costs and improve the ability to deliver its products in substantially all of its direct markets worldwide 
no assurance can be given that the company s efforts will be successful 
the failure to receive adequate  accurate and timely financial information could inhibit management s ability to make effective and timely decisions 
risks associated with international operations and foreign economies 
international sales are subject to inherent risks  including fluctuations in local economies  difficulties in staffing and managing foreign operations  greater difficulty in accounts receivable collection  costs and risks of localizing products for foreign countries  unexpected changes in regulatory requirements  tariffs and other trade barriers  difficulties in the repatriation of earnings and the burdens of complying with a wide variety of foreign laws 
the company must also comply with various import and export regulations 
failure to ensure compliance with these regulations could result in fines and or termination of import and export privileges  which could have a material adverse effect on the company s operating results 
additionally  the regulatory environment in some countries is very restrictive as their governments try to protect their local economy and value of their local currency against the us dollar 
sales made by the company s international direct sales offices are denominated in local currencies  and accordingly  the us dollar equivalent of these sales is affected by changes in the weighted average value of the us dollar 
this weighted average is calculated as the percentage change in the value of the currency relative to the dollar  multiplied by the proportion of international sales recorded in the particular currency 
between and  the weighted average value of the us dollar decreased by  causing an equivalent increase in the us dollar value of the company s foreign currency sales and expenses 
if the weighted average value during had been the same as that in  on a pro forma basis  the company s sales for would have been flat with sales from if the weighted average value during had been the same as that in  on a pro forma basis  the company s consolidated operating expenses would have been million  representing a decrease of million 
if the us dollar strengthens in the future  it could have a materially adverse effect on the company s operating results 
as of december   the company has million of deferred gains on yen foreign currency cash flow hedge contracts recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income that are expected to be reclassified into earnings over the next months 
if the yen fails to strengthen before the expiration of these contracts  and if the company is unable to increase prices in japan and or globally  the company will experience a deterioration of revenue and gross and net profit margins  which could have a material adverse effect on the company s operating results 
expansion of manufacturing capacity 
during  the company completed construction of a second manufacturing facility 
this facility is located in hungary and became operational in the fourth quarter of this facility sources a significant portion of the company s sales 
currently the company is continuing to recruit and train the local work force and is continuing to develop and implement information systems to support its operation 
this facility and its operation are also subject to risks associated with a new manufacturing facility and with doing business internationally  including difficulty in managing manufacturing operations in a foreign country  difficulty in achieving or maintaining product quality  interruption to transportation flows for delivery of components to us and finished goods to our customers  and changes in the country s political or economic conditions 
no assurance can be given that the company s efforts will be successful 
accordingly  failure to deal with these factors could result in interruption in the facility s operation or delays in expanding its capacity  either of which could have a material adverse effect on the company s operating results 
income tax rate 
the company established a manufacturing facility in hungary in as a result of certain foreign investment incentives available under hungarian law  the profit from the company s hungarian operation is currently exempt from income tax 
these benefits may not be available in the future due to changes in hungary s political condition and or tax laws

the company receives a substantial income tax benefit from the extraterritorial income exemption eti under us law 
the eti rules provide that a percentage of the profits from products and intangibles exported from the us are exempt from us tax 
this benefit may not be available in the future as the eti has been ruled an illegal export subsidy by the world trade organization 
the repeal of the eti would result in the elimination of this tax benefit thereby increasing the company s future effective income tax rate  which could have a material adverse effect on the company s operating results 
products dependent on certain industries 
sales of the company s products are dependent on customers in certain industries  particularly the telecommunications  semiconductor  automotive  automated test equipment  defense and aerospace industries 
as experienced in the past  and as may be expected to occur in the future  downturns characterized by diminished product demand in any one or more of these industries could result in decreased sales  which could have a material adverse effect on the company s operating results 
dependence on key suppliers 
the company s manufacturing processes use large volumes of high quality components and subassemblies supplied by outside sources 
several of these components are available through sole or limited sources 
sole source components purchased by the company include custom application specific integrated circuits asics and other components 
the company has in the past experienced delays and quality problems in connection with sole source components  and there can be no assurance that these problems will not recur in the future 
accordingly  the failure to receive sole source components from suppliers could result in a material adverse effect on the company s revenues and operating results

proprietary rights and intellectual property litigation 
the company s success depends on its ability to obtain and maintain patents and other proprietary rights relative to the technologies used in its principal products 
despite the company s efforts to protect its proprietary rights  unauthorized parties may have in the past infringed or violated certain of the company s intellectual property rights 
the company is currently involved in litigation in federal court alleging patent infringement by the products of a defendant 
as is typical in the industry  the company from time to time may be notified that it is infringing certain patent or intellectual property rights of others 
there can be no assurance that this litigation and any other intellectual property litigation initiated in the future will not cause significant litigation expense  liability and a diversion of management s attention which may have a material adverse effect on the company s operating results 
dependence on key management and technical personnel 
the company s success depends to a significant degree upon the continued contributions of its key management  sales  marketing  research and development and operational personnel  including dr 
truchard  the company s chairman and chief executive officer  and other members of senior management and key technical personnel 
the company has no agreements providing for the employment of any of its key employees for any fixed term and the company s key employees may voluntarily terminate their employment with the company at any time 
the loss of the services of one or more of the company s key employees in the future could have a material adverse affect on operating results 
the company also believes its future success will depend upon its ability to attract and retain additional highly skilled management  technical  marketing  research and development  and operational personnel with experience in managing large and rapidly changing companies  as well as training  motivating and supervising the employees 
in addition  the recruiting environment for software engineering  sales and other technical professionals is very competitive 
competition for qualified software engineers is particularly intense and is likely to result in increased personnel costs 
failure to attract or retain qualified software engineers could have an adverse effect on the company s operating results 
the company also recruits and employs foreign nationals to achieve its hiring goals primarily for engineering and software positions 
there can be no guarantee that the company will continue to be able to recruit foreign nationals to the current degree 
these factors further intensify competition for key personnel  and there can be no assurance that the company will be successful in retaining its existing key personnel or attracting and retaining additional key personnel 
failure to attract and retain a sufficient number of technical personnel could have a material adverse effect on the company s operationg results
