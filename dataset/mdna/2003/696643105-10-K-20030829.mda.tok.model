item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations should be read together with our consolidated financial statements and notes to those statements included in item of part ii of this form k 
our week fiscal year ends on the friday nearest to may fiscal years  and contained weeks 
for presentation purposes  the fiscal years have been presented as ending on may unless otherwise stated  all years and dates refer to our fiscal years and fiscal periods 
overview palm  inc is the leading global provider of handheld computing devices and operating systems for handheld devices 
for purposes of this report  we refer to the devices designed and sold by palm as palm branded devices  and we refer to devices running on the palm os as palm powered devices 
palm powered devices include palm branded devices as well as devices designed and sold by third parties licensing the palm os 
palm was founded in as palm computing  inc in  it was acquired by us robotics corporation and sold its first handheld product in  quickly establishing a leadership role in the handheld device industry 
in  com corporation acquired us robotics  and in  com announced the intent to separate the palm business into an independent company 
in preparation for becoming an independent  publicly traded company  palm computing  inc changed its name to palm  inc 
and was reincorporated in delaware in december in march  approximately of the shares of palm common stock were sold in an initial public offering and concurrent private placements  and in july  com distributed the remaining shares of palm common stock it owned  approximately of palm s common stock then outstanding  to com s stockholders 
in december  palm formed palmsource  inc  a stand alone subsidiary for its operating system business  and subsequently announced its intent to establish palmsource as an independent  publicly traded company 
palm is organized into two operating segments palmsource and the solutions group 
in the first quarter of fiscal year  palm announced its strategy to separate its palm os business palmsource and its device business the solutions group into two independent companies 
we believe the separation of our two businesses brings greater clarity of mission and focus to each unit and better serves our existing and future licensees 
in december  palm received a ruling from the internal revenue service that a distribution of palmsource stock to palm stockholders  if it occurs in accordance with the terms of the ruling  will be tax free to the company and its us stockholders 
on june   palm entered into an agreement for a transaction in which palm will distribute  on a pro rata basis to its existing stockholders  all of the shares of palmsource common stock we own  and immediately following the palmsource distribution  palm will acquire handspring  and handspring stockholders will receive palm common stock in exchange for their handspring common stock 
in the palmsource distribution  the million shares as recapitalized via palmsource s one for five reverse stock split to take effect prior to the distribution date of palmsource common stock held by palm will be distributed to existing palm stockholders on a pro rata basis 
the final exchange ratio for the palmsource distribution will be determined based on the number of shares of palm common stock outstanding at the distribution date 
in the handspring merger  the stockholders of handspring will receive of a share of palm common stock for each share of handspring common stock held an aggregate of approximately million shares of palm common stock  based on the number of shares of handspring common stock outstanding at june   handspring s fiscal year end 
the closing of the transaction effecting the palmsource distribution and the handspring merger is subject to stockholder approval and other customary conditions 
palm s total revenue has grown from approximately million in fiscal year to million in fiscal year substantially all of palm s revenues to date have been generated from sales of its handheld devices and related add ons and accessories 
as of may   palm had shipped over million palm branded devices and approximately million palm powered devices have been sold worldwide 

table of contents critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to make judgments  assumptions and estimates that affect the amounts reported in palm s consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes 
we base our estimates and judgments on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances 
however  future events are subject to change and the best estimates and judgments routinely require adjustment 
the amounts of assets and liabilities reported in our balance sheets and the amounts of revenues and expenses reported for each of our fiscal periods are affected by estimates and assumptions which are used for  but not limited to  the accounting for rebates  price protection  product returns  allowance for doubtful accounts  warranty and technical service costs  goodwill and intangible asset impairments  restructurings  inventory and income taxes 
actual results could differ from these estimates 
the following critical accounting policies are significantly affected by judgments  assumptions and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
revenue is recognized when earned in accordance with applicable accounting standards  including aicpa statement of position sop no 
 software revenue recognition  as amended 
we recognize revenues from sales of handheld device products upon shipment  net of estimated returns  provided that collection is determined to be probable and no significant obligations remain 
sales to resellers are subject to agreements allowing for limited rights of return  rebates and price protection 
accordingly  we reduce revenues for our estimates of liabilities related to these rights at the time the related sale is recorded 
the estimates for returns are adjusted periodically based upon historical rates of returns  inventory levels in the channel and other related factors 
the estimates and reserves for rebates and price protection are based on specific programs  expected usage and historical experience 
actual results could differ from these estimates 
within palmsource  revenue from software license agreements with manufacturers of handheld devices is generally recognized on a per unit or volume royalty basis  and any prepaid royalties received under the license agreements are generally deferred and recognized on a per unit or net sales basis in the period information is reported by licensees  generally the month or quarter subsequent to the period of sale by the licensee 
upfront license fees from subscription license arrangements are generally recognized ratably over the term of the subscription period 
post contract support revenue consists primarily of fees for providing unspecified software updates when and if available and technical support for software products to licensees 
post contract support revenue is deferred and recognized ratably over the term of the agreement 
within the solutions group  revenue from software license agreements with end users is recognized upon delivery of the software  provided that persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  collection is determined to be probable and no significant obligations remain 
deferred revenue is recorded for post contract support and any other future deliverables  and is recognized over the support period or as the elements of the agreement are delivered 
vendor specific objective evidence of the fair value of the elements contained in these software license agreements is based on the price determined by management having the relevant authority when the element is not yet sold separately  but is expected to be sold in the marketplace within six months of the initial determination of the price by management 
the allowance for doubtful accounts is based on our assessment of the collectibility of specific customer accounts and an assessment of international  political and economic risk as well as the aging of the accounts receivable 
if there is a change in a major customer s credit worthiness or actual defaults differ from our historical experience  our estimates of recoverability of amounts due us could be affected 
we accrue for warranty costs based on historical rates of usage as a percentage of shipment levels and the expected repair cost per unit  service policies and specific known issues 
if we experience claims or significant 
table of contents changes in costs of services  such as third party vendor charges  materials or freight  which could be higher or lower than our historical experience  our cost of revenues could be affected 
long lived assets such as land not in use  property and equipment are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such assets may not ultimately be recoverable 
determination of recoverability is based on an estimate of undiscounted future cash flows resulting from the use of the asset and its ultimate disposition 
we evaluate the recoverability of goodwill annually or more frequently if impairment indicators arise  as required under statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
goodwill is reviewed for impairment by applying a fair value based test at the reporting unit level  which is the same as the business segment level 
a goodwill impairment loss is recorded for any goodwill that is determined to be impaired 
under sfas no 
 accounting for the disposal of long lived assets  intangible assets are evaluated whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the asset may be impaired 
an impairment loss is recognized for an intangible asset to the extent that the asset s carrying value exceeds its fair value  which is determined based upon the estimated future cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset  including disposition 
cash flow estimates used in evaluating for impairment represent management s best estimates using appropriate assumptions and projections at the time 
effective for calendar year  in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities  which supersedes emerging issues task force eitf issue no 
 liability recognition for costs to exit an activity including certain costs incurred in a restructuring  we record liabilities for costs associated with exit or disposal activities when the liability is incurred instead of at the date of commitment to an exit or disposal activity 
prior to calendar year  in accordance with eitf issue no 
 we accrued for restructuring costs when we made a commitment to a firm exit plan that specifically identified all significant actions to be taken 
we record initial restructuring charges based on assumptions and related estimates that we deem appropriate for the economic environment at the time these estimates are made 
we reassess restructuring accruals on a quarterly basis to reflect changes in the costs of the restructuring activities  and we record new restructuring accruals as liabilities are incurred 
inventory purchases and purchase commitments are based upon forecasts of future demand 
we value our inventory at the lower of standard cost which approximates first in  first out cost or market 
if we believe that demand no longer allows us to sell our inventory above cost or at all  then we write down that inventory to market or write off excess inventory levels 
if customer demand subsequently differs from our forecasts  requirements for inventory write offs could differ from our estimates 
our deferred tax assets represent net operating loss carryforwards and temporary differences that will result in deductible amounts in future years if we have taxable income 
a valuation allowance reduces deferred tax assets to estimated realizable value  based on estimates and certain tax planning strategies 
the carrying value of our net deferred tax assets assumes that it is more likely than not that we will be able to generate sufficient future taxable income in certain tax jurisdictions to realize the net carrying value 
if these estimates and related assumptions change in the future  we may be required to increase our valuation allowance against the deferred tax assets resulting in additional income tax expense 
our key accounting estimates and policies are reviewed with the audit committee of the board of directors 

table of contents results of operations palm s fiscal year ends on the friday nearest to may for presentation purposes  the periods have been presented as ending on may our management s discussion and analysis is organized into two segments solutions group and palmsource  as described in business in item of part i of this form k

revenues for fiscal year were million  a decrease of million or approximately from revenues for fiscal year the decrease in revenues was primarily driven by a decline in unit shipments reflecting a continued weak economy in both the consumer and enterprise segments and a decline in the average selling price of our handheld devices reflective of a price sensitive and 
table of contents increasingly competitive market 
the average selling price of our handheld devices decreased to approximately per unit in fiscal year from approximately per unit in fiscal year  accounting for more than of the overall decrease in revenues 
net unit shipments of devices were million units in fiscal year compared to million units in fiscal year  accounting for just under of the decrease in revenues 
revenues from accessory sales were down by approximately million  or  from fiscal year  reflective of a decrease in device sales and an increase in competition in the accessories business 
these factors were partially offset by a decrease in the provision for product return reserves from of revenue in fiscal year to of revenue in fiscal year this decrease was primarily attributable to lower return rates from our channel partners for product returned to them by their end customers open box returns driven by a decrease in product defects and our channel partners developing alternative means for selling open box returns 
international revenues were approximately of revenues in fiscal year compared to approximately of revenues in fiscal year we experienced strong year over year performance in europe with increased unit shipments and sell through to end users  reflecting european market share gains

cost of revenues in fiscal year was million  or of revenues  compared to million  or of revenues  in fiscal year the decrease in cost of revenues as a percentage of revenues was primarily due to improvement in component and product transformation costs of approximately percentage points  reduced excess and obsolete costs of approximately percentage points  resulting from improved inventory management  and lower product warranty expenses of approximately percentage points as a result of lower volumes and repair costs per unit  partially offset by increased scrap and rework and manufacturing spending of approximately percentage points 
in the fourth quarter of fiscal year  we recorded an inventory related charge of million  or of revenues  captioned cost of revenues charge benefit for special excess inventory and related costs in the solutions group results of operations table 
during the first three quarters of fiscal year  we were experiencing high growth rates and product supply constraints  including a limited supply of certain key components 
as a result  we purchased inventory and made purchase commitments with third party suppliers in anticipation of the continuation of this trend 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal year  we experienced a sudden and significant decline in demand for our products 
revenues in the fourth quarter of fiscal year were million compared to revenues of million during the third quarter of fiscal year this rapid and unexpected decline in demand for handheld device products and in revenues resulted in us recording a charge totaling million consisting of million of excess inventory and related tooling costs and million of non cancelable inventory purchase commitments in excess of our forecasted needs 
this excess inventory charge was calculated in accordance with palm s policy  which is based on inventory levels determined to be in excess of anticipated month demand based upon our internal sales and marketing forecasts of product demand and inventory levels in the distribution channel 
during fiscal year  we experienced continued customer demand for the products that had been previously written off and settled the component purchase commitments for less than the original amount 
accordingly  during fiscal year  we recognized a benefit of million  or of revenues  because we were able to sell approximately million of inventory that had previously been written off and to realize approximately million from the favorable settlement of non cancelable component commitments 
there were no similar benefits recognized in fiscal year  as all excess inventory related to the fiscal year inventory charge had been sold or scrapped by the end of fiscal year

business environment and risk factors you should carefully consider the risks described below and the other information in this form k 
the risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones facing palm  and there may be additional risks that we do not presently know of or that we currently deem immaterial 
the business  results of operations or financial condition of palm could be seriously harmed if any of these risks materialize 
the trading price of shares of palm common stock may also decline due to any of these risks 
company specific trends and risks risks related to our business on june   we announced our intention to distribute the shares that we own of our palmsource subsidiary to our stockholders and to acquire handspring through a merger transaction 
if the transaction is not completed  our stock price and business may be adversely affected  and we may have an outstanding note from handspring that may be subject to risk of default 
even if the transaction is completed  we may not realize the benefits because of integration and other challenges 
on june   we announced a definitive agreement to distribute the shares that we own of our palmsource subsidiary to our stockholders and to acquire handspring 
the boards of directors of both palm and handspring have approved the merger  but final consummation of the palmsource distribution and handspring merger  which is expected to be completed this fall at the earliest  is contingent on the vote of both the palm and handspring stockholders as well as other customary closing conditions 
palm and handspring have made the required filings under the hart scott rodino antitrust improvements act of with the united states federal trade commission and department of justice and the statutory waiting period has terminated 
even after the statutory waiting period or the completion of the handspring merger  governmental authorities could seek to block or challenge the handspring merger 
palm and handspring also may agree to restrictions or conditions imposed by antitrust authorities in order to obtain regulatory approval  and these restrictions or conditions could harm the combined company s operations 
moreover  a competitor  customer or other third party could initiate a private action under the antitrust laws challenging or seeking to enjoin the handspring merger  before or after it is completed 
the stockholders of either palm or handspring may also fail to approve the handspring merger at their respective stockholder meetings 
if the transaction is not completed  the trading price of palm common stock may decline 
in addition  our business and operations may be harmed to the extent that customers  suppliers and others believe that we cannot effectively compete in the marketplace without the transaction  or there is customer or employee uncertainty surrounding the future direction of our product and service offerings and strategy on a standalone basis 
moreover  palm has incurred and will incur transaction costs associated with the handspring merger  including but not limited to legal  banking  consulting  printing and accounting fees which will not be recoverable if the merger transaction does not close 
in addition  each of palm and handspring have agreed to pay to the other a termination fee if the merger agreement is terminated  under certain specified circumstances 
any delay in the completion of the handspring merger could diminish the anticipated benefits of the merger  result in additional transaction costs or result in loss of revenue or other effects associated with uncertainty about the transaction 
in connection with the merger agreement  we may be required to loan up to million to handspring to fund its operations 
as of june   handspring s accumulated deficit was million and its net worth 
table of contents was million 
in addition  handspring is likely to continue to incur losses in the short term 
if the transaction does not close  the term loans may be subject to a risk of default  and while the loans would be collateralized by all of the assets of handspring  such assets may not be sufficient to allow palm to fully recover the loaned funds 
furthermore  the loaned funds could help handspring in competing against us in various segments of the mobile computing market 
realizing the benefits of the transaction will depend in part on the integration of technology  operations and personnel 
the integration of the companies is a complex  time consuming and expensive process that  without proper planning and implementation  could significantly disrupt our solutions group business 
we are currently planning this integration process which is diverting the attention of our management and employees and causing us to incur expenses and use cash 
if the transaction is not completed  this time and money will not be recoverable 
furthermore  our failure to meet the challenges involved in integrating the operations of our solutions group and handspring in a timely manner  or at all  or otherwise to realize any of the anticipated benefits of the transaction could seriously harm our results of operations 
if we do not externally separate our palmsource and solutions group businesses  our business  results of operations and stock price could suffer 
if we do not distribute our palmsource common stock to our stockholders  our business may be adversely affected because we may lose current licensees and or attract fewer new licensees to the palm os platform due to concern about lack of independence from the products of our solutions group 
this could result in the palm os platform being less competitive 
in addition  we may face challenges managing our two independent businesses in a single company without compromising business opportunities for one business because of potentially conflicting business priorities with the other business 
we may also have difficulty attracting and retaining key employees without an external separation 
in addition  if the distribution of palmsource common stock to our stockholders is delayed or not completed  our stock price could decline  and we would not be able to recover the significant costs and diversion of management and employee attention that we have incurred and will continue to incur in planning for and implementing the external separation 
if we fail to develop and introduce new products and services successfully and in a timely manner  we will not be able to compete effectively and our ability to generate revenues will suffer 
we operate in a highly competitive  rapidly evolving environment  and our future success depends on our ability to develop and introduce new products and services that our customers and end users choose to buy 
if we are unsuccessful at developing and introducing new products and services that are appealing to our customers and end users with acceptable prices and terms  we will not be able to compete effectively and our ability to generate revenues will suffer 
the development of new products and services can be very difficult and requires high levels of innovation 
the development process is also lengthy and costly 
if we fail to anticipate our end users needs or technological trends accurately or are unable to complete the development of products and services in a cost effective and timely fashion  we will be unable to introduce new products and services into the market or successfully compete with other providers 
in addition  if we fail to timely develop wireless products that meet carrier product planning cycles  our wireless device sales volumes may be negatively impacted 
as a result  our revenues and cost of revenues could be adversely affected 
as we introduce new or enhanced products or integrate new technology into new or existing products  we face risks relating to such transitions including  among other things  disruption in customers ordering patterns  excessive levels of older product inventories  delivering sufficient supplies of new products to meet customers demand  possible product and technology defects arising from the integration of new technology  and a potentially different sales and support environment relating to any new technology 
our failure to manage the transition to newer products or the integration of newer technology into new or existing products could adversely affect our business and financial results 

table of contents if we do not correctly anticipate demand for our products  we could have costly excess production or inventories or we may not be able to secure sufficient quantities or cost effective production of our handheld devices and our cost of revenues could be adversely impacted 
the demand for our products depends on many factors  including pricing levels  and is difficult to forecast due in part to competition  variations in economic conditions  seasonality  changes in consumer and enterprise preferences and relatively short product life cycles 
it is particularly difficult to forecast demand by individual product 
significant unanticipated fluctuations in demand could result in costly excess production of inventories or the inability to secure sufficient quantities or cost effective production of our handheld devices 
this could adversely impact our cost of revenues and financial condition 
our operating results are subject to fluctuations  and if we fail to meet the expectations of securities analysts or investors  our stock price may decrease significantly 
our operating results are difficult to predict 
our future operating results may fluctuate significantly and may not meet our expectations or those of securities analysts or investors 
if this occurs  the price of our stock will likely decline 
factors that may cause fluctuations in our operating results include  but are not limited to  the following changes in consumer and enterprise spending levels  changes in general economic conditions and specific market conditions  changes in consumer and enterprise preferences for our products and services  price and product competition from other handheld devices or other devices with similar functionality  seasonality of demand for our products and services  variations in product costs or the mix of products sold  quality issues with our products  changes in pricing or promotional programs  inability of our third party manufacturers to produce quality products on time  failure to achieve targeted product cost reductions and operating expense reductions  the timely introduction and market acceptance of new products and services  excess inventory or insufficient inventory to meet demand  unpredictability of product introductions by our licensees and market acceptance of such products  and litigation brought against us 
any of the foregoing factors  or any other factors discussed elsewhere herein  could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations  and financial condition 
economic conditions and increased competition could lead to reduced demand for our products 
the downturn in general economic conditions and the substantial decline in the stock market have led to reduced demand for a variety of goods and services  including many technology products 
economic conditions have created a challenging environment in the pda market which experienced a decline in unit shipments and value of shipments from calendar year to  according to idc  declining average selling prices and increased competition 
if conditions continue to decline  or fail to improve  we could see a further decrease in the overall demand for our products that could negatively affect our operating results 
this is particularly true with respect to a number of our premium products as they typically carry a list price in excess of and therefore are expensive purchases for many consumers and enterprises

if they fail to place timely and sufficient orders with suppliers  our revenues could suffer

in addition  we have entered into an agreement with a third party manufacturer to manufacture and sell our handheld device products in brazil 
the cost  quality and availability of third party manufacturing operations are essential to the successful production and sale of our handheld devices 
our reliance on third party manufacturers exposes us to risks  which are not in our control and our revenues or cost of revenues could be negatively impacted 
for example  the severe acute respiratory syndrome sars outbreak in china could result in quarantines or closures of our third party manufacturers or their suppliers 
in the event of such a quarantine or closure  our revenues  or cost of revenues and results of operations  could be negatively impacted 
we do not have manufacturing agreements with all of the third party manufacturers upon which we rely to manufacture our device products 
the absence of a manufacturing agreement means that  with little or no notice  these manufacturers could refuse to continue to manufacture all or some of the units of our devices that we require or change the terms under which they manufacture our device products 
if these manufacturers were to stop manufacturing our devices  we may be unable to replace the lost manufacturing capacity on a timely basis and our results of operations could be harmed 
in addition  if these manufacturers were to change the terms under which they manufacture for us  our manufacturing costs could increase and our cost of revenues could increase 
our contract distribution facilities are physically separated from our contract manufacturing locations 
this requires additional lead time to move products to customers 
if we are shipping products near the end of the quarter  this extra time could result in us not meeting anticipated shipment volumes for that quarter  which may negatively impact the timing of our revenues 
as a result of economic conditions or other factors  our distribution facility providers may close or move their facilities with little notice to us  which could cause disruption in our ability to deliver products 
in addition  we do not have contracts with all of our third party distribution providers 
the absence of agreements means that  with little or no notice  these distribution facility providers could refuse to continue to provide warehouse and distribution services for all or some of our devices or change the terms under which they provide such services 
any disruption of distribution facility services could have a negative impact on our revenues and results of operations 
for example  in july we were notified by our largest distribution facility provider  servicing all of the united states and canada and most of latin america  that the warehouse and distribution facility that we utilize will be closed and services will be consolidated into another facility within the next few months 
if this provider is not able to complete this transition in a timely and seamless manner  delivery of our existing products and the launch of our new fall products could be adversely affected 
any interruption or delay in delivery of our products could have a significant  adverse impact on our market share  revenues  results of operations and financial condition 
changes in transportation schedules due to terrorist threats or attacks  military activity  labor disruptions or carrier financial difficulties could cause transportation delays and increase our costs for both receipt of inventory 
table of contents and shipment of products to our customers 
for instance  our primary domestic freight carrier filed for bankruptcy immediately after the close of our first quarter of fiscal year this led to delayed deliveries to our customers 
additionally  labor disputes of west coast dockworkers in the second quarter of fiscal year led to less capacity and higher costs for the transportation alternatives we normally use 
if these types of disruptions occur  our results of operations could be adversely impacted 
we depend on our suppliers  some of which are the sole source for certain components and elements of our technology  and our production or reputation could be seriously harmed if these suppliers were unable to timely meet our demand or technical requirements on a cost effective basis 
our device products contain components  including liquid crystal displays  touch panels  memory chips  microprocessors  cameras and batteries  that are procured from a variety of suppliers 
the cost  quality and availability of components are essential to the successful production and sale of our device products 
some components  such as displays and certain integrated circuits  digital signal processors  microprocessors  radio frequency components and other discrete components  come from sole source suppliers  one of which is also a competitor of ours in certain markets 
alternative sources are not always available or may be financially prohibitive 
if suppliers were unable or unwilling to meet our demand for sole source components and if we are unable to obtain an alternative source or if the price for an alternative source is prohibitive  our ability to maintain timely and cost effective production of our handheld computing device products will be seriously harmed 
we enter into agreements for the development and licensing of third party technology to be incorporated into some of our products 
our ability to release and sell our products could be seriously harmed if the third party technology is not delivered to us in a timely manner or contains errors or defects which are not discovered and fixed prior to release of our products 
our inability to obtain alternative technology could result in damage to our reputation as well as lost revenues and divert our development resources from other business objectives 
we rely on our handheld device products as the primary source of our revenues 
our revenues and our results of operations depend substantially on the commercial success of our palm handheld devices 
if revenues from our palm handheld devices fail to meet expectations  our other revenue sources will likely not be able to compensate for this shortfall and our results of operations may suffer 
for the year ended may   revenues from sales of devices and accessories constituted more than of our consolidated revenues 
according to idc  from calendar year to calendar year  the market for handheld devices has declined and we derive substantially all of our revenues from this market 
if this market fails to return to growth or continues to decline  our results of operations and our growth potential could be negatively impacted 
our proposed acquisition of handspring  which is risky  is an effort to expand into a new product market 
however  the handspring merger may not be completed or be successful and  regardless of whether the handspring merger is completed or successful  we may not have sufficient cash  resources  capacity or experience to expand into other markets successfully  or at all 
we rely on distributors  retailers and resellers to sell our products  and disruptions to these channels would adversely affect our ability to generate revenues from the sale of our handheld devices 
our distributors  retailers and resellers sell products offered by our competitors 
if our competitors offer our distributors  retailers and resellers more favorable terms or have more products available to meet their needs or utilize the leverage of broader product lines sold through the channel  those distributors  retailers and resellers may de emphasize or decline to carry our products 
if we are unable to maintain successful relationships with distributors  retailers and resellers or to expand our distribution channels  our business will suffer 

table of contents because we sell our products primarily to distributors  retailers and resellers  we are subject to many risks  including risks related to product returns  either through the exercise of contractual return rights or as a result of our strategic interest in assisting them in balancing inventories 
in addition  our distributors  retailers or resellers could modify their business practices  such as payment terms or inventory levels 
unexpected changes in return requests  inventory levels  payment terms or other practices by our channel customers could negatively impact our revenues or our financial condition 
distributors  retailers and traditional resellers experience competition from internet based resellers that distribute directly to end user customers  and there is also competition among internet based resellers 
we also sell our products directly to end user customers from our palm 
com web site 
these varied sales channels could cause conflict among our channels of distribution  which could harm our revenues and results of operations 
if we are unable to compete effectively with existing or new competitors our resulting loss of competitive position could result in price reductions  fewer customer orders  reduced margins and loss of market share  and our results of operations and financial condition would suffer 
we compete in the handheld device and operating system software markets 
the markets for these products and services are highly competitive  and we expect increased competition in the future  particularly as companies from various established industry segments  such as mobile handset  personal computer and consumer electronics  increasingly develop and market products that compete with us 
some of our competitors or potential competitors possess capabilities developed over years of serving customers in their respective markets 
in addition  many of our competitors have significantly greater financial  technical and marketing resources than we do 
these competitors may be able to respond more rapidly than we can to new or emerging technologies or changes in customer requirements 
they may also devote greater resources to the development  promotion and sale of their products 
they may also be better able to withstand lower prices in order to gain market share at our expense 
finally  these competitors bring with them customer loyalties  and such loyalties may limit our ability to attract new users despite superior product offerings 
our handheld computing devices compete with a variety of handheld computing products 
our principal handheld device competitors include personal computer companies which also develop and sell handheld computing products  such as acer  dell  hewlett packard and toshiba  consumer electronics companies which also develop and sell handheld computing products  such as casio  sharp and sony  research in motion limited rim  a leading provider of wireless email  instant messaging and internet connectivity  mobile handset manufacturers which also develop and sell wireless handheld and smartphone products such as audiovox  ericsson  handspring  htc corporation  kyocera  lg motorola  nokia  samsung  sanyo and sony ericsson  and a variety of privately held start up companies looking to compete in our current and future markets  such as danger and good technology 
some competitors sell or license server  desktop and or laptop computing products in addition to handheld computing products and may choose to market and sell or license their handheld products at a discounted price or give them away for free with their other products  which could negatively affect our revenues  sales and marketing expenses and financial condition 
certain competitors may have longer and closer relationships with the senior management of enterprise customers who decide which products and technologies will be deployed in their enterprises 
moreover  these 
table of contents competitors may have larger and more established sales forces calling upon potential enterprise customers and therefore could contact a greater number of potential customers with more frequency 
consequently  these competitors could have a better competitive position than we do  which could result in potential enterprise customers deciding not to choose our products and services  which would adversely impact our business  revenues  sales and marketing expenses and financial condition 
the separation of our solutions group and palmsource businesses into two independent companies may result in more competition for our solutions group s handheld devices as palmsource may license the palm os to companies who compete directly or indirectly with our solutions group s business 
for example  palmsource has a license agreement with sony and has recently signed palm os license agreements with hunetech  lenovo formerly known as legend and group sense international limited  located in the asia pacific region 
if the revenues and gross margins of our solutions group business suffer because of competition from licensees of the palm os platform  our revenues and results of operations could be negatively impacted 
our palm os platform competes in the operating system software and services markets 
the markets for these products and services are highly competitive  and we expect competition to increase in the future 
we compete primarily with microsoft and symbian 
microsoft has substantially more resources than we do and has the ability to impact interoperability with their desktop operating systems and software 
symbian is supported by companies such as nokia and sony ericsson and has a significant portion of the worldwide smartphone market that is important to our future success 
additionally  there are proprietary operating systems  open source operating systems  such as linux  and other software technologies  such as java and rim s licensed technology  which could be integrated into devices that compete with palm powered devices 
some of our competitors or potential competitors have significantly greater financial  technical and marketing resources than we do 
these competitors may provide additional or better functionality than we do  or may be able to respond more rapidly than we can to new or emerging technologies or changes in customer requirements 
they may also devote greater resources to the development  promotion and sale of their products and services and the third party developer community  which could attract the attention of influential user segments 
in addition  if microsoft or other competitors actions were to disrupt the interoperability of palm powered devices  the marketability and market share of palm os and palm branded devices could be adversely affected 
successful new product introductions or enhancements by our competitors  or increased market acceptance of competing products could reduce the sales and market acceptance of our products  cause intense price competition or could make our products obsolete 
to remain competitive  we must continue to invest significant resources in research and development  sales and marketing and customer support 
we cannot be sure that we will have sufficient resources to make these investments or that we will be able to make the technological advances necessary to be competitive 
increased competition could result in price reductions  fewer customer orders  reduced margins and loss of market share 
our failure to compete successfully against current or future competitors could seriously harm our business  financial condition and results of operations 
our palm os platform and handheld devices may contain errors or defects  which could result in the rejection of our products  damage to our reputation  lost revenues  diverted development resources and increased service costs and warranty claims 
our palm os platform and our devices are complex and must meet stringent user requirements 
in addition  we warrant that our products will be free of defect for to days after the date of purchase  depending on the product 
in europe we are required by law in some countries to provide a two year warranty for certain defects 
we must develop our software and hardware products quickly to keep pace with the rapidly changing handheld device and operating system markets 
products and services as sophisticated as ours are likely to contain undetected errors or defects  especially when first introduced or when new models or versions are released 
our products may not be free from errors or defects after commercial shipments have begun  which could result in the rejection of our products  damage to our reputation  lost revenues  diverted development resources and increased customer service and support costs and warranty claims  which could harm our business  revenues  cost of revenues and financial condition 

table of contents if we are unable to obtain key technology from third parties on a timely basis free from errors or defects  we may have to cancel or delay the release of certain features in our palm os platform and handheld device product shipments or incur increased costs 
we license third party software for use in the palm os platform and handheld device products  as well as to provide software development tools to enable applications to be written for our palm os platform 
in addition to third party licensed software  we may enter into joint development agreements with certain licensees of the palm os platform whereby a licensee will develop a specific feature for our palm os platform that we will then own and may later incorporate into new releases of the palm os platform 
our ability to release and sell our products could be seriously harmed if the third party technology is not delivered to us in a timely manner or contains errors or defects that are not discovered and fixed prior to release of our products and we are unable to obtain alternative technology to use in our products 
as a result  our product shipments could be delayed or our offering of features could be reduced  which could adversely affect our business or results of operations 
furthermore  a third party developer or joint developer may improperly use or disclose the software we include in the palm os platform or handheld device products  which could adversely affect our competitive position 
in addition  because we license some of our development tools from third parties  our business would suffer if we could no longer obtain those tools from those third parties or if the tools developers wanted to use were not available 
if we are unable to offer technology that our licensees need to build successful palm powered products  which we obtain by licensing the technology from third parties or developing it internally  then our business may suffer 
for example  we recently modified the graffiti handwriting recognition system in our palm os  which now includes a subcomponent of the jot technology we license from the communication intelligence corporation cic 
if the technology we license from cic contains errors or defects or cannot be seamlessly integrated into the products of our licensees  our licensees ability to market their products may be delayed or cancelled 
further  should we be required to license the jot technology after expiration or termination of the jot license  we may be unable to renegotiate the license on favorable terms or obtain alternative technology from another third party  which may require us to license other third party solutions or develop aspects of the functionality ourselves 
any of these events may result in higher licensing costs to us and delay the shipment of products based on palm os  which could adversely affect our business  results of operations and financial condition 
we have internally separated our business into two independent businesses by transferring our palm os and licensing business to our palmsource subsidiary 
if we fail to manage our separate businesses effectively  our on going business prospects and overall financial performance may suffer 
in december  we internally separated our business into two independent businesses and formed our palmsource subsidiary to hold our palm os platform and licensing business with the intent to make palmsource an independent public company in the two independent businesses may fail to sustain efficient operations or successfully implement their business strategies 
the implementation of the two independent business strategies may result in actions or decisions that are unfavorable to the other business 
for example  in order for palmsource to diversify its revenue  it may focus its development efforts on functionality that does not match the direction or needs of the solutions group 
failure to effectively manage two independent business operations could cause a decline in our revenues  compromise our on going business prospects and impair our overall financial performance 
palmsource currently derives its revenue from a small number of licensees of palm os  and the failure of one or more of them to sustain sales of palm powered products from which palmsource derives revenue could significantly harm palmsource s future business prospects 
palmsource currently derives its revenue from a small number of licensees of palm os 
revenue from the solutions group was million  or of revenues  in fiscal year and million  or of revenues  in fiscal year revenue from sony was million  or of revenue  in fiscal year and 
table of contents million  or of revenue  in fiscal year revenue from handspring was million  or of revenue  in fiscal year and million  or of revenues  in fiscal year although palmsource recently expanded its number of licensees  many of these new licensees have yet to introduce products on the market or sell significant numbers of units based on palm os 
additionally  the combination of palm solutions group and handspring will increase the concentration of palmsource s customers 
palmsource expects that palm solutions group and sony will continue to account for a substantial portion of its revenue for the foreseeable future 
if revenues from either palm solutions group or sony do not grow as palmsource anticipates  if either of them decide to not incorporate palm os into their future products  or if palm solutions group experiences financial difficulties and is not able to satisfy its annual minimum royalty commitments  palmsource will have to significantly reduce its expenses or increase its revenue from other sources in order to stay in business 
the term of palmsource s license agreement with palm solutions group will expire in december  its license arrangement with sony will expire in october and its license agreement with handspring will be terminated following the handspring merger 
nothing restricts these licensees from competing with palmsource or offering products based on competing operating systems and these licensees may stop incorporating palm os in their products during the term of their agreements with limited notice to palmsource 
once these license arrangements expire  palmsource may not be able to renegotiate them on favorable terms  if at all 
if palmsource does not continue to generate significant revenues from palm solutions group or sony or if palmsource is unable to generate an increased percentage of its revenues from other licensees  palmsource s business  results of operations and financial condition will be significantly harmed 
if we do not deliver the wireless functionality and solutions that the market desires or if we fail to provide wireless devices on additional domestic and international carrier networks  our results of operations could suffer 
we must continue to develop solutions to compete in the evolving wireless space  which includes solutions for wan with carriers  lan with or similar technology and pan with bluetooth or similar technology 
the success of these products is in part based upon the broader adoption of the underlying wireless technology and because the wireless market is still evolving  we cannot be assured which wireless technologies will be broadly adopted 
while we currently have offerings in each of these areas  we cannot assure that there will be demand for our wireless solutions or that individuals will widely adopt our handheld devices as a means of accessing wireless services 
we are reliant on pricing plans put into effect by carriers 
if carriers charge above a rate consumers are willing to pay  the acceptance of our wireless solutions could be less than anticipated and our revenues and results of operations could be adversely affected 
the success of our wan based product  tungsten w  as well as any future wireless products  is highly dependent on our ability to establish new relationships and build on our existing relationships with strategic domestic and international wireless carriers 
we cannot assure that we will be successful in establishing new relationships or advancing existing relationships with wireless carriers or that these carriers will act in a manner that will promote the success of our tungsten w 
for example  service for our gsm gprs based tungsten w in the united states is only offered on the at t wireless network 
if at t wireless should stop providing service for this product  our revenues would be adversely impacted 
in addition  wireless products are subject to lengthy certification processes with wireless carriers and governmental or regulatory authorities 
these certification requirements could delay the offering of the tungsten w on additional carrier networks and delay the introduction of future wireless products 
our success largely depends on our ability to hire  retain  integrate and motivate sufficient numbers of qualified personnel 
our future success depends on our ability to attract and retain highly skilled personnel 
we compensate our employees through a combination of salary  bonuses  benefits and equity compensation 
if we fail to provide competitive compensation to our employees  we may be unable to retain them 
volatility or lack of positive performance in our stock price may also affect our ability to retain key employees  all of who have been granted stock options 

table of contents palm s practice has been to provide incentives to all of its employees through the use of broad based stock option plans 
proposed accounting rules concerning the expensing of stock options may cause us to reevaluate our use of stock options as an employee incentive 
our ability to hire  retain and motivate our personnel may suffer as a result 
in addition  many key personnel and executives hold options that have exercise prices per share that are significantly above the market price of our common stock and the number of shares available for new option grants is limited 
we may find it difficult to provide competitive stock option grants and the ability to hire  retain and motivate key personnel may suffer 
in recent quarters  we have initiated reductions in our workforce of both employees and contractors to balance the size of our employee base with our anticipated revenue base 
these reductions have resulted in reallocations of employee duties  which could result in employee and contractor uncertainty 
reductions in our workforce could make it difficult to motivate and retain the remaining employees and contractors  which could affect our ability to deliver our products in a timely fashion and negatively affect our business 
third parties have claimed and may claim in the future that we are infringing their intellectual property  and we could suffer significant litigation or licensing expenses or be prevented from selling products if these claims are successful 
in the course of our business  we frequently receive claims of infringement or otherwise become aware of potentially relevant patents or other intellectual property rights held by other parties 
we evaluate the validity and applicability of these intellectual property rights  and determine in each case whether we must negotiate licenses or cross licenses to incorporate or use the proprietary technologies in our products 
third parties may claim that we  our customers  or palm os platform licensees  are infringing or contributing to the infringement of their intellectual property rights  and we may be found to infringe or contribute to the infringement of those intellectual property rights and require a license to use those rights 
we may be unaware of intellectual property rights of others that may cover some of our technology  products and services 
any litigation regarding patents or other intellectual property could be costly and time consuming and could divert our management and key personnel from our business operations 
the complexity of the technology involved and the uncertainty of litigation generally increase the risks associated with intellectual property litigation 
moreover  patent litigation has increased due to the current uncertainty of the law and the increasing competition and overlap of product functionality in our markets 
claims of intellectual property infringement might also require us to enter into costly royalty or license agreements or indemnify our customers or palm os platform licensees 
however  we may not be able to obtain royalty or license agreements on terms acceptable to us or at all 
we also may be subject to significant damages or injunctions against development and sale or our products

if palm is unsuccessful in its litigation with xerox  our business  results of operations and financial condition could be significantly harmed and our licensees may not be able to ship products with graffiti handwriting recognition software 
we are engaged in a civil action brought by xerox corporation in in new york federal district court alleging willful infringement of a xerox patent by the graffiti handwriting recognition system employed in handheld computers operating the palm os 
we cannot assure you that palm will be successful in the litigation 
if we are not successful  we may be required to pay xerox significant damages or license fees or pay significant amounts with respect to palm os licensees for their losses 
it may also result in other indirect costs and expenses  such as significant diversion of management resources  loss of reputation and goodwill  damage to our customer relationships and declines in our 
table of contents stock price 
accordingly  if xerox is successful  our business  results of operations and financial condition would be significantly harmed and we may be rendered insolvent 
in addition  xerox might again seek an injunction preventing us or palm os licensees from offering products with palm os with graffiti handwriting recognition software 
we and our licensees have largely transitioned our products to a handwriting recognition software that does not use graffiti

if third parties infringe our intellectual property or if we are unable to secure and protect our intellectual property  we may expend significant resources enforcing our rights or suffer competitive injury 
our success depends in large part on our proprietary technology and other intellectual property rights 
we rely on a combination of patents  copyrights  trademarks and trade secrets  confidentiality provisions and licensing arrangements to establish and protect our proprietary rights 
our intellectual property  particularly our patents  may not provide us a significant competitive advantage 
if we fail to protect or to enforce our intellectual property rights successfully  our competitive position could suffer  which could harm our operating results 
our pending patent and trademark applications for registration may not be allowed  or others may challenge the validity or scope of our patents or trademarks  including patent or trademark applications or registrations 
even if our patents or trademark registrations are issued and maintained  these patents or trademarks may not be of adequate scope or benefit to us or may be held invalid and unenforceable against third parties 
we may be required to spend significant resources to monitor and police our intellectual property rights 
effective policing of the unauthorized use of our products or intellectual property is difficult and litigation may be necessary in the future to enforce our intellectual property rights 
intellectual property litigation is not only expensive  but time consuming  regardless of the merits of any claim  and could divert attention of our management from operating the business 
despite our efforts  we may not be able to detect infringement and may lose competitive position in the market before we do so 
we may not be able to detect infringement and may lose competitive position in the market before we do so 
in addition  competitors may design around our technology or develop competing technologies 
intellectual property rights may also be unavailable or limited in some foreign countries  which could make it easier for competitors to capture market share 
in the past  there have been leaks of proprietary information associated with our intellectual property 
we have implemented a security plan to reduce the risk of future leaks of proprietary information 
we may not be successful in preventing those responsible for past leaks of proprietary information from using our technology to produce competing products or in preventing future leaks of proprietary information 
the unauthorized use of our technology or of our proprietary information by competitors could have a material adverse effect on our ability to sell our products 
despite our efforts to protect our proprietary rights  existing laws  contractual provisions and remedies afford only limited protection 
intellectual property lawsuits are subject to inherent uncertainties due to  among other things  the complexity of the technical issues involved  and we cannot assure you that we will be successful in asserting intellectual property claims 
attempts may be made to copy or reverse engineer aspects of our products or to obtain and use information that we regard a proprietary 
accordingly  we cannot assure you that we will be able to protect our proprietary rights against unauthorized third party copying or use 
use by others of our proprietary rights could materially harm our business 
we have an international presence in countries whose laws may not provide protection of our intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the united states  which may make it more difficult for us to protect our intellectual property 
as part of our business strategy  we target countries with large populations and propensities for adopting new technologies 
however  many of these targeted countries do not prevent misappropriation of intellectual property or 
table of contents deter others from developing similar  competing technologies or intellectual property 
effective protection of patents  copyrights  trademarks  trade secrets and other intellectual property may be unavailable or limited in some foreign countries 
in particular  the laws of some foreign countries in which we are active may not protect our intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the united states 
as a result  we may not be able to effectively prevent competitors in these regions from infringing our intellectual property rights  which would reduce our competitive advantage and ability to compete in those regions and negatively impact our business 
we are subject to general commercial litigation and other litigation claims as part of our operations  and we could suffer significant litigation expenses in defending these claims and could be subject to significant damages or remedies 
in the course of our business  we occasionally receive consumer protection claims  general commercial claims related to the conduct of our business and the performance of our products and services and other litigation claims 
any litigation regarding these consumer  commercial and other claims could be costly and time consuming and could divert our management and key personnel from our business operations 
the complexity of the technology involved and the uncertainty of consumer  commercial and other litigation increase these risks 
we also may be subject to significant damages or equitable remedies regarding the development and sale of our products and operation of our business 
for information concerning pending matters  see legal proceedings in item of part i of this form k 
our future results could be harmed by economic  political  regulatory and other risks associated with international sales and operations 
because we sell our products worldwide and most of the facilities where our devices are manufactured  distributed and supported are located outside the united states  our business is subject to risks associated with doing business internationally  such as changes in foreign currency exchange rates  changes in a specific country s or region s political or economic conditions  particularly in emerging markets  changes in international relations  trade protection measures and import or export licensing requirements  potentially negative consequences from changes in tax laws  difficulty in managing widespread sales operations  and difficulty in managing a geographically dispersed workforce in compliance with diverse local laws and customs 
in addition  we are subject to changes in demand for our products resulting from exchange rate fluctuations that make our products relatively more or less expensive in international markets 
if exchange rate fluctuations occur  our business and results of operations could be harmed by decreases in demand for our products or reductions in margins 
while we sell our products worldwide  one component of our strategy is to expand our sales efforts in china and other countries with large populations and propensities for adopting new technologies 
we have limited experience with sales and marketing in some of these countries 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to market and sell our products in all of our targeted international markets 
if our international efforts are not successful  our results of operations and business growth could be harmed 

table of contents we may pursue strategic acquisitions and investments which could have an adverse impact on our business if they are unsuccessful 
we have announced the proposed handspring merger and we have made acquisitions in the past  notably thinairapps  inc  certain assets of be incorporated  peanutpress 
com  inc  wesync 
com  inc  anyday 
com  inc 
and actual software corporation 
we will continue to evaluate other acquisition opportunities that could provide us with additional product or service offerings or additional industry expertise as they arise 
acquisitions could result in difficulties assimilating acquired operations and products  and result in the diversion of capital and management s attention away from other business issues and opportunities 
integration of acquired companies may result in problems related to integration of technology and management teams 
we may not successfully integrate operations  personnel or products that we have acquired or may acquire in the future 
if we fail to successfully integrate acquisitions  our business could be materially harmed 
in addition  our acquisitions may not be successful in achieving our desired strategic objectives  which would also cause our business to suffer 
these transactions may result in the diversion of capital and management s attention away from other business issues and opportunities 
in addition  we have made strategic venture investments in other companies that provide products and services that are complementary to ours 
if these investments are unsuccessful  this could have an adverse impact on our results of operations and financial position 
we may need or find it advisable to seek additional funding which may not be available and which may result in dilution of the value of our common stock 
we currently believe that our existing cash and cash equivalents will be sufficient to satisfy our anticipated cash requirements for the next twelve months 
we could be required to seek additional funding if our expectations are not met 
even if our expectations are met  we may find it advisable to seek additional funding 
if we seek additional funding  adequate funds may not be available on favorable terms  or at all 
if adequate funds are not available on acceptable terms  or at all  we may be unable to adequately fund our business plans and it could have a negative effect on our business and financial condition 
in addition  if funds are available  the result of our issuing equity securities could dilute the value of shares of our common stock and cause the market price to fall and the result of issuing debt securities could be restrictive covenants which could impair our ability to engage in certain business transactions 
we own land that is not currently being utilized in our business 
if our expected ability to ultimately recover the carrying value of this land is impaired  we would incur a non cash charge to operations 
we own approximately acres of land in san jose  california which we do not plan to develop 
in the third quarter of fiscal year  we reported an impairment charge to adjust the carrying cost of the land to its then current fair market value 
while we currently have no immediate plans to sell this property  a future sale or other disposition of the land at less than its carrying value  or a further deterioration in market values that impacts our expected recoverable value  would result in a non cash charge which would negatively impact our results of operations 
business interruptions could adversely affect our business 
our operations and those of our suppliers and customers are vulnerable to interruption by fire  earthquake  power loss  telecommunications failure  terrorist attacks  wars  health epidemics and other events beyond our control 
in addition  the business interruption insurance we carry may not be sufficient to compensate us fully for losses or damages that may occur as a result of such events 
any such losses or damages incurred by us could have a material adverse effect on our business 
war  terrorist attacks or other threats beyond our control could negatively impact consumer confidence  which could harm our operating results 
wars  terrorist attacks or other threats beyond our control could have an adverse impact on the united states and world economy in general and consumer confidence and spending in particular  which could harm our revenues and results of operations 

table of contents recently enacted and proposed changes in securities laws and regulations are likely to increase our costs 
the sarbanes oxley act of along with other recent and proposed rules from the sec and nasdaq require changes in our corporate governance  public disclosure and compliance practices 
many of these new requirements will increase our legal and financial compliance costs  and make some corporate actions more difficult  such as proposing new or amendments to stock option plans  which now requires stockholder approval 
these developments could make it more difficult and more expensive for us to obtain director and officer liability insurance  and we may be required to accept reduced coverage or incur substantially higher costs to obtain coverage 
these developments also could make it more difficult for us to attract and retain qualified executive officers and qualified members of our board of directors  particularly to serve on our audit committee 
risks related to the securities markets and ownership of our common stock our common stock price may be subject to significant fluctuations and volatility 
the market price of our common stock has been subject to significant fluctuations since the date of our initial public offering 
these fluctuations could continue 
among the factors that could affect our stock price are quarterly variations in our operating results  changes in revenues or earnings estimates or publication of research reports by analysts  speculation in the press or investment community  strategic actions by us or our competitors  such as new product announcements  acquisitions or restructurings  actions by institutional stockholders or financial analysts  general market conditions  and domestic and international economic factors unrelated to our performance 
the stock markets in general  and the markets for high technology stocks in particular  have experienced high volatility that has often been unrelated to the operating performance of particular companies 
these broad market fluctuations may adversely affect the trading price of our common stock 
provisions in our charter documents and delaware law and our adoption of a stockholder rights plan may delay or prevent acquisition of us  which could decrease the value of shares of our common stock 
our certificate of incorporation and bylaws and delaware law contain provisions that could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us without the consent of our board of directors 
these provisions include a classified board of directors and limitations on actions by our stockholders by written consent 
delaware law also imposes some restrictions on mergers and other business combinations between us and any holder of or more of our outstanding common stock 
in addition  our board of directors has the right to issue preferred stock without stockholder approval  which could be used to dilute the stock ownership of a potential hostile acquirer 
although we believe these provisions provide for an opportunity to receive a higher bid by requiring potential acquirers to negotiate with our board of directors  these provisions apply even if the offer may be considered beneficial by some stockholders 
our board of directors adopted a stockholder rights plan  pursuant to which we declared and paid a dividend of one right for each share of common stock outstanding as of november  unless redeemed by us prior to the time the rights are exercised  upon the occurrence of certain events  the rights will entitle the holders to receive upon exercise thereof shares of our preferred stock  or shares of an acquiring entity  having a value equal to twice the then current exercise price of the right 
the issuance of the rights could have the effect of delaying or preventing a change in control of us 

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate sensitivity we currently maintain an investment portfolio consisting mainly of cash equivalents 
these available for sale securities are subject to interest rate risk and will fall in value if market interest rates increase 
the primary objective of our investment activities is to maintain the safety of principal and preserve liquidity while maximizing yields without significantly increasing risk 
this is accomplished by investing in marketable investment grade securities and by limiting exposure to any one issue or issuer 
we do not use derivative financial instruments in our investment portfolio  and due to the nature of our investments  primarily debt securities with maturities of less than days  an immediate and uniform increase in market interest rates by percent from levels at may  would cause an immaterial decline in the fair value of our investment portfolio 
we would not expect our operating results or cash flows to be affected to any significant degree by a sudden change in market interest rates 
foreign currency exchange risk we denominate our sales to certain european customers in the euro and in pounds sterling 
expenses and other transactions are also incurred in a variety of currencies 
we hedge certain balance sheet exposures and intercompany balances against future movements in foreign currency exchange rates by using foreign exchange forward contracts 
gains and losses on the contracts are intended to offset foreign exchange gains or losses from the revaluation of assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of the reporting entity 
the net of gains and losses from these contracts and the revaluation of the foreign denominated assets and liabilities was a gain loss of million  million and million in fiscal years  and  respectively  and is included in interest and other income expense in our consolidated statements of operations 
our foreign exchange forward contracts generally mature within days 
we do not intend to utilize derivative financial instruments for trading purposes 
movements in currency exchange rates could cause variability in our revenues  expenses or interest and other income expense
