item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
the following management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations should be read in connection with millipore s consolidated financial statements and related notes thereto and other financial information included elsewhere in this form k report 
unless otherwise indicated  all items refer to continuing operations only 
critical accounting policies and estimates the company s discussion and analysis of its financial condition and results of operations are based upon millipore s consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the company s most critical accounting policies had a significant impact on the preparation of these financial statements 
these policies include estimates and significant judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
the company evaluates its estimates and judgments on an on going basis 
by their nature  these estimates and judgments are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty 
millipore bases its estimates and judgments on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results may differ materially from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
the company believes the following critical accounting policies and estimates require it to make the most difficult and subjective judgments in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition 
revenue from the sale of products is recognized when evidence of an arrangement is in place  related prices are fixed or determinable  contractual obligations have been satisfied  title and risk of loss have been transferred to the customer and collection of the resulting receivable is reasonably assured 
when significant obligations remain after products are delivered  such as site assessment acceptance  revenue and related costs are deferred until such obligations are fulfilled 
revenue from service arrangements is recognized when the services are provided 
revenue for certain fixed price contracts associated with the company s process equipment business are recognized under the percentage of completion method poc 
historically  less than of the company s revenues have been derived from poc sales 
revenue is recognized based on the ratio of hours expended compared with the total estimated hours to complete the construction of the process equipment 
the cumulative impact of any revisions in estimates of the percent complete is reflected in the period in which the changes become known 
actual results related to poc estimates have been materially the same as the assumptions used at the beginning of each contract 
in addition  should a poc contract be cancelled while in progress  the company would offset the lost revenue and incurred expense with progress payments previously received during the design and construction period 
typically such progress payments can range between and of the total contract sales value 
the company has experienced few cancellations 
during the last three years  cancellations related to poc were less than million in sales 
allowance for doubtful accounts 
millipore regularly evaluates its ability to collect outstanding receivables 
allowances for doubtful accounts are provided when collection becomes unlikely 
in performing this evaluation  significant estimates are involved  including an analysis of risks on a customer by customer basis 
based upon this information  management reserves an amount representing those receivables believed to be uncollectible 
at december   the allowance for doubtful accounts represented approximately of gross receivables 
during the past three years  the company has provided between million per year for allowances for doubtful accounts  which approximates bad debts during those years 
if the financial condition of the company s customers were to deteriorate  resulting in their inability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 

table of contents inventory valuation analysis 
the company s product life cycle is generally a minimum of years and may be in excess of years 
the company considers recent historic usage and future demand in estimating its realizable value of its inventory 
finished goods and components that are obsolete are written off at the point of obsolescence 
in certain cases  for newly introduced products and overstocked products  future demand is considered in establishing inventory write downs 
raw material and work in process inventories are also reviewed for obsolescence and alternative or future use by reviewing manufacturing plans  future demand and market conditions 
inventory at december  reflects cumulative net realizable value write downs of million 
should it be determined that write downs are insufficient  then the company would be required to record additional inventory write downs  which would have a negative impact on gross margin 
valuation of long lived assets 
long lived assets are comprised of property  plant and equipment  intangible assets and goodwill 
the company periodically reviews its long lived assets to determine if impairment has taken place 
the review of goodwill is performed annually at a minimum 
in addition  all long lived assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable and accordingly  the net book value of the asset may be reduced 
significant judgments are required to estimate the future cash flows  appropriate discount rates and other assumptions 
changes in these estimates and assumptions could materially affect the determination of fair value for each asset group 
the company had various capital programs in progress at december  which it anticipates substantially completing during during  the company invested million of a planned million project to expand manufacturing capacity adjacent to its existing manufacturing facility in ireland 
the company has delayed completion of this facility as existing manufacturing capacity can meet the expected demand of its core consumable product through the company does not expect to complete the construction of this facility prior to this facility is currently a multipurpose building shell that is expected to increase manufacturing capacity for its core consumable product 
if necessary  this facility could be used for the manufacturing of alternative products 
in connection with the acquisition of cpg  inc cpg in august  the company recorded million of goodwill 
the impairment review of this goodwill was based on a discounted cash flow approach that uses the company s estimates of revenues and costs from its biopharmaceutical operating segment  as well as appropriate discount rates 
if the fair value of the company s biopharmaceutical operating segment was substantially reduced  then the company may incur charges for impairment of this goodwill 
income tax provision 
the company recognizes income taxes when transactions are recorded in its statement of operations  with deferred taxes provided for items that are recognized in different periods for financial reporting and tax return purposes 
the company records a valuation allowance to reduce the deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
in addition  the company estimates its exposures relating to uncertain tax positions and establishes reserves for such exposures when they become probable and reasonably estimable 
the company s valuation allowance is primarily attributable to foreign tax credit carryforwards which can be utilized against future taxable income in the united states  to reduce its deferred tax assets to the amount of future tax benefit that is more likely than not to be realized 
at december   the company had net operating loss carryforwards of approximately million which must be utilized prior to utilization of foreign tax credit carryforwards of approximately million that expire in the years through of the million of foreign tax credit carryforwards  million is reserved as a valuation allowance 
while the company has considered future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for the valuation allowance  the valuation allowance may need to be increased if the company is unable to generate sufficient taxable income within the statutory limitations to utilize its net operating loss and foreign tax 
table of contents credit carryforwards 
any increase in the valuation allowance could have a material adverse impact on the company s income tax provision and net income in the period in which such determination is made 
the company provides for us income taxes on the earnings of foreign subsidiaries unless they are considered indefinitely invested outside the us at december   the cumulative earnings upon which u 
s 
income taxes have not been provided are approximately million 
if these earnings were repatriated to the u 
s  they would generate an additional tax provision to reflect the us tax rate impact 
foreign tax credits would also be generated that would partially reduce the us tax liability associated with the foreign dividend 
the company estimates an additional million tax provision would be required to reflect the us tax on such repatriation 
employee retirement plans 
the company sponsors retirement plans covering substantially all us employees who meet eligibility requirements 
several estimates are used in calculating the expense and liability related to the plans 
these estimates include the discount rate  expected return on plan assets and rate of future compensation increases as determined by the company 
in addition  the company s actuarial consultants also use other estimates  such as withdrawal and mortality rates  to estimate pension expense 
the estimates used by the company may differ materially from actual results due to changing market and economic conditions  higher or lower withdrawal rates or longer or shorter life spans of the participants 
these differences may have a significant effect on the amount of pension expense recorded by the company 
during  the company used a discount rate of  an expected return on plan assets of and rate of future compensation increases of related to its us retirement plan and a discount rate related to its post retirement medical and life insurance plans 
the most sensitive estimate used in calculating the expense and liability related to the company s us retirement is the discount rate 
if the discount rate were to change by basis points  the retirement plan liability would be impacted by million 
intent to refinance short term debt as long term debt 
the company s credit agreement allows for revolving loan borrowings of up to million 
borrowings against the company s credit agreement of million were outstanding at december   and have been classified as long term  because of the company s ability and intent to continuously refinance such borrowings 
if the company s intent to refinance changes  a significant amount of debt could be characterized as short term debt in future financial statements

business outlook and uncertainties the following statements are based on current expectations 
these statements are forward looking and actual results may differ materially 
sales the company expects sales in local currencies to increase to percentage points over the company expects sales to increase within the biotechnology market by an amount greater than the company s overall growth 
the growth within the biotechnology market is expected to be significant  as the company s customers progress in their development of therapeutic compounds  particularly monoclonal antibodies 
the company s biotechnology customers  particularly those involved in the production of therapeutic compounds  purchase products for use in validated production processes 
accordingly  it is important to participate in the development of the manufacturing process for these new drugs in order to be specified into the ultimate manufacturing process 
adoption of new technologies and products requires a lengthy validation process prior to adoption 
growth in this market is highly dependent on the development and approval of new drugs 
it is difficult to ascertain the number or timing of such approvals 
the number of drugs at various stages in the development process has increased over the past two years  although the number of drugs which received approval decreased in additionally  the company will not realize significant revenue growth from drugs approved in the current year 
significant revenue growth will not occur unless and until the drug has been successfully accepted in the market 
the company expects sales to increase within the life science research market at approximately the same rate as the overall company 
the company expects there will be an increase in development spending and a gradual increase in spending for proteomics 
the increase spending in proteomics is expected as a result of market growth 
the company expects a significant percentage increase in spending related to drug discovery 
the company expects that its new products and protocols used in testing for absorption  solubility and protein binding will successfully penetrate the drug discovery market from target identification through validation 
the extent to which these trends will affect the company is not quantifiable 

table of contents the company expects sales to increase slowly within the other bioscience market 
the company expects that sales in this market will be under economic pressures  but will experience growth rates in line with market growth 
approximately percent of the company s sales are to customers outside of the americas and are generally made in foreign currencies 
as previously noted  currencies had a net negative impact to both sales and earnings in and since the end of  the dollar has continued to weaken against the yen and the euro 
therefore  if rates of exchange remain at the january  level  and depending on the mix of sales growth by geography  there could be a favorable impact on sales for the first quarter and full year as compared with the company does not expect sales to grow significantly during the first half of  but it does expect an increase in sales during the latter half of as large currently booked orders are shipped 
gross margins the company expects gross margin percentages of approximately  in approximately equal to new product start up costs will put short term pressure on gross margins 
however  to the extent that foreign currency exchange rates relative to the us dollar remain at january  levels  first quarter and full year margins could be favorably impacted by foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations as compared with the same periods of the prior year 
millipore s products are made from a wide variety of raw materials that are generally available from alternate sources of supply 
for certain critical raw materials  millipore has qualified only a single source 
with sufficient lead times  the company believes it would be able to validate alternate suppliers for each of these raw materials 
several of these critical raw materials are used in a significant portion of the company s products and if the company were unable to obtain supply of any one of them  the loss of revenues to the company would be material 
operating expenses the company expects that operating expenses  before the impact of changes in foreign currency rates of exchange  as a percentage of sales  in will approximate the percentage achieved in the previous year primarily as a result of continued investment in strategic r d projects 
the company expects r d expense to average of net sales 
in addition  the company will continue to invest in sales  service and marketing resources focused on maintaining or improving customer services  supporting the launch of new products and development of future sales initiatives aimed at improving the company s competitive positions 
the company expects sg a expense to average of net sales 
net interest expense  capital resources and liquidity the company intends to use its revolving credit line to borrow capital as desired 
the revolving credit line contains a floating interest rate which the company expects to result in lower interest expense than its prior fixed rate debt 
in  the company s million note will be due and the company believes it has the ability to obtain new debt at prevailing market rates 
provision for income taxes the effective tax rate in is projected to be approximately  compared with an effective rate of for the increased tax rate is due to an expected unfavorable change in the mix of profits in higher tax jurisdictions 
in the event that the company s cash needs significantly increase above those currently projected and exceed the resources identified under net interest expense  capital resources and liquidity above  then an additional upward influence on the company s tax rate could develop if the company were required to repatriate cash from certain foreign operations 
capital spending the company expects to spend between million and million for fixed asset additions in this increase will be driven by the on going need to add manufacturing capacity  expand automated manufacturing processes and upgrade research and development facilities 
accordingly  the company also expects that depreciation expense will be approximately million higher than reported in
