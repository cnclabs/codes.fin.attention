the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods 
the company bases its estimates and judgments on historical experience and various other factors it believes to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
the most significant estimates and assumptions relate to the adequacy of receivable and inventory reserves  self insurance accruals and the accounting for income taxes

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk commodity risk sensitivity the company purchases cotton from approximately eleven established merchants with whom it has long standing relationships 
the majority of the company s purchases are executed using on call contracts 
these on call arrangements are used to insure that an adequate supply of cotton is available for the company s requirements 
under on call contracts  the company agrees to purchase specific quantities for delivery on specific dates  with pricing to be determined at a later time 
prices are set according to prevailing prices  as reported by the new york cotton exchange  at the time of the company s election to fix specific contracts 
cotton on call with a fixed price at june  was valued at million  and is scheduled for delivery between july and december at june   the company had unpriced contracts for deliveries between july and june based on the prevailing price at june   the value of these commitments was approximately million 
at june   a decline in the market price of the cotton covered by delta apparel s fixed price contracts would have had a negative impact of approximately million on the value of the contracts 
at june   cotton on call with a fixed price was valued at million

accordingly  changes in the fair market value are marked to market 
the company owned options valued at million on june  interest rate sensitivity delta apparel s credit agreement provides that the interest rate on outstanding amounts owed shall bear interest at variable rates 
if the amount of outstanding indebtedness at june  under the revolver and term loan had been outstanding during the entire year and the interest rate on this outstanding indebtedness were increased by basis points  delta apparel s expense would have increased by approximately  or  for the fiscal year 
the actual increase in interest expense resulting from a change in interest rates would depend on the magnitude of the increase in rates and the average principal balance outstanding
