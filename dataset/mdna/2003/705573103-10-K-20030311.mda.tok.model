item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations results of operations overview total revenue in increased due to increased software license revenue offset by decreased services revenue 
the million growth in license revenue was driven by an increase in perpetual licenses  primarily a million increase in license revenue resulting from an overall restructuring of our relationship with first data resources  or fdr 
this restructured relationship also allowed us to re enter the growing credit card market 
while we have stepped up efforts to sign new customer license business in all of our target markets  the vast majority of our license revenue in was from existing customers who chose to renew  add on to  or extend their investment with us 
services revenue declined sharply to million in from million in due largely to the fall off in new customer license signings 
net income of million in grew over  mainly because license revenue comprised a higher percentage of total revenue and because of cost containment efforts 
we generated million in positive cash flow from operations and ended the year with a strong balance sheet  including million in cash and marketable debt securities and million in combined short and long term license installments receivable 
total cash and cash equivalents increased to million at december   up from september  and up from december  revenue of million in the fourth quarter of was less than our revenue for the immediately preceding quarter and for the fourth quarter of due primarily to a decline in license revenues 
the decrease in fourth quarter license revenue reflected a decrease in revenue from fdr as well as the timing of license 
table of contents acceptances and renewals which can cause fluctuations in our quarterly revenue because of the relatively small number of license transactions that typically comprise our revenue in any quarter 
included in term software license revenue in the fourth quarter of was million related to the settlement of a customer dispute 
we posted net income of million and million in positive cash flow from operations for the fourth quarter of services revenue and services margins increased in the fourth quarter over the third quarter of in the fourth quarter  we signed four new customers  two of which are in the healthcare sector  a growth market we are targeting 
new license signings in the second half of grew over the first half  indicating improved sales traction 
nearly all of the dollar value of new license signings in the second half of is expected to be recorded as revenue in  when the license implementations are complete 
international revenues international revenues were   and of total consolidated revenues in   and  respectively 
our international revenues may fluctuate in the future because such revenues are generally dependent upon a small number of product acceptances by our customers during a given period 
historically  most of our contracts have been denominated in u 
s dollars 
we expect  however  that in the future due to competition from vendors who will do business in foreign currencies  more of our contracts may be denominated in foreign currencies which may expose us to increased currency exchange risk

table of contents year ended december  compared to year ended december  revenue total revenue for increased to million from million for the increase was due primarily to increases in software license revenue  which were partially offset by decreases in services revenue 
since the latter part of and through most of  signing of license contracts with new customers slowed significantly due in large part  we believe  to continued weakness in spending by our target customers 
license and services revenue from new customers was of total revenue for  compared with for the decrease in license contracts with new customers adversely impacted our services business because we derive a substantial portion of our services revenue from implementation of software licensed by these customers 
the following table summarizes our revenue composition twelve months ended december  in millions license revenue perpetual licenses and licenses accounted for on a subscription basis term license renewals  extensions and additions total license revenue services revenue implementation  consulting and training services maintenance total services revenue total revenue software license revenue for increased to million from million for due primarily to software license renewals by existing customers 
the increase in perpetual and subscription license revenue for was primarily due to a perpetual license agreement entered into with first data resources  or fdr  in the first quarter of that perpetual license agreement replaced a prior term license agreement with fdr under which revenue was being recognized on a subscription basis and which was due to expire in december of the million increase in perpetual and subscription license revenue for  million was due to the fdr perpetual license agreement 
the following table summarizes the revenue we have recognized under the fdr perpetual license and the prior agreements with fdr twelve months ended december  in millions perpetual and subscription licenses implementation  consulting and training services maintenance total revenue 
table of contents under the terms of the fdr perpetual license agreement  fdr is required to make monthly payments through december these payments will total million in each of the four quarters of we recognize revenue as earned  which is three months in advance of receipt of payments  because while fdr has the contractual right to terminate the agreement  fdr is required to provide us with at least three months advance notice 
we expect to recognize as revenue from the fdr perpetual license million in each of the first three quarters of our current sales strategy is to sell perpetual licenses to new customers  and therefore we expect to enter into more perpetual license transactions than term licenses with new customers  the effect of which may be to increase our license revenue and cash flow in the short term and to decrease the amount of revenue and cash flow from the renewal of term software license agreements 
in the past few years  a significant portion of our license revenue has been from renewals of term software license agreements 
revenues from term software licenses  renewals  extensions  and additions decreased by million to million from million for included in term software license revenues in the fourth quarter of is million received from qwest in settlement of a dispute 
discount rates used to recognize term license revenue vary directly with market interest rates 
the discount rates used to recognize term license revenue reflect the estimated borrowing rates of our customers  and averaged in the fourth quarter of decreases in the average discount rate resulted in an increase in license revenue of approximately million for versus if interest rates increase and in turn the discount rates we use to recognize term license revenue increase  we would defer as installment receivable interest a greater portion of the revenue from such arrangements and recognized license revenue would decrease by the same amount 
services revenue for decreased to million from million for the decrease was due primarily to delayed customer spending and a decrease in new customer license transactions  which we believe were caused by current generally weak economic conditions 
typically  we derive substantial revenue from services provided in connection with the implementation of software licensed to new customers 
new customer implementations in were significantly below while we saw a modest improvement in new license signings in the fourth quarter of  the rate of signing new customers in indicates that growth in services revenue will continue to be a challenge 
deferred revenue at december  consisted primarily of billed fees from arrangements for which acceptance of the software license or service milestone had not occurred  the unearned portion of services revenue and advance payment of maintenance fees 
deferred revenue balances increased to million as of december  from million as of december   due to payments for software licenses in advance of customer acceptance and advance payment of maintenance fees

the charge was for software we acquired in the fourth quarter of  which  after initially being amortized  was expensed in full in the second quarter of because the productive use of this software was no longer anticipated 
cost of services consists primarily of the cost of providing implementation  consulting  maintenance  and training services 
cost of services for decreased to million from million for  primarily due to reduced staff costs and reduced spending on consultants

as a percentage of total revenue  general and administrative expenses remained essentially flat at approximately for installment receivable interest income installment receivable interest income for  which consists of the portion of all license fees under long term software license agreements that is attributable to the time value of money  decreased to million from million for the decrease was due to a lower average discount rate for our portfolio of term software licenses 
installment receivable interest income of million in the fourth quarter of was higher than in previous quarters due to growth in our portfolio of term software licenses and adjustment from review of estimates for the current year 
a portion of the fee from each license lease arrangement is initially deferred and recognized as installment receivable interest income over the term of the license 
for purposes of the present value calculations  the discount rates used are estimates of customers borrowing rates  typically below prime rate  and have varied between and for the three years ended december  other interest income  net other interest income  net  remained flat at million for as larger invested cash balances and investments in securities were offset by lower interest rates 
other income expense  net other income expense  net  which consists primarily of currency exchange losses and reseller development funds received from third party vendors of computer hardware products  decreased to a million expense for compared to thousand income for the decrease was due to greater currency exchange losses and lower reseller development funds

table of contents provision for income taxes the provision for income tax was million in  an increase from million in the tax provision consisted primarily of foreign subsidiary income tax 
the increase was primarily due to increased deductions for compensation triggered by stock option exercises  which are reflected as increases in equity instead of reductions in the provision for income taxes 
the provision for income tax in the fourth quarter of was higher than previous quarters due to adjustment from review of estimates for minimal provisions for us income taxes have been made due to the availability of loss carry forwards to offset current period income 
our net deferred tax assets are currently reserved 
these valuation allowances have been maintained due to concerns about the future realization of these benefits 
in and  the benefits of these assets were recognized only to the extent that they reduced taxes due on current year operations 
should circumstances in the future indicate an increased likelihood of realization of our assets  remaining valuation allowances would be reversed generally through tax provision

liquidity and capital resources we have funded our operations primarily from cash flow from operations and the proceeds of our public stock offerings 
at december   we had cash and cash equivalents of million and working capital of million 
net cash provided by operations for was million compared with million for the increase was primarily due to million in improved profitability  million from increased deferred revenue and million from improved collection of accounts receivable  primarily from perpetual licenses 
although we have been successful in reducing receivables through collections activity  should services revenue increase or customer payments slow  it is reasonable to expect that our collections experience may return to a more normal level during net cash used in investing activities for was million compared with million for the increased use of cash was primarily due to a million purchase of debt securities  which we intend to hold to maturity  and transaction costs associated with the mind acquisition 
on february   we acquired substantially all of the assets of mind corporation for initial consideration valued at million  consisting of  shares of our common stock  shares of which were deposited into escrow to secure the indemnity obligations of mind s equity holders relating to the transaction and warrants to purchase for nominal consideration  shares of our common stock 
the purchase agreement included provisions for additional consideration  which we are not obligated to pay because of the performance of the acquired business since the acquisition date 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
net cash provided by financing activities for was million compared with thousand in the increase was primarily due to proceeds from employee stock option exercises 
see note to notes to consolidated financial statements 
we believe that current cash  cash equivalents  and cash flow from operations will be sufficient to fund our business until at least the end of we expect to receive cash during of million for license installments and million for maintenance under existing contracts 
we do not have plans or commitments for significant capital equipment expenditures 
material risks to cash flow from operations include  a further decline in services revenue and delayed or reduced cash payments accompanying sales of new licenses 
there can be no assurance that changes in our plans or other events affecting our operations will not result in materially accelerated or unexpected expenditures 
in addition  there can be no assurance that additional capital if needed will be available on reasonable terms  if at all  at such time as we require 

table of contents we lease certain equipment and office space under non cancelable capital and operating leases 
future minimum rental payments required under the capital and operating leases with non cancelable terms in excess of one year at december  are as follows operating leases years ending december  in thousands and thereafter our liquidity is affected by the manner in which we collect cash for certain types of license transactions 
historically  our term licenses have provided for monthly license payments  generally over five years 
the following amounts of cash are due for receipt over the next six years in connection with our existing term license agreements license installments years ended december  in thousands critical accounting policies and estimates management s discussion and analysis of the financial condition and results of operations is based upon the consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
we base our estimates and judgments on historical experience  knowledge of current conditions and beliefs of what could occur in the future given available information 
we consider the following accounting policies to be both those most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and those that require the most subjective judgment 
if actual results differ significantly from management s estimates and projections  there could be a material effect on our financial statements 
revenue recognition our revenue is derived from two primary sources software license fees and service fees 
we offer both perpetual and term software licenses 
perpetual license fees are generally payable at the time the software is delivered  and are generally recognized as revenue upon customer acceptance to the extent that payments are not subject to refund 
payments subject to refund are recognized as revenue as refund provisions lapse 
term software license fees are generally payable on a monthly basis under term license agreements that generally have a five year term and may be renewed for additional years at the customer s option 
the present value of future license payments is generally recognized as revenue upon customer acceptance 
a portion of the 
table of contents license fees payable under each term license agreement equal to the difference between the total license payments and the discounted present value of those payments is initially deferred and recognized as installment receivable interest income and is not part of total revenue over the license term 
many of our license agreements provide for license fee increases based on inflation 
when such an increase occurs  as determined by the terms of the license agreement  we recognize the present value of such increases as revenue  the remainder of the increase is recognized as installment receivable interest income over the license term 
for purposes of the present value calculations  the discount rates used are estimates of customers borrowing rates at the time of recognition  typically below prime rate  and have varied between and for the past few years 
as a result  revenue that we recognize relative to these types of license arrangements would be impacted by changes in market interest rates 
for term license agreement renewals  license revenue is recognized with the same present value approach  when the customer becomes committed to the new license terms  provided no additional obligations to the customer exist 
in certain circumstances  such as when license fees are not fixed and determinable  some term licenses are accounted for on a subscription basis  where revenue is recognized as payments become due over the term of the license 
our services revenue is comprised of fees for software implementation  consulting  maintenance  and training services 
our software implementation and consulting agreements typically require us to provide services for a fixed fee or at an hourly rate 
revenues for time and material projects are recognized as fees are billed 
until the fair value of the elements of a contract can be determined  the recognition of services revenue for fixed price projects is limited to amounts equal to costs incurred  resulting in no gross profit 
we do not have a reliable track record for accurately estimating the time and resources needed to complete fixed price service projects 
as a result  determination of the fair value of the elements of the contract has generally occurred late in the implementation process  typically when implementation is complete and remaining services are no longer significant to the project 
if the fair values of the elements of a contract are then apparent  the remaining revenue and profit associated with the fixed price services elements will be recognized when the project is completed 
to the extent that a software license is included in the contract  any residual amounts remaining after revenue is allocated to the services elements are recorded as license revenues 
all costs of services are expensed as incurred 
software license customers are offered the option to enter into a maintenance contract  which requires the customer to pay a monthly maintenance fee over the term of the maintenance agreement  typically renewable annually 
prepaid maintenance fees are deferred and are recognized evenly over the term of the maintenance agreement 
we generally recognize training fees revenue as the services are provided 
we reduce revenue for estimates of the fair value of potential concessions  such as disputed services  when revenue is initially recorded 
these estimated amounts are deferred or reserved until the related elements of the agreement are completed and provided to the customer 
allowance for doubtful accounts we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts using estimates that we make based on factors such as the composition of the accounts receivable aging  historical bad debts  changes in payment patterns  customer creditworthiness and current economic trends 
if we used different estimates  or if the financial condition of customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional provisions for doubtful accounts would be required and would increase bad debt expense 
during  our allowances were reduced by approximately million reflecting lower levels of problem accounts 

table of contents accounting for income taxes we account for income taxes in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 or fas  accounting for income taxes  which requires that deferred tax assets and liabilities be recognized using enacted tax rates for the effect of temporary differences between the book and tax bases of recorded assets and liabilities 
fas also requires that deferred tax assets be reduced by a valuation allowance if it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax asset will not be realized 
we evaluate the realizability of our deferred tax assets quarterly by assessing our valuation allowance and by adjusting the amount of such allowance  if necessary 
at december   we had net deferred tax assets of million primarily resulting from temporary differences between the book and tax bases of assets and liabilities 
we have provided a valuation allowance equal to net deferred tax assets based on an assessment of the likelihood of realization 
in reaching our conclusion  we evaluated certain relevant criteria including deferred tax liabilities that can be used to offset deferred tax assets  estimates of future taxable income of appropriate character within the carry forward period available under the tax law  and tax planning strategies 
our judgments regarding future taxable income may change due to market conditions  changes in us or international tax laws  and other factors 
these changes  if any  may require material adjustments to these deferred tax assets  resulting in either a tax benefit  if it is estimated that future taxable income is likely  or a reduction in the value of the deferred tax assets  if it is determined that their value is impaired  resulting in a reduction in net income or an increase in net loss in the period when such determinations are made 
in addition  we have provided for potential liabilities due in the various foreign jurisdictions 
judgment is required in determining our worldwide income tax expense provision 
in the ordinary course of conducting a global business enterprise  there are many transactions and calculations undertaken whose ultimate tax outcome cannot be certain 
some of these uncertainties arise as a consequence of transactions and arrangements made among related parties 
although we believe our estimates are reasonable  no assurance can be given that the final tax outcome of these matters will not be different from what is reflected in our historical income tax provisions and accruals 
such differences could have a material impact on our income tax provision and operating results in the period in which such a determination is made 
contingencies from time to time  we are threatened with or become party to litigation 
we periodically assess each matter in order to determine if a contingent liability in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 or fas  accounting for contingencies  should be recorded 
in making this determination  we may  depending on the nature of the matter  consult with internal and external legal counsel and technical experts 
based on the information we obtain  combined with our judgment regarding all the facts and circumstances of each matter  we determine whether it is probable that a contingent loss may be incurred and whether the amount of such loss can be estimated 
should a loss be probable and estimable  we record a contingent loss in accordance with fas in determining the amount of a contingent loss  we consider advice received from experts in the specific matter  current status of legal proceedings  settlement negotiations that may be ongoing  prior case history and other factors 
should the judgments and estimates made by us be incorrect  we may need to record additional contingent losses that could materially adversely impact our results of operations 
inflation inflation has not had a significant impact on our operating results to date  and we do not expect it to have a significant impact in the future 
our unbilled license and maintenance fees are typically subject to annual increases based on recognized inflation indexes

forward looking statements this annual report on form k contains or incorporates forward looking statements within the meaning of section a of the securities act of and section e of the securities exchange act of these forward looking statements are based on current expectations  estimates  forecasts and projections about the industry and markets in which we operate and management s beliefs and assumptions 
in addition  other written or oral statements that constitute forward looking statements may be made by or on our behalf 
words such as expect  anticipate  intend  plan  believe  seek  estimate  may  variations of such words and similar expressions are intended to identify such forward looking statements 
these statements are not guarantees of future performance and involve certain risks  uncertainties and assumptions that are difficult to predict 
we have included important factors in the cautionary statements below under the heading factors that may affect future results that we believe could cause our actual results to differ materially from the forward looking statements we make 
we do not intend to update publicly any forward looking statements  whether as a result of new information  future events or otherwise 
factors that may affect future results we are having difficulty closing license transactions with new customers 
due in large part  we believe  to continued weakness in spending by our target customers  license transactions with new customers have decreased significantly since the latter part of license revenue from new customers was of total license revenue in we believe that obtaining new license customers will continue to be a challenge at least in the near term 
the decrease in license contracts with new customers has adversely impacted and may continue to adversely impact our services business because we derive a substantial portion of our services revenue from implementation of software licensed by new customers 
we have been dependent on fdr for a significant portion of our revenue during the past few years 
with the perpetual license entered into with fdr in  fdr is not likely to represent as large a portion of our revenues after  therefore we are more dependent on license transactions with new customers 
our stock price has been volatile 
quarterly results have fluctuated and are likely to continue to fluctuate significantly 
the market price of our common stock has been and may continue to be highly volatile 
factors that are difficult to predict  such as quarterly revenues and operating results  statements and ratings by financial analysts  and overall market performance  will have a significant effect on the price for shares of our common stock 
revenues and operating results have varied considerably in the past from period to period and are likely to vary considerably in the future 
we plan product development and other expenses based on anticipated future revenue 
if revenue falls below expectations  financial performance is likely to be adversely affected because only small portions of expenses vary with revenue 
as a result  period to period comparisons of operating results are not necessarily meaningful and should not be relied upon to predict future performance 
the timing of license revenues is related to the completion of implementation services and product acceptance by the customer  the timing of which has been difficult to predict accurately 
there can be no assurance that we will be profitable on an annual or quarterly basis or that earnings or revenues will meet analysts expectations 
fluctuations may be particularly pronounced because a significant portion of revenues in any quarter is attributable to product acceptance or license renewal by a relatively small number of customers 
fluctuations also reflect our policy of recognizing revenue upon product acceptance or license renewal in an amount equal to the present value of the total committed payments due during the term 
customers generally do not accept products until the end of a lengthy sales cycle and an implementation period  typically ranging from six to twelve months but in some cases significantly longer 
we are currently in the process of introducing new 
table of contents product technology and making material changes to our existing products 
this may result in even lengthier sales and implementation cycles which may adversely affect our financial performance 
in addition  we are more focused on closing larger but fewer license transactions than in the past 
this may increase the volatility in our quarterly operating results 
risks over which we have little or no control  including customers budgets  staffing allocation  and internal authorization reviews  can significantly affect the sales and acceptance cycles 
changes dictated by customers may delay product implementation and revenue recognition 
if existing customers do not renew their term licenses  our financial results may suffer 
term license renewal negotiations have required more effort due to economic pressures and consolidation among our customers 
a significant portion of total revenue has been attributable to term license renewals 
while historically a majority of customers have renewed their term licenses  there can be no assurance that a majority of customers will continue to renew expiring term licenses 
a decrease in term license renewals absent offsetting revenue from other sources would have a material adverse effect on future financial performance 
in addition  we are currently entering into perpetual licenses with most of our new customers  the effect of which may be to increase our license revenue and cash flow in the short term but to decrease the amount of revenue and cash flow from the renewal of term license in the long term 
we will need to develop new products  evolve existing ones  and adapt to technology change 
technical developments  customer requirements  programming languages and industry standards change frequently in our markets 
as a result  success in current markets and new markets will depend upon our ability to enhance current products  to develop and introduce new products that meet customer needs  keep pace with technology changes  respond to competitive products  and achieve market acceptance 
product development requires substantial investments for research  refinement and testing 
there can be no assurance that we will have sufficient resources to make necessary product development investments 
we may experience difficulties that will delay or prevent the successful development  introduction or implementation of new or enhanced products 
inability to introduce or implement new or enhanced products in a timely manner would adversely affect future financial performance 
our products are complex and may contain errors 
errors in products will require us to ship corrected products to customers 
errors in products could cause the loss of or delay in market acceptance or sales and revenue  the diversion of development resources  injury to our reputation  or increased service and warranty costs which would have an adverse effect on financial performance 
we have historically sold to the financial services market 
this market is continuing to consolidate  and faces uncertainty due to many other factors 
we have historically derived a significant portion of our revenue from customers in the financial services market  and our future growth depends  in part  upon increased sales to this market 
competitive pressures  industry consolidation  decreasing operating margins within this industry  currency fluctuations  geographic expansion and deregulation affect the financial condition of our customers and their willingness to pay 
in addition  customers purchasing patterns are somewhat discretionary 
as a result  some or all of the factors listed above may adversely affect the demand by customers 
the financial services market is undergoing intense domestic and international consolidation 
in recent years  several customers have been merged or consolidated 
future mergers or consolidations may cause a decline in revenues and adversely affect our future financial performance 
we depend on certain key personnel  and must be able to attract and retain qualified personnel in the future 
the business is dependent on a number of key  highly skilled technical  managerial  consulting  sales  and marketing personnel  including mr 
trefler  our chief executive officer 
the loss of key personnel could adversely affect financial performance 
we do not have any significant key man life insurance on any officers or employees and do not plan to obtain any 
our success will depend in large part on the ability to hire and retain qualified personnel 
the number of potential employees who have the extensive knowledge of computer hardware and operating systems needed to develop  sell and maintain our products is limited  and competition for their services is intense  and there can be no assurance that we will be able to attract and retain such personnel 
if we are unable to do so  our business  operating results  and financial condition could be materially adversely affected 

table of contents the market for our offerings is increasingly and intensely competitive  rapidly changing  and highly fragmented 
the market for customer relationship management software and related implementation  consulting and training services is intensely competitive and highly fragmented 
we currently encounter significant competition from internal information systems departments of potential or existing customers that develop custom software 
we also compete with companies that target the customer interaction and workflow markets and professional service organizations that develop custom software in conjunction with rendering consulting services 
competition for market share and pressure to reduce prices and make sales concessions are likely to increase 
many competitors have far greater resources and may be able to respond more quickly and efficiently to new or emerging technologies  programming languages or standards or to changes in customer requirements or preferences 
competitors may also be able to devote greater managerial and financial resources to develop  promote and distribute products and provide related consulting and training services 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to compete successfully against current or future competitors or that the competitive pressures faced by us will not materially adversely affect our business  operating results  and financial condition 
we rely on certain third party relationships 
we have a number of relationships with third parties that are significant to sales  marketing and support activities  and product development efforts 
we rely on relational database management system applications and development tool vendors  software and hardware vendors  and consultants to provide marketing and sales opportunities for the direct sales force and to strengthen our products through the use of industry standard tools and utilities 
we also have relationships with third parties that distribute our products 
in particular  we benefit from our non exclusive relationship with first data resources for the distribution of products to the credit card market and with pfpc inc for distribution of products to the mutual fund market 
fdr can sell applications based on our software to their credit card customers who have less than an agreed number of active credit card accounts as identified in the perpetual license agreement  without paying additional fees to us 
there can be no assurance that these companies  most of which have significantly greater financial and marketing resources  will not develop or market products that compete with ours in the future or will not otherwise end their relationships with or support of us 
we may face product liability and warranty claims 
our license agreements typically contain provisions intended to limit the nature and extent of our risk of product liability and warranty claims 
there is a risk that a court might interpret these terms in a limited way or could hold part or all of these terms to be unenforceable 
also  there is a risk that these contract terms might not bind a party other than the direct customer 
furthermore  some of our licenses with our customers are governed by non us law  and there is a risk that foreign law might give us less or different protection 
although we have not experienced any material product liability claims to date  a product liability suit or action claiming a breach of warranty  whether or not meritorious  could result in substantial costs and a diversion of management s attention and our resources 
we face risks from operations and customers based outside of the us sales to customers headquartered outside of the united states represented approximately  and of our total revenue in  and  respectively 
we  in part through our wholly owned subsidiaries based in the united kingdom  singapore  canada  and australia  market products and render consulting and training services to customers based in canada  the united kingdom  france  germany  the netherlands  belgium  switzerland  austria  ireland  sweden  south africa  mexico  australia  hong kong  and singapore 
we have established offices in continental europe and australia 
we believe that growth will necessitate expanded international operations requiring a diversion of managerial attention and financial resources 
we anticipate hiring additional personnel to accommodate international growth  and we may also enter into agreements with local distributors  representatives  or resellers 
if we are unable to do one or more of these things in a timely manner  our growth  if any  in our foreign operations will be restricted  and our business  operating results  and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected 
in addition  there can be no assurance that we will be able to maintain or increase international market demand for our products 
most of our international sales are denominated in us dollars 
accordingly  any appreciation of the value of the us dollar relative to the currencies of those countries in which we distribute our products may place us at a competitive disadvantage by effectively making our products more expensive as 
table of contents compared to those of our competitors 
additional risks inherent in our international business activities generally include unexpected changes in regulatory requirements  increased tariffs and other trade barriers  the costs of localizing products for local markets and complying with local business customs  longer accounts receivable patterns and difficulties in collecting foreign accounts receivable  difficulties in enforcing contractual and intellectual property rights  heightened risks of political and economic instability  the possibility of nationalization or expropriation of industries or properties  difficulties in managing international operations  potentially adverse tax consequences including restrictions on repatriating earnings and the threat of double taxation  enhanced accounting and internal control expenses  and the burden of complying with a wide variety of foreign laws 
there can be no assurance that one or more of these factors will not have a material adverse effect on our foreign operations  and  consequentially  our business  operating results  and financial condition 
we face risks related to intellectual property claims or appropriation of our intellectual property rights 
we rely primarily on a combination of copyright  trademark and trade secrets laws  as well as confidentiality agreements to protect our proprietary rights 
in october  we were granted a patent by the united states patent and trademark office relating to the architecture of our systems 
we cannot assure that such patent will not be invalidated or circumvented or that rights granted there under or the description contained therein will provide competitive advantages to our competitors or others 
moreover  despite our efforts to protect our proprietary rights  unauthorized parties may attempt to copy aspects of our products or to obtain the use of information that we regard as proprietary 
in addition  the laws of some foreign countries do not protect our proprietary rights to as great an extent as do the laws of the united states 
there can be no assurance that our means of protecting our proprietary rights will be adequate or that our competitors will not independently develop similar technology 
we are not aware that any of our products infringe the proprietary rights of third parties 
there can be no assurance  however  that third parties will not claim infringement by us with respect to current or future products 
we expect that software product developers will increasingly be subject to infringement claims as the number of products and competitors in our industry segment grows and the functionality of products in different industry segments overlaps 
any such claims  with or without merit  could be time consuming  result in costly litigation  cause product shipment delays  or require us to enter into royalty or licensing agreements 
such royalty or licensing agreements  if required  may not be available on terms acceptable to us or at all  which could have a material adverse effect upon our business  operating results  and financial condition 
item a quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk market risk represents the risk of loss that may affect us due to adverse changes in financial market prices and rates 
our market risk exposure is primarily fluctuations in foreign exchange rates and interest rates 
we have not entered into derivative or hedging transactions to manage risk in connection with such fluctuations 
we derived approximately of our total revenue in from sales to customers based outside of the united states 
certain of our international sales are denominated in foreign currencies 
the price in dollars of products sold outside the united states in foreign currencies will vary as the value of the dollar fluctuates against such foreign currencies 
although our sales denominated in foreign currencies in were not material  there can be no assurance that such sales will not be material in the future and that there will not be increases in the value of the dollar against such currencies that will reduce the dollar return to us on the sale of our products in such foreign currencies 
we believe that at current market interest rates  the fair value of license installments receivable approximates carrying value as reported on our balance sheets 
however  there can be no assurance that the fair value will approximate the carrying value in the future 
factors such as increasing interest rates can reduce the fair value of the license installments receivable 
the carrying value reflects a weighted average of historic discount rates 
the average rate changes with market rates as new license installment receivables are added to the portfolio  which mitigates exposure to market interest rate risk 
a change in the market rates would not have a significant impact on the fair value of our license installments receivable
