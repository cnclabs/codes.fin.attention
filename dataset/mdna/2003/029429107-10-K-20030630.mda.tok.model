the second was a million export credit and security agreement  guaranteed by the export import bank of the united states to support the company s overseas contract  trade finance and working capital needs 
on february   these credit agreements were amended to increase the domestic revolving credit facility to million and to reduce the export credit facility to million in anticipation of higher domestic demand 
this agreement was due to expire on november  these agreements were further amended on november  to reduce the domestic revolving credit facility to million  with maximum borrowings set at the lower of a the sum of of eligible domestic accounts receivable plus the lower of i of eligible raw materials and work in process inventory  or  ii million  or  b million 
in addition  the interest rate and certain financial covenants were amended and the expiration date of the facility was extended to february  in february and may  these agreements were further amended to extend expiration to july  the credit facility  as amended  bears an interest rate at the hsbc bank usa prime rate plus or libor plus at the company s option at march  
at the end of fiscal  there were no borrowings outstanding and million in standby letters of credit were in effect against this credit facility 
no amounts have been drawn against these letters of credit 
the credit agreements are collateralized by certain assets of the company  and contain certain restrictions  including limitations on the amount of distributions that can be made to stockholders  encumbrances of assets  and loans that can be made to officers  and requires the maintenance of certain financial covenants 
as of march   the company was not in compliance with its tangible net worth and earnings covenants  but has obtained a waiver from the bank for these non compliances for the year end 
given the significant losses of fiscal  the company does not expect to be in compliance with the tangible net worth covenant in the coming year 
the company will request waivers of this covenant as required at each quarter end 
if the company is unable to obtain such waivers  hsbc could terminate the company s domestic revolving credit and export credit facilities 
in addition  the current credit agreements expire in july of and there can be no assurance that hsbc will renew the credit agreements or that alternative financing can be obtained 
management believes the company s working capital requirements through march  can be met without the line of credit 
in addition  if the company s credit facility were terminated  it would also preclude the company from obtaining financing through its current secured export credit and security agreement that could negatively impact the company s ability to support international sales 
however  management believes the company s planned level of revenues can be achieved without access to export credit

a total of  shares were sold to accredited investors at a price of each

inflation the company does not believe that inflation has had a material effect on its results of operation 
there can be no assurance  however  that the company s business will not be affected by inflation in the future 
purchase commitments in the normal course of business  the company enters into purchase orders with its vendors for the purchase of materials or services to meet its production needs 
certain single source vendors or vendors producing custom material require significant lead times from order to delivery of their material 
in response to the expected increased demand subsequent to september th  the company entered into certain purchase commitments with key suppliers for this long lead material 
certain of these purchase orders related to these vendors contained cancellation clauses requiring the company to pay for a portion or all of the work in process upon cancellation of an order or to purchase a certain minimum quantities of material by a future date 
should the demand for the company s products decline significantly  or should there be a significant shift in the mix of products being demanded  the company may incur cancellation charges that could be material to the company s results of operations 
to date  the company has not experienced any material losses related to cancellation penalties 
critical accounting policies the company considers certain accounting policies related to revenue recognition  inventories and the related allowance for obsolete and excess inventory  warrant liability  and income taxes to be critical policies due to the estimation processes involved in each 
revenue recognition the company derives a significant portion of its revenue from fixed price contracts  which require the accurate estimation of the cost  and scope of each contract 
the majority of cargosearch systems are sold under fixed price arrangements 
revenue is recognized using percentage of completion accounting  generally using a total costs method to measure the percent complete with revisions to estimates reflected in the period in which changes become known 
if the company does not accurately estimate the resources required or the costs to be incurred under the contracts  then future margins may be significantly and negatively affected or losses on existing contracts may need to be recognized 
any such resulting reductions in margins or contract losses could be material to the company s results of operations 
the company recognizes certain cargosearch system sales and other product revenue  primarily parcelsearch systems and spare parts  in accordance with sec staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition in financial statements sab  as amended by sab a and b 
sab requires that four basic criteria must be met before revenue can be recognized persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred or services rendered  the fee is fixed and determinable  and collectibility is reasonably assured 
determination of criteria and are based on management s judgments regarding the fixed nature of the fee charged for services rendered and products delivered and the collectibility of those fees 
should changes in conditions cause management to determine these criteria are not met for certain future transactions  revenue recognized for any reporting period could be adversely affected 
the company s products are generally covered by a warranty for a one year period 
the company accrues a warranty reserve for estimated costs to provide warranty services 
the company s estimate of costs to service its warranty obligations is based on historical experience and expectation of future conditions 
to the extent the company experiences increased warranty claim activity or increased costs associated with servicing those claims  its warranty accrual will increase resulting in decreased gross profit 
inventories and related allowance for obsolete and excess inventory inventories are valued at the lower of cost or net realizable value on an average cost method 
the company regularly reviews inventory quantities on hand and records a provision for excess and obsolete inventory based primarily on the estimated forecast of product demand over the next twelve to eighteen months 
as demonstrated during and  demand for products can fluctuate significantly 
a significant increase in the demand for the company s products could result in a short term increase in inventory balances while a significant decrease in demand could result in an increase in the amount of excess inventory quantities on hand 
additionally  estimates of future product demand may prove to be inaccurate  in which case the company may have understated or overstated the provision required for excess and obsolete inventory 
in the future  if inventory were determined to be overvalued  the company would be required to recognize such costs in its cost of goods sold at the time of such determination 
likewise  if inventory is determined to be undervalued  the company may have over reported costs of goods sold in previous periods and would be required to recognize such additional operating income at the time of sale 
therefore  although the company makes every effort to ensure the accuracy of forecasts of future product demand  any significant unanticipated changes in demand or technological developments could have a significant impact on the value of its inventory and reported operating results 
warrant liability in fiscal  the company issued  warrants in connection with a private placement offering of common stock 
these warrants can be exchanged for cash under certain circumstances including a merger  sale or tender offer of the company and as such the company recorded the fair value of these warrants as a long term liability on the balance sheet 
the fair value of these warrants is adjusted each period with the resulting gain or loss recorded as other income expense in the statement of operations 
the black scholes method is used to value the warrants and the calculation requires the use of estimates for stock price volatility and interest rates 
the black scholes value of these warrants can fluctuate significantly based on the current fair market value of the company s common stock  changes in interest rates or changes in the volatility of the company s stock price 
income taxes the company accounts for income taxes in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes 
accordingly  the company recognizes deferred income taxes based on the expected future tax consequences of differences between the financial statement basis and the tax basis of assets and liabilities  calculated using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to be reflected in the tax return 
the company records a valuation allowance against any net deferred tax assets if it is more likely than not that they will not be realized 
new accounting pronouncements in november  the fasb issued fasb interpretation no 
 guarantor s accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees  including indirect guarantees of indebtedness of others  which elaborates on required disclosures by a guarantor in its financial statements about obligations under certain guarantees that it has issued and clarifies the need for a guarantor to recognize  at the inception of certain guarantees  a liability for the fair value of the obligation undertaken in issuing the guarantee 
the company has adopted the disclosure provisions of this interpretation for the fiscal year ended march  and has determined that the recognition principles are not applicable 
in november  the task force reached a consensus on emerging issues task force issue no 
 accounting for revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables 
this issue addresses how to determine whether an arrangement involving multiple deliverables contains more than one unit of accounting and how arrangement consideration should be measured and allocated to the separate units of accounting 
this guidance is effective for the company beginning in fiscal with early application permitted 
the company is currently evaluating the impact of this guidance on its revenue recognition policies 
in july  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities fas  which nullifies emerging issues task force eitf issue no 
 liability recognition for certain employee termination benefits and other costs to exit an activity including certain costs incurred in a restructuring 
fas requires a liability for a cost associated with an exit or disposal activity be recognized and measured initially at its fair value in the period in which the liability is incurred 
if fair value cannot be reasonably estimated  the liability shall be recognized initially in the period in which fair value can be reasonably estimated 
the provisions of fas will be effective for the company prospectively for exit or disposal activities initiated after december   however  this standard is not expected to have a significant impact on its financial condition  results of operations  or cash flows 
in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure an amendment of fasb statement no 
fas 
this statement amends sfas no 
accounting for stock based compensation fas to provide alternative methods of voluntarily transitioning to the fair value based method of accounting for stock based employee compensation 
fas also amends the disclosure requirements of fas to require disclosure of the method used to account for stock based employee compensation and the effect of the method on reported results in both annual and interim financial statements 
the amended disclosure provisions are effective for the fiscal years ending after december  and the company has adopted the amended disclosure provisions as of march  the company has not decided whether it will voluntarily change to the fair value based method of accounting for stock based employee compensation at this time 
in january  the fasb issued fasb interpretation no 
 consolidation of variable interest entities and interpretation of arb fin  which requires the consolidation of certain entities considered to be variable interest entities vie s 
an entity is considered to be a vie when it has equity investors which lack the characteristics of a controlling financial interest  or its capital is insufficient to permit it to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support 
consolidation of a vie by an investor is required when it is determined that the investor will absorb a majority of the vie s expected losses or residual returns if they occur 
the company adopted fin as of march  and such adoption did not have an effect on the consolidated financial statements 
forward looking information and factors affecting future performance some of the statements contained in this report and in the documents incorporated by reference are forward looking made pursuant to the safe harbor provisions of the private securities litigation reform act of in essence  forward looking statements are predictions of future events 
although we would not make forward looking statements unless we believe we have a reasonable basis for doing so  we cannot guarantee their accuracy and actual results may differ materially from those we anticipated due to a number of uncertainties  many of which we are not aware 
it should also be understood that we have no plans to update our forward looking statements 
our forward looking statements are accurate only as of the date of this report  or in the case of forward looking statements in documents incorporated by reference  as of the date of those documents 
certain risk factors  which might cause actual results to differ materially from those projected or that may otherwise affect future performance  are set forth below 
the company s reliance on a small number of customers for a large portion of its revenues could harm its business and prospects 
the company s business is heavily dependent on sales to a small number of customers  which include agencies of the united states government 
during fiscal  four customers accounted for of the company s total revenues 
during fiscal  five customers accounted for of the company s total revenues and during fiscal  three customers accounted for of total revenues 
during fiscal  the company s largest customer  an agency of the us government  accounted for approximately of total revenues 
in general  the company s government contracts may be terminated at the government s discretion 
the termination of the company s relationship with one or more of its significant customers or the reduction or delay of orders of its systems by these customers would substantially reduce the company s revenues and its business and prospects may be harmed 
the company conducts its business worldwide  which exposes it to a number of difficulties in coordinating its international activities and dealing with multiple regulatory environments 
the company s international business  including sales to foreign governments  accounted for approximately  and of its net revenues for the fiscal years ended march   march  and march   respectively 
although fiscal revenues reflect a focus domestically  the company anticipates that international sales will account for a significant percentage of its revenues in the future 
as a result of the company s worldwide business operations  it is subject to various risks  including international regulatory requirements and policy changes  lengthy sales cycles  longer payment cycles of foreign customers  difficulties in inventory management  accounts receivable collection and the management of distributors or representatives  difficulties in staffing and managing foreign operations  geopolitical instability  political and economic changes and disruptions  favoritism towards local suppliers  governmental currency controls  currency exchange rate fluctuations  and tariff regulations 
although the company s international sales have been denominated primarily in us dollars  changes in currency exchange rates that increase the relative value of the us dollar may make it more difficult for the company to compete with foreign manufacturers on price or otherwise have a material adverse effect on its sales and operating results 
the homeland security focus has increased financial expectations that may not materialize 
following the september  terrorist attacks  the united states government made it a national priority with the creation of the office of homeland security and other initiatives to increase security in airports  high threat federal facilities  us military bases  and seaports and borders 
the efforts of the united states government to revamp security in the united states have resulted in increased interest in the company s x ray inspection products 
the company is uncertain whether the level of demand for its products will be as high as anticipated 
the company is uncertain what solutions  if any  ultimately will be adopted and implemented by the united states government and other international entities to combat terrorism and whether the company s products will be a part of the solution 
even if the company s products are considered as part of the security solution  it is unclear what level the company will be involved and how quickly funding to purchase its products may be made available 
the company may incur non recoverable expenditures in anticipation of future demand for its products that may not materialize 
all of these factors may adversely impact the company s operations and create unpredictability in its revenues and operating results 
the company s lengthy sales cycle requires it to incur significant expenses with no assurance that it will generate revenue or recover such expenses 
a substantial portion of the company s sales depends in significant part upon the decision of governmental agencies to upgrade or expand security at border crossing inspection sites  existing airports  seaports and other facilities 
accordingly  a portion of the company s product sales is subject to delays associated with the lengthy approval processes that often accompany such capital expenditures 
during these approval periods  the company expends significant financial and managerial resources in anticipation of future orders that may not occur 
if the company fails to receive an order after expending these resources  it may be unable to generate sufficient revenue to recover the costs incurred and its business and prospects may be harmed 
the company s business is dependent upon governmental policies and appropriations 
the company s largest customers are governmental agencies and demand for its products is dependent upon national priorities and governmental initiatives 
these priorities and initiatives are subject to change from time to time in response to the economic and political environment 
the company is also exposed to the united states budget approval and appropriation cycle  which may be subject to significant and unpredictable delays 
if demand for the company s products is reduced because of a change in economic or political conditions or if there are delays in receiving governmental approvals and appropriations  sales of the company s products may be adversely affected and its business and prospects may be harmed 
changes in governmental regulations may reduce demand for the company s products or increase its expenses 
the company competes in markets in which the company or its customers must comply with federal  state  local and foreign regulations  such as health and safety regulations 
the company develops  configures and markets its products to meet its customers needs created by these regulations 
any significant change in these regulations could reduce demand for the company s products or increase its costs to comply with new regulations  both of which may adversely affect its operating results 
the company s reliance on only a limited number of suppliers for some key components for its products could harm its business and prospects 
the company relies on only a limited number of suppliers for some key components for its products 
the company s reliance on limited supply sources reduces its control over timely delivery  price increases  reliability  and quality of critical components 
obtaining alternative sources of supply of these key components could involve significant delays and other costs  and may not be available to the company on reasonable terms  if at all 
if the company changes any of its suppliers  the potential new supplier would be required to go through a qualification process  creating potential delays or reductions in product shipments 
the failure of any supplier to provide quality and timely components at an acceptable price  or an interruption of supplies from such a supplier could result in lost or deferred sales  which would harm the company s business and prospects 
fluctuations in the company s quarterly operating results may cause its stock price to decline 
given the nature of the markets in which the company participates  it cannot reliably predict future revenue and profitability 
a high proportion of the company s costs are fixed  due in part to its significant sales  research and development  and manufacturing costs 
as a result of its fixed costs  small declines in revenue could disproportionately affect the company s operating results in a quarter 
factors that may affect the company s quarterly operating results and the market price of its common stock include demand for and market acceptance of its x ray inspection systems  lengthy sales cycles and the effect of large orders  changes in political agendas or national priorities  adverse changes in the level of economic activity in regions in which the company does business  political unrest in the regions where the company transacts business  adverse changes in industries on which the company is particularly dependent  competitive pressures resulting in lower selling prices for its products  changes in the portions of its revenue represented by its various products and customers  delays or problems in the introduction of new products  the company s competitors announcement or introduction of new products  services or technological innovations  variations in the company s product mix  the timing and amount of the company s expenditures in anticipation of future sales  increased costs of raw materials or supplies  and changes in the volume or timing of product orders 
the company could incur substantial costs as a result of product liability claims and adverse publicity if its x ray inspection systems fail to detect bombs  explosives  weapons  contraband or other threats to personal safety 
if the company s x ray inspection systems fail to detect the presence of bombs  explosives  weapons  contraband or other threats to personal safety  the company could be subject to product liability claims and negative publicity  which could result in increased costs  reduced sales  and a decline in the market price of the company s common stock 
there are many factors beyond the company s control that could result in the failure of its products to detect the presence of bombs  explosives  weapons  contraband or other threats to personal safety 
examples of these factors include operator error or misuse of or malfunction of its equipment 
the failure of the company s systems to detect the presence of these dangerous materials may lead to personal injury  loss of life  and extensive property damage and resulting claims against the company 
the company s insurance may be insufficient to protect it from product liability claims 
the company s product liability and umbrella liability insurance may be insufficient to protect it from product liability claims 
moreover  there is a risk that product liability insurance will not continue to be available to the company at a reasonable cost  if at all 
if liability claims exceed the company s current or available insurance coverage  its business and prospects may be harmed 
regardless of the adequacy of the company s product liability insurance protection  any significant claim may have an adverse affect on its industry and market reputation  leading to a substantial decrease in demand for its products and reduced revenues 
the company may not be able to fund its research and development activities 
the company generates funds for its research and development activities from operations  private sources and the government 
the company may be unable to generate the funds necessary to support its research and development activities if it does not generate sufficient funds from operations  other potential private sources  or the government 
the company may not successfully compete with other companies and research institutions for government funding and funding from other private sources 
additionally  government funding priorities are subject to frequent changes 
for example  in fiscal and  the company earned  and  respectively  for government sponsored research and development 
in fiscal the company did not receive any funds to conduct government sponsored research and development 
there is no guarantee that the company will receive funds for government sponsored research in the future 
if the company is unable to fund its research and development activities through its operations or from outside sources  the company may be unable to continue to innovate or bring its innovations to market on a timely or cost effective basis  or its innovations may be surpassed by other competitors or new technologies 
the company s success depends on new product development 
the company s continuing research and development program is designed to develop new products and to enhance and improve its current products 
the company plans to expend significant resources on the development of its new products 
the successful development of its products and product enhancements is subject to numerous risks  both known and unknown  including unanticipated delays  access to capital  budget overruns  technical problems  and other difficulties that could result in the abandonment or substantial change in the design  development and commercialization of new products and product enhancements  including  for example  changes requested or required by governmental and regulatory agencies 
given the uncertainties inherent with product development and introduction of x ray inspection systems  the company cannot assure that its product development efforts will be successful on a timely basis or within budget  if at all 
the company s failure to develop new products and product enhancements on a timely basis or within budget would harm its business and prospects 
the company s success depends upon its ability to adapt to rapid changes in technology and customer requirements 
the market for the company s products has been characterized by rapid technological changes  frequent product introductions and evolving industry standards and customer requirements 
the company believes that these trends will continue into the foreseeable future 
the company s success will depend  in part  upon its ability to enhance its existing products  successfully develop new products that meet changing customer and regulatory requirements and gain market acceptance 
if the company fails to do so  its products may be rendered obsolete or uncompetitive by new industry standards or changing technology  in which case its revenue and operating results would suffer 
in developing any new product  the company may be required to make a substantial investment before it can determine the commercial viability of the new product 
if the company fails to accurately foresee its customers needs and future activities  it may invest heavily in research and development of products that do not lead to significant revenue 
the company may not be able to compete successfully 
a number of companies have developed products that compete with the company s x ray inspection products 
many of the company s competitors are larger and have greater financial resources than it does 
some of its competitors have more extensive research  marketing and manufacturing capabilities and greater technical and personnel resources than the company does  and may be better positioned to continue to improve their technology in order to compete in an evolving industry 
the company s failure to compete successfully could decrease demand for its products or make its products obsolete 
in the inspection systems market  competition is based primarily on the following factors product performance  functionality and quality  price  the overall costs of the system  prior customer relationships  technological capabilities of the product  certification by government authorities  local market presence  and breadth of sales and service organization 
to remain competitive  the company must develop new products and periodically enhance its existing products in a timely manner 
the company anticipates that it may have to adjust the prices of some of its products to stay competitive 
in addition  new competitors may emerge  and entire product lines may be threatened by new technologies or market trends that reduce the value of these product lines 
the company s business could be harmed if it is unable to protect its intellectual property 
the company relies primarily on a combination of trade secrets  patents  copyrights  trademarks  licensing arrangements and confidentiality procedures to protect its technology 
despite its precautions  the steps the company has taken to protect its technology may be inadequate 
existing trade secret  patent  trademark and copyright laws offer only limited protection 
the company s patents could be invalidated or circumvented 
the laws of some foreign countries in which the company s products are or may be developed  manufactured or sold may not protect its products or intellectual property rights to the same extent as do the laws of the united states 
this may make the possibility of piracy of the company s technology and products more likely 
the company cannot assure that the steps it has taken to protect its intellectual property will be adequate to prevent misappropriation of its technology 
the company s business could be harmed if it is unable to protect its intellectual property 
the company s business may be materially and adversely affected by infringement claims initiated by the company or its competitors 
initiating or defending against the enforcement of the company s intellectual property rights may result in significant  protracted  and costly litigation 
the company was previously involved in civil litigation filed by a competitor seeking a declaratory judgment that the competitor s product did not infringe upon certain of the company s patents 
the company was successful in that action 
the company is currently involved in a civil action filed by the company against a competitor alleging patent infringement and misappropriation of trade secrets 
the company expects intellectual property disputes to be an ordinary part of its business for the foreseeable future 
the company may initiate claims or litigation against third parties for infringement of its intellectual property rights  or to establish the validity of its property rights 
there can be no assurance that the company will prevail in any such action 
litigation by or against the company could result in significant expense to it and divert the efforts of technical and management personnel  whether or not such litigation results in a favorable outcome for the company 
in the event of an adverse result in any such litigation  the company could be required to pay substantial damages  cease the manufacture  use and sale of infringing products  expend significant resources to develop non infringing technology  discontinue the use of certain processes  or obtain licenses for the infringing technology 
if a license were required  the company cannot assure that it would be able to obtain one on commercially reasonable terms  if at all 
the company cannot assure that it will be successful in developing non infringing technology or that the cost or time required to develop such technology will be reasonable 
the company s success depends on its ability to attract and retain qualified management professionals 
due to the recent departures of our ceo and other members of our senior management team  future operating results will be largely dependent upon our ability to recruit and retain the services of professionals to fill these roles from a limited pool of qualified candidates 
our future success will continue to depend in large measure upon the continued contributions of our senior management team and other key personnel 
if we lose professionals or are unable to attract new talent  we will not be able to maintain our position in the market or grow our business

the company may require additional capital to finance continuing operations 
the company cannot assure that operations will continue to be profitable  that it will generate levels of revenues and cash flows sufficient to fund operations  or  if necessary  that the company will be able to obtain additional financing on satisfactory terms  if at all 
any existing financing arrangements may not be available or sufficient to meet the company s cash needs or may not be available in the future  or  if available  at a cost that the company believes is reasonable 
given the significant losses of fiscal  the company does not expect to be in compliance with the tangible net worth covenant contained in its credit agreements with hsbc bank usa hsbc in the coming year 
the company will request waivers of this covenant as required at each quarter end 
to the extent the company is unable to obtain such waivers  hsbc could terminate the company s domestic revolving credit and export credit facilities 
in addition  the current credit agreements expire in july of and there can be no assurance that hsbc will renew the credit agreements or that alternative financing can be obtained 
management believes the company s working capital requirements through march  can be met without the line of credit 
in addition  to the extent the company s credit facility is terminated  it would preclude the company from obtaining financing through its current secured export credit and security agreement which could negatively impact the company s ability to support international sales
