item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations introduction management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations contains forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
the actual results achieved by the company may differ significantly from the results discussed in the forward looking statements 
factors that might cause such differences include general economic  market  or business conditions  the opportunities or lack thereof that may be presented to and pursued by the company  the availability and price of raw materials used by the company  competitive actions by other companies  changes in laws or regulations  the accuracy of certain judgments and estimates concerning the integration of gaylord into the operations of the company  the accuracy of certain judgments and estimates concerning the company s streamlining project  and other factors  many of which are beyond the control of the company 
results of operations for the years ended december  and summary consolidated revenues were billion in  billion in and billion in income from continuing operations was million in  million in and million in income from continuing operations per diluted share was in  in and in business segments the company manages its operations through three business segments corrugated packaging  building products and financial services 
each of these business segments is affected by the factors of supply and demand and changes in domestic and global economic conditions 
these conditions include changes in interest rates  new housing starts  home repair and remodeling activities and the strength of the us dollar  some or all of which may have varying degrees of impact on the business segments 
as used herein  the term parent company refers to the company and its manufacturing business segments  the corrugated packaging group and the building products group  with the financial services group reported on the equity method 
the company acquired effective control of gaylord container corporation gaylord and began consolidating the results of gaylord on march  in may  the company sold million shares of common stock and issued million of upper decs sm units and million of senior notes due the company also acquired a box plant in puerto rico in march  certain assets of mack packaging group  inc in may and fibre innovations llc in november in the aggregate  these transactions significantly increased the assets and operations of the company and its corrugated packaging group and changed the capital structure of the company 
as a result  financial information is not comparable to prior periods 
none of these acquisitions resulted in the creation of any new business segments 
the corrugated packaging group the corrugated packaging group manufactures linerboard and corrugating medium that it converts into a complete line of corrugated and specialty packaging 
the corrugated packaging group operations consist of five linerboard mills  one corrugating medium mill  converting plants  ten specialty converting plants and an interest in a gypsum facing paper joint venture 
the corrugated packaging group s facilities are located throughout the united states and in mexico and puerto rico 
the corrugated packaging group s revenues are principally derived from the sale of corrugated packaging products and  to a lesser degree  from the sale of linerboard in the domestic and export markets 
the corrugated packaging group began consolidating the results of gaylord on march  gaylord was primarily engaged in the manufacture and sale of corrugated containers and linerboard through its  ton linerboard mill in bogalusa  louisiana  its  ton recycle linerboard mill in antioch  california  and its converting facilities 
the company permanently closed gaylord s antioch mill in september in addition  the company ceased operating two machines at the bogalusa mill in as a result of this acquisition  the corrugated packaging group is the third largest us manufacturer in the corrugated packaging industry 
the corrugated packaging group also acquired a box plant in puerto rico in march and certain assets of mack packaging group  inc in may and fibre innovations llc in november due to the integration of the acquired operations  the incremental effects on the corrugated packaging group s operating income associated with these acquisitions cannot be readily quantified but is considered to be significant 
in  the corrugated packaging group completed the acquisition of the corrugated packaging operations of chesapeake corporation  elgin corrugated box company and compro packaging llc 
these operations consist of corrugated converting plants in eight states 
these acquired operations did not contribute significantly to the corrugated packaging group s operating income 
the corrugated packaging group s revenues were billion in compared with billion in and billion in the corrugated packaging group s revenues from the sale of corrugated packaging represented percent of this group s revenues in compared with percent in and percent in the remaining revenues are derived from the sales of linerboard and other products 
the change in revenues in was principally due to the inclusion of the acquired operations  approximately million  partially offset by lower corrugated packaging and linerboard prices and volumes 
average corrugated packaging prices were down five percent while pro forma corrugated packaging shipments including gaylord were down three percent in compared with corrugated packaging prices and shipments continue to be adversely affected by the weak economy 
average linerboard prices were down seven percent while pro forma linerboard shipments including gaylord were down nine percent in compared with linerboard markets continue to be adversely affected by the weak economy and increased offshore containerboard capacity 
revenues were unchanged in as the inclusion of the acquired corrugated packaging operations  approximately million  was offset by lower corrugated packaging volumes and lower linerboard prices 
average corrugated packaging prices were up two percent  while corrugated packaging shipments were down three percent compared with pro forma shipments including the acquired operations for corrugated packaging prices and shipments were adversely affected by the weak economy 
average linerboard prices were down seven percent while linerboard shipments were down percent 
linerboard markets were adversely affected by the weak economy and increased offshore containerboard capacity 
revenues and volumes were also affected by the poor performance of the specialty packaging operations 
the change in revenues in was due to higher corrugated packaging prices  up percent  with essentially no change in volumes coupled with higher linerboard prices  up percent  partially offset by lower linerboard shipments  down ten percent 
in and  average corrugated packaging prices and shipments were adversely affected by the weak economy while linerboard markets were adversely affected by the weak economy and increased offshore containerboard capacity 
it is likely that these factors will continue to have an adverse effect on the corrugated packaging group s revenues and operating results in costs  which include production  distribution and administrative costs  were billion in compared with billion in and billion in the change in costs in was primarily due to the inclusion of the acquired operations 
other factors increasing costs in included higher occ costs  up million  higher pension costs  up million  and higher depreciation expense  up million  resulting from the addition of the acquired property and equipment 
factors decreasing costs in included lower energy costs  down million  less goodwill amortization  down million  and lower expenses associated with the specialty packaging operations 
the change in costs in was due to the inclusion of the acquired corrugated packaging operations  higher energy costs  up million  higher labor and benefit costs  up million  higher technology costs  up million  and higher costs associated with the specialty packaging operations 
factors decreasing costs in were lower occ costs  down million  and lower depreciation expense  down million  due to the lengthening of estimated useful lives of certain production equipment beginning january the changes in costs in were primarily due to higher energy costs  up million  higher occ costs and increased outside purchases of corrugating medium 
occ prices continue to fluctuate from year to year 
occ costs averaged per ton in compared with per ton in and per ton in at year end  occ prices were per ton compared with per ton at year end and per ton at year end occ represented percent of the group s fiber requirements during compared with percent in and percent in energy costs  principally natural gas  also continue to fluctuate from year to year 
energy costs began to rise during second quarter  peaked during second quarter and began to decline the remainder of reaching more normalized levels by year end energy costs remained at these levels during most of  but began to rise during fourth quarter and have continued to rise in early it is likely that occ and energy costs will continue to fluctuate during mill production was million tons in compared with million tons in and million tons in of the mill production  percent in  percent in and percent in was used by the corrugated packaging operations 
the remainder was sold in the domestic and export markets 
in september  the  ton per year capacity recycle linerboard mill in antioch  california obtained in the acquisition of gaylord was permanently closed 
also in september  the no 
paper machine at the orange  texas linerboard mill resumed full production 
this machine was shut down in december due to weak market conditions 
mill production was curtailed by  tons in due to market  maintenance and operational reasons  compared with  tons in and  tons in the corrugated packaging group will likely continue to curtail production in for these reasons 
at year end  the corrugated packaging group s annual linerboard and medium mill capacity is million tons of which approximately percent is dependent on virgin fiber and approximately percent is dependent on recycled raw materials such as occ 
in connection with the closure of the antioch mill  the corrugated packaging group established accruals for the estimated costs of closure 
these closure accruals aggregated million  which consisted of million for involuntary terminations of the work force  million for contract terminations  million for environmental compliance and million for demolition and clean up 
these accruals were recognized as liabilities incurred in connection with the acquisition of gaylord and are included in the allocation of the purchase price 
at year end  the remaining balance of the accruals aggregated million 
it is expected that the majority of these accruals will be paid in the carrying value of the antioch mill s property and equipment was adjusted to its estimated fair value less cost to sell 
it is expected that these assets will be sold in and market conditions continue to be weak for gypsum facing paper 
as a result  the corrugated packaging group s premier boxboard limited llc joint venture continues to produce corrugating medium  of which the corrugated packaging group purchased  tons in   tons in and  tons in it is uncertain when market conditions for lightweight gypsum facing paper will improve to levels that eliminate the venture s need to produce corrugating medium 
of the non strategic assets obtained in the gaylord acquisition  the retail bag business  the multi wall bag business  the kraft paper mill and other non strategic assets have been sold for aggregate proceeds of approximately million 
the only non strategic asset that remains is the chemical business  which is anticipated to be sold upon the resolution of its toxic tort litigation 
the operating results and cash flows of these operations are classified as discontinued operations and are excluded from business segment operating income 
in addition  the corrugated packaging group terminated employees of gaylord s corporate and divisional staff in in  the corrugated packaging group sold its corrugated packaging operation in chile at a loss of million 
the corrugated packaging group also restructured and downsized its specialty packaging operations at a loss of million and recognized an impairment charge of million related to its interest in a glass bottling venture operation in puerto rico 
these losses are included in other operating expenses and excluded from business segment operating income 
the corrugated packaging group is continuing its efforts to enhance return on investment 
these include reviewing operations that are unable to meet return objectives and determining appropriate courses of action including the possible consolidation and rationalization of converting facilities 
the corrugated packaging group s business segment operating income was million in compared with million in and million in the building products group the building products group manufactures a variety of building products including lumber  particleboard  medium density fiberboard mdf  gypsum wallboard and fiberboard 
the building products group operations consist of facilities including a particleboard plant and an mdf plant operated under long term operating lease agreements and interests in a gypsum wallboard joint venture and an mdf joint venture 
the building products group operates in the united states and canada and manages the company s million acres of owned and leased timberlands located in texas  louisiana  georgia and alabama 
the building products group s revenues are principally derived from the sale of its building products and to a lesser degree from sales of timberlands 
the building products group s revenues were million in compared with million in and million in the change in revenues in was due to higher average prices for mdf and gypsum and higher shipments of all products  partially offset by lower average prices for particleboard and lumber 
average prices for lumber were down six percent and particleboard prices were down percent while average prices for mdf were up three percent and gypsum prices were up percent 
shipments for all products were up with lumber shipments up five percent  particleboard up percent  mdf up percent and gypsum up percent 
in  prices for lumber were down five percent  particleboard down percent  and gypsum down percent  while prices for mdf were up four percent due to improved product mix 
in  shipments of lumber were up percent  particleboard down percent  gypsum down percent and mdf up five percent 
lumber shipments were up primarily due to the new pineland sawmill  which began operations in second quarter particleboard shipments were down due to weaker market conditions and the explosion at the mount jewett facility  which closed the facility for about five months during the change in revenues in was due to increased shipments resulting from additional manufacturing facilities partially offset by lower average prices in most product lines 
in and  lumber prices were adversely affected by over capacity and increased imports 
it is likely that these conditions will continue in other revenues include sales of high value timberlands and deliveries under a long term fiber supply agreement entered into in connection with the sale of the bleached paperboard operations 
the contribution to the building products group s operating income from sales of high value lands was million in compared with million in and million in costs  which include production  distribution and administrative costs  were million in compared with million in and million in the change in costs in was due to higher production volumes and higher pension costs  up million  partially offset by lower energy costs  down million 
fiber costs were up three percent 
the change in costs in was due to lower production volumes  lower depreciation expense  down million  and the disposition of the fiber cement venture during third quarter offset by higher energy costs  up million 
the decrease in depreciation expense was due to the lengthening of estimated useful lives of certain production equipment beginning january fiber costs were down percent 
the change in costs in was due to additional manufacturing facilities  an increase in energy costs  up million  and million of operating losses from the fiber cement venture 
fiber costs were up four percent 
energy costs  principally natural gas  continue to fluctuate from year to year 
energy costs began to rise during second quarter  peaked during second quarter and began to decline the remainder of reaching more normalized levels by year end energy costs remained at these levels during most of  but began to rise during fourth quarter and have continued to rise in early it is likely that energy costs will continue to fluctuate during production was curtailed to varying degrees due to market conditions in most product lines 
production averaged from a low of percent to a high of percent of capacity in the various product lines in compared with a low of percent to a high of percent of capacity in the building products group s joint venture operations also experienced production curtailments in and due to market conditions 
the building products group and its joint venture operations will likely continue to curtail production to varying degrees due to market conditions in the various product lines in the building products group s del tin fiber llc mdf joint venture in el dorado  arkansas  continues to experience production and cost issues 
in first quarter  this facility was shut down due to market conditions  higher energy prices and reconstruction of the heat energy system of the plant 
production at this facility resumed in second quarter in second quarter  deltic timber corporation  the partner in this venture  announced its intentions to evaluate strategic alternatives for its one half interest in the venture 
in january  deltic timber announced its intention to exit this business upon the earliest  reasonable opportunity provided by the market 
as a result of this decision  deltic timber recognized an million after tax charge 
it is uncertain what effects deltic timber s decision will have on the joint venture or its operations 
at year end  the building products group s equity investment in the venture was million  and it has agreed to fund up to million of the venture s debt service obligations as needed 
in  the building products group contributed million to the venture 
at year end  the venture had million in working capital  million in property and equipment and million in net long term debt 
for the year  the venture had million in revenues and a net loss of million of which the building products group s share was million 
in  the building products group performed a review of its million acres of timberlands and classified them into three categories strategic  million acres  non strategic   acres  and high value   acres 
in september  approximately  acres of the non strategic timberlands were sold for million resulting in a gain of million  which was included in other income 
the remaining non strategic timberlands will be sold over time 
the high value land is located around atlanta  georgia and will be sold over time 
in   acres of these high value lands were sold compared with  acres in the building products group is continuing its efforts to enhance return on investment  including reviewing operations that are unable to meet return objectives and determining appropriate courses of action 
in addition  the building products group is continuing to address production cost and market issues at its particleboard and mdf facilities  including the del tin fiber mdf joint venture 
the building products group s business segment operating income was million in compared with million in and million in the financial services group the financial services group operates a savings bank and engages in mortgage banking  real estate and insurance brokerage activities 
the savings bank  guaranty bank guaranty  conducts its retail business through banking centers in texas and california 
commercial and residential lending activities are conducted in over markets in states and the district of columbia 
the mortgage banking operation originates single family mortgages and services them for guaranty and unrelated third parties 
mortgage origination offices are located in states 
real estate operations include the development of residential subdivisions and multifamily housing and the management and sale of income producing properties  which are principally located in texas  colorado  florida  tennessee  california and missouri 
the insurance brokerage operation sells a full range of insurance products 
in  the financial services group acquired five savings bank branches in northern california and an insurance agency operation in los angeles 
in  the financial services group acquired an asset based loan portfolio and two mortgage production operations 
in  the financial services group acquired american finance group  inc afg  a commercial finance company engaged in leasing and secured lending 
pro forma results  assuming these acquisitions had been effected at the beginning of the appropriate periods  would not be significantly different from those presented 
operations the financial services group revenues  consisting of interest and noninterest income  were billion in compared with billion in and billion in selected financial information for the financial services group follows for the year in millions net interest income provision for loan losses noninterest income noninterest expense segment operating income severance and asset write offs income before taxes net interest income was million in compared with million in and million in the change in net interest income in was due to the maintenance of an asset sensitive position  a change in the mix of average earning assets and a competitive market for deposits 
in  the financial services group maintained an asset sensitive position whereby the rate and pre payment characteristics of its assets were more responsive to changes in market interest rates than its liabilities 
as a result  the declining interest rate environment encountered in coupled with a change in the mix of earning assets to lower risk  lower yield  single family residential related earning assets negatively affected net interest income 
the change in net interest income in was primarily due to growth and changes in the mix of average earning assets and interest bearing liabilities 
to assist in quantifying these matters the following table presents average balances  interest income and expense and rates by major balance sheet categories for the year average yield average yield average yield balance interest rate balance interest rate balance interest rate dollars in millions assets cash equivalents securities    loans a    loans held for sale total earning assets     other assets    total assets    liabilities and equity deposits interest bearing demand    savings deposits time deposits    total deposits    advances from fhlbs    securities sold under repurchase agreements  other debt preferred stock issued by subsidiaries total other borrowings    total interest bearing liabilities    obligations to settle trade date securities other liabilities shareholder s equity    total liabilities and equity    interest rate spread net interest income margin a includes nonaccruing loans 
average earning assets increased billion in  primarily due to an increase in securities 
a mortgage backed securities purchase program  begun in late  resulted in an increase in average us government agency mortgage backed securities of billion in the increase in average securities was partially offset by a million decline in average loans 
the decline in average loans was due primarily to decreases of million in average single family mortgage loans  million in average consumer and other loans and million in average commercial real estate loans  which were partially offset by a million increase in commercial and business loans 
in addition  average loans held for sale increased million in average earning assets increased million in primarily due to an increase in average loans and average loans held for sale 
approximately million of the increase in average loans was the result of the first quarter acquisition of an asset based lending portfolio and the first quarter acquisition of afg 
the remainder was due to internally generated growth  primarily in average residential loans and average commercial and business loans 
in addition  average loans held for sale increased million in average interest bearing liabilities increased million in primarily due to an increase in other borrowings partially offset by a decrease in deposits 
average other borrowings increased billion due primarily to an increase in average securities sold under repurchase agreements resulting from the mortgage backed securities purchase program partially offset by a million decrease in average advances from fhlbs 
the decrease in average interest bearing deposits of million in was the result of very competitive markets partially offset by branch and deposit acquisitions 
despite paying rates for new deposits at an historically high interest rate spread  non renewed maturing deposits exceeded new deposits in see note g to the financial services group summarized financial statements for further information regarding deposits 
average interest bearing liabilities increased million in due primarily to an increase in average other borrowings  principally advances from fhlbs partially offset by a million decrease in average interest bearing deposits in very competitive markets

the financial services group is a party to various interest rate corridor and cap agreements  which reduce the impact of increases in interest rates on its investments in adjustable rate mortgage backed securities that have lifetime interest rate caps 
these corridor and cap agreements do not qualify for hedge accounting and are therefore recorded at fair value 
the changes in fair value  which are not material  are included in the determination of net interest income 
the fair value of these corridor and cap agreements at year end and was immaterial 
there were no material changes in risk management policies as a result of applying hedge accounting in see note m to the financial services group summarized financial statements for further information regarding hedging strategies 
in  net interest income was adversely affected by the maintenance of an asset sensitive position in a declining interest rate environment coupled with a change in the mix of earning assets to lower risk  lower yield  single family residential related earning assets 
if interest rates continue to decline in it is likely that net interest income will continue to be adversely affected 
however  if interest rates begin to rise in  then it is likely that net interest income would be positively affected 
the provision for loan losses was million in compared with million in and million in the provision related primarily to the commercial and business portfolio 
this portfolio includes large syndications  middle market lending  asset based lending and equipment leasing 
both the asset based lending and equipment leasing areas continued to show weakness in significant provisions were required on several borrowers with ties to air transportation  which was affected by the downturn related to the events of september  the provision primarily related to a decline in asset quality related to loans in the senior housing  commercial and asset based lending portfolios 
the provision primarily related to large syndications in the commercial and business portfolio 
noninterest income includes service charges  fees and revenues from mortgage banking  real estate and insurance activities 
noninterest income was million in compared with million in and million in the increase in noninterest income in was due to increases in income from mortgage banking operations of million  service charges on deposits of million and insurance operations of million 
these were partially offset by declines in income from real estate operations of million  loan related fees and gains on sale of loans of million and income from operating leases of million 
see mortgage banking activities for further information regarding mortgage banking operations 
the increase in income from insurance operations was primarily due to an agency acquisition in first quarter the decline in income from the real estate operations was primarily related to the decline in lot sales as activity in residential development slowed with the downturn in the economy 
the decline in loan related fees and gains on sale of loans was primarily due to lower loan origination activity 
the financial services group is no longer originating equipment leases 
as a result  the income from operating leases is declining as the portfolio pays off 
the increase in noninterest income in was due to increased income from mortgage banking operations of million  insurance operations of million  loan related fees and gains on sale of loans of million and fee based products of million 
these were partially offset by a decline in income from real estate operations of million 
noninterest expense includes compensation and benefits  real estate operations  occupancy and data processing expenses 
noninterest expense  including severance and asset write offs  was million in compared with million in and million in the increase in noninterest expense in was primarily due to an increase in costs associated with mortgage banking operations of million and compensation and benefits associated with the insurance agency acquisition of million 
during first quarter  due to a slow down in loan demand  the financial services group took actions to lower costs and exit certain businesses and product delivery methods that were not expected to meet return objectives in the near term 
these actions resulted in a million charge related to severance for work force reductions and the write off of certain technology investments 
this restructuring and other cost reduction activities that occurred throughout resulted in a reduction in compensation and benefits of million  professional services of million  advertising and promotional expense of million and occupancy of million 
the increase in noninterest expense in was primarily due to an increase in costs associated with mortgage banking operations of million and costs related to the asset based portfolio acquisition and new product offerings

these purchases are part of a mortgage backed securities purchase program that began in late the increase in was the result of purchases and securitizations of million  partially offset by maturities and prepayments 
virtually all of these securities held at year end were classified as variable no maturity 
see note d to the financial services group summarized financial statements for further information regarding securities 
mortgage loans held for sale were billion at year end compared with million at year end and million at year end the increases in and were the result of high refinancing activities due to the low interest rate environment and growth in the mortgage production operations due to acquisitions in loans were billion at year end compared with billion at year end and billion at year end the following table summarizes the composition of the loan portfolio at year end in millions single family mortgage      single family mortgage warehouse single family construction  multifamily and senior housing     total residential      commercial real estate      commercial and business    consumer and other total loans      less allowance for loan losses single family mortgages are made to owners to finance the purchase of a home 
single family mortgage warehouse loans provide funding to mortgage lenders to support the flow of loans from origination to sale 
single family construction loans finance the development and construction of single family homes  condominiums and town homes  including the acquisition and development of home lots 
multifamily and senior housing loans are for the development  construction and lease up of apartment projects and housing for independent  assisted and memory impaired residents 
commercial real estate loans provide funding for the development  construction and lease up primarily of office  retail and industrial projects and are geographically diversified among market areas in states and the district of columbia 
commercial and business loans finance business operations and are primarily composed of large syndications  asset based and middle market loans and direct financing leases on equipment 
the financial services group is no longer originating equipment leases  and  as a result  this portfolio is declining as the leases pay off 
consumer and other loans are primarily composed of loans secured by junior liens on single family homes 
in  the financial services group focused on altering the mix of loans to reduce the overall risk in the portfolio 
as a result  residential loans represent percent of the loan portfolio at year end compared with percent at year end and percent at year end in  single family mortgage loans increased million and commercial real estate loans decreased million 
in  single family mortgage loans decreased million due to significant repayments in the low interest rate environment and very little new loan production 
in addition  commercial and business loans increased million partially due to the acquisition of an asset based lending portfolio 
lending activities are subject to underwriting standards and liquidity considerations 
specific underwriting criteria for each type of loan are outlined in a credit policy approved by the board of directors of the savings bank 
in general  commercial loans are evaluated based on cash flow  collateral  market conditions  prevailing economic trends  type and leverage capacity of the borrower  capabilities  experience and reputation of management of the borrower and capital and investment in a particular property  if applicable 
most small business and consumer loans are underwritten using credit scoring models that consider factors including payment capacity  credit history and collateral 
in addition  market conditions  economic trends and the type of borrower are considered 
the credit policy  including the underwriting criteria for loan categories  is reviewed on a regular basis and adjusted when warranted

interest payments received on nonperforming loans are applied to reduce principal if there is doubt as to the collectibility of contractually due principal and interest 
nonperforming loans decreased in due to payoffs and improved credit quality in the senior housing portfolio 
nonperforming loans increased in due to loans in the senior housing and asset based portfolios 
one of the asset based loans was affected by the events of september  the allowance as a percent of nonperforming loans was percent at year end compared with percent at year end and percent at year end the allowance as a percent of total loans was percent at year end compared with percent at year end and percent at year end loans accounted for on a nonaccrual basis  accruing loans that are contractually past due days or more  and restructured or other potential problem loans were less than two percent of total loans as of the end of each of the most recent five years 
the aggregate amounts and the interest income foregone on such loans were immaterial 
the investment in impaired loans was million at year end compared with million at year end  with related allowances for loan losses of million at year end compared with million at year end the average investment in impaired loans was million in compared with million in the related amount of interest income recognized on impaired loans in and was immaterial 
virtually all of the loans in the commercial real estate portfolio are collateralized and performing in accordance with contractual terms 
however  many of the projects being financed are nearing completion and  as a result  will soon require that the borrower secure permanent financing  continue temporary financing  extend the existing borrowing or sell the property 
in addition  many of these loans contain options that permit the borrower to extend the term of the loan if defined operating levels are achieved 
in the current economic environment  permanent financing may be difficult to secure and sales may require significant marketing periods or may not be possible or  given the current low variable interest rate environment  the borrower may elect to continue temporary financing 
in addition  at year end  there are million of potential problem loans that are performing in accordance with contractual terms but for which management has concerns about the borrower s ability to continue to comply with repayment terms because of operating and financial difficulties 
these include direct financing aircraft leases  totaling million  with an air cargo transportation company that has indicated a need to renegotiate leases on several aircraft  including those of the financial services group 
at year end  payments on these leases were current  however  no payments have been received on these leases since mid january the effect  if any  of lease renegotiations on loss exposure cannot presently be determined 
however  it is likely that these leases will be classified as non performing during first quarter in addition  the renegotiation may result in terms that would require classification of these assets as operating leases 
if the renegotiated leases are determined to be operating leases  they would not be included in the loan portfolio but would be classified as other assets 
management believes it has established an adequate allowance for loss against these direct financing leases 
the ultimate loss  if any  however  may differ from management s estimate 
these matters will be closely monitored and will likely be resolved in allowance for loan losses the allowance for loan losses includes specific allowances  general allowances and an unallocated allowance 
management continuously evaluates the allowance for loan losses to confirm the level is adequate to absorb losses inherent in the loan portfolio 
the allowance is increased by charges to income through the provision for loan losses and by the portion of the purchase price related to credit risk on loans acquired through bulk purchases and acquisitions  and decreased by charge offs  net of recoveries 
specific allowances are based on a thorough review of the financial condition of the borrower  general economic conditions affecting the borrower  collateral values and other factors 
general allowances are based on historical loss trends and management s judgment concerning those trends and other relevant factors  including delinquency rates  current economic conditions  loan size  industry competition and consolidation and the effect of government regulation 
the unallocated allowance provides for inherent loss exposures not yet identified 
the evaluation of the appropriate level of unallocated allowance considers current risk factors that may not be apparent in historical factors used to determine the specific and general allowances 
these factors include inherent delays in obtaining information  the volatility of economic conditions  the subjective nature of individual loan evaluations  collateral assessments and the interpretation of economic trends and the sensitivity of assumptions used to establish general allowances for homogeneous groups of loans 
changes in the allowance for loan losses were for the year in millions balance at beginning of year charge offs single family mortgage single family mortgage warehouse multifamily and senior housing total residential commercial real estate commercial and business consumer and other total charge offs recoveries single family mortgage single family mortgage warehouse multifamily and senior housing total residential commercial real estate commercial and business consumer and other total recoveries net charge offs provision for loan losses acquisitions and bulk purchases of loans  net of adjustments balance at end of year ratio of net charge offs during the year to average loans outstanding during the year charge offs increased in primarily due to certain loans in the asset based portfolio 
two of the borrowers were in industries related to air transportation  which were affected by the events of september  charge offs in were primarily related to certain large syndications 
charge offs in were primarily related to borrowers in the mortgage banking industry and certain large syndications 
the financial services group allocation of the allowance for loan losses follows 
allocation of a portion of the allowance does not preclude its availability to absorb losses in other categories of loans

the allowance allocated to the commercial real estate portfolio decreased slightly in while the portfolio declined million 
the higher allowance coverage in was due to the mature nature of the real estate properties financed by the commercial and real estate portfolios 
the increase in the allowance allocated to residential loans in was due to an increase in nonperforming senior housing loans 
the increase in the allowance allocated to the commercial and business portfolio was due to the growth in asset based lending partially offset by charge offs of syndicated loans for which an allowance was previously provided 
the allowance for loan losses is considered adequate based on information currently available 
however  adjustments to the allowance may be necessary due to changes in economic conditions  assumptions as to future delinquencies or loss rates and intent as to asset disposition options 
in addition  regulatory authorities periodically review the allowance for loan losses as a part of their examination process 
based on their review  the regulatory authorities may require adjustments to the allowance for loan losses based on their judgment about the information available to them at the time of their review 
mortgage banking activities in  the financial services group completed acquisitions of mortgage production operations in the upper mid west and mid atlantic regions that significantly increased its mortgage production capacity 
in addition  the mortgage loan servicing portfolio was reduced by an billion bulk sale of servicing 
the acquisitions and change in the size of the servicing portfolio were designed to reposition the mortgage banking operations to be more production focused and to minimize impairment risk associated with mortgage servicing rights 
mortgage loan originations were billion in compared with billion in and billion in included in total production were loans originated for the savings bank of billion in compared with million in and virtually none in the significant increase in loans originated for the savings bank in was the result of the financial services group s efforts to increase the level of single family mortgage related assets 
the record mortgage loan originations in and the significant increase in compared with were due to the acquisitions and the high level of refinance activity resulting from the low interest rate environment 
higher interest rates during resulted in a significant reduction in mortgage refinancing activity  contributing to the lower level of originations 
mortgage servicing portfolio runoff was percent in compared with percent in and percent in the changes in the runoff rates were due to the lower interest rate environments in and  leading to high levels of refinancing  and a relatively higher interest rate environment in resulting in low levels of refinancing 
as a result of the high runoff rates  the mortgage operation recorded significant amortization of mortgage servicing rights and impairment charges in both and amortization of mortgage servicing rights was million in compared with million in provisions for impairment of mortgage servicing rights totaled million in compared with million in resulting in valuation allowances of million at year end compared with million at year end in  the mortgage banking operations sold billion in loans to secondary markets by delivering loans to third parties or by delivering loans into mortgage backed securities 
of the loans sold in  the only retained interest was mortgage servicing rights relating to billion of loans 
loans sold in and totaled billion and billion  respectively 
of the loans sold in and  the only retained interest was mortgage servicing rights relating to billion and million of loans  respectively 
the mortgage servicing portfolio was billion at year end compared with billion at year end and billion at year end the decrease in was the result of significant repayments on loans serviced for third parties 
the decrease in was due to the bulk sale of servicing  an increase in the sale of servicing with loan production and the accelerated runoff rate 
included in the mortgage servicing portfolio were loans serviced for the savings bank totaling billion at year end compared with billion at year end and billion at year end in and  the mortgage banking operations were significantly affected by the refinancing activity associated with the declining interest rate environment 
if interest rates continue to decline in  the level of mortgage originations and the level of mortgage servicing rights impairment will likely remain high 
however  if interest rates remain constant or begin to rise in  then the level of mortgage originations and the level of mortgage servicing rights impairment will likely decline 
corporate  interest and other income expense corporate expenses were million in compared with million in and million in the changes in and were primarily due to changes in pension costs 
parent company interest expense was million in compared with million in and million in the change in was due to an increase in long term debt due to the acquisition of gaylord offset in part by a million reduction in other borrowings

project tip transformation innvovation performance involves moving the corrugated packaging operations management from indianapolis to austin  consolidating business support functions throughout the company into a shared service function and combining and leveraging the procurement  transportation and supply chain processes for the entire company 
the company anticipates estimated annual savings and cost reductions from this project of approximately million  the majority of which will begin to be realized in pension expense credit non cash pension expense was million in compared with non cash pension credits of million in and million in the change in was due to lower than expected returns on pension plan assets through year end and to the acquisition of gaylord 
the changes in and reflect the cumulative higher than expected returns on pension plan assets through year end see pension matters for further information regarding pension expense 
income taxes the effective tax rate was percent in compared with percent in and percent in the difference between the effective tax rate and the statutory rate is due to state income taxes  nondeductible items and losses in certain foreign operations for which no financial benefit is recognized until realized 
the rate reflects a one time  three percent  financial benefit realized from the sale of the corrugated packaging operation in chile 
based on current expectations of income and expense  it is likely that the effective tax rate for the year will approximate percent 
the company is in the process of concluding the internal revenue service s examination of the company s tax returns for the years through including matters related to the company s computations of net operating losses and minimum tax credit carry forwards for which no financial accounting benefit has been recognized 
if these computations are approved  the company expects to recognize a significant non cash financial accounting benefit as a result of reducing valuation allowances previously provided against its deferred tax assets 
average shares outstanding average diluted shares outstanding were million in compared with million in and million in the increase of six percent in was due to the may sale of million shares of common stock 
the decrease of three percent in was due to the effects of share repurchases under the stock repurchase programs authorized during fourth quarter and third quarter the dilutive effect of stock options and equity purchase contracts was not significant in any of the years presented

in addition  million was contributed to the del tin joint venture 
cash received from the dispositions of gaylord s non strategic assets and operations was million  including million related to working capital items 
in january  the company sold gaylord s multi wall bag business and kraft paper mill 
aggregate proceeds from the dispositions of gaylord s non strategic assets now approximate million 
capital expenditures were million  down million  and approximated percent of depreciation and depletion 
capital expenditures are expected to approximate million in or about percent of expected depreciation and depletion 
there were no capital contributions to the financial services group during financing activities cash provided by financing activities was million 
cash received from financing transactions more than offset debt repayments and dividends to shareholders 
cash proceeds from the may offerings of common stock  senior notes and upper decs sm units were  million before expenses of million

the bridge financing facility initially provided million of which million was used to acquire gaylord  million was used to repay gaylord s assumed bank debt  million was used for financing fees and the remainder was used for other acquisition related purposes 
the million shares of common stock were sold for per share 
the million of senior notes due were sold at percent of par 
the notes bear interest at an effective rate of percent 
the upper decs sm units consist of million of senior notes due in and contracts to purchase common stock 
the interest rate on the upper decs sm senior notes will be reset in february the purchase contracts represent an obligation to purchase by may  shares of common stock based on an aggregate purchase price of million 
the actual number of shares that will be issued on the stock purchase date will be determined by a settlement rate that is based on the average market price of the company s common stock for days preceding the stock purchase date 
the average price per share will not be less than  in which case million shares would be issued  and will not be higher than  in which case million shares would be issued 
if a holder elects to purchase shares prior to may  the number of shares that would be issued will be based on a fixed price of per share the settlement rate resulting in the fewest number of shares issued to the holder regardless of the actual market price of the shares at that time 
accordingly  if the purchase contracts had been settled at year end  the settlement rate would have resulted in the issuance of million shares of common stock and the receipt of million cash 
the purchase contracts also provide for contract adjustment payments at an annual rate of percent 
cash dividends paid to shareholders were million or per share  the same as in in february  the company increased the quarterly cash dividend to per share  or a projected annual rate of per share

given these uncertainties  the company estimates that capital expenditures for environmental purposes excluding the mact rules during the period through will average in the range of million each year 
energy and the effects of inflation inflation has had minimal effects on operating results the last three years except for the changes in energy costs 
while energy costs  principally natural gas  decreased million in  they increased million in and million in energy costs began to rise during second quarter  peaked during second quarter and began to decline the remainder of reaching more normalized levels by year end energy costs remained at these levels during most of but began to rise during fourth quarter and have continued to increase in early it is likely that energy costs will continue to fluctuate during the remainder of during the year  excluding the closed antioch mill  the company purchased approximately million mmbtu of natural gas 
the company s fixed assets  including timber and timberlands  are reflected at their historical costs 
if reflected at current replacement costs  depreciation expense and the cost of timber harvested or timberlands sold would be significantly higher than amounts reported

accounting policies critical accounting estimates in preparing the financial statements  the company follows generally accepted accounting policies  which in many cases require the company to make assumptions  estimates and judgments that affect the amounts reported 
many of these policies are relatively straightforward and are included in note a to the summarized financial statements of the parent company and financial services group and note to the consolidated financial statements 
there are  however  a few policies that are critical because they are important in determining the financial condition and results and are difficult to apply 
within the parent company  they include asset impairments and pension accounting and  within the financial services group  they include the allowance for loan losses and mortgage servicing rights 
the difficulty in applying these policies arises from the assumptions  estimates and judgments that have to be made currently about matters that are inherently uncertain  such as future economic conditions  operating results and valuations as well as management intentions 
as the difficulty increases  the level of precision decreases  meaning that actual results can and probably will be different from those currently estimated 
the company bases its assumptions  estimates and judgments on a combination of historical experiences and other reasonable factors 
measuring assets for impairment requires estimating intentions as to holding periods  future operating cash flows and residual values of the assets under review 
changes in management intentions  market conditions or operating performance could indicate that impairment charges might be necessary 
the expected long term rate of return on pension plan assets is an important assumption in determining pension expense 
in selecting that rate  consideration is given to both historical returns and future returns over the next quarter century 
differences between actual and expected returns will adjust future pension expense 
allowances for loan losses are based on loan classifications  historical experiences and evaluations of future cash flows and collateral values and are subject to regulatory scrutiny 
changes in general economic conditions or loan specific circumstances will inevitably change those evaluations 
measuring for impairment and amortizing mortgage servicing rights is largely dependent upon the speed at which loans are repaid and market rates of return 
changes in interest rates will affect both of these variables and could indicate that impairments or adjustments of the rate of amortization might be necessary 
during  the parent company completed an assessment of the estimated useful lives of certain production equipment  which resulted in a revision of estimated useful lives 
these revisions ranged from a reduction of several years to a lengthening of up to five years 
accordingly  beginning in  the parent company began computing depreciation of certain production equipment using revised estimated useful lives 
as a result of these revisions in estimated useful lives  year depreciation expense was reduced by million and net income was increased by million or per diluted share 
new accounting pronouncements adopted in  the company was required to adopt a number of new accounting pronouncements  the most significant being sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  pursuant to which amortization of goodwill and other indefinitely lived intangible assets is precluded 
these assets  however  must be measured for impairment at least annually 
the cumulative effect of adopting this statement was to reduce net income by million or per diluted share for an million goodwill impairment associated with the corrugated packaging group s pre specialty packaging acquisitions 
under this statement  impairment is measured based upon estimated fair values generally determined using the present value of future operating cash flows while under the prior methodology impairment was measured based upon undiscounted future cash flows 
the effect of not amortizing goodwill and trademarks in and would have been to increase operating income by million and million  respectively  and net income by million  or per diluted share  and million  or per diluted share  respectively 
the company also adopted sfas no 
 rescission of statement of financial accounting standards no 
  and  amendment of statement of financial accounting standards no 
and technical corrections in the principal effect of adopting this statement was that the charge off of the unamortized debt financing fees commensurate with the early repayment of the bridge financing facility and other borrowings was not classified as an extraordinary item in the determination of income from continuing operations 
other new accounting pronouncements adopted included one related to impairments of long lived assets held for use and another related to the clarification of what constitutes an acquisition of a financial institution business 
the effect on earnings or financial position of adopting these two statements was not material 
in  the company was required to adopt a number of new accounting pronouncements  the most important being sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  as amended  under which derivative instruments are required to be included on the balance sheet at fair value 
the changes in fair value are reflected in net income or other comprehensive income  depending upon the classification of the derivative instrument 
the cumulative effect of adopting this statement was to reduce net income by million or per diluted share and other comprehensive income by million 
additionally  as permitted by this statement  the financial services group changed the designation of its held to maturity securities  which are carried at unamortized cost  to available for sale  which are carried at fair value 
as a result  the carrying value of these securities was adjusted to their fair value with a corresponding after tax reduction in other comprehensive income of million 
new accounting pronouncements to be adopted in in  the company will voluntarily adopt the prospective transition method of accounting for stock based compensation contained in sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure  an amendment of fasb statement no 
under the prospective transition  the company will apply the fair value recognition provisions to all stock based compensation awards granted in and thereafter 
the principal effect of adopting this statement is that the fair value of stock options granted will be charged to expense over the option vesting period 
if options are granted in at a similar level with  the expected effect on earnings or financial position of adopting this method will not be material 
also in  the company will be required to adopt two other new accounting pronouncements  the first being sfas no 
 accounting for asset retirement obligations 
this statement applies to legal obligations associated with retirement of long lived assets 
this statement requires the recording of an asset and a liability equal to the fair value of the estimated costs associated with the retirement of the long lived assets 
the second pronouncement to be adopted is sfas no 
 accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities 
under this statement  liabilities for costs associated with an exit or disposal activity  including restructurings  are to be recognized when the liability is incurred and can be measured at estimated fair value 
the effect on earnings or financial position of adopting these statements is not expected to be material

the financial services group is currently in an asset sensitive position whereby the rate and repayment characteristics of its assets are more responsive to changes in market interest rates than are its liabilities
