item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations as you read management s discussion and analysis  it may be helpful to refer to our financial statements and accompanying notes beginning on page in management s discussion and analysis we explain the changes in specific line items in the statements of operations 
where changes are due to more than one reason  we list the reasons in order of importance 
introduction in management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations we explain our general financial condition and results of operations including results of operations why revenues  costs and earnings changed from the prior period funds from operations ffo how we used cash for capital projects and dividends during through and how we expect to use cash in where we plan on obtaining cash for future dividend payments and future capital expenditures the results of excel legacy are included in operations beginning september  critical accounting policies and estimates general our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america gaap 
preparation of our financial statements in accordance with gaap requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses and the related notes 
we believe that the following accounting policies are critical because they affect the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
for a detailed discussion on the application of these and other accounting policies  see note in the notes to the consolidated financial statements in item of this annual report on form k 
consolidation we combine our financial statements with those of our wholly owned subsidiaries as well as all affiliates in which we have control and present them on a consolidated basis 
the consolidated financial statements do not include the results of transactions between us and our subsidiaries or among our subsidiaries 
revenue recognition recognition of revenue is dependent upon the quality and ability of our tenants to pay their rent in a timely manner 
rental revenues include minimum annual rentals  adjusted for the straight line method for recognition of fixed future increases  additional rentals  including recovery of property operating expenses  and certain other expenses which we accrue in the period in which the related expense occurs  and percentage rents based on the level of sales achieved by the lessee  which we recognize when earned 
gain or loss on sale of real estate is recognized when the sales contract is executed  title has passed  payment is received  and we no longer have continuing involvement in the asset 
real estate assets and depreciation we record real estate assets at historical costs and adjust them for recognition of impairment losses 
in following purchase accounting  we adjusted the historical costs of excel legacy s real estate assets to fair value at the time of the merger 
our consolidated balance sheets at december  and december  reflect the new basis of those real estate assets 
we expense as incurred ordinary repairs and maintenance costs  which include building painting  parking lot repairs  etc 
we capitalize major replacements and improvements  which include hvac equipment  roofs  etc  and depreciate them over their estimated useful lives 
we compute real estate asset depreciation on a straight line basis over their estimated useful lives  as follows land improvements years building and improvements to years tenant improvements lesser of the lease term or years fixtures and equipment years we review long lived assets for impairment when events or changes in business conditions indicate that their full carrying value may not be recovered 
we consider assets to be impaired and write them down to fair value if their expected associated future undiscounted cash flows are less than their carrying amounts 
we capitalize interest incurred during the construction period of certain assets and this interest is depreciated over the lives of those assets 
pre development costs that are directly related to specific construction projects are capitalized as incurred 
we expense these costs to the extent they are unrecoverable or it is determined that the related project will not be pursued 
derivative instruments and hedging activities we follow the provisions of sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
in the normal course of business  we may use derivative financial instruments to manage or hedge interest rate risk 
when entered into  we formally designate and document the financial instrument as a hedge of a specific underlying exposure  as well as the risk management objectives and strategies for undertaking the hedge transactions 
we assess  both at the inception and at least quarterly thereafter  whether the financial instruments that are used in hedging transactions are effective at offsetting changes in either the fair value or cash flows of the related underlying exposure 
because of the high degree of correlation between the hedging instrument and the underlying exposure being hedged  fluctuations in the value of the derivative instruments are generally offset by changes in the fair value or cash flows of the underlying exposures being hedged 
any ineffective portion of a financial instrument s change in fair value is immediately recognized in earnings 
virtually all of our derivatives are straightforward over the counter instruments with liquid markets 
to determine the fair values of derivative instruments  we use a variety of methods and assumptions that are based on market conditions and risks existing at each balance sheet date 
for the majority of financial instruments including most derivatives  long term investments and long term debt  standard market conventions and techniques such as discounted cash flow analysis  option pricing models  replacement cost  and termination cost are used to determine fair value 
all methods of assessing fair value result in a general approximation of value  and such value may never actually be realized 
notes receivable we typically do not recognize interest income on non recourse notes receivable related to development projects until the projects begin operations or the interest is paid 
asset disposal in august  the fasb issued sfas no

the board of governors of the national association for real estate investment trusts nareit  defines ffo as net income in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america gaap  excluding depreciation and amortization expense and gains losses from depreciable operating real estate 
we calculate ffo in accordance with the nareit definition and also exclude provisions for asset impairments and gains losses from the sale of investments when we calculate ffo 
ffo does not represent the cash flows from operations defined by gaap  may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies and should not be considered as an alternative to net income as an indicator of our operating performance or to cash flows as a measure of liquidity 
excluded from ffo are significant components in understanding our financial performance 
ffo before preferred dividends during increased million or to million compared to because properties we acquired during and increased ffo million properties we owned in both and increased ffo million gain on non depreciable land sold during the year contributed million to ffo joint ventures contributed an additional million to ffo in the current year these increases to ffo were partially offset by additional interest expense which reduced ffo million additional general and administrative expenses reduced ffo by million properties sold which contributed million to ffo in the previous year decreased interest income  which reduced ffo by million ffo before preferred dividends during increased million or to million compared to because properties we acquired during and increased ffo million interest income on our outstanding notes receivable and higher cash balances increased ffo million a net increase in ffo of million for our self storage business as we began collecting rent net of expenses when we entered into a master lease arrangement on these properties properties we owned in both and increased ffo million joint venture income contributed an additional million to ffo in the current year these increases to ffo were partially offset by additional interest expense which reduced ffo million properties sold during reduced ffo million additional bad debt expense and general and administrative expenses reduced ffo by million liquidity and capital resources liquidity refers to our ability to generate sufficient cash flows to meet the short and long term cash requirements of our business operations 
capital resources represent those funds used or available to be used to support our business operations and consist of stockholders equity and debt 
cash flow from operations has been the principal source of capital to fund our ongoing operations and dividend payments  while asset sales and use of our credit facilities and mortgage financing have been the principal sources of capital required to fund our growth 
while we are positioned to finance our business activities through a variety of sources  we expect to satisfy short term liquidity requirements through net cash provided by operations and through borrowings 
dividends as a reit  we are required to distribute of our taxable income  excluding capital gains  in dividends 
our series a preferred stock requires a quarterly dividend payment of million  an annual total of million 
in connection with the merger  we assumed a net operating loss nol of approximately million which could be used to offset federal taxable income 
we anticipate that approximately million of this nol will be used to offset taxable income in the remaining taxable income was distributed in dividends to the series a preferred stockholders 
in the future  if our series a preferred dividend is less than of our taxable income after applying any applicable nols  we have two options to meet the distribution requirement we can declare a series b preferred stock dividend by issuing additional series b preferred shares 
the series b preferred stock dividends accumulate at a rate of  compounded quarterly 
as of december   the series b preferred stockholders were entitled to approximately million additional shares 
we can declare a dividend to our common stockholders 
if our taxable income is less than the series a preferred stock dividends  we are still obligated to pay them 
if we are unable to pay these dividends when due  they accumulate until paid 
debt in september  we obtained a million unsecured credit facility with fleet bank as agent 
the facility has a three year term and has a current interest rate of libor plus basis points 
the rate may vary between and basis points based on our leverage and other financial ratios 
at december   we had million outstanding on the facility at a interest rate 
in january  we issued a million letter of credit to april   which reduced the total available we can borrow to million 
our credit facility requires us to comply with specified financial covenants  the most restrictive of which relate to fixed charge coverage and leverage 
covenants in some of our construction loans are also tied to our credit facility 
we were in compliance with all covenants in our credit facility at december   and are closely monitoring our operating results in as they relate to compliance with such covenants  in particular fixed charge coverage and leverage 
to the extent that we are in violation of any of these covenants  we would need to obtain waivers from our lenders to maintain compliance 
we cannot assure that any such waivers would be forthcoming 
in we have the following significant debt maturities on december   a million construction loan related to our project in newport  kentucky matured 
the lender gave us a day extension 
as a condition of this extension  we were required to issue a million letter of credit to fund any tenant improvement requirements 
we anticipate that the current lender will extend this loan beyond march  although they may require a pay down on the outstanding amount 
if the current lender does not extend this loan  we may not have the capital resources to repay this loan completely without selling assets or incurring other debt 
on april   a million loan related to our project in orlando florida matures 
the loan has an option to extend for years 
we anticipate that we will either exercise this extension or refinance this debt with a new loan 
on march   a million loan related to our property in newport  ky matured 
the lender agreed to extend this loan for another year 
the following table summarizes all of our long term contractual obligations  excluding interest  to pay third parties as of december  contractual cash obligations thereafter total mortgages and notes payable     ground lease obligation  total       in we plan to use cash flow from operations to fund our recurring debt service obligations 
included in the mortgage and notes payable obligations is a million capital lease obligation whereby the lessor can require us to repay the lease with a day notice 
if this occurs  we would replace the obligation with other mortgage debt or borrowing on our credit facility 
off balance sheet financing matters related to our newport  ky project discussed previously  the city of newport  ky newport in issued two series of public improvement bonds related to the newport development project 
the series a tax exempt bonds total million and are broken down as follows a million maturing with interest at  b million maturing with interest at  and c million maturing with interest at 
the series b bonds are taxable and have a par amount of million with interest at due the bonds are guaranteed by the newport project  the company  and the project s third party developers

in january  the guarantee was reduced to million and we guarantee this debt until it matures on april  development we have a significant retail project in newport  ky 
the majority of the construction was completed in october  with all of the primary buildings completed except for one out parcel yet to be leased 
the project opened in october at december   the project was approximately occupied  excluding ground leases 
as the project becomes fully leased  there may be capital required to fund the remaining tenant improvements 
the anaheim gardenwalk project in anaheim  ca  located between disney s two theme parks on harbor boulevard and disney s new proposed theme park on katella avenue will consist of a  square foot open air retail center and four hotels 
total cost of the retail portion of this project is approximately million with an estimated cost of million remaining to complete construction over the next eight years for all phases 
we anticipate that the first phase of the project will cost approximately million  of which approximately million may be spent in we expect to fund construction costs through a construction loan  sales of hotel land parcels or potential joint venture investors 
we also have retail development projects in which construction will continue through the temecula  ca project is an open air retail shopping center with wal mart  kohl s and other tenants 
we estimate million remaining to complete construction 
we expect to fund the remaining cost through borrowings on our unsecured line of credit 
in december  we purchased additional land adjacent to this development project to develop an additional open air retail center 
we estimate the total cost of this development to be approximately million with an estimated million remaining to complete construction 
in november  we purchased land adjacent to our property in orlando  fl to develop an open air retail center 
we estimate the total cost of this development to be approximately million with an estimated million remaining to complete construction 
notes receivable we had million in principal amount of third party notes receivable outstanding as of december  related to various real estate developments and related businesses 
the notes bear interest ranging from to per annum 
the notes generally do not require cash payments of interest until specified future dates  typically when developments are completed or sold 
as of december   we had million of accrued but unpaid interest on these notes 
of this amount  we assumed from the merger with excel legacy 
we typically do not recognize interest income on these notes receivable until development projects begin operations 
of the million in notes receivable  as of december   the notes receivable from companies owned by or affiliated with steven ellman the ellman companies had an aggregate outstanding principal balance of approximately million and the aggregate outstanding accrued interest on such notes receivable was approximately million 
notes receivable of million principal amount and accrued interest matured in  but were extended to december  the remainder of the notes receivable mature at various dates in or or earlier if the related development is sold 
repayment of the notes depends upon the completion of the various development projects or other events 
the notes receivable are generally non recourse obligations  but are typically collateralized by either real estate liens or pledges of ownership interests in the borrower or affiliated entities 
growth we continue to evaluate various properties for acquisition or development and continue to evaluate other investment opportunities 
we anticipate borrowing available amounts on our credit facility or mortgages to fund these acquisition and development opportunities 
we also anticipate obtaining construction loans to fund our development activities 
during the year ended december  we purchased eight properties for a total of million 
we used proceeds from tax deferred exchange transactions on properties sold in and  mortgage financing  borrowings on our unsecured line of credit  and assumed loans to fund these acquisitions 
from time to time we will consider selling properties to better align our portfolio with our geographic and tenant composition strategies 
we may also participate in additional tax deferred exchange transactions  which allow us to dispose of properties and reinvest the proceeds in a tax efficient manner 
during the year ended december  we sold three parcels of land for million  three self storage development properties for million  three self storage operating properties for million and one operating retail property for million 
when we sell an operating property  we anticipate a temporary reduction in operating income due to the time lag between selling a property and reinvesting the proceeds 
we are contemplating purchasing various properties and selling certain other properties 
as we sell properties  our cash flows from operations may decrease until the proceeds are reinvested into new properties 
litigation we own a interest in destination villages llc  which indirectly owns a hospitality project located in bermuda  daniel s head village resort daniel s head 
daniel s head was closed in the fourth quarter of  primarily due to low occupancy rates as a result of the terrorist events in the united states that occurred on september  the project was encumbered by a million loan with a bermuda bank 
in march  we informed the bermuda bank that we did not intend to re open this project due to large projected operating losses and instead intended to sell the project to an identified buyer 
this resulted in a default of the loan 
on march   the bermuda bank exercised its rights under bermuda law and put the project in receivership  which gives the bank the right to negotiate directly with this buyer as well as other potential buyers 
on june  the bermuda bank filed a lawsuit against us in bermuda for million plus other costs related to a guarantee agreement for a promissory note on the destination villages daniel s head project in bermuda 
we believe we were in full compliance with the guarantee and intend to vigorously defend the lawsuit 
other in april  we entered into five interest rate swap agreements with fleet bank that are accounted for under sfas no 
and sold them in october the combined notional amount was approximately million and the maturities ranged from we paid monthly interest of libor plus to and fleet bank assumed our fixed rates of to 
these swaps hedged the fair value of fixed rate debt 
in october  we sold the five swaps back to the counter party for million and will amortize the gain over the fixed rate debt s remaining life through to in july  we entered into four interest rate cap agreements with wells fargo bank and fleet bank that are also accounted for under sfas no 
the combined notional amount is million and the maturities range from to the agreements cap our variable rate risk on one month libor interest at 
in october  our board of directors approved the repurchase of up to million of our outstanding common stock 
in september  we repurchased  shares of our common stock on the open market for approximately million 
transactions with related and certain other parties we have million in notes receivable including accrued interest from certain of our current and former officers  which are due march the notes are primarily non recourse obligations collateralized by approximately million shares of our common stock 
as of december   the market value of these shares was less than the amounts due on the notes 
the sarbanes oxley act of prohibits any material changes to notes receivable from current officers 
as a result of discussions related to the eventual disposition of the notes  we have applied emerging issues task force eitf  issues related to the accounting for stock compensation under apb opinion no 
and fasb interpretation no 
issued in eitf requires accounting as if the shares had been repurchased and treated as treasury shares  with a corresponding issuance of a new stock option 
the impact of eitf on our financial statements was as follows we retired the notes receivable from officers and the million shares securing the notes at the current market value in the third quarter of the shares collateralizing the notes are now treated as treasury stock and we recorded a one time non cash charge of million in compensation expense to record the difference between the notes book value and the value of the shares the above only impacts our accounting records 
legally  the notes and shares remain outstanding until the notes are repaid or otherwise settled 
the million shares are treated similar to stock options and are accounted for under variable option plan accounting in accordance with apb no 
this valuation had no impact on our financial statements for the year ended december  prior to the merger  excel legacy was responsible for the daily management of pei  including property management  finance and administration 
we reimbursed excel legacy for these services based on historical costs for similar expenses 
we expensed million for these services during prior to the merger  we executed a note receivable with excel legacy allowing them to borrow up to million 
during we recorded million in interest income from excel legacy on this note 
as a result of the merger  interest income is no longer recorded on this note 
in connection with the san diego rancho bernardo  ca office building purchased from excel legacy  we leased the building back to excel legacy under a year lease agreement 
we recorded million of rental revenue from excel legacy in connection with this lease during due to the merger  rental revenue is no longer recorded on this lease 
in connection with the purchase of the anaheim land in the first quarter of  we executed a ground lease agreement with excel legacy 
the lease has a term of years and requires payments of million per year in rent 
during we recorded million in rental revenue from excel legacy related to this lease 
due to the merger  rental revenue is no longer recorded on this lease 
inflation because a substantial number of our leases contain provisions for rent increases based on changes in various consumer price indices  based on fixed rate increases  or based on percentage rent if tenant sales exceed certain base amounts  we do not expect inflation to have a material impact on future net income or cash flow from developed and operating properties 
in addition  substantially all leases are triple net  which means specific operating expenses and property taxes are passed through to the tenant 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risks relating to our operations result primarily from changes in short term libor interest rates 
we do not have any significant foreign exchange or other material market risk 
our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our variable interest rate debt 
we enter into variable rate debt obligations to support general corporate purposes  including acquisitions  capital expenditures and working capital needs 
we continuously evaluate our level of variable rate debt with respect to total debt and other factors  including our assessment of the current and future economic environment 
we had million in variable rate debt outstanding at december  based upon these year end debt levels  a hypothetical increase in interest rates by basis points would increase interest expense by approximately million on an annual basis  and likewise decrease our earnings and cash flows 
we cannot predict market fluctuations in interest rates and their impact on our variable rate debt  nor can there be any assurance that fixed rate long term debt will be available to us at favorable rates  if at all 
consequently  future results may differ materially from the estimated adverse changes discussed above 
also  as previously discussed  we entered into five fair value interest rate swap agreements for million in april these swap agreements effectively convert million of fixed rate loans with interest rates ranging from to to variable interest rates 
the fair value of these interest rate swap agreements represents the estimated amount we would receive if we terminated the agreements 
in october  we sold the five swaps for million and will amortize the gain over the fixed rate debt s remaining life 
in july  in order to mitigate our variable interest rate exposure  we acquired four interest rate caps  which hedge our exposure on million of variable rate debt 
the hedges limit our exposure to the one month libor index associated with certain of our outstanding debt at 
to the extent the one month libor index exceeds  the counter parties on the hedges will pay us the difference between the actual index and 
the following table presents the scheduled principal payments on notes receivable and the scheduled principal payments on mortgages payable over the next five years and thereafter 
the table also includes the average interest rates of the financial instruments during each respective year and the fair value of the notes receivable and mortgages payable 
we determine the fair value of financial instruments through the use of discounted cash flows analysis using current interest rates for notes receivable with terms and credit characteristics similar to our existing portfolio and borrowings under terms similar to our existing mortgages payable 
accordingly  we have determined that the carrying value of our financial instruments at december  approximated fair value 
expected maturity date thereafter total fair value dollar amounts in thousands notes receivable  including notes from affiliates   average interest rate mortgages and notes payable     average interest rate
