net revenues by groups of similar service were as follows dollars in thousands years ended december  marketing services    fees    listings    net revenues    percent of net revenues 
marketing services revenues include transaction revenues of million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
marketing services revenues 
marketing services revenues are primarily generated from the sale of banner  sponsorship  text link advertisements  including sponsored search services primarily provided through our agreement with overture  and transactions revenues 
marketing services revenues for the year ended december  increased by million  or as compared to the prior year 
the increase is due to increased revenues of million realized through our worldwide sponsored search services  which focus primarily on small and medium sized businesses 
in addition  transactions revenues increased million or compared to the prior year  and was comprised of million due to a change in the company s pricing for the yahoo store platform primarily from a fixed to transaction based structure  million due to an increase in volume of commerce transactions enabled on the yahoo network  and million due to increased revenues from other performance based arrangements 
the increases were partially offset by a decrease in barter revenues of million  and a million decrease in renewals of previous advertising arrangements 
the number of impressions and click throughs delivered under advertising arrangements in increased by approximately on a combined basis as compared to  while the average price yield per impression and click through delivered  also on a combined basis  declined approximately for the same period 
during the period  the company s focus remained on obtaining overall advertising dollars rather than maximizing price per unit 
marketing services in decreased by million  or  as compared to the decrease was due to a softening of the global economy  which significantly impacted many of our customers marketing budgets 
this resulted in significantly reduced spending on internet advertising on our site in by our customers  as compared to the reduction of revenues was due to reduced spending on advertising  rather than a function of pricing  given the increased availability of advertising inventory  as measured in page views  and the company s focus on obtaining overall advertising dollars  rather than maximizing price per unit or impression 
the average price yield per impression and click through delivered declined approximately  on a combined basis  in compared with although the arrangements that we entered into with our customers were for reduced dollar commitments when compared to  the number of impressions and click throughs delivered under advertising arrangements increased by approximately  on a combined basis  as compared to in addition  internet companies spent significantly less money on advertising in due to diminished access to capital markets as compared to during  our customer base shifted toward more traditional marketers 
the decrease was partially offset by an increase in transaction revenues of million  or as compared to  which resulted from an increase in the number of electronic commerce transactions enabled through the yahoo network 
excluding the merchants brought by overture and hotjobs  over  customers advertised directly on the yahoo network during as compared to more than  and  in and  respectively 
in addition  in  the company gained access to advertisers of hotjobs 
com  inc hotjobs and overture  bringing our total direct and indirect advertisers to over  during fees revenues 
fees revenues consist of revenues generated from a variety of consumer and business fee based services we provide 
these services primarily include sbc yahoo dsl and dial  yahoo personals  small business services  yahoo mail and yahoo enterprise solutions 
for the year ended december   fees revenues increased million  or  as compared to the prior year 
the increases are attributable to an increase in paying customers for our fee based services 
approximately million of this increase is associated with an increase in our network and platform services  of which million is associated with yahoo personals 
in addition  million is attributable to an increase in hotjobs fees revenues  and the remainder of the increase is due to overall growth across other premium information and content services  search and marketplace services and consumer services 
fees revenues in increased million  or  as compared to the significant factors contributing to this increase were million attributable to expanded services in the small business sector  as well as million attributable to the expanded deployment of yahoo portal solutions 
the increase was partially offset by a million decrease in revenues from broadcasted events due to a softening of the global economy  approximately of which was caused by a decrease in the number of events to approximately  during  as compared to  events during  and approximately of which was due to a reduction in price per event 
listings revenues 
listings revenues consist of revenues generated from a variety of consumer and business listings based services we provide 
these services primarily include access to the hotjobs database and classifieds such as yahoo autos  yahoo real estate and other search and directory services 
for the year ended december   listings revenues increased million  or  as compared to the prior year  million of which was associated with the acquisition of hotjobs 
listings revenues in increased million  or  as compared to  of which million relates to listings within the commerce and search and marketplace properties 
overall  we currently expect total combined revenues for marketing services  fees  and listings to increase in absolute dollars for compared to costs and expenses primary operating costs and expenses were as follows dollars in thousands years ended december  cost of revenues    sales and marketing    product development    general and administrative    percent of net revenues 
cost of revenues 
cost of revenues consists of the expenses associated with the production and usage of the yahoo network 
these costs primarily consist of fees paid to third parties for content included on our online media properties  internet connection charges  equipment depreciation  live event production costs  technology license fees and compensation related expenses 
cost of revenues for the year ended december  increased million  or  as compared to the prior year 
this reflects approximately million of additional expense due to hotjobs  which was acquired during the year  million associated with increased royalties and other content related costs  as well as increased costs for growing network usage and premium services 
the increase in was partially offset by savings of approximately million from more favorable bandwidth pricing and more efficient bandwidth utilization during cost of revenues in increased by million  or  as compared to the increase reflects a million increase in costs associated with growing network usage and additional content and other costs for new and enhanced services on the yahoo network 
the increase in is partially offset by an million decrease in costs associated with live event production costs and the licensing of patented technology 
network usage is measured in page views defined as electronic page displays per day 
we delivered an average of approximately billion page views per day in december compared to approximately billion page views per day in december and approximately billion page views per day in december cost of revenues was  and of revenues in  and  respectively 
cost of revenues as a percentage of revenues does not directly correlate to revenues as many of our service offerings are free 
we currently anticipate that cost of revenues will continue to increase in absolute dollars in compared to  as network usage increases and additional content is introduced for new and enhanced services 
sales and marketing 
sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of advertising and other marketing related expenses  compensation related expenses  sales commissions and travel costs 
sales and marketing expenses for the year ended december   increased million  or  as compared to the prior year 
sales and marketing expenses increased by million due to costs related to hotjobs  which was acquired during the year  and million due to increases in compensation related expenses  but was partially offset by approximately million in savings from our overall effort to manage discretionary costs and a decrease in barter related expenses 
sales and marketing expenses in decreased million  or  as compared to this was the result of our overall effort to manage discretionary costs  which resulted in savings of million from reduced marketing spending and savings of million from the restructuring programs 
the cost efficiencies gained in were partially offset by million in costs related to the continued investment in people and business process improvement for our sales organizations in the united states and internationally 
the year over year increase in sales and marketing expenses as a percentage of net revenues is due to a greater decrease in marketing services revenues than sales and marketing expenses 
we currently anticipate that sales and marketing expenses in absolute dollars will increase in compared to product development 
product development expenses consist primarily of compensation related expenses incurred for enhancements to and maintenance of the yahoo network  classification and organization of listings within yahoo properties  research and development expenses  and other operating costs 
product development expenses for the year ended december   increased million  or  as compared to the prior year 
product development expenses increased by approximately million due to costs related to hotjobs  which was acquired during the year  as well as overall increases of approximately million in our total compensation expense related to engineers that develop and enhance properties and services throughout the yahoo network 
product development expenses decreased as a percentage of sales to compared to in as a result of savings in our overall effort to manage discretionary costs 
product development expenses in increased million  or  as compared to the year over year increase in absolute dollars and as a percentage of sales is attributable to an increase in the total compensation for engineers and other costs to develop and enhance media properties on the yahoo network of million  partially offset by million in savings obtained through our restructuring programs 
we believe that continued investments in product development are required to remain competitive 
consequently  we currently anticipate that product development costs in absolute dollars will increase in compared to general and administrative 
general and administrative expenses consist primarily of compensation related expenses and fees for professional services 
general and administrative expenses for the year ended december   increased million  or  as compared to the prior year 
the increases are attributable to a million increase in compensation related expense and incremental general and administrative expenses  and a million increase in costs related to hotjobs  which was acquired during the year 
general and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales remained consistent in compared with general and administrative expenses in increased million  or  as compared to the year over year increase in absolute dollars and as a percentage of sales was primarily attributable to an increase in compensation related and professional services totaling million  partially offset by a decrease of million from cost efficiencies obtained through our restructuring programs 
we currently believe that general and administrative expenses in absolute dollars will increase in compared to amortization of intangibles 
from time to time we have purchased  and expect to continue purchasing  assets or businesses  which may result in the creation of intangible assets 
amortization of intangibles was million  or of net revenues for the year ended december   a decrease of million compared to million or of net revenues for as a result of the cessation of goodwill amortization in connection with the adoption of statement of financial accounting standards no 
sfas  goodwill and other intangible assets 
amortization of intangibles increased million in compared to million  or of net revenues for the year over year absolute dollar increases in amortization of intangibles are primarily the result of acquisitions accounted for under the purchase method of accounting during those years 
restructuring costs 
during  we announced restructuring programs to balance our investment in growth areas with the desire to modify our near term business plan to reflect the current economic and capital market slowdown 
these restructuring programs included worldwide workforce reductions  consolidation of excess facilities and other charges 
as a result of these restructuring programs  we recorded restructuring costs of million classified as operating expenses in worldwide workforce reduction 
the restructuring programs resulted in a workforce reduction of approximately employees across certain business functions  operating units  and geographic regions 
the worldwide workforce reductions were substantially completed within we recorded a workforce reduction charge of million in relating primarily to severance and fringe benefits 
consolidation of excess facilities and other charges 
we recorded a restructuring charge of million in relating to the consolidation of excess facilities and other charges 
of this charge  approximately million was primarily for excess facilities relating to lease terminations and non cancelable lease costs 
this charge included estimated sub lease income based on current comparable rates for leases in the respective markets 
if facilities rental rates continue to decrease in these markets or if it takes longer than expected to sublease these facilities  the maximum amount the actual loss could exceed the original estimate is approximately million 
property and equipment that was disposed of or removed from operations resulted in a net charge of million and consisted primarily of furniture and fixtures  servers  leasehold improvements  and computer equipment 
we also recorded other restructuring costs of million relating primarily to payments for professional fees incurred with the restructuring program 
a summary of the restructuring costs is as follows in thousands total charge noncash charges cash payments restructuring accrual at december  cash payments restructuring accrual at december  workforce reduction      consolidation of excess facilities and other charges   total       the restructuring accrual is included on the balance sheet in accrued expenses and other current liabilities 
amounts related to the net lease expense due to the consolidation of facilities will be paid over the respective lease terms through december acquisition related costs 
acquisition related costs consist of contract and facility termination expenses  write offs of certain related fixed assets and leasehold improvements  professional services  severance costs associated with the termination of employees and registration and filing fees incurred in connection with business combinations recorded under the pooling of interests method of accounting 
there were no acquisition related costs for the year ended december  acquisition related costs were million and million for and  respectively 
acquisition related costs in were for incremental costs associated with the final settlement of a facilities lease termination in connection with the egroups acquisition 
during  these costs related primarily to the acquisition of egroups 
due to the elimination of the pooling of interests method of accounting for business combinations as a result of the issuance of statement of accounting standards no 
sfas  business combinations  future acquisition related costs are expected to be limited to in process research and development for technologies acquired in business combinations that have not yet reached technological feasibility and have no alternative future use 
such amounts could have a significant impact on future financial results 
other income loss  net 
other income loss  net was as follows in thousands years ended december  interest income    investment gains losses  net    contract termination fees   earnings in equity interests note    other   other income loss  net was million  million and million for  and  respectively 
the increase from to of million was a result of gains of million on investments in  compared to losses of million on investments in  as well as higher earnings in equity interests of million in as compared to million in this was partially offset by lower interest income in as a result of lower cash balances and reduced interest rates 
the increase from to was primarily the result of the smaller net investment loss of million which includes a gain of million related to the sale of certain equity instruments in compared to million which includes a gain of million related to the exchange of certain equity investments in in addition  the company recorded million of income in related to early termination of a long term advertising contract  whereby the customer terminated the remaining portion of its original agreement and agreed to pay the company a negotiated termination fee to settle the commitment 
the company did not provide the advertising related to the cancelled commitment  and therefore recorded the termination fee as other income 
the company also generated higher interest income on our larger average investment balance in the amounts were partially offset by declining interest rates and foreign exchange losses 
other income loss  net in future periods may fluctuate as a result of changes in our average investment balances held  changes in market rates or the sale of investments  and investment impairments 
minority interests in operations of consolidated subsidiaries 
minority interests in operations of consolidated subsidiaries represents the minority partners percentage share of income or losses from such subsidiaries in which we hold a majority ownership interest  but less than  and consolidate the subsidiaries results in our financial statements 
minority interests in income from operations of consolidated subsidiaries was million  million and million for  and  respectively 
the change from to was due to increased income in korea and reduced losses in europe 
the change from to was due to lower profits within the consolidated affiliates  which was attributable to weaker economic climates in europe and korea 
income taxes 
the provision for income taxes for  and differs from the amount computed by applying the statutory federal rate principally due to a change in valuation allowance related to nondeductible impairment write downs of certain of our equity investments  foreign losses not benefited  nondeductible costs related to acquisitions  nondeductible amortization charges related to acquisitions  nondeductible stock based compensation charges  nontaxable re organizational gains resulting from exchanges of certain equity investments  and a change in income tax regulations resulting in the recognition of certain acquired loss carryforward benefits 
the increase in the provision for income taxes in from was primarily a result of increases in federal and state income taxes  driven by net income for compared to net loss in this increase was partially offset by non deductible acquisition related charges in that did not occur in  which had a tax effect of million  as well as a million increase in the valuation allowance for compared to a million increase for the change in valuation allowance from to was driven by a significant reduction in impairment write downs and foreign losses not benefited for as compared to the decrease in provision for income taxes in from was primarily a result of decreases in federal and state income taxes  as a result of net income in compared to net loss in  as well as a million increase in the valuation allowance for compared to a million increase for the change in valuation allowance from to was driven primarily by nondeductible impairment write downs incurred in business segment results we manage our business geographically 
our segments for financial reporting purposes are the united states and international 
management relies on an internal management reporting process that provides segment ebitda information for making financial decisions and allocating resources 
segment ebitda information includes income loss from operations before certain unallocated operating costs and expenses  including stock compensation expense  amortization of intangibles and depreciation 
we believe that segment ebitda is an appropriate measure of evaluating the operating performance of our segments 
however  segment ebitda should be considered in addition to  not as a substitute for or superior to  operating income  cash flows or other measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles 
revenue is attributed to individual countries according to the international online property that generated the revenue 
no single foreign country accounted for more than of net revenues in   and summarized information by segment for   and  as excerpted from the internal management reports  is as follows dollars in thousands years ended december  net revenues united states    international    total net revenues    segment ebitda united states    international    total segment ebitda    corporate and unallocated operating costs and expenses stock compensation expense    amortization of intangibles    depreciation    income loss from operations   segment ebitda includes income loss from operations before certain unallocated operating costs and expenses  including stock compensation expense  amortization of intangibles  and depreciation

segment ebitda margin 
united states 
united states revenues in increased million  or in absolute dollars as well as increased as a percentage of net revenues primarily due to increased revenue from our search and directory and personals properties  as well as revenue from hotjobs 
united states revenues in decreased million  or  in absolute dollars as well as decreased as a percentage of net revenues primarily due to the overall softening of the global economy  which significantly impacted many of our customers marketing budgets 
united states segment ebitda increased million  or  in absolute dollars from to as a result of the increase in net revenues 
united states segment ebitda decreased million  or  in absolute dollars from to  primarily as a result of decreased net revenues due to the softening of the online advertising market 
the united states segment ebitda decreased in absolute dollars more than revenues in due to the charges for the restructuring programs  but was partially offset by cost savings obtained through a reduction in discretionary spending and the restructuring programs 
international 
international revenues in increased million  or  in absolute dollars primarily due to the strengthening of the asian markets in which we operate  and increases in yahoo portal solutions and transactions revenues  partially offset by a soft advertising market in europe 
international revenues in decreased million  or  in absolute dollars primarily due to the decline in international advertising which occurred across all international markets during international segment ebitda increased million in absolute dollars from to  primarily due to the nonrecurrence of the restructuring programs and a reduction in discretionary spending 
international segment ebitda decreased million  or  in absolute dollars from to  primarily as a result of the decline in advertising revenues  offset partially by reduced discretionary spending 
acquisitions in february  we completed the acquisition of hotjobs  a recruiting solutions company  which became a part of our listings properties and generates revenue primarily through listings and subscription fees for access to hotjobs database 
the acquisition gained the company meaningful presence in the online segment of the recruiting marketplace and is consistent with the company s strategy of building a diversified global business and providing solutions for consumers and business partners 
these factors contributed to a purchase price in excess of fair market value of the hotjobs net tangible and intangible assets acquired  and as a result  the company has recorded goodwill in connection with the transaction 
the total purchase price of million consisted of million in yahoo common stock  representing approximately million shares  million in cash consideration  million of stock options exchanged and direct transaction costs of million 
the value of the common stock and stock options was determined based on the average market price of our common stock over the day period surrounding the date the terms of the exchange offer were finalized in february the preliminary allocation of the purchase price to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on the fair value of hotjobs was as follows in thousands cash acquired  other tangible assets acquired  amortizable intangible assets  goodwill  liabilities  deferred compensation  total  although the company has not finalized the allocation of the purchase price  the company does not expect the final allocation to differ materially from the preliminary allocation 
amortizable intangible assets acquired have estimated useful lives as follows tradename  trademark and domain name seven years  customer contracts five to seven years  developed technology three to five years 
goodwill of million represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the net tangible and intangible assets acquired  and is not deductible for tax purposes 
see note acquisitions in the financial statements for further discussion of acquisitions that we have made in  and related party transactions softbank  including its consolidated affiliates softbank  was approximately a stockholder at december  we have joint ventures with softbank in france  germany  japan  korea and the united kingdom 
a managing partner of a softbank affiliate is also a member of our board of directors 
revenues from softbank accounted for approximately of net revenues for each of the three years ended december    and  respectively 
we believe contracted prices are comparable to those with our other similarly situated customers 
see item of this form k certain relationships and related transactions  note related party transactions and note joint ventures in the financial statements for further information related to transactions with related parties 
critical accounting policies our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to uncollectible receivables  investment values  intangible assets  income taxes  restructuring costs and contingencies 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements revenue recognition  valuation allowances  specifically the allowance for doubtful accounts and deferred tax assets valuation allowance  accounting for investments in private and publicly traded securities  and goodwill impairment 
revenue recognition 
our revenues are primarily generated from the sale of banner  sponsorship  and text link advertisements  including sponsored search advertisements  transactions revenues  and revenues generated from a variety of consumer and business fee and listings based services 
in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states  the recognition of these revenues is partly based on our assessment of the probability of collection of the resulting accounts receivable balance 
as a result  the timing or amount of revenue recognition may have been different if different assessments of the probability of collection of accounts receivable had been made at the time the transactions were recorded in revenue 
valuation allowances 
we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
we record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
while we have considered future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for the valuation allowance  in the event we were to determine that we would be able to realize our deferred tax assets in the future in excess of its net recorded amount  an adjustment to the valuation allowance would likely increase stockholders equity as substantially all of our net operating losses result from employee stock option deductions 
accounting for investments in private and publicly traded securities 
we hold equity interests in companies  some of which are publicly traded and have highly volatile share prices 
we record an investment impairment charge when we believe an investment has experienced a decline in value that is judged to be other than temporary 
we monitor our investments for impairment by considering current factors including economic environment  market conditions and the operational performance and other specific factors relating to the business underlying the investment 
future adverse changes in these factors could result in losses or an inability to recover the carrying value of the investments that may not be reflected in an investment s current carrying value  thereby possibly requiring an impairment charge in the future 
we recorded approximately million of impairments on the carrying value of equity securities during goodwill impairment 
our long lived assets include goodwill and other intangible assets 
statement of financial accounting standards no 
goodwill and other intangible assets sfas requires that goodwill be tested for impairment at the reporting unit level operating segment or one level below an operating segment on an annual basis and between annual tests in certain circumstances 
application of the goodwill impairment test requires judgment  including the identification of reporting units  assigning assets and liabilities to reporting units  assigning goodwill to reporting units  and determining the fair value of each reporting unit 
significant judgments required to estimate the fair value of reporting units include estimating future cash flows  determining appropriate discount rates and other assumptions 
changes in these estimates and assumptions could materially affect the determination of fair value for each reporting unit 
effective january   we adopted sfas and performed a transitional test of our goodwill and intangible assets 
due to  among other things  the overall softening of the global economy and the related decline in international advertising  the company recorded a goodwill impairment loss of million  which was recorded during the first quarter of as a cumulative effect of an accounting change in the company s consolidated financial statements 
the fair value of the reporting unit giving rise to the transitional impairment loss was estimated using the expected present value of future cash flows 
any further impairment losses recorded in the future could have a material adverse impact on our financial conditions and results of operations 
recent accounting pronouncements in june  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
sfas  accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities 
sfas addresses financial accounting and reporting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities and nullifies emerging issues task force issue no 
 liability recognition for certain employee termination benefits and other costs to exit an activity including certain costs incurred in a restructuring 
sfas requires that a liability for costs associated with an exit or disposal activity be recognized and measured initially at fair value only when the liability is incurred  rather than at the date of commitment to an exit or disposal plan 
sfas is effective for exit or disposal activities that are initiated after december  the company does not expect that the adoption of sfas will have a material impact on the company s financial position or results of operations  although sfas may impact the timing of recognition of costs associated with future restructuring  exit or disposal activities 
in december  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
sfas  accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure an amendment of fasb statement no 
sfas amends statement of financial accounting standards no 
sfas  accounting for stock based compensation  to provide alternative methods of transition for a voluntary change to the fair value based method of accounting for stock based employee compensation 
sfas amends the disclosure requirements of sfas to require prominent disclosures both in annual and interim financial statements about the method of accounting for stock based employee compensation and the effect of the method used on reported results 
the company has included the disclosures required by sfas in note the company and summary of significant accounting policies and note stockholders equity 
in november  the fasb issued interpretation no 
fin guarantor s accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees  including indirect guarantees of indebtedness of others 
fin elaborates on the existing disclosure requirements for most guarantees  including loan guarantees 
it also clarifies that at the time a company issues a guarantee  the company must recognize an initial liability for the fair value  or market value  of the obligations it assumes under that guarantee 
however  the provisions related to recognizing a liability at inception of the guarantee for the fair value of the guarantor s obligations does not apply to product warranties or to guarantees accounted for as derivatives 
the initial recognition and initial measurement provisions apply on a prospective basis to guarantees issued or modified after december  the disclosure requirements of fin are effective for financial statements of interim or annual periods ending after december  the company has not yet determined the effect of adopting fin on its results of operations or financial position 
in january  the fasb issued interpretation no 
fin consolidation of variable interest entities 
until this interpretation  a company generally included another entity in its consolidated financial statements only if it controlled the entity through voting interests 
fin requires a variable interest entity  as defined  to be consolidated by a company if that company is subject to a majority of the risk of loss from the variable interest entity s activities or entitled to receive a majority of the entity s residual returns 
management is currently evaluating the effect of adopting fin on its results of operations and financial position 
in november  the emerging issues task force reached a consensus on issue no 
eitf  revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables 
eitf provides guidance on how to account for arrangements that involve the delivery or performance of multiple products  services and or rights to use assets 
the provisions of eitf will apply to revenue arrangements entered into in fiscal periods beginning after june  the company does not believe the adoption of eitf will have a material impact on its financial position or results of operations

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to the impact of interest rate changes  foreign currency fluctuations  and changes in the market values of our investments 
interest rate risk 
our exposure to market rate risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our investment portfolio 
we have not used derivative financial instruments to hedge our investment portfolio 
we invest excess cash in debt instruments of the us government and its agencies  and in high quality corporate issuers and  by policy  limit the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer 
we protect and preserve invested funds by limiting default  market and reinvestment risk 
investments in both fixed rate and floating rate interest earning instruments carry a degree of interest rate risk 
fixed rate securities may have their fair market value adversely impacted due to a rise in interest rates  while floating rate securities may produce less income than expected if interest rates fall 
due in part to these factors  our future investment income may fall short of expectations due to changes in interest rates or we may suffer losses in principal if forced to sell securities which have declined in market value due to changes in interest rates 
foreign currency risk 
international revenues from our foreign subsidiaries accounted for approximately of total revenues during international sales are made mostly from our foreign sales subsidiaries in their respective countries and are typically denominated in the local currency of each country 
these subsidiaries also incur most of their expenses in the local currency 
accordingly  all foreign subsidiaries use the local currency as their functional currency 
our international business is subject to risks  including  but not limited to differing economic conditions  changes in political climate  differing tax structures  other regulations and restrictions  and foreign exchange rate volatility when compared to the united states 
accordingly  our future results could be materially adversely impacted by changes in these or other factors 
our exposure to foreign exchange rate fluctuations arises in part from intercompany accounts in which costs incurred in the united states are charged to our foreign sales subsidiaries 
these intercompany accounts are typically denominated in the functional currency of the foreign subsidiary 
we are also exposed to foreign exchange rate fluctuations as the financial statements of foreign subsidiaries are translated into us dollars in consolidation 
as exchange rates vary  these results  when translated  may vary from expectations and adversely impact overall expected profitability 
the effect of foreign exchange rate fluctuations for was not material 
investment risk 
we invest in equity instruments of privately held companies for business and strategic purposes 
these investments are included in other long term assets and are accounted for under the cost method when ownership is less than and we do not have the ability to exercise significant influence over operations 
since our initial investment  certain of these investments in privately held companies have become marketable equity securities upon the investees completing initial public offerings 
such investments  most of which are in the internet industry  are subject to significant fluctuations in fair market value due to the volatility of the stock market  and are recorded as long term investments 
for these investments in public and privately held companies  our policy is to monitor these investments for impairment by considering current factors including economic environment  market conditions and operational performance and other specific factors relating to the business underlying the investment  and reductions in carrying value when necessary 
the primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve principal while at the same time maximizing yields without significantly increasing risk 
to achieve this objective  we maintain our portfolio of cash equivalents  short term and long term investments in a variety of securities  including both government and corporate obligations and money market funds 
as of december  the net unrealized gains of million on these investments have been recorded net of deferred taxes of million as a separate component of stockholders equity 
we are exposed to market risk as it relates to changes in the market value of our investments 
we invest in equity instruments of public companies  certain of which may be classified as derivatives  for business and strategic purposes and have classified these securities as available for sale 
these available for sale equity investments  primarily in internet and technology companies  are subject to significant fluctuations in fair value due to the volatility of the stock market and the industries in which these companies participate 
we have realized gains and losses from both the sale of investments  as well as mergers and acquisitions of companies in which we have invested 
as of december   we had available for sale equity investments with a fair value of million and a cost basis of million 
the net unrealized losses of million have been recorded net of deferred taxes of million as a separate component of stockholders equity and gains on derivatives of million have been recorded in other income on the statement of operations 
our objective in managing exposure to stock market fluctuations is to minimize the impact of stock market declines to earnings and cash flows 
however  continued market volatility  as well as mergers and acquisitions  have the potential to have a material non cash impact on our operating results in future periods
