item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation critical accounting policies and estimates management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations discusses our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
we believe that the estimates  assumptions and judgments involved in the accounting policies described below have the greatest potential impact on our financial statements  so we consider these to be our critical accounting policies 
because of the uncertainty inherent in these matters  actual results could differ from the estimates we used in applying the critical accounting policies 
within the context of these critical accounting policies  we are not currently aware of any reasonably likely event that would result in materially different amounts being reported 
allowance for excess and obsolete inventory inventories  which are composed of raw materials  work in process and finished goods  are valued at the lower of cost or market 
on a periodic basis  the company analyzes the level of inventory on hand  its cost in relation to market value and estimated customer requirements to determine whether write downs for excess or obsolete inventory are required 
actual customer requirements in any future periods are inherently uncertain and thus may differ from our estimates 
if actual or expected requirements were significantly greater or lower than the established reserves  we would record a reduction or increase to the obsolescence allowance in the period in which we made such a determination 
goodwill impairment the company evaluates the valuation of its goodwill according to the provisions of sfas to determine if the current value of goodwill has been impaired 
to do this the company determines the discounted present value of anticipated cash flows based on anticipated results of operations for the coming years 
if we have changes in events or circumstances  including reductions in anticipated cash flows generated by our operations  goodwill could become impaired which would result in a charge to earnings 
deferred taxes the company accounts for income taxes using the liability method 
deferred income taxes are provided for temporary difference between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities 
a valuation allowance would be set up should the realization of any deferred taxes become less likely than not to occur 
the valuation allowance is analyzed periodically by the company and may result in income tax expense different than statutory rates 
liquidity and capital resources the company s net working capital at the end of fiscal was  as compared to  at the end of fiscal the improvement was due in large measure to the company generating million in cash in fiscal  and using those funds to pay down debt 
the ratio of current assets to current liabilities improved to to from to in the prior year

the company s total debt was  at august  that consisted of capital lease obligations secured by production equipment 
in fiscal  the company elected to payoff its seller subordinated note early 
in connection with the prepayment  the company received a  discount from the note holder 
current maturities of long term debt consist of  due on capital leases 
it is managements belief that internally generated funds will be sufficient to enable the company to meet its financial requirements during fiscal  even if the company does not renew its revolving line of credit 
however  the company intends on pursuing a renewal of the line 
results of operations net sales in fiscal were million which is a decrease of million or from fiscal the primary reason for the decrease was the asset sale of bowman tool in february  and thus the inclusion of a half year of bowman sales in operations 
year on year sales for taurus numeric tool the remaining subsidiary of wsi increased in fiscal from approximately million in fiscal this increase in sales resulted from increases in volume in the recreational vehicle market offset by the decline in sales from the aerospace and avionics market

selling and administrative expense of million in fiscal was a decrease of  from fiscal and million from fiscal the decrease in selling and administrative expense in fiscal was due in part to the inclusion in fiscal of six months of bowman administrative expense 
wsi s selling and administrative costs were also lower in both and due to cost containment measures including reductions in wages and benefits  professional services and cost savings due to the consolidation efforts that were a result of the sale of the bowman tool subsidiary assets 
the company s fiscal fourth quarter selling and administrative expense was negatively affected by a  charge related to an environmental claim relating to an incident that occurred in involving a subsidiary of the company that no longer exists 
the company s selling and administrative expense was also lower in due to the company s adoption of fas goodwill and intangible assets as outlined in note of the financial statements which resulted in a reduction of amortization expense of  versus interest expense of  in fiscal was  lower than and  lower than the lower expense is a result of overall lower levels of long term debt
