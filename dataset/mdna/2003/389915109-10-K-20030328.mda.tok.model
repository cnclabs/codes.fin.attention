item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations please refer to forward looking statements following the index in front of this form k 
general following is a discussion and analysis of the financial statements and other statistical data that management believes will enhance the understanding of the financial condition and results of operations of great american financial resources  inc gafri or the company 
this discussion should be read in conjunction with the financial statements beginning on page f gafri and its subsidiary  aag holding company  inc  are organized as holding companies with nearly all of their operations being conducted by their subsidiaries 
these companies  however  have continuing expenditures for administrative expenses  corporate services and for the payment of interest and principal on borrowings and stockholder dividends 
critical accounting policies significant accounting policies are described in note b to the financial statements 
the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that can have a significant effect on amounts reported in the financial statements 
as more information becomes known  these estimates and assumptions could change and thus impact amounts reported in the future 
management believes that the establishment of insurance reserves  the determination of other than temporary impairments on investments  the recoverability and carrying value of unamortized insurance acquisition costs and environmental reserves of gafri s former manufacturing operations are the areas where the degree of judgement required to determine amounts recorded in the financial statements make the accounting policies critical 
liquidity and capital resources ratios gafri s consolidated debt to capital ratio was in for purposes of this calculation  capital represents the sum of consolidated debt  redeemable preferred securities of subsidiary trusts and stockholders equity excluding unrealized gains losses on marketable securities 
the national association of insurance commissioners naic risk based capital rbc formula determines the amount of capital that an insurance company needs to ensure that it has an acceptable expectation of not becoming financially impaired 
at december   the capital ratio of gafri s principal insurance subsidiary was times its authorized control level rbc 
sources and uses of funds to pay interest and principal on borrowings and other holding company costs  gafri parent and aag holding use primarily capital distributions from their directly owned insurance subsidiaries  great american life insurance company galic and ga life of puerto rico gapr  bank borrowings and cash and investments on hand 
capital distributions from gafri s insurance subsidiaries are subject to regulatory restrictions relating to statutory surplus and earnings 
the maximum amount of dividends payable by galic and gapr in without prior regulatory approval is million and million  respectively 
in  galic paid million in dividends and gapr paid million in dividends 
also in  gafri made capital contributions to galic of million 
in the third quarter of  gafri paid down approximately million of its bank credit line 
in january  the company replaced its existing agreement with a million unsecured credit agreement  which matures at december  in september  gafri redeemed its ropes for million in cash using bank borrowings 
at march   gafri had million available under its bank credit line 
in recent years  the company has entered into several reinsurance transactions in connection with certain of its life and supplemental health operations 
these transactions were entered into both in the normal course of business and as a source of additional capital and liquidity 
the company may enter into additional reinsurance transactions in the future 
at december   gafri had million available under a shelf registration 
based upon the current level of operations and anticipated growth  gafri believes that it will have sufficient resources to meet its liquidity requirements 
independent ratings the company s principal insurance subsidiaries insurance companies are rated by am best  fitch and standard poor s 
galic is rated a good financial security by moody s 
such ratings are generally based on items of concern to policyholders and agents and are not directed toward the protection of investors 
following are the company s ratings as of march  standard am best fitch poor s galic a excellent a strong a strong ailic a excellent a strong a strong loyal a excellent a strong not rated uta a excellent not rated not rated gapr a excellent not rated not rated in evaluating a company  independent rating agencies review such factors as the company s i capital adequacy  ii profitability  iii leverage and liquidity  iv book of business  v quality and estimated market value of assets  vi adequacy of policy reserves  vii experience and competency of management and viii operating profile 
management believes that the ratings assigned by independent insurance rating agencies are important because potential policyholders often use a company s rating as an initial screening device in considering annuity products 
management believes that i a rating of a by am best its third highest rating is necessary to successfully market tax deferred annuities to public education employees and other not for profit groups and ii a rating in the a category by at least one rating agency is necessary to successfully compete in other annuity markets 
gafri s insurance entities also compete in markets other than the sale of tax deferred annuities 
ratings are an important competitive factor  management believes that these entities can successfully compete in these markets with their respective ratings 
the company s insurance ratings were recently affirmed by fitch with a stable outlook  and affirmed by moody s with a negative outlook  its ratings were downgraded by standard poor s with a negative outlook 
gafri s operations could be materially and adversely affected by additional downgrades 
in connection with recent reviews by independent rating agencies  management indicated that it intends to maintain the capital of its significant insurance subsidiaries at levels currently indicated by the rating agencies as appropriate for the current ratings 
items which could adversely affect capital levels include i a sustained decrease in the stock market in or beyond  ii a significant period of low interest rates and a resulting significant narrowing of annuity spread  iii investment impairments  iv a change in statutory reserving requirements for guaranteed minimum death benefits on variable annuities  v adverse mortality  and vi higher than planned dividends paid due to liquidity needs by gafri and aag holding 
acquisition on june   galic acquired manhattan national life insurance company mnl for million in cash 
in december  the company reinsured of the business in force 
at december   mnl had statutory assets of approximately million and statutory capital and surplus of million 
investments insurance laws restrict the types and amounts of investments which are permissible for life insurers 
these restrictions are designed to ensure the safety and liquidity of insurers investment portfolios 
gafri invests primarily in fixed income investments which  including loans and short term investments  comprised of its investment portfolio at december  gafri generally invests in securities having intermediate term maturities with an objective of optimizing interest yields while maintaining an appropriate relationship of maturities between gafri s assets and expected liabilities 
the naic assigns quality ratings to publicly traded as well as privately placed securities 
at december   of gafri s fixed maturity portfolio was comprised of investment grade bonds naic rating of or 
management believes that a high quality investment portfolio is more likely to generate a stable and predictable investment return 
at december   gafri s mortgage backed securities mbss portfolio represented approximately one third of its fixed maturity investments 
mbss are subject to significant prepayment risk due to the fact that  in periods of declining interest rates  mortgages may be repaid more rapidly than scheduled as borrowers refinance higher rate mortgages to take advantage of the lower current rates 
due to the significant decline in the general level of interest rates in  gafri has experienced an increase in the level of prepayments on its mbs portfolio  these prepayments have not been reinvested at interest rates comparable to the rates earned on the prepaid mbss 
partly as a result of this  the overall yield on gafri s fixed maturity portfolio dropped from at year end to at year end approximately of gafri s mbss are rated aaa with substantially all being investment grade quality 
the market in which these securities trade is highly liquid 
aside from the interest rate risk referred to above  gafri does not believe a material risk relative to earnings or liquidity is inherent in holding such investments 
at december   gafri had pretax net unrealized gains of million on fixed maturities and million on equity securities 
summarized information for the unrealized gains and losses recorded in gafri s balance sheet at december   is shown in the following table dollars in millions 
approximately million of fixed maturities and million of equity securities had no unrealized gains or losses at december  securities with unrealized securities with unrealized gains losses fixed maturities market value of securities amortized cost of securities gross unrealized gain or loss market value as of amortized cost number of security positions number individually exceeding million gain or loss concentration of gains or losses by type or industry exceeding of unrealized mortgage backed securities banks us government state and municipal electric services asset backed securities air transportation generally collateralized percentage rated investment grade equity securities market value of securities cost of securities gross unrealized gain or loss market value as of cost gafri s investment in equity securities of provident financial group  a cincinnati based commercial banking and financial services company  represents million of the million in unrealized gains on equity securities at december  the table below sets forth the scheduled maturities of fixed maturity securities at december   based on their market values 
securities that do not have a single maturity date are reported at average maturity 
actual maturities may differ from contractual maturities because certain securities may be called or prepaid by the issuers 
securities with unrealized securities with unrealized maturity gains losses one year or less after one year through five years after five years through ten years after ten years mortgage backed securities excludes million of fixed maturities with no unrealized gains or losses 
gafri realized aggregate losses of million during on million in sales of fixed maturity securities issues issuers that had individual unrealized losses greater than  at december  market values of five of the securities increased an aggregate of million from december  to date of sale 
one of the securities was a conseco bond that decreased in value by million from december  to the date of sale due to the continued decline in conseco s financial condition 
the market value of the remaining security did not change from december  to the sale date 
although gafri had the ability to continue holding these investments  its intent to hold them changed due primarily to deterioration in the issuers creditworthiness  decisions to lessen exposure to a particular credit or industry  or to modify asset allocation within the portfolio 
none of the securities were sold out of a necessity to raise cash 
gafri has the ability and intent to hold securities with unrealized losses at december   for a period of time sufficient to allow for a recovery in market value 
the table below dollars in millions summarizes the length of time securities have been in an unrealized gain or loss position at december  aggregate market value aggregate unrealized gain loss market value as of cost basis fixed maturities securities with unrealized gains at exceeding  and for less than one year issues more than one year issues less than  and an unrealized gain for less than one year issues more than one year issues securities with unrealized losses at exceeding  and for less than one year issues more than one year issues less than  and an unrealized loss for less than one year issues more than one year issues equity securities securities with unrealized gains at exceeding  and for less than one year issues more than one year issue less than  and an unrealized gain for less than one year issues more than one year issues securities with unrealized losses at exceeding  and for less than one year issues more than one year issues less than  and an unrealized loss for less than one year issues more than one year issue when a decline in the value of a specific investment is considered to be other than temporary  a provision for impairment is charged to earnings accounted for as a realized loss and the cost basis of that investment is reduced 
the determination of whether unrealized losses are other than temporary requires judgment based on subjective as well as objective factors 
factors considered and resources used by management include a 
whether the unrealized loss is credit driven or a result of changes in market interest rates  b 
the extent to which market value is less than cost basis  c 
historical operating  balance sheet and cash flow data contained in issuer sec filings  d

ability and intent to hold the investment for a period of time sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in market value 
based on its analysis of the factors enumerated above  management believes i gafri will recover its cost basis in the securities with unrealized losses and ii that gafri has the ability and intent to hold the securities until they mature or recover in value 
should either of these beliefs change with regard to a particular security  a charge for impairment would likely be required 
while it is not possible to accurately predict if or when a specific security will become impaired  charges for other than temporary impairment could be material to results of operations in a future period 
while management believes it is not likely that future impairment charges will have a significant effect on gafri s liquidity  impairment charges could have an effect on the company s ratings 
net realized gains losses on investments sold and charges for other than temporary impairment on investments held were as follows in millions net realized gains losses on sales charges for impairment other a total b a 
includes adjustments to carry derivatives at market and to reflect the impact of realized gains and losses on the amortization of deferred policy acquisition costs 
b 
does not include an million writedown of certain collateralized debt obligations  which was recorded as the cumulative effect of an adoption of an accounting change at april  increased impairment charges in recent years reflect a rise in corporate defaults in the marketplace resulting from the weakened economy  fraud and other factors 
uncertainties exposure to market risk market risk represents the potential economic loss arising from adverse changes in the fair value of financial instruments 
gafri s exposures to market risk relate primarily to its fixed maturity investment portfolio and annuity contracts which are exposed to interest rate risk and  to a lesser extent  equity price risk 
in addition  a portion of gafri s long term debt is also exposed to interest rate risk 
fixed maturity portfolio the fair value of gafri s fixed maturity portfolio is directly impacted by changes in market interest rates 
gafri s fixed maturity portfolio is comprised of substantially all fixed rate investments with primarily short term and intermediate term maturities 
this practice allows flexibility in reacting to fluctuations of interest rates 
gafri s portfolio is managed with an attempt to achieve an adequate risk adjusted return while maintaining sufficient liquidity to meet policyholder obligations 
gafri attempts to align the duration of invested assets to the projected cash flows of policyholder liabilities 
the following table provides information about gafri s fixed maturity investments at december  and  that are sensitive to interest rate risk 
these tables show dollars in millions principal cash flows and related weighted average interest rates by expected maturity date for each of the five subsequent years and for all years thereafter 
callable bonds and notes are included based on call date or maturity date depending upon which date produces the most conservative yield 
mbss and sinking fund issues are included based on maturity year adjusted for expected payment patterns 
actual cash flows may differ from those expected 
december  december  principal principal cash flows rate cash flows rate thereafter thereafter total total fair value fair value annuity contracts substantially all of gafri s fixed rate annuity contracts permit gafri to change crediting rates subject to minimum interest rate guarantees of to per annum as determined by applicable law enabling management to react to changes in market interest rates 
nonetheless  due to the sharp drop in interest rates in  gafri s spreads have narrowed and will likely continue to narrow through at least actuarial assumptions used to estimate dpac and annuity benefits  as well as gafri s ability to maintain spread  could be impacted if the current interest rate environment continues for an extended period and causes policyholder behavior to be altered 
projected payments in each of the next five years and for all years thereafter on gafri s fixed annuity liabilities at december are as follows dollars in millions there fair first second third fourth fifth after total value nearly half of gafri s fixed annuity liabilities at december   were two tier in nature in that policyholders can receive a higher amount if they annuitize rather than surrender their policy  even if the surrender charge period has expired 
at december   the average stated crediting rate on gafri s principal fixed annuity products was approximately and current stated crediting rates excluding bonus interest on gafri s active products generally range from to 
gafri estimates that its effective weighted average crediting rate  on its inforce business over the next five years will approximate 
this rate reflects actuarial assumptions as to i expected investment spread ii deaths  iii annuitizations  iv surrenders and v renewal premiums 
actual experience and changes in actuarial assumptions may result in different effective crediting rates than those above 
gafri s equity indexed fixed annuities provide policyholders with a crediting rate tied  in part  to the performance of an existing stock market index 
gafri attempts to mitigate the risk in the equity based component of these products through the purchase of call options on the appropriate index 
the company s strategy is designed so that an increase in the liabilities  due to an increase in the market index  will be substantially offset by unrealized gains on the call options purchased by the company 
under sfas no 
 both the equity based component of the annuities and the related call options are considered derivatives and marked to market through current earnings as annuity benefits 
adjusting these derivatives to market value had a net effect of less than of annuity benefits in and in  gafri chose to suspend new sales of equity indexed annuities due primarily to lack of volume 
debt and preferred securities the following table shows scheduled principal payments on fixed rate long term debt of gafri and related weighted average interest rates for the next five years and for all years thereafter in millions december  december  scheduled scheduled principal principal payments rate payments rate through through thereafter thereafter total total fair value fair value less than million each year under the terms of the company s bank credit facility entered into in january  gafri and its subsidiaries have no variable rate debt maturing until december the weighted average interest rate on gafri s variable rate debt was at march   at december   and at december  there were million of subsidiary trust preferred securities outstanding at december   and  none of which are scheduled for maturity or mandatory redemption during the next five years  the weighted average interest rate on these trust securities at december  and was 
results of operations general the comparability of gafri s financial statements is affected by the acquisitions of subsidiaries discussed in note c to its financial statements 
results of operations as shown in the accompanying financial statements are prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles 
many investors and analysts focus on core earnings of companies  setting aside certain items included in net earnings such as realized gains and losses  the cumulative effect of accounting changes and certain other unusual items 
realized gains and losses are excluded from core earnings because they are unpredictable and not necessarily indicative of current operating fundamentals 
other items such as the litigation charges are excluded to assist investors in analyzing their impact on the trend in operating results 
nonetheless  these items are significant components of gafri s overall financial results and core earnings should not be considered a substitute for the net income reported in the consolidated income statement as an indication of gafri s overall performance 
the following table in millions  except per share amounts compares the compan y s core earnings over the past three years 
gafri consolidated net operating earnings per income statement exclude litigation charges  net of tax included in annuity benefits included in other expenses exclude realized losses gains  net of tax core net operating earnings diluted earnings per common share net income per share per income statement exclude  per share litigation charges realized losses gains equity in results of affiliate accounting changes core net operating earnings per share the following table summarizes gafri s annuity sales in millions 
annuity premiums single premium fixed rate annuities flexible premium fixed rate annuities single premium variable annuities flexible premium variable annuities sales of fixed rate annuity products were up and in and  respectively  and were offset by a decrease in the sale of variable annuities by and over the same periods 
management attributes these trends to the volatile equity and bond markets  the introduction of several new fixed rate products and exiting the wholesale single premium  non qualified variable annuity market 
life  accident and health premiums and benefits the following table summarizes gafri s life  accident and health premiums and benefits as shown in the consolidated income statement in millions 
premiums supplemental insurance products ga life of puerto rico life products benefits supplemental insurance products ga life of puerto rico life products gafri continues to experience adverse mortality in galic s life division 
further adverse mortality could result in an additional charge to income due to a further reduction in unamortized insurance acquisition costs 
see md a insurance acquisition expenses life products in include premiums of million and benefits of million related to manhattan national life which was acquired in june the increase in supplemental insurance premiums and benefits is due primarily to the november reinsurance of a block of accident and health insurance business 
net investment income net investment income increased in due primarily to higher average invested assets partially as a result of the mnl acquisition  somewhat offset by lower yields in the portfolio 
the yield on gafri s fixed maturity portfolio was approximately at december  compared to approximately at december  see md a investments 
gafri expects the yield on its portfolio to further decline through at least net investment income increased in as a result of higher average invested assets 
realized gains losses on investments realized gains losses on investments included the following provisions for other than temporary impairment million  million and million for the years ended  and  respectively 
see md a investments results for include a pretax gain of million resulting from the sale of gafri s investment in a company engaged in the production of ethanol 
gafri s investment was repurchased by the ethanol company which  following the repurchase  became wholly owned by gafri s chairman 
other income other income increased million in compared to the same period in due primarily to income from the sale of real estate and  to a lesser extent  increased fees earned on gafri s variable annuity and life business 
these increases were partially offset by lower annuity policy charges and lower revenues at gafri s insurance agency and broker dealer subsidiaries 
real estate operations gafri is engaged in a variety of real estate operations including hotels and marinas  gafri also owns various parcels of land 
revenues and expenses of these operations  including gains on disposal  are included in gafri s consolidated income statement as shown below in millions 
other income other expenses other income included a pretax gain on the sale of real estate assets of million in annuity benefits annuity benefits reflect amounts accrued on annuity policyholders funds accumulated 
the majority of gafri s fixed rate annuity products permit gafri to change the crediting rate at any time subject to minimum interest rate guarantees of to per annum 
historically  management has been able to react to changes in market interest rates and maintain a desired interest rate spread 
the recent interest rate environment has resulted in a spread compression  which could continue through at least on its deferred annuities annuities in the accumulation phase  gafri generally credits interest to policyholders accounts at their current stated surrender interest rates 
furthermore  for two tier deferred annuities annuities under which a higher interest amount can be earned if a policy is annuitized rather than surrendered  gafri accrues an additional liability to provide for expected deaths and annuitizations 
changes in crediting rates  actual surrender  death and annuitization experience or modifications in actuarial assumptions can affect this accrual 
in  this accrual was reduced by approximately million due to i decreases in crediting rates on certain fixed annuity products  partially offset by ii a modification in projected investment yields 
significant changes in projected investment yields could result in additional benefits or charges to earnings 
insurance acquisition expenses insurance acquisition expenses include amortization of deferred policy acquisition costs dpac as well as a portion of commissions on sales of insurance products 
insurance acquisition expenses also include amortization of the present value of future profits of businesses acquired amounting to million in  million in and million in the increase in insurance acquisition expenses in reflects i a writeoff of dpac  ii the amortization costs associated with gafri s purchase of mnl in june and iii higher commission expense due to the company s growth in premiums 
included in and were dpac writeoffs related to variable annuities of million and million  respectively  resulting from the actual performance of the equity markets and a reduction of assumed future returns 
poor performance in the equity markets could lead to additional dpac writeoffs or a charge to earnings in order to accrue for guaranteed minimum death benefits included in the variable products 
see md a proposed accounting standard 
included in is a dpac writeoff of million related primarily to adverse mortality in the company s life operations 
partially offsetting the dpac writeoffs in was a reduction of approximately million in dpac amortization on fixed annuities relating to decreases in crediting rates o n certain fixed annuity products 
continued adverse mortality could lead to additional dpac writeoffs 
significant changes in projected investment yields could result in additional benefits or charges to earnings 
the increase in is due primarily to i increased lapses and increased sales of traditional life insurance by galic and ii the effect of the equity markets on variable annuity dpac 
trust preferred distribution requirement the decrease in trust preferred distribution requirement in and reflects the company s september redemption of one issue of its trust preferred securities 
interest and other debt expenses higher average borrowings in were offset by lower interest rates on the company s bank debt 
the decrease in interest and other debt expenses in compared to is due primarily to lower average borrowings as well as lower interest rates on these borrowings 
other expenses other expenses increased in due to i an increase in expenses from real estate operations resulting from the acquisition of property and ii the acquisition of mnl in june other expenses decreased in primarily due to the absence of a litigation charge that was recorded in see md a results of operations general 
income taxes the provision for income taxes in all periods presented reflects the effects of non taxable foreign operations 
in and  the provision for income taxes also reflects reductions of the valuation allowance associated with certain deferred tax assets

equity in losses of affiliate equity in losses of affiliate in represents gafri s proportionate share of the results of chiquita brands international  as well as the writedown in of gafri s investment in chiquita to market value of approximately per share 
chiquita reported net losses attributable to common shareholders of million in cumulative effect of accounting changes effective january   gafri implemented statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  under which goodwill is no longer amortized  but is subject to an impairment test at least annually 
the initial impairment testing resulted in an aftertax charge of million for the cumulative effect of an accounting change 
at december   gafri had less than million of unamortized goodwill remaining on its balance sheet 
in  the cumulative effect of accounting change represents the implementation of a new accounting standard eitf which resulted in a writedown of million million or per share after tax of the cost basis of certain collateralized debt obligations in the second quarter 
in  gafri implemented statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  which requires all derivatives to be recognized in the balance sheet at fair value  and that the initial effect of recognizing derivatives at fair value be reported as a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle 
accordingly  gafri recorded income of million net of taxes reflecting the adoption of sfas no 
recent accounting standards the following accounting standards have been  
or will be 
implemented by gafri 
the implementation of these standards is discussed under various subheadings of note b to the financial statements 
effects of each are shown in the relevant notes 
accounting year standard subject of standard implemented sfas derivatives eitf asset backed securities sfas business combinations sfas goodwill and other intangibles sfas stock based compensation other standards issued in recent years did not apply to gafri or had only negligible effects on gafri 
proposed accounting standard gafri s variable annuity contracts contain a guaranteed minimum death benefit gmdb which may exceed the value of the policyholder s account to be paid if the annuityholder dies before the annuity payout period commences 
payment of any difference between the gmdb and the related account balance is borne by gafri and expensed when paid 
in periods of declining equity markets  the gmdb difference increases as the variable annuity account value decreases 
at december  and  the aggregate gmdb values assuming every policyholder died on those dates exceeded the market value of the underlying variable annuities by million and million  respectively 
industry practice varies  but gafri does not establish gaap reserves for this mortality risk 
if a proposed accounting standard becomes effective  gafri would be required to record a liability for the present value of expected gmdb payments 
initial recognition of a gaap liability estimated to be less than of the difference between the underlying market value of the variable annuities and the gmdb value would be accounted for as the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principles 
death benefits paid in excess of the variable annuity account balance were million in item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the information required by item a is included in management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations
