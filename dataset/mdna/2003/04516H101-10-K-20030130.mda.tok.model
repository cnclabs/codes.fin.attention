critical accounting policies in response to the sec s release numbers  cautionary advice regarding disclosure about critical accounting policies and  commission statement about management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  the company has identified the following critical accounting policies that affect its significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements 

table of contents sales returns and other allowances 
management must make estimates of potential future product returns related to current period product revenues 
management analyzes historical returns  current economic trends  changes in customer demand and sell through of our products when evaluating the adequacy of the sales returns and other allowances 
significant management judgments and estimates must be made and used in connection with establishing the sales returns and other allowances in any accounting period 
material differences may result in the amount and timing of our revenues for any period if management makes different judgments or utilizes different estimates 
the reserves for sales returns and other allowances amounted to  at october  compared to  at october  allowance for doubtful accounts 
management must also make estimates of the uncollectability of accounts receivable 
the company maintains an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of its customers to make required payments  which results in bad debt expense 
management determines the adequacy of this allowance by analyzing historical bad debts  continually evaluating individual customer receivables considering the customer s financial condition and current economic conditions 
as of october   the company had reserved  for the unpaid principal balance of an unsecured promissory note as well as approximately  of receivables due from a national retail customer which has filed for protection under us bankruptcy laws 
if the financial condition of other significant customers of ours were to deteriorate  resulting in the impairment of their ability to make payments  material additional allowances for doubtful accounts may be required 
in october  the company acquired credit insurance to cover many of its major accounts 
our trade accounts receivable balance was million  net of allowances for doubtful accounts of million  at october   as compared to the balance of million  net of allowances for doubtful accounts of million  at october  inventory 
the company writes down its inventory by amounts equal to the difference between the cost of inventory and the estimated net realizable value based on assumptions about the age of the inventory  future demand and market conditions 
this process provides for a new basis for the inventory until it is sold 
if actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management  additional inventory write downs may be required 
our inventory balance was million  net of inventory write downs of million  at october   as compared to an inventory balance of million  net of inventory write downs of million at october  the inventory balance increased as compared to the prior fiscal year end due to the addition of the callaway golf apparel product line 
the ashworth brand inventory declined approximately as compared to the prior fiscal year 
asset purchase credits 
in november  the company entered into an agreement with a third party whereby inventory was exchanged for future asset purchase credits apcs  which may be utilized by the company to purchase future goods and services over a four year period 
the original value of the inventory exchanged at cost was million resulting in million in future apcs 
the company has entered into contracts with several third party suppliers who have agreed to accept these apcs  in part  as payment for goods and services 
from time to time the company may enter into additional contracts with such third party suppliers to use the apcs 
at october   the company had  of the apcs remaining and management expects to fully utilize them over their remaining life 
at october  and  the company did not have any relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships  such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities  which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes 
in addition  the company does not engage in trading activities involving non exchange traded contracts which rely on estimation techniques to calculate fair value 
as such  the company is not exposed to any financing  liquidity  market or credit risk that could arise if the company had engaged in such relationships

new accounting standards in june  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of financial 
table of contents accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for asset retirement obligations  which addresses financial accounting and reporting for obligations associated with the retirement of tangible long lived assets and the associated asset retirement costs 
the standard applies to legal obligations associated with the retirement of long lived assets that result from the acquisition  construction  development and or normal use of the asset 
sfas no 
requires that the fair value of a liability for an asset retirement obligation be recognized in the period in which it is incurred if a reasonable estimate of fair value can be made 
the fair value of the liability is added to the carrying amount of the associated asset and this additional carrying amount is depreciated over the life of the asset 
the liability is accreted at the end of each period through charges to operating expense 
if the obligation is settled for other than the carrying amount of the liability  the company will recognize a gain or loss on settlement 
the company is required and plans to adopt the provisions of sfas no 
for the quarter ending january  to accomplish this  the company must identify all legal obligations for asset retirement obligations  if any  and determine the fair value of these obligations on the date of adoption 
the determination of fair value is complex and will require the company to gather market information and develop cash flow models 
additionally  the company will be required to develop processes to track and monitor these obligations 
management does not expect the adoption of sfas no 
to have a material impact on the company s financial statements 
in august  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  which supersedes both sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of and the accounting and reporting provisions of accounting principles board apb opinion no 
 reporting the results of operations reporting the effects of disposal of a segment of a business  and extraordinary  unusual and infrequently occurring events and transactions  for the disposal of a segment of a business as previously defined in that opinion 
sfas no 
retains the fundamental provisions in sfas no 
for recognizing and measuring impairment losses on long lived assets held for use and long lived assets to be disposed of by sale  while also resolving significant implementation issues associated with sfas no 
for example  sfas no 
provides guidance on how a long lived asset that is used as part of a group should be evaluated for impairment  establishes criteria for when a long lived asset is held for sale  and prescribes the accounting for a long lived asset that will be disposed of other than by sale 
sfas no 
retains the basic provisions of apb opinion no 
on how to present discontinued operations in the income statement but broadens that presentation to include a component of an entity rather than a segment of a business 
unlike sfas no 
 an impairment assessment under sfas no 
will never result in a write down of goodwill 
rather  goodwill is evaluated for impairment under sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
the company is required to adopt sfas no 
no later than the fiscal year beginning after december   and plans to adopt its provisions for the quarter ending january  the provisions of the statement for assets held for sale or other disposal generally are required to be applied prospectively after the adoption date to newly initiated disposal activities 
management does not expect the adoption of sfas no 
for long lived assets held for use to have a material impact on the company s financial statements because the impairment assessment under sfas no 
is largely unchanged from sfas no 
in april  the fasb issued sfas no 
 rescission of fasb sfass no 
  and  amendment of fasb sfas no 
 and technical corrections 
sfas no 
updates  clarifies and simplifies existing accounting pronouncements including rescinding sfas no 
 which required all gains and losses from extinguishments of debt to be aggregated and  if material  classified as an extraordinary item  net of related income tax effect and amending sfas no 
to require that certain lease modifications that have 
table of contents economic effects similar to sale leaseback transactions be accounted for in the same manner as sale leaseback transactions 
upon adoption of sfas no 
 companies will be required to apply the criteria in apb opinion no 
 reclassifying prior period items that do not meet the extraordinary item classification criteria in such opinion 
sfas no 
is effective for fiscal years beginning after may   with early adoption of the provisions related to the rescission of sfas no 
encouraged 
the company is required and plans to adopt the provisions of sfas no 
for the quarter ending january  the company does not expect the adoption of this statement to have a material impact on its financial position or results of operations 
in june  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities  which addresses financial accounting and reporting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities 
sfas no 
nullifies eitf issue no 
 liability recognition for certain employee termination benefits and other costs to exit an activity including certain costs incurred in a restructuring 
the principal difference between sfas no 
and eitf issue no 
relates to the recognition of a liability for a cost associated with an exit or disposal activity 
sfas no 
requires that a liability be recognized for those costs only when the liability is incurred  that is  when it meets the definition of a liability in the fasb s conceptual framework 
in contrast  under eitf issue no 
 a company recognized a liability for an exit cost when it committed to an exit plan 
sfas no 
also establishes fair value as the objective for initial measurement of liabilities related to exit or disposal activities 
sfas no 
is effective for exit or disposal activities that are initiated after december  although earlier application is encouraged 
the company is required and plans to adopt the provisions of sfas no 
for the quarter ending january  management does not believe that the adoption of this statement will have a material impact on its financial position or results of operations 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk the company s long term debt consists of notes payable with a total balance of  at october  see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
the debt bears interest at variable and fixed rates ranging from to  which approximates fair value based on current rates offered for debt with similar risks and maturities on october  the company also had  outstanding on its revolving line of credit with interest charged at the bank s reference prime rate minus one half of one percentage point 
the loan agreement also provides for optional interest rates based on ibor for periods of at least days in increments of  a hypothetical increase in interest rates during the year ended october  would have resulted in a  decrease in net income 
foreign currency exchange rate risk the company s ability to sell its products in foreign markets and the us dollar value of the sales made in foreign currencies can be significantly influenced by foreign currency fluctuations 
a decrease in the value of foreign currencies relative to the us dollar could result in downward price pressure for the company s products or losses from currency exchange rates 
although the company and its subsidiaries did not do so during fiscal  from time to time the company enters into short term foreign exchange contracts with its bank to hedge against the impact of currency fluctuations between the us dollar and the british pound 
the contracts provide that  on specified dates  the company would sell the bank a specified number of british pounds in exchange for a specified number of us dollars 
additionally  the company s subsidiary in england from time to time enters into similar contracts with its bank to hedge against currency fluctuations between the british pound and other european currencies 
realized gains and losses on these contracts are 
table of contents recognized in the same period as the hedged transaction 
these contracts have maturity dates that do not normally exceed months 
the company will continue to assess the benefits and risks of strategies to manage the risks presented by currency exchange rate fluctuations 
there is no assurance that any strategy will be successful in avoiding losses due to exchange rate fluctuations  or that the failure to manage currency risks effectively would not have a material adverse effect on the company s results of operations 
as of october   the company had no outstanding foreign currency forward exchange contracts
