critical accounting policies critical accounting policies are defined as those that are reflective of significant judgments and uncertainties  and potentially result in materially different results under different assumptions and conditions 
for a discussion on the application of these and other accounting policies  see note in the notes to the consolidated financial statements included in item of this form k 

table of contents revenue recognition the company s revenue consists primarily of fees for product sales  professional services  hosting and customer support 
the company generally recognizes product revenues when a non cancelable license agreement has been signed  the product has been shipped  the fees are fixed or determinable  collectibility is probable and vendor specific objective evidence vsoe of fair value exists to allocate the total fee to the multiple elements of an arrangement 
fees are generally considered fixed or determinable upon receipt of a signed license agreement and completion of negotiations 
management strives to achieve net payment terms depending on market and customer specific conditions 
if payment terms on license fees extend beyond twelve months  revenue is recognized as payments are received 
the amount of product revenue is determined based on the residual amount of the multiple element contract value that is not assigned to other elements based on vsoe of those elements 
if an acceptance period is required  the company generally recognizes revenue upon customer acceptance or the expiration of the acceptance period 
the company recognizes support revenues  which consist of fees for ongoing support and product updates  ratably over the term of the contract support period  typically one year 
the amount of support revenue invoiced but not yet recognized is recorded as unearned revenue in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets 
professional service revenues are primarily related to implementation  integration and training services performed on a time and materials basis or a fixed fee arrangement under separate service arrangements 
revenues from professional services are recognized as the services are performed 
revenue from hosted software service arrangements is recognized ratably over the term of the hosting arrangement 
the company s standard agreements do not contain product return rights 
the company provides a standard warranty of days from the date of sale 
the company continually evaluates its obligations with respect to warranties  returns and refunds 
based on historical trends and management s evaluation of current conditions  any potential obligations that are inherent in the accounts receivable balance are adequately provided for through the allowance for doubtful accounts 
the company may  in certain circumstances  grant discounts for product sales 
the discounts are recognized as a reduction of product revenue 
income taxes the company accounts for income taxes under the asset and liability method in accordance with financial accounting standard  accounting for income taxes 
the company recognizes deferred income taxes  net of valuation allowances  for the estimated future tax effects of temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their tax bases and net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date 
changes in deferred tax assets and liabilities are recorded in the provision for income taxes 
as of december  and  the company had approximately million and million  respectively  in deferred tax assets  net of valuation allowances 
the company evaluates the realizability of its deferred tax assets on a regular basis for each taxable jurisdiction 
in making this assessment  management considers whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of its deferred tax assets will not be realized 
the ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which those temporary differences become deductible 
management considers all available evidence  both positive and negative in making this assessment 
positive evidence supporting the realizability of the company s deferred taxes assets include the company s strong earnings history for twelve of the thirteen years prior to operating losses realized in and  the ability to carryback losses to prior years  positive operating results in  projections of future taxable income in and beyond  the existence of significantly appreciated net assets and the availability of prudent and feasible tax planning strategies to accelerate taxable amounts 
the company s pre tax operating losses in and represent negative evidence with respect to the realizability of the company s deferred taxes assets 
however  such losses included infrequent litigation settlements  nontaxable goodwill amortization and impairment charges  and losses related to the company s investment in the internet e commerce market which are not expected to continue 
in order to fully realize the deferred tax assets  the company will need to generate future taxable income of approximately  in the united states 
the company s net operating loss carryforwards generally expire in and the tax credit carryforwards may generally be carried forward indefinitely 
based upon the level of historical taxable income and projections for future taxable income over the periods in which the deferred tax assets 
table of contents are deductible  management believes it is more likely than not that the company will realize the benefits of these deductible differences  net of the existing valuation allowances at december  in the future  if the company determines that it expects to realize deferred tax assets in excess of the recorded net amounts  a reduction in the deferred tax asset valuation allowance would decrease income tax expense in the period such determination is made 
alternatively  if the company determines that it no longer expects to realize a portion of its net deferred tax assets  an increase in the deferred tax asset valuation allowance would increase income tax expense in the period such determination is made 
allowance for doubtful accounts receivable the company maintains allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of its customers to make required payments 
in determining the allowance for doubtful accounts  the company reviews the rolling twelve month average of account write offs  customer specific account risks  accounts receivable aging  and geographic specific factors that may impact international accounts 
these factors combine to establish the allowance for doubtful accounts balance 
if the financial condition of the company s customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
the above is not intended to be a comprehensive list of all of our accounting policies 
in many cases  the accounting treatment of a particular transaction is specifically dictated by accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america  with no need for management s judgment in their application 
there are also areas in which management s judgment in selecting any available alternative would not produce a materially different result

sfas no 
also requires that intangible assets with estimable useful lives be amortized over their respective estimated useful lives to their estimated residual values  and reviewed for impairment in accordance with sfas the company adopted the provisions of sfas as of july   and sfas as of january  the adoption of sfas and did not have a material impact on the company s consolidated financial statements 
in august   the fasb issued sfas  accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets sfas

risk factors from time to time  we make oral and written statements that may constitute forward looking statements rather than historical facts as defined in the private securities litigation reform act of or by the sec in its rules  regulations and releases  including section a of the securities act of  as amended the securities act and section e of the exchange act 
we desire to take advantage of the safe harbor provisions in the private securities litigation reform act of for forward looking statements made from time to time  including  but not limited to  the forward looking statements made in this annual report on form k the annual report  as well as those made in other filings with the sec 
the following is a summary of certain risks and uncertainties identified by us in the conduct of our business and is not meant to be exhaustive 
these risk factors should also be read in conjunction with other cautionary statements that we make in this annual report as well as other risks and uncertainties identified from time to time in our other sec reports  registrations statements and public announcements 
see also safe harbor statement under the private securities litigation reform act of at the beginning of this annual report 
our market continues to be highly competitive 
our market continues to be highly competitive 
we expect competition to intensify as new companies enter the market and existing ones expand their product lines 
certain competitors  including erp companies  have greater financial  marketing  technical  service and support resources than we do 
in addition  many prospective customers have already made significant commitments to erp competitors  which could materially and adversely affect our ability to succeed in our market 
further  slowing us and world economies could result in a decrease in spending by corporations on information technology and software 
this could lead to even greater competition in our markets 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to successfully compete against current and future competitors  especially if customers or prospective customers decrease their level of spending on asset management products in a slowing economy 
if we fail to compete successfully  our results of operations would be materially and adversely affected 
if we do not keep pace with rapid technological changes and demands in our markets  we will not remain competitive 
our business is characterized by rapidly changing technology  evolving industry standards  changes in customer requirements and frequent new product introductions 
our future success depends greatly on our ability to enhance certain of our existing products 
our success also depends on our ability to develop and introduce  on a timely and cost effective basis  new products and product features to meet our customers changing needs  particularly involving internet based applications 
industry requirements for product development in our market are still evolving 
our ability to successfully and efficiently develop products that meet these evolving requirements will require high levels of innovation  as well as an accurate anticipation of technological and market trends 
in addition  certain competitors may be able to devote greater financial  marketing  technical and other resources to identify and meet the evolving industry requirements 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to successfully identify  develop  and market new products or product enhancements that comply with evolving industry requirements or achieve market acceptance 
if we do not successfully identify  develop  and market new products or product enhancements  it could have a material and adverse effect on our results of operations 
increasing sales cycles and other factors may result in volatility of our quarterly results 
traditionally  a significant portion of our revenues in any quarter had been the result of a large number of relatively small orders received during the period 
we expect the average size of our license sales transactions  however  to continue to increase in the coming years 
an increase in average deal size typically increases the length of an average sales cycle 
potential customers spend significant time and resources determining which software to purchase 
this requires us to spend substantial time  effort and money educating and convincing prospective customers to purchase our software 
a customer s decision to license our software generally involves evaluation by 
table of contents a number of the customer s personnel in various functional and geographic areas 
due to these and other factors  our sales cycle may be extended 
since the sales cycle can be unpredictable and can be affected by events beyond our control  we cannot always forecast the timing or amount of specific sales  and sales may vary from quarter to quarter 
further  the company typically realizes a significant portion of its revenue from sales of software licenses in the last month of a quarter  frequently even in the last days of a quarter 
failure to close a small number of large software license contracts may have a significant impact on revenues for any quarter and could  therefore  result in significant fluctuations in quarterly revenues and operating results 
in addition  the market for our asset management solutions has changed dramatically over the last several years  and we expect that it will continue that trend as technology advances continue 
as our average license sale size has grown  we have shifted the primary focus of our sales and marketing efforts upon the enterprise wide deployment of our datastream i solution 
we expect to experience a decline in the large number of relatively small orders that has been a staple of our marketing and sales efforts in the past 
we have restructured our sales and marketing organizations to facilitate this move to the higher end transactional model 
there can be no guarantee  however  that we will ultimately be successful in making this transition 
also  the overall demand for enterprise asset management software may grow more slowly than we anticipate or even decrease in upcoming quarters 
we have reported fluctuations in software license revenue in each of the last three years  as we make this transition to predominately higher end transactions 
this may be an indication of the extent of market penetration into the asset management software market  as well as a retrenchment in the way companies purchase enterprise software 
to the extent that a slow down in the market for enterprise asset management software develops  it could have a materially adverse affect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
other factors which could contribute to a fluctuation in our quarterly results include but are not limited to the following changes in demand for our products and services and market acceptance of new products  competitive conditions in the industry  changes in pricing policies of the company or its competitors  changes in customer budgets  the introduction of new products or product enhancements by us and our competitors  changes in our sales and marketing organization  product life cycles and rotations  technological changes in computer systems and environments  variability in new licenses obtained  loss of customers  changes in the proportion of revenues attributable to licensing fees versus services  changes in the level of operating expenses  delay or deferral of customer implementations of their software  deferral of certain product and or service revenue to subsequent reporting periods to comply with contract accounting requirements  foreign currency exchange rates  and other economic conditions generally or in our particular industry 
due to these factors  our operating results could fail to meet the expectations of securities analysts or investors 
if that happens  the price of our common stock could decline materially 
our solutions typically require longer implementations and other professional services engagements 
the initial implementation of our solutions generally involves an extensive period of delivery of professional services  including the configuration of the solutions  together with customer training and consultation 
in addition  existing customers for other professional services projects often retain us for those projects beyond an initial implementation 
a successful implementation or other professional services project requires a close working relationship between us  the customer and often third party consultants and systems integrators who assist in the process 
these factors may increase the costs associated with completion of any given sale  increase the risks of collection of amounts due during implementations or other professional services projects  and increase risks of delay of such projects 
delays in the completion of an implementation or with any other professional services project may require that the revenues associated with such implementation or project be recognized over a longer period than 
table of contents originally anticipated  or may result in disputes with customers regarding performance as originally anticipated 
such delays in the implementation may cause material fluctuations in our operating results 
in addition  customers may typically defer implementation projects or portions of such projects at any time without penalty  and such deferrals could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations 
our hosting services strategy may reduce profits 
we cannot assure you that our hosting service customers whether of the traditional up front license model or a subscription model will remain customers over a sustained period of time 
a successful hosting service offering must be accessible to customers continually  without disruptions 
we cannot provide assurances that the technical infrastructure employed by hosting service customers or prospective hosting service customers is sufficiently robust to prevent disruptions in internet services beyond our control or that of our third party hosting provider 
further  we cannot assure you that the infrastructure of the internet  or the complementary services necessary to provide these continual and expanding services will be adequate to meet our needs in providing our hosting service on a competitive basis 
such connectivity and related issues could adversely affect the growth and customer acceptance of our hosting service business model 
in addition  while our traditional business model charges an up front license fee for access to our software applications  one of the offerings available through our hosting service business model charges a significantly lower monthly fee for rights to the same application for a defined term 
certain customers may choose a monthly revenue model as opposed to an up front license fee 
as a result  this subscription model  if widely adopted by our customers  could significantly lower revenue and profits in the near term 
our iprocure product strategy may not generate revenue and profits 
our iprocure product enables our customers to direct mro procurement to a select group of mro suppliers via the internet 
the market for products comparable to iprocure is competitive and there can be no assurances that we will successfully generate sufficient license and service revenue from this initiative 
also  we charge mro suppliers a transaction fee for each transaction executed through the iprocure network 
there can be no assurances that this transaction fee model will be profitable or sustainable in the long term 
the market for internet based mro procurement has experienced considerable change over the past several years and the customer demand for solutions in this area has been significantly reduced 
as we continue to market and sell the iprocure initiative  particularly internationally  we may be required to augment our technical infrastructure to meet the requirements of customers for mro procurement solutions 
if we are not successful in any of these areas  it could have a material adverse affect on our results of operations 
significant delays in product development would harm our reputation as an innovator and result in a decrease in our revenues 
if we experience significant product development delays  our position in the market would be harmed  and our revenues could be substantially reduced  which would adversely affect our operating results 
historically  we have issued significant new releases of our software products periodically  with minor interim releases issued more frequently 
as a result of the complexities inherent in our software  major new product enhancements and new products often require long development and test periods before they are released 
on occasion  we have experienced delays in the scheduled release date of new or enhanced products  and we cannot assure you that these delays will not occur in the future 
delays may occur for many reasons  including an inability to hire a sufficient number of developers  discovery of bugs and errors  or a failure of our current or future products to conform to industry requirements 
any such delay  or the failure of new products or enhancements in achieving market acceptance  could materially impact our business and reputation and result in a decrease in our revenues 
our success is substantially dependent on third party relationships 
a principal element of our strategy is to establish and maintain alliances with other companies  such as system integrators  resellers  consultants  and spare parts suppliers 
these relationships enhance our status in the marketplace  which generates new business opportunities and marketing channels and  in certain cases  additional revenue and profitability 
our inability to establish and maintain alliances with other companies could impact our success in the marketplace  which could materially and adversely impact our results of operations 
in addition  as we cannot control the actions of these third party alliances  if these companies suffer business downturns or fail to meet their objectives  we may experience a resulting diminished revenue and decline in results of operations 

table of contents during  we entered into an arrangement with ge fanuc  an affiliate of ge industrial systems  for ge fanuc to offer our datastream i and iprocure products as the exclusive asset management component of its collaborative manufacturing solutions around the world 
because the agreement grants ge fanuc exclusive rights to market and sell our solutions to certain global industry segments  we will experience a reduction in revenue in those segments if ge fanuc is not effective in its marketing and selling efforts 
we have also entered into a strategic agreement with ibm corporation under which we have undertaken to integrate our products and solutions and to market the ibm versions of our products in preference to other versions 
our license revenue may be affected by the success and acceptance of the ibm websphere and db products relative to those of ibm s competitors 
we may experience difficulties in gaining market acceptance of the ibm version of our solutions  and difficulties in integrating and coordinating our products and sales efforts with those of ibm 
in addition  customers or prospects that have not adopted the ibm technology platform may view our alliance with ibm negatively  and competitive alliances may emerge among other companies that are more attractive to our customers and prospective customers 
the success of our iprocure solution is substantially dependent upon our strategic relationships with certain spare parts suppliers and service providers who pay a transaction fee for orders placed through the iprocure network 
we have more than strategic supplier agreements  none of which represent significant revenues 
our third party suppliers and service providers may not view their relationships with us as significant to their own business  and they may reassess their commitment to  or decide to compete directly with us for our customers procurement in the future 
therefore  we cannot assure you that any of these relationships will be successful in the long term 
we also cannot assure you that we will be able to establish new agreements  that these agreements can be renewed on commercially acceptable terms or that any relationships  if established  will be commercially successful 
our hosting service business model depends heavily on hosting services provided by a third party 
to be successful  the hosted application must be accessible to customers continually  without any disruptions 
if our third party service provider fails to provide consistent access of the application to our customers  it would have a material adverse effect on our business 
we cannot assure you that there will not be disruptions in internet services beyond our control or that of our third party hosting provider 
further  we cannot assure you that the infrastructure of the internet  or the complementary services necessary to provide these continual and expanding services will be adequate to meet our needs in providing our hosting service on a competitive basis 
as we expand our hosting service and iprocure offerings internationally  we may need to augment our existing technical infrastructure on a global or regional basis  to provide the complete array of services and availability that hosting customers require 
our future success is substantially dependent on third party technologies 
we rely heavily on third parties that supply us with certain technologies that are crucial to our success 
in particular  our line of internet based applications is highly dependent on oracle technology  including oracle database technology and development tools 
if such technology does not achieve continued market acceptance or if oracle were to develop application software that successfully competed with our application software  it could have a material adverse effect on the acceptance of the company s products  and thus our results of operations 
we also expect to increasingly depend on third party technology that facilitates the integration of our products with other systems of our clients 
this integration is crucial to our solution 
we cannot assure you that third parties will continue to develop new versions of products that successfully facilitate this integration 
we also cannot assure you that that the third party technology licenses we depend upon or suitable alternatives will continue to be available to us on commercially reasonable terms  if at all 
as we continue to introduce new products that incorporate new technologies  we may license additional technology from additional third parties 
any failure to obtain any of these technology upgrades or licenses could result in delays or reductions in the introduction of new products  features or functions  which could materially and adversely impact our results of operations 
our business could be substantially harmed if we have to correct or delay the release of products due to software bugs or errors 
our software products may contain undetected errors or bugs when first introduced or as new versions are released 
our software products may also contain undetected viruses 
further  software we license from third parties and incorporate into our products may contain errors  bugs or viruses 
errors  bugs or viruses may cause a loss of or delay in market acceptance  recalls of hardware products incorporating the software or loss of data 
any such defects and errors could result in any of the following 
table of contents adverse customer reactions  negative publicity regarding our business and our products  harm to our reputation  loss of or delay in market acceptance  loss of revenue or required product changes  diversion of development resources and increased development expenses  increased service and warranty costs  legal action by our customers  and increased insurance costs 
if we fail to manage our international operations  our business could be adversely affected 
we generate our international sales through our international sales subsidiaries  as well as through a variety of indirect sales and marketing channel alliances 
our business  and our ability to maintain and expand our operations internationally  is subject to the risks inherent in international business activities  including  in particular difficulty in staffing and managing an organization spread over various countries  greater difficulty in safeguarding our intellectual property  acceptance of localized versions or our products  cultural differences in the conduct of business  maintaining uniform administrative controls in each country in accounting for customer contractual commitments  general economic and political conditions in each country  fluctuating economic and political conditions affecting geographic regions  foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations  increased trade restrictions  changes in tariff rates  longer accounts receivable payment cycles in certain countries  product compliance with local language and business customs  unexpected changes in regulatory requirements  and compliance with a variety of foreign laws and regulations 
any of the foregoing factors could have a material adverse effect on our ability to expand internationally  which could materially and adversely affect our results of operations 
in the past  we acquired several international businesses 
our inability to successfully grow these international acquisitions has previously resulted in goodwill impairment  which has had a significant adverse affect on the results of operations 
in addition  as a result of these acquisitions  we are more deeply involved with international markets that are less familiar 
we cannot assure you that we will successfully compete in these international markets 
we anticipate that our future results of operations may be subject to quarterly variations as a result  in part  of the seasonal revenue fluctuations in europe  asia and latin america  principally consisting of slower business conditions in the first and third quarters of the year 
further  we conduct virtually all of our business in us dollars  european euros  japanese yen  united kingdom pound sterling  singapore and australian dollars  argentinean  chilean and mexican pesos  brazilian real  and chinese renminbi 
changes in the value of these currencies relative to the dollar could negatively impact our financial condition 
we do not engage in hedging transactions  and an unfavorable foreign exchange rate at the time of conversion to us dollars could adversely affect the net fair value of the foreign denominated cash upon conversion 
deterioration of economic and political conditions could adversely affect operations 
over the past several quarters  the united states and regional economies around the world have experienced recession or similar economic conditions 
the continuing downturn in economic conditions has led to a reduced demand for a variety of goods and services  including software and other technology products 
while we have been relatively successful in selling in this economic climate over the past year  if conditions decline or fail to improve  
table of contents we could experience a decrease in the overall demand for our software and services that could harm our operating results 
in addition  as we have operational presence in the united states  as well as throughout europe  latin america  and the pacific rim  we are subject to the economic and political uncertainties that may be associated with the threat of terrorism or military action taken by the united states or its allies in response to that threat 
these risks include the possibility that our customers may cancel  defer or limit purchases as a result of such threat or the response to it  and the possibility that air travel delays or cancellations and restrictions imposed by companies could adversely affect our licensing efforts or our services revenue  as they result in our inability to visit customer sites or customers inability to visit our offices 
in the current uncertain economic and political environment  our revenue and our license revenue in particular  is difficult to forecast and will likely be less predictable from quarter to quarter 
if we have a shortfall in revenue in any given quarter  we probably will not be able to reduce our operating expenses quickly in response 
thus  any significant shortfall in revenue could have an immediate adverse effect on our operating results for that quarter 
our product strategy depends on the continued acceptance of the internet for business transactions 
as we continue to develop and market internet based products  our success will increasingly depend on the continued use and development of the internet as a tool for the transaction of business 
we cannot assure you that the infrastructure or complementary services necessary to maintain the internet will sufficiently address the requirements of our products or the demands of our marketplace 
if the internet fails as a medium for business transactions  it would have a material adverse affect on our results of operations 
we must recruit and retain key employees in order to be successful 
our continued success depends on the services of several of our key executive  sales and marketing and technical employees 
the loss of the services of these personnel  particularly those of larry g 
blackwell  our founder  chairman  chief executive officer and president  or our inability to attract and retain other qualified management  sales and marketing and technical employees  could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations 
we do not maintain any key man life insurance policy with respect to mr 
blackwell 
our success also depends in part on our ability to attract  hire  train  retain and motivate qualified personnel  with appropriate levels of managerial and technical capabilities 
our business generally requires a significant level of expertise to effectively develop and market our products and services 
we have at times experienced  and continue to experience  difficulty in recruiting qualified personnel 
we believe that the pool of potential applicants with such requisite expertise is limited 
recruiting qualified personnel is an intensely competitive and time consuming process 
such competition has resulted in demands for increased compensation from qualified applicants 
due to such competition  we have experienced  and expect to continue to experience  turnover in personnel 
we cannot assure you that we will be successful in attracting and retaining the personnel required to conduct and expand our operations successfully 
our business  financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected if we were unable to attract  hire  train  retain and motivate qualified personnel 
if we fail to adequately protect our proprietary rights  it could harm our competitive position and decrease our revenues 
our success and ability to compete is dependent in part on our proprietary technology 
we rely on a combination of trade secret  copyright and trademark laws  software licenses  nondisclosure agreements and technical measures to establish and protect our proprietary technology 
we generally enter into confidentiality and or license agreements with our key employees  consultants  distributors and strategic affiliates as well as with our customers and potential customers seeking proprietary information 
we also limit access to and distribution of our software  documentation and other proprietary information 
we cannot assure you that the steps we have taken in this regard  however  will be adequate to deter misappropriation or independent third party development of our technology 
further  we cannot assure you that third parties will not assert infringement or misappropriation claims against us in the future with respect to our current or future products 
any claims or litigation  with or without merit  could be time consuming  result in costly litigation  diversion of management s attention and cause product shipment delays or require us to enter into royalty or licensing arrangements 
such royalty or licensing arrangements  if required  may not be available on terms acceptable to us  if at all  which could have a material adverse effect on our 
table of contents business  financial condition and results of operations 
adverse determinations in such claims or litigation also could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
litigation to defend and enforce our intellectual property rights could result in substantial costs and diversion of resources and could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations  regardless of the final outcome of such litigation 
we may be subject to additional risks as we enter into transactions in countries where intellectual property laws are not well developed or are poorly enforced 
legal protections of our rights may be ineffective in such countries  which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 
security risks and concerns may deter the use of the internet for our applications 
a significant barrier to communications is the secure transmission of confidential information over public networks 
advances in computer capabilities  new discoveries in the field of cryptography or other events or developments could result in compromises or breaches of our security systems or those of other web sites to protect proprietary information 
if any well publicized compromises of security were to occur  it could have the effect of substantially reducing the use of the internet for our market 
anyone who circumvents our security measures could misappropriate proprietary information or cause interruptions in our services or operations 
the internet is a public network  and data is sent over this network from many sources 
in the past  computer viruses  software programs that disable or impair computers  have been distributed and have rapidly spread over the internet 
computer viruses could be introduced into our systems or those of our customers or suppliers  which could disrupt iprocure or make it inaccessible to customers or suppliers 
we may be required to expend significant capital and other resources to protect against the threat of security breaches or to alleviate problems caused by breaches 
to the extent that our activities may involve the storage and transmission of proprietary information  such as credit card numbers  security breaches could expose us to a risk of loss or litigation and possible liability 
our security measures may be inadequate to prevent security breaches  and our business would be harmed if we do not prevent them 
our stock price has fluctuated substantially since our initial public offering and may continue to do so 
the market price of our common stock has fluctuated substantially since our initial public offering in april the common stock is quoted on the nasdaq national market  which has experienced and is likely to experience significant price and volume fluctuations  which could adversely affect the market price of the common stock without regard to our operating performance 
in addition  we believe that factors such as quarterly fluctuations in our financial results  the overall economy and the condition of the financial markets could cause the price of our common stock to fluctuate substantially 
our articles of incorporation and bylaws and delaware corporate law may inhibit a takeover  which may not be in the interests of stockholders 
there are several provisions in our articles of incorporation and bylaws and delaware corporate law that may inhibit a takeover  even when a takeover may be in the interests of our stockholders 
for example  our board of directors is empowered to issue preferred stock without shareholder action 
the existence of this blank check preferred stock could render more difficult or discourage an attempt to obtain control of the company by means of a tender offer  merger  proxy contest or otherwise 
our articles of incorporation also divide the board of directors into three classes  as nearly equal in size as possible  with staggered three year terms 
the classification of the board of directors could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire control of the company because only one third of the board is up for election each year 
we are also subject to provisions of the delaware general corporate law that relate to business combinations with interested shareholders  which can serve to inhibit a takeover 

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the principal market risk to which the company is exposed that may adversely impact results of operations and financial position is fluctuations in foreign exchange rates 
fluctuations in foreign exchange rates 
in  revenue generated outside the united states accounted for approximately of total revenue 
significant revenues ie  greater than of total revenues were derived in france and the netherlands  with the balance derived primarily from the nine remaining countries argentina  brazil  chile  china  germany  japan  mexico  singapore and the united kingdom in which the company maintains subsidiary or branch operations 
many of the company s foreign sales were denominated in the currencies of the local country 
as such  the company s reported profits and cash flows are exposed to changing exchange rates or weak economic conditions 
historically  exchange rate exposure has been minimal  however  management is evaluating alternatives to reduce the risk associated with fluctuations in the value of the us dollar in the foreign exchange markets 
the currencies in which the company generates foreign denominated sales are geographically widespread and individually represent relatively low dollar exposure 
local currency revenues generated by the company s foreign subsidiaries are used to pay local currency expenses 
at any point in time  the company s foreign operations hold financial assets and liabilities that are denominated in the local currency 
these financial assets and liabilities consist primarily of short term  third party and intercompany receivables and payables 
at december   cash denominated in foreign currencies was approximately million 
long term investments 
the company has an available for sale investment security in the preferred stock of a private company 
the company evaluates the market value of its investment on a periodic basis 
significant changes the market value could cause a decline in the fair value of the investment
