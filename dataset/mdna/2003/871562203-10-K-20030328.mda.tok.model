recent accounting pronouncements effective january   we adopted statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  as amended by sfas no 
 accounting for certain derivative instruments and hedging activities  which requires that we recognize all derivative instruments as assets or liabilities in our balance sheet and measure them at their fair value 
changes in the fair value of a derivative are recorded in income or directly to equity  depending on the instrument s designed use 
for derivative instruments that are designated and qualify as a cash flow hedge  the effective portion of the gain or loss on the derivative instrument is reported as a component of other comprehensive income and reclassified into income when the hedged transaction affects income  while the ineffective portion of the gain or loss on the derivative instrument is recognized currently in earnings 
for derivative instruments that are designated and qualify as a fair value hedge  the gain or loss on the derivative instrument as well as the offsetting loss or gain on the hedged item attributable to the hedged risk are recognized in current income during the period of the change in fair values 
the noncash transition adjustment related to the adoption of this statement has been reflected as a cumulative effect of change in accounting for derivatives of approximately  charged to net income and approximately  charged to accumulated other comprehensive income included in stockholders equity as of january  see note to the consolidated financial statements for discussion of our current derivative contracts and hedging activities 
in july  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued sfas no 
 business combinations  and sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
sas no 
requires all business combinations initiated after june   to be accounted for using the purchase method 
under sfas no 
 goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives are no longer amortized but are reviewed annually or more frequently if impairment indicators arise for impairment 
separable intangible assets that are not deemed to have indefinite lives will be amortized over their useful lives 
management of the company has completed the initial impairment test required by the provisions of sfas no 
as of january   and determined that there has not been an impairment of our goodwill 
beginning january   we will no longer amortize goodwill 
during  we recorded goodwill amortization of approximately million

covers all legally enforceable obligations associated with the retirement of tangible long lived assets and provides the accounting and reporting requirements for such obligations 
sfas no 
is effective for the company beginning january  the company s asset retirement obligations primarily consist of equipment dismantling and foundation removal at certain of its facilities and temporary storage facilities 
the estimated noncash transition adjustment of approximately  net of tax  related to the adoption of this statement will be reflected as cumulative effect of a change in accounting for asset retirement obligations in the statement of operations for the three months ended march  in august  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  which supersedes sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of 
sfas no 
establishes a single accounting method for long lived assets to be disposed of by sale  whether previously held and used or newly acquired  and extends the presentation of discontinued operations to include more disposal transactions 
sfas no 
also requires that an impairment loss be recognized for assets held for use when the carrying amount of an asset group is not recoverable 
the carrying amount of an asset group is not recoverable if it exceeds the sum of the undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the asset group  excluding interest charges 
estimates of future cash flows used to test the recoverability of a long lived asset group must incorporate the entity s own assumptions about its use of the asset group and must factor in all available evidence 
the company adopted sfas no 
during the first quarter of and there was no effect on the company s results of operations and financial position 
in april  the fasb issued sfas no 
 rescission of fasb statement nos

fin clarifies the requirements of sfas no 
 accounting for contingencies  relating to the guarantor s accounting for  and disclosure of  the issuance of certain types of guarantees 
the company has adopted the disclosure requirements of fin in the consolidated financial statements and will apply the initial recognition and measurement provisions of the standard prospectively in critical accounting estimates and assumptions in preparing financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states  management makes estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements  as well as the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
the following are our significant estimates and assumptions made in preparation of its financial statements allowance for doubtful accounts we estimate losses for uncollectible accounts based on the aging of the accounts receivable and the evaluation and the likelihood of success in collecting the receivable 
loss contracts we evaluate our revenue producing contracts to determine whether the projected revenues of such contracts exceed the direct cost to service such contracts 
these evaluations include estimates of the future revenues and expenses 
accruals for loss contracts are adjusted based on these evaluations 
property and equipment long lived assets management adopted sfas no 
during the first quarter property and equipment is reviewed for impairment pursuant to the provisions of sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
the carrying amount of an asset group is considered impaired if it exceeds the sum of our estimate of the undiscounted future cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the asset group  excluding interest charges 
the company has contracts for the design  permitting and construction of biosolids processing facilities 
if the permits and or other government approvals are not obtained  the company may not be reimbursed for its costs incurred 
the company has approximately  of design and permitting costs included in other long term assets at december  goodwill goodwill attributable to the company s reporting units are tested for impairment by comparing the fair value of each reporting unit with its carrying value 
significant estimates used in the determination of fair value include estimates of future cash flows  future growth rates  costs of capital and estimates of market multiples 
as required under current accounting standards  the company tests for impairment annually at year end unless factors become known that an impairment may have occurred prior to year end 
purchase accounting we estimate the fair value of assets  including property  machinery and equipment and its related useful lives and salvage values  and liabilities when allocating the purchase price of an acquisition 
income taxes we assume the deductibility of certain costs in our income tax filings and estimate the recovery of deferred income tax assets 
legal and contingency accruals we estimate and accrue the amount of probable exposure we may have with respect to litigation  claims and assessments 
fair value of financial instruments the carrying amounts of cash and cash equivalents  receivables  accounts payable and accrued liabilities approximate their fair values because of the short term nature of these instruments 
management believes the carrying amounts of the current and long term debt approximate their fair value based on interest rates for the same or similar debt offered to the company having the same or similar terms and maturities 
self insurance reserves through the use of actuarial calculations  we estimate the amounts required to settle insurance claims 
actual results could differ materially from the estimates and assumptions that we use in the preparation of our financial statements 
other we maintain two leases with an affiliate of one of our stockholders 
the first lease has an initial term through july   with an option to renew for an additional five year period 
rental payments made under this lease in totaled approximately  the second lease has an initial term through december  rental payments made under the second lease in totaled approximately  as of december   we had generated net operating loss nol carryforwards of approximately million available to reduce future income taxes 
these carryforwards begin to expire in a change in ownership  as defined by federal income tax regulations  could significantly limit our ability to utilize our carryforwards 
accordingly  our ability to utilize our nols to reduce future taxable income and tax liabilities may be limited 
additionally  because federal tax laws limit the time during which these carryforwards may be applied against future taxes  we may not be able to take full advantage of these attributes for federal income tax purposes 
as we have incurred losses in recent years and the utilization of these carryforwards could be limited as discussed above  a valuation allowance has been established to partially offset the deferred tax asset at december  and we estimate that our effective tax rate in will approximate percent of pre tax income 
substantially all of our tax provision over the next several years is expected to be deferred in nature due to significant tax deductions in excess of book deductions for goodwill and depreciation 
risks relating to forward looking statements we are including the following cautionary statements to secure the protection of the safe harbor provisions of the private securities litigation reform act of for all forward looking statements made by us in this annual report on form k 
forward looking statements include  without limitation  any statement that may predict  forecast  indicate  or imply future results  performance  or trends  and may contain the words believe  anticipate  expect  estimate  project  will be  will continue  will likely result  or words or phrases of similar meaning 
in addition  from time to time  we or our representatives may make forward looking statements of this nature in our annual report to shareholders  proxy statement  quarterly reports on form q  current reports on form k  press releases or in oral or written presentations to shareholders  securities analysts  members of the financial press or others 
all such forward looking statements  whether written or oral  and whether made by or on our behalf  are expressly qualified by these cautionary statements and any other cautionary statements which may accompany the forward looking statements 
in addition  the forward looking statements speak only of the company s views as of the date the statement was made  and we disclaim any obligation to update any forward looking statements to reflect events or circumstances after the date thereof 
forward looking statements involve risks and uncertainties which could cause actual results  performance or trends to differ materially from those expressed in the forward looking statements 
we believe that all forward looking statements made by us have a reasonable basis  but there can be no assurance that management s expectations  beliefs or projections as expressed in the forward looking statements will actually occur or prove to be correct 
factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those discussed in the forward looking statements include  but are not limited to  the factors discussed below 
federal wastewater treatment and biosolid regulations may restrict our operations or increase our costs of operations 
federal wastewater treatment and wastewater residuals laws and regulations impose substantial costs on us and affect our business in many ways 
if we are not able to comply with the governmental regulations and requirements that apply to our operations  we could be subject to fines and penalties  and we may be required to spend large amounts to bring operations into compliance or to temporarily or permanently stop operations that are not permitted under the law 
those costs or actions could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
federal environmental authorities regulate the activities of the municipal and industrial wastewater generators and enforce standards for the discharge from wastewater treatment plants effluent wastewater with permits issued under the authority of the clean water act  as amended 
the treatment of wastewater produces an effluent and wastewater solids 
the treatment of these solids produces biosolids 
the part regulations regulate the use and disposal of biosolids and wastewater residuals and establish use and disposal standards for biosolids and wastewater residuals that are applicable to publicly and privately owned wastewater treatment plants in the united states 
biosolids may be surface disposed in landfills  incinerated  or applied to land for beneficial use in accordance with the requirements established by the regulations 
to the extent demand for our wastewater residuals treatment methods is created by the need to comply with the environmental laws and regulations  any modification of the standards created by such laws and regulations  or in their enforcement  may reduce the demand for our wastewater residuals treatment methods 
changes in these laws or regulations and or changes in the enforcement of these laws or regulations may also adversely affect our operations by imposing additional regulatory compliance costs on us  and requiring the modification of and or adversely affecting the market for our wastewater residuals management services 
we are subject to extensive and increasingly strict federal  state and local environmental regulation and permitting 
our operations are subject to increasingly strict environmental laws and regulations  including laws and regulations governing the emission  discharge  disposal and transportation of certain substances and related odor 
wastewater treatment plants and other plants at which our biosolids management services may be implemented are usually required to have permits  registrations and or approvals from state and or local governments for the operation of such facilities 
some of our facilities require air  wastewater  storm water  composting  use or siting permits  registrations or approvals 
we may not be able to maintain or renew our current permits  registrations or licensing agreements or to obtain new permits  registrations or licensing agreements  including for the land application of biosolids when necessary 
the process of obtaining a required permit  registration or license agreement can be lengthy and expensive 
we may not be able to meet applicable regulatory or permit requirements  and therefore may be subject to related legal or judicial proceedings 
many states  municipalities and counties have regulations  guidelines or ordinances covering the land application of biosolids  many of which set either a maximum allowable concentration or maximum pollutant loading rate for at least one pollutant 
the part regulations also require certain monitoring to ensure that certain pollutants or pathogens are below thresholds 
the epa has considered increasing these thresholds or adding new thresholds for different substances  which could increase our compliance costs 
in addition  some states have established management practices for land application of biosolids 
some members of congress  some state or local authorities  and some private parties  have sought to prohibit or limit the land application  agricultural use  thermal processing or composting of biosolids 
in states where we currently conduct business  certain counties and municipalities have banned the land application of class b biosolids 
other states and local authorities are reviewing their current regulations relative to land application of biosolids 
there can be no assurances that prohibition or limitation efforts will not be successful and have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
in addition  many states enforce landfill restrictions for nonhazardous biosolids and some states have site restrictions or other management practices governing lands 
these regulations typically require a permit to use biosolid products including incineration ash as landfill daily cover material or for disposal in the landfill 
it is possible that landfill operators will not be able to obtain or maintain such required permits 
any of the permits  registrations or approvals noted above  or related applications may be subject to denial  revocation or modification  or challenge by a third party  under various circumstances 
in addition  if new environmental legislation or regulations are enacted or existing legislation or regulations are amended or are enforced differently  we may be required to obtain additional  or modify existing  operating permits  registrations or approvals 
maintaining  modifying or renewing our current permits  registrations or licensing agreements or obtaining new permits  registrations or licensing agreements after new environmental legislation or regulations are enacted or existing legislation or regulations are amended or enforced differently may be subject to public opposition or challenge 
much of this public opposition and challenge  as well as related complaints  relates to odor issues  even when we are in compliance with odor requirements and even though we have worked hard to minimize odor from our operations 
public misperceptions about our business and any related odor could influence the governmental process for issuing such permits  registrations and licensing agreements or for responding to any such public opposition or challenge 
community groups could pressure local municipalities or state governments to implement laws and regulations which could increase our costs of our operations 
our ability to grow may be limited by direct or indirect competition with other businesses that provide some or all of the same services that we provide 
we provide a variety of services relating to the transportation and treatment of wastewater residuals 
we are in direct and indirect competition with other businesses that provide some or all of the same services including small local companies  regional residuals management companies  and national and international water and wastewater operations privatization companies  technology suppliers  municipal solid waste companies  farming operations and  most significantly  municipalities and industries who choose not to outsource their residuals management needs 
some of these competitors are larger  more firmly established and have greater capital resources than we have 
we derive a substantial portion of our revenue from services provided under municipal contracts 
many of these will be subject to competitive bidding at some time in the future 
we also intend to bid on additional municipal contracts 
however  we may not be the successful bidder 
in addition  some of our contracts will expire in the near future and those contracts may be renewed on less attractive terms 
if we are not able to replace revenues from contracts lost through competitive bidding or from the renegotiation of existing contracts with other revenues within a reasonable time period  the lost revenue could have a material and adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
our customer contracts may be terminated prior to the expiration of their term 
a substantial portion of our revenue is derived from services provided under contracts and written agreements with our customers 
some of these contracts  especially those contracts with large municipalities including our largest contract and at least four of our other top ten customers  provide for termination of the contract by the customer after giving relative short notice in some cases as little as ten days 
in addition  some of these contracts contain liquidated damages clauses  which may or may not be enforceable in the event of early termination of the contracts 
if one or more of these contracts are terminated prior to the expiration of its term  and we are not able to replace revenues from the terminated contract or receive liquidated damages pursuant to the terms of the contract  the lost revenue could have a material and adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operation 
a significant amount of our business comes from a limited number of customers and our revenue and profits could decrease significantly if we lost one or more of them as customers 
our business depends on provision of our services to a limited number of customers 
one or more of these customers may stop buying services from us or may substantially reduce the amount of services we provide them 
any cancellation  deferral or significant reduction in the services we provide these principal customers or a significant number of smaller customers could seriously harm our business  financial condition and results of operations 
for the year ended december   our single largest customer accounted for percent of our revenues and our top ten customers accounted for approximately percent of our revenues 
we may not be able to obtain bonding required in connection with certain contracts on which we bid 
consistent with industry practice  we are required to post performance bonds in connection with certain contracts on which we bid 
in addition  we are often required to post both performance and payment bonds at the time of execution of contracts for commercial  federal  state and municipal projects 
the amount of bonding capacity offered by sureties is a function of the financial health of the entity requesting the bonding 
although we could issue letters of credit under our credit facility for bonding purposes  if we are unable to obtain bonding in sufficient amounts we may be ineligible to bid or negotiate on projects 
as of march   we had a bonding capacity of approximately million with approximately million utilized as of that date 
we always face the risk of liability and insufficient insurance 
we carry million of liability insurance including umbrella coverage  and under a separate policy  million of aggregate pollution and legal liability insurance million each loss subject to retroactive dates  which we consider sufficient to meet regulatory and customer requirements and to protect our employees  assets and operations 
it is possible that we will not be able to maintain such insurance coverage in the future 
further  we could face personal injury  third party or environmental claims or other damages resulting in substantial liability for which we are uninsured and which could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
our insurance programs utilize large deductible self insured retention plans offered by a commercial insurance company 
large deductible self insured retention plans allow us the benefits of cost effective risk financing while protecting us from catastrophic risk with specific stop loss insurance limiting the amount of self funded exposure for any one loss 
we are dependent on the availability and satisfactory performance of subcontractors for our design and build operations 
we participate in design and build construction operations usually as a general contractor 
virtually all design and construction work is performed by unaffiliated third party subcontractors 
as a consequence  we are dependent upon the continued availability of and satisfactory performance by these subcontractors for the design and construction of our facilities 
the insufficient availability of and unsatisfactory performance by these unaffiliated third party subcontractors could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
further  as the general contractor  we are legally responsible for the performance of our contracts and if such contracts are underperformed or nonperformed by our subcontractors  we could be financially responsible 
although our contracts with our subcontractors provide for indemnification if our subcontractors do not satisfactorily perform their contract  such indemnification may not cover our financial losses in attempting to fulfill the contractual obligations 
we are affected by unusually adverse weather and winter conditions 
our business is adversely affected by unusual weather conditions and unseasonably heavy rainfall  which can temporarily reduce the availability of land application sites in close proximity to our business upon which biosolids can be beneficially reused and applied to crop land 
in addition  our revenues and operational results are adversely affected during the winter months when the ground freezes thus limiting the level of land application that can be performed 
long periods of inclement weather could reduce our revenues and operational results causing a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition 
fluctuations in fuel costs could increase our operating expenses and negatively impact our net income 
the price and supply of fuel is unpredictable and fluctuates based on events outside our control  including geopolitical developments  supply and demand for oil and gas  actions by opec and other oil and gas producers  war and unrest in oil producing countries  regional production patterns and environmental concerns 
because fuel is needed to run the fleet of trucks that service our customers  our incinerators  our dryers and other facilities  price escalations or reductions in the supply of fuel could increase our operating expenses and have a negative impact on net income 
in the past  we have implemented a fuel surcharge to offset increased fuel costs 
however  we are not always able to pass through all or part of the increased fuel costs due to the terms of certain customers contracts and the inability to negotiate such pass through costs in a timely manner 
we are not able to guarantee that our estimated remaining contract value  which we call backlog  will result in actual revenues in any particular fiscal period 
any of the contracts included in our backlog  or estimated remaining contract value  presented herein may not result in actual revenues in any particular period or the actual revenues from such contracts may not equal our backlog 
in determining backlog  we calculate the expected payments remaining under the current terms of our contracts  assuming the renewal of contracts in accordance with their renewal provisions  no increase in the level of services during the remaining term  and estimated adjustments for changes in the consumer price index for contracts that contain price indexing 
however  it is possible that not all of our backlog will be recognized as revenue or earnings 
if we lose the pending lawsuits we are currently involved in  we could be liable for significant damages and legal expenses 
in the ordinary course of business  we may become involved in various legal and administrative proceedings  including some related to our permits  to land use or to environmental laws and regulations 
we are currently subject to several lawsuits relating to our business 
our defense to these claims or any other claims against us may not be successful 
if we lose these or future lawsuits  we may have to pay significant damages and legal expenses  and we could be subject to injunctions  court orders  loss of revenues and defaults under our credit and other agreements 
in addition  we may be subject to future lawsuits or legal proceedings 
these claims  even if they are without merit  could be expensive and time consuming to defend and if we were to lose any future cases we could be subject to injunctions and damages that could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we could face considerable business and financial risk in implementing our acquisition strategy 
as part of our growth strategy  we intend to consider acquiring complementary businesses 
although we regularly engage in discussions with respect to possible acquisitions  we do not currently have any understandings  commitments or agreements relating to any material acquisitions 
future acquisitions could result in potentially dilutive issuances of equity securities  the incurrence of debt and contingent liabilities  which could have a material adverse effect upon our business  financial condition and results of operations 
risks we could face with respect to acquisitions include difficulties in the integration of the operations  technologies  products and personnel of the acquired company  potential loss of employees  diversion of management s attention away from other business concerns  expenses of any undisclosed or potential legal liabilities of the acquired company  and risks of entering markets in which we have no or limited prior experience 
in addition  it is possible that we will not be successful in consummating future acquisitions on favorable terms or at all 
we are dependent on our chief executive officer for his depth of industry experience and knowledge 
we are highly dependent on the services of ross m 
patten  our ceo and chairman of the board 
mr 
patten has been in the industry for more than years and has substantial industry knowledge and contacts 
if mr 
patten were to terminate his employment with us  we would lose valuable human capital  adversely affecting our business 
we currently do not maintain key man insurance on mr 
patten or any other member of our senior management team 
neither mr 
patten nor any other member of our senior management team intends to retire or is nearing retirement age 
we generally enter into employment agreements with members of our senior management team  which contain noncompete and other provisions 
the laws of each state differ concerning the enforceability of noncompetition agreements 
state courts will examine all of the facts and circumstances at the time a party seeks to enforce a noncompete covenant 
we cannot predict with certainty whether or not a court will enforce a noncompete covenant in any given situation based on the facts and circumstances at that time 
if one of our key executive officers were to leave us and the courts refused to enforce the noncompete covenant  we might be subject to increased competition  which could have a material and adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
efforts by labor unions to organize our employees could divert management attention and increase our operating expenses 
in the past  labor unions have made attempts to organize our employees  and these efforts may continue in the future 
certain groups of our employees have chosen to be represented by unions  and we have negotiated collective bargaining agreements with some of the groups 
we cannot predict which  if any  groups of employees may seek union representation in the future or the outcome of collective bargaining 
the negotiation of these agreements could divert management attention and result in increased operating expenses and lower net income 
if we are unable to negotiate acceptable collective bargaining agreements  we might have to wait through cooling off periods  which are often followed by union initiated work stoppages  including strikes 
depending on the type and duration of such work stoppage  our operating expenses could increase significantly 
we may become subject to cercla 
cercla generally imposes strict joint and several liability for cleanup costs upon present owners and operators of facilities at which hazardous substances were disposed  past owners and operators at the time of disposal  generators of hazardous substances that were disposed at such facilities  and parties who arranged for the disposal of hazardous substances at such facilities 
the costs of a cercla cleanup can be very expensive 
given the difficulty of obtaining insurance for environmental impairment liability  such liability could have a material impact on our business and financial condition 
cercla section liability extends to cleanup costs necessitated by a release or threat of release of a hazardous substance 
the definition of release under cercla excludes the normal application of fertilizer 
the epa regards the land application of biosolids that meet the part regulations as a normal application of fertilizer  and thus not subject to cercla 
however  if we were to transport or handle biosolids that contain hazardous substances in violation of the part regulations we could be liable under cercla 
from time to time  we generate hazardous substances which we dispose at landfills or we transport soils or other materials which may contain hazardous substances to landfills 
we also send residuals and ash from our incinerators to landfills for use as daily cover over the landfill 
liability under cercla  or comparable state statutes  can be founded on the disposal  or arrangement for disposal  of hazardous substances at sites such as landfills and for the transporting of such substances to landfills 
under cercla  or comparable state statutes  we may be liable for the remediation of a disposal site that was never owned or operated by us if the site contains hazardous substances that we generated or transported to such site 
we could also be responsible for hazardous substances during actual transportation and may be liable for environmental response measures arising out of disposal at a third party site with whom we had contracted 
in addition  under cercla  or comparable state statutes  we could be required to clean any of our current or former properties if hazardous substances are released or are otherwise found to be present 
we are currently monitoring the remediation of soil and groundwater at one of our properties in cooperation with the applicable state regulatory authority  but do not believe any additional material expenditures will be required 
however  there can be no assurance that currently unknown contamination would not be found on this or other properties 
our intellectual property may be misappropriated or subject to claims of infringement 
we attempt to protect our intellectual property rights through a combination of patent  trademark  and trade secret laws  as well as licensing agreements 
our failure to obtain or maintain adequate protection of our intellectual property rights for any reason could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
our competitors  many of whom have substantially greater resources and have made substantial investments in competing technologies  may have applied for or obtained  or may in the future apply for and obtain  patents that will prevent  limit or otherwise interfere with our ability to offer our services 
we have not conducted an independent review of patents issued to third parties 
we also rely on unpatented proprietary technology 
it is possible that others will independently develop the same or similar technology or otherwise obtain access to our unpatented technology 
to protect our trade secrets and other proprietary information  we require employees  consultants  advisors and collaborators to enter into confidentiality agreements 
we cannot be assured that these agreements will provide meaningful protection for our trade secrets  know how or other proprietary information in the event of any unauthorized use  misappropriation or disclosure of such trade secrets  know how or other proprietary information 
if we are unable to maintain the proprietary nature of our technologies  we could be materially adversely affected 
if we determine that our goodwill is impaired  we may have to write off all or part of it 
goodwill represents the aggregate purchase price paid by us in acquisitions accounted for as a purchase over the fair value of the net assets acquired 
under statement of financial accounting standards  or sfas no 
 we no longer amortize goodwill  but review annually for impairment 
in the event that facts and circumstances indicate that goodwill may be impaired  an evaluation of recoverability would be performed 
if a write down to market value of all or part of our goodwill becomes necessary  our accounting results and net worth would be adversely affected 
as of december   our total goodwill  net of amortization  was  we may experience a decline in our recent revenue and income due to a shift in focus away from acquisition towards internal growth 
in  we shifted our focus away from acquisitions to internal growth 
as a result  we may experience a reduction in the rate of increase of our revenues 
you should not expect revenues to increase at the same rates as when we were focused on acquisitions 
see business acquisitions history 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we utilize financial instruments  which inherently have some degree of market risk due to interest rate fluctuations 
management is actively involved in monitoring exposure to market risk and continues to develop and utilize appropriate risk management techniques 
we are not exposed to any other significant market risks  including commodity price risk  foreign currency exchange risk or interest rate risks from the use of derivative financial instruments 
management does not currently use derivative financial instruments for trading or to speculate on changes in interest rates or commodity prices 
derivatives and hedging activities prior to june   the company s derivative contracts consisted of interest rate swap agreements and option agreements related to hedging requirements under the company s senior credit agreement 
the option agreements did not qualify for hedge accounting under sfas no 
changes in the fair value of these derivatives recognized in earnings in as interest expense totaled  the company s interest rate swap agreements qualified for hedge accounting as cash flow hedges of the company s exposure to changes in variable interest rates 
on june   the company entered into a reverse swap on its percent subordinated debt  and terminated the previously existing interest rate swap and option agreements noted above 
accordingly  the balance included in accumulated other comprehensive loss included in stockholders equity is being recognized in future periods income over the remaining term of the original swap agreement 
the amount of accumulated other comprehensive loss recognized as a noncash expense in and was approximately  and  respectively 
the company designated the reverse swap agreement on its subordinated debt as a fair value hedge of changes in the value of the underlying debt as a result of changes in the benchmark interest rate 
the liability related to the reverse swap agreement totaling approximately  is reflected in other long term liabilities at december   additionally  a fair value adjustment on the company s subordinated debt of approximately  is reflected in long term debt at december  the amount of the ineffectiveness of the reverse swap agreement debited to interest expense  net  for the twelve months ended december   totaled approximately  the percent subordinated debt was repaid on april   with the proceeds from the sale of the percent senior subordinated notes due accordingly  the company discontinued using hedge accounting for the reverse swap agreement on april  from april   through june   the fair value of this fixed to floating reverse swap decreased by million 
this million mark to market gain is included in other income in the company s financial statement 
on june   the company entered into a floating to fixed interest rate swap agreement that is expected to substantially offset market value changes in the company s reverse swap agreement 
the liability related to this reverse swap agreement and the floating to fixed offset agreement totaling approximately  is reflected in other long term liabilities at december  gains recognized during the year ended december   related to the floating to fixed interest rate swap agreement were approximately  while losses recognized related to the reverse swap agreement since june   were approximately  the amount of the ineffectiveness of the reverse swap agreement debited to other income is approximately  for the twelve months ended december  on july   the company entered into an interest rate cap agreement establishing a maximum fixed libor rate on  of its floating rate debt at an interest rate of percent in order to meet the hedging requirements of its senior credit agreement 
changes in the fair value of the agreement charged to interest expense  net  totaled  and  for the twelve months ended december  and  respectively 
interest rate risk total debt at december   included approximately  in floating rate debt attributed to the senior credit agreement at a base interest rate plus percent  or approximately percent at december  as a result  the company s interest cost in will fluctuate based on short term interest rates 
the impact on annual cash flow of a ten percent change in the floating rate would be approximately
