business overview we develop and manufacture compound semiconductor materials and electronic devices made from silicon carbide sic and group iii nitrides gan 
we derive the largest portion of our revenue from the sale of blue  green and near ultraviolet uv light emitting diodes leds 
we currently offer leds at three brightness levels xbright blue products  mid brightness blue  green and uv products  which include megabright  ultrabright and superbright devices  and standard brightness blue products 
our led devices are used by manufacturers as a lighting source for mobile appliances  automotive dashboard lighting  indicator lamps  miniature white lights  indoor and outdoor full color displays and signs  traffic signals and other lighting applications 
led products represented of our revenue in fiscal and in fiscal we also derive revenue from the sale of semiconductor wafers made from sic that are used by our customers for manufacturing leds and power devices or for research and development 
sales of sic wafer products represented of our revenue in fiscal and of our revenue in fiscal we also sell sic materials in bulk crystal form for use in gemstones to charles colvard c c 
sales of sic crystals for gemstones represented of our revenue in fiscal and of our revenue in fiscal our other products include sic based power and radio frequency rf devices 
we received less than of total revenues from sales of power devices or sic based rf devices in fiscal and fiscal through our cree microwave segment  we also develop and manufacture rf power transistors and modules using silicon technologies 
during fiscal and fiscal  approximately and  respectively  of our revenue came from the sale of rf devices from our cree microwave segment 
these rf power transistors are a key semiconductor component for power amplifiers that are used in base stations for wireless networks 
the balance of our revenue  for fiscal and for fiscal is derived from contract research funding 
under various programs  us government entities assist us in the development of new technology by funding our research and development efforts 
contract revenue includes funding for direct research and development costs and a portion of our general and administrative expenses and other operating expenses for contracts under which we expect funding to exceed direct costs over the life of the contract 
for contracts under which we anticipate that direct costs will exceed amounts to be funded over the life of the contract  we report direct costs as research and development expenses with related reimbursements recorded as an offset to those expenses 

table of contents fiscal overview we reported record revenue in fiscal primarily due to customer demand for our led products for the mobile appliance and automotive markets 
our led revenue and units sold increased and  respectively  in fiscal over the previous fiscal year 
we saw the most significant increase in product sales in our mid brightness leds  which our customers estimate  were used mostly in the keypads of handheld mobile appliances as well as dashboards for automobiles 
we completed the introduction of our mid brightness megabright led product line during fiscal much of the increase in our led revenue was attributable to this product line  which offers higher brightness  as well a competitive pricing of our other mid brightness devices 
mid brightness products made up of our led revenue in fiscal we continue to work with our customers toward design wins using our xbright leds 
the xbright product family  which we initially introduced in fiscal  targets applications that include miniature white lights  traffic signals and video screens 
the xbright led technology incorporates a junction down design and utilizes the optical benefits of sic while maintaining the vertical structure advantages of a single top contact 
this design allows for a standard size chip similar to our other led devices  however  it does present significant packaging challenges for many of our traditional customers 
we are making progress working with our customers to address die attachment issues in the packaging process which they encountered using our xbright products 
as a result  xbright leds comprised of led revenue during fiscal year we are working to develop a lower temperature die attach compatible product to address some of our customers needs and we project that xbright products will be a greater percentage of our led revenue during fiscal shipments of our standard brightness devices remained stable in fiscal in comparison to fiscal and were supported by automotive and indicator light designs from a number of customers  including osram opto semiconductors gmbh osram 
for fiscal  standard brightness products were approximately of our led revenue 
during fiscal  sic materials revenue increased over the prior year due to a increase in the average sales price received for our wafers 
the higher average sales price resulted from increased sales to research and development customers  who generally purchase higher priced wafers than volume customers using our product for commercial applications 
revenue from sales of sic materials for use in gemstones was higher in fiscal as c c  our sole customer for such material  increased its demand  yet it still remained at of our overall revenue 
revenue from microwave products declined in fiscal over fiscal as we entered into an agreement in november terminating our supply agreement with spectrian 
prior to the termination of the supply agreement with spectrian  revenue from spectrian comprised of our revenue for the cree microwave segment 
in the second quarter of fiscal  we received a million one time payment from spectrian associated with the termination of the supply agreement between cree microwave and spectrian 
this one time payment was recorded as other operating income on the statement of operations 
government contract revenue increased in fiscal over the prior year as we received several new contract awards in in june  we were awarded two contracts by the office of naval research onr  with a total value of approximately million as part of the wide bandgap semiconductor technology initiative of the defense advanced research projects agency  or darpa 
the first contract provides for up to million in government funding over an month period for work directed to microwave and related technologies 
the second onr darpa contract provides for up to million in government funding over an month period for work directed toward sic high voltage  high power switching devices for high power conversion and distribution technology 
additionally  we were awarded with another contract in june funded by darpa  through the army research laboratory arl to pursue the development of uv leds and lasers for a variety of military communications and bio threat detection applications under darpa s suvos program 
this cost share contract provides for up to 
table of contents million in us government funding over a four year period 
in july  we were awarded government contracts totaling million  if fully funded  over a three year period from onr and the air force research laboratories afrl for sic microwave monolithic integrated circuit mmic process development 
these contracts are jointly funded by the us navy  the missile defense agency and the department of defense s title iii program 
in fiscal  we anticipate that one of our best growth opportunities will be for blue leds that our customers would convert to white leds for mobile appliance and other applications 
based on trends in the industry  we believe there will be an increase for using white leds as a backlight for the keypad and for full color screens in mobile phones and other handheld electronics 
we recently have introduced our megabright plus  xbright plus  and razerthin products to target these and other applications 
critical accounting policies the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
in preparing our financial statements  we must make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of our financial statements 
critical accounting policies include those policies that are reflective of significant judgments and uncertainties  which potentially could produce materially different results under different assumptions and conditions 
we believe that our critical accounting policies are limited to those described below 
valuation of long lived assets  intangible assets and goodwill 
we have approximately million of long lived assets as of june   including approximately million related to fixed assets and capitalized patents  million in long term investments held to maturity and million of other long term assets that includes net investments in privately held companies of million and deferred taxes of million 
in addition to the original cost of these assets  their recorded value is impacted by a number of management estimates that are determined based on our judgment  including estimated useful lives  salvage values and  in  impairment charges 
in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas  accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of  or sfas  we record impairment charges on long lived assets used in operations when events and circumstances indicate that the assets have been impaired 
in making these determinations  we utilize certain assumptions  including  but not limited to i estimations of the fair market value of the assets  and ii estimations of future cash flows expected to be generated by these assets  which are based on additional assumptions such as asset utilization  length of service the asset will be used in our operations and estimated salvage values 
we recorded a million impairment charge for long lived assets for the three months ending december   due to the election by management to discontinue a novel epitaxy reactor project 
during fiscal  we determined certain property and equipment was impaired under sfas  accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of  which was the relevant accounting pronouncement at the time  and as a result  we recorded impairment charges of million 
during the third quarter of fiscal  we completed an impairment analysis of the intangible assets and goodwill related to the acquisition of cree microwave 
this analysis was performed due to significant changes in business conditions at the operating segment 
first  cree microwave amended its supply agreement with spectrian effective march   which resulted in a significant reduction in quarterly revenue expectations 
in addition  cree microwave s outlook for acquiring additional customers in the near term weakened due to delays in the development of laterally diffused metal oxide semiconductor ldmos technology  the overall deteriorating economic conditions and long product qualification cycles 
also  the principal products that spectrian indicated it would consider purchasing from cree microwave in the future 
table of contents were not fully qualified and  subsequently not released to production at the time 
as a result of this impairment analysis  we estimated that the future cash flows of the cree microwave business would not be sufficient to provide for recovery of the carrying value of its intangible assets and goodwill 
therefore  the remaining balance of intangible assets and goodwill of million was deemed fully impaired and was written off in march in november  we entered into an agreement terminating our supply contract with spectrian  and  due to the changed circumstances  management performed an impairment analysis of the tangible assets at cree microwave as of december  and june  in accordance with sfas based on estimations of the fair market value of the assets  and estimations of future cash flows  we determined that the estimated undiscounted cash flow exceeded the amount of the book value of the long term tangible assets 
as a result  no additional cree microwave assets were determined to be impaired or written down at that time 
accounting for marketable and non marketable equity securities 
from time to time  we evaluate strategic opportunities and potential investments in complimentary businesses and as a result may invest in marketable equity securities 
at june   we held no marketable equity securities 
during the second quarter of fiscal  we sold our entire position in two publicly traded companies 
we sold  common shares in microvision  inc microvision for million  with a net loss on the sale of  recognized during the second quarter of fiscal we also sold  common shares in emcore corporation emcore for million  with a net loss on the sale of million recognized during the second quarter of fiscal we classify marketable securities that are not trading or held to maturity securities as available for sale 
we carry these investments at fair value  based on quoted market prices  and unrealized gains and losses  net of taxes  are included in accumulated other comprehensive income  which is reflected as a separate component of shareholders equity 
realized gains and losses are recognized when realized upon sale or disposition 
declines in value that are deemed to be other than temporary in accordance with sfas  accounting for certain debt and equity securities are also recorded in the income statement 
we have a policy in place to review our equity holdings on a periodic basis to evaluate whether or not each security has experienced an other than temporary decline in fair value 
our policy requires  among other things  a review of each company s cash position  earnings and revenue outlook  stock price performance  liquidity  ability to raise capital and management and ownership changes 
based on this review  if we believe that an other than temporary decline exists in the value of one of our marketable equity securities  it is our policy to write down these equity investments to the market value 
in addition  we record a write down for investments in publicly held companies for an other than temporary impairment any time the market price of the security has remained below the company s average cost for two consecutive fiscal quarters  unless strong positive evidence exists that makes it clear that an other than temporary write down would be inappropriate under the guidance of sfas the related write down will then be recorded as an investment loss on our consolidated statements of operations 
during fiscal  we recorded a recognized loss of million related to available for sale marketable securities as we sold our investments in microvision and emcore 
during fiscal  we recorded an other than temporary investment loss of million related to available for sale marketable securities based primarily on sustained reductions in stock price performance 
we also make strategic investments in equity securities of privately held companies from time to time 
since we do not have the ability to exercise significant influence over the operations of these companies  these investment balances are carried at cost and accounted for using the cost method of accounting 
the shares of stock we received in these investments are not presently publicly traded and there is no other established market value for these securities 
we have a policy in place to review the fair value of these investments on a regular basis to evaluate the carrying value of such investments 
this policy includes  but is not limited to  reviewing each of the companies cash position  financing needs  earnings and revenue outlook  operational performance  management or ownership changes  and competition 
the evaluation 
table of contents process is based on information that we are provided by these privately held companies 
since these companies are not subject to the same disclosure regulations as us public companies  the basis for these evaluations is subject to the timing and the accuracy of the data received from these companies 
if the carrying value of an investment is at an amount in excess of our estimate of fair value  and we have determined that the decline is other than temporary  it is our policy to record a write down of the investment 
this write down is estimated based on the information described above  and it is recorded as an investment loss on our consolidated statements of operations 
during fiscal  we recorded a write down on these investments of million  representing our estimate of other than temporary declines in value based on a review of those factors described above 
estimating the fair value of non marketable investments in early stage technology companies is inherently subjective and may contribute to significant volatility in our reported results of operations 
there were no adjustments made to investment losses on our consolidated statements of operations during fiscal relating to our investments in privately held companies 
inventories 
inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market  cost being determined using the first in  first out method for finished goods and work in process accounts and the average cost method is used for raw materials for the cree segment 
the cree microwave segment uses a standard cost method 
we evaluate our ending inventories for excess quantities  impairment of value and obsolescence 
this evaluation includes analysis of sales levels by product and projections of future demand based upon input received from our customers  sales team and management estimates 
we reserve for inventories on hand that are greater than twelve months old  unless there is an identified need for the inventory 
in addition  we write off inventories that are considered obsolete based upon changes in customer demand  manufacturing process changes that result in existing inventory obsolescence or new product introductions  which eliminates demand for existing products 
remaining inventory balances are adjusted to approximate the lower of our manufacturing cost or market value 
if future demand or market conditions are less favorable than our estimates  additional inventory write downs may be required and would increase cost of revenue in the period the revision is made 
we evaluate the adequacy of these reserves quarterly 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal  we reserved  related to sic wafer inventory that was slow moving as our customer demand for this type of product had slowed 
as a result of the termination of the supply agreement with spectrian in the second quarter of fiscal  we recorded a million reserve in the cree microwave segment for inventory that was slow moving or specifically identified to be sold to spectrian  including customized parts 
we also reserved an additional  of inventory at cree microwave during the first quarter of fiscal this inventory charge was taken because of change in demand from spectrian 
spectrian initially indicated that they would have strong demand for this type of transistor and later determined that the demand had significantly weakened 
during the three months ended december   we reserved  in the cree segment for slow moving led and wafer inventory 
in addition  during the first quarter of fiscal  we wrote down  of certain leds to an estimated market value calculation 
in the third quarter of fiscal  we recorded a million reserve at our cree microwave segment for non ldmos and older ldmos devices as a result of contract negotiations with spectrian that identified these devices as obsolete 
all of these adjustments were recorded through cost of revenue 
in addition  we also wrote off million of costs associated with initial xbright products and  of costs associated with ldmos devices as research and development expenses in the first quarter of fiscal the million write down was attributable to early generation xbright devices that were later determined to be non saleable because of design deficiencies 
the  write down was associated with ldmos products that were on hand and determined not to be saleable for similar reasons 
in both cases  our customers had initially accepted the devices and we produced initial amounts of the product 
based on history with our customers  normally once products are accepted  they are ultimately qualified 
thus we concluded that capitalizing the cost of these items  as inventory was appropriate 
however  in both cases  our customers later rejected the products 
therefore  we wrote off the entire amount of inventory as research and development expenses  because the materials were never qualified as completed devices or ultimately sold to customers 
in the case of the led devices  our customers returned all products shipped of that technology 

table of contents revenue recognition and accounts receivable 
revenue on product sales is recognized when persuasive evidence of a contract exists  such as when a purchase order or contract is received from the customer  the price is fixed  title of the goods has transferred and there is a reasonable assurance of collection of the sales proceeds 
we obtain written purchase authorizations from our customers for a specified amount of product at a specified price and consider delivery to have occurred at the time of shipment 
the majority of our products have shipping terms that are fob or fca shipping point  which means that we fulfill the obligation to deliver when the goods are handed over and into the charge of the carrier at our shipping dock 
this means that the buyer bears all costs and risks of loss of or damage to the goods from that point 
the difference between fob and fca is that under fca terms  the customer designates a shipping carrier of choice to be used 
in certain cases  we ship our product cost insurance freight cif 
under this arrangement  revenue is recognized under fob shipping point shipping terms  however  we are responsible for the cost of insurance to transport the product as well as the cost to ship the product 
for all of our sales other than those with cif terms  we invoice our customers only for shipping costs necessary to physically move the product from our place of business to the customer s location 
the costs primarily consist of overnight shipping charges 
we incur the direct shipping costs on behalf of the customer and invoice the customer to obtain direct reimbursement for such costs 
we account for our shipping costs as a part of cost of revenue and record the reimbursement of such costs by our customer as a direct offset and reduction to cost of revenue 
beginning in fiscal year  we will record the amount of freight that is invoiced to our customers as revenue  with the corresponding cost recorded as cost of revenue 
we estimate that this change will amount in an insignificant contribution to revenues 
if inventory is maintained at a consigned location  revenue is recognized when our customer pulls product for its use 
we provide our customers with limited rights of return for non conforming shipments and warranty claims for up to months for cree microwave products 
revenue is recognized from our customers at shipment 
for certain customers we defer revenue for certain sales costs incurred in selling our products and for managing our inventory  up to the balance of the deferred revenue 
this deferred revenue amounted to million and  as of june  and june   respectively 
please see discussion in item of this report under distributorship agreement with sumitomo corporation  for further information 
significant judgments and estimates made by management are used in connection with establishing the allowance for sales returns 
material differences may result in the amount and timing of our revenue for any period if management made different judgments or utilized different estimates 
the allowance for sales returns at june  was  revenue from government contracts is recorded on the percentage of completion method as contract expenses are incurred 
contract revenue represents reimbursement by various us government entities to aid in the development of new technology 
the applicable contracts generally provide that we may elect to retain ownership of inventions made in performing the work  subject to a non exclusive license retained by the government to practice the inventions for government purposes 
the contract funding may be based on either a cost plus or a cost share arrangement 
the amount of funding under each contract is determined based on cost estimates that include direct costs  plus an allocation for research and development  general and administrative and the cost of capital expenses 
cost plus funding is determined based on actual costs plus a set percentage margin 
for the cost share contracts  the actual costs relating to the activities to be performed by us under the contract are divided between the us government and us based on the terms of the contract 
the government s cost share is then paid to us 
activities performed under these arrangements include research regarding sic and group iii nitride materials and devices 
the contracts typically require the submission of a written report that documents the results of such research  as well as some material deliverables 
the revenue and expense classification for contract activities is based on the nature of the contract 
for contracts where we anticipate that funding will exceed direct costs over the life of the contract  funding is reported as contract revenue and all direct costs are reported as costs of contract revenue 
for contracts under 
table of contents which we anticipate that direct costs of the activities subject to the contract will exceed amounts to be funded over the life of the contract  costs are reported as research and development expenses and related funding is reported as an offset of those expenses 
accruals for liabilities and warranties 
at times  we must make estimates for the amount of costs that have been incurred but not yet billed for general services  including legal and accounting fees  costs pertaining to our self funded medical insurance  warranty costs and other expenses 
many of these expenses are estimated based on historical experience or information gained directly from the service providers 
valuation of deferred tax assets 
as of june   we had million recorded as a deferred tax asset 
this asset was recorded as a result of tax benefits associated with the million of significant charges taken in fiscal these charges were recorded for the write off of property and equipment  the impairment of goodwill and intangible assets at cree microwave and other charges resulting from the downturn in cree microwave s business and the other than temporary charges taken on our investments 
the above listing is not intended to be a comprehensive list of all of our accounting policies 
in many cases  the accounting treatment of a particular transaction is specifically dictated by generally accepted accounting principles  with no need for management s judgment in its application 
there are also areas in which management s judgment in selecting any available alternative would not produce a materially different result 
see our audited consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included in this annual report on form k which contain a discussion of our accounting policies and other disclosures required by accounting principles generally accepted in the united states

revenue increased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal higher revenue was primarily attributable to greater product revenue  which increased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal much of the increase in revenue resulted from significantly higher unit shipments of our led products due to stronger demand from our customers primarily for mobile appliance and automotive applications 
led revenue was million and million  for fiscal and  respectively 
the most significant increase in revenue in fiscal came from sales to our japanese distributor  sumitomo 
revenue from sales to sumitomo increased by or million in fiscal as compared to fiscal due to strong demand among japanese manufacturers for our products for mobile appliance  automotive  consumer products and indicator light applications 
revenue from sales to osram and agilent also increased by and  respectively  or million and million  respectively  in fiscal over the prior year comparative period 
much of this increased business was 
table of contents caused by demand for our products used in mobile appliances as well as automotive and other applications 
during fiscal  we also noted an increase in business from several smaller asian led packagers as our customer base became more diversified 
the only significant decline in revenue came from spectrian  which was acquired by remec in december  where revenue from sales declined or million in fiscal as compared to fiscal spectrian or remec purchases silicon rf transistors from our cree microwave segment 
the distributorship agreement with sumitomo requires us to establish reserves at the time we ship led products to sumitomo based upon a percentage of the total purchase price of such products 
revenue is recognized from our customers at shipment 
for certain customers we defer revenue for certain sales costs incurred in selling our products and for managing our inventory  up to the balance of the deferred revenue 
this deferred revenue amounted to million and  as of june  and june   respectively 
our led revenue increased in fiscal as compared to fiscal and made up of our total revenue in fiscal our average led sales price declined for the twelve months ended june compared to the prior year 
this decrease was in line with our strategy to lower prices to our customers to expand applications using nitride leds 
our average sales price for leds also was lower due to increasing price competitiveness in the marketplace and a change in the product mix of our sales to customers 
for fiscal  our led chip volume increased over prior year shipments 
the most significant increase to revenue occurred in our mid brightness range of led products including our high brightness  ultrabright and megabright products 
our lower range mid brightness led products have been incorporated into new designs in the keypads of several mobile phone models that feature a blue color as well as blue leds that are used as the backlight for blue displays 
in addition  these led chips are now used in other products targeting gaming equipment  consumer products and office automation applications 
the introduction of the megabright blue  green and uv products in fiscal also has generated new design wins for our customers 
the megabright chip is approximately two times brighter than our previous generation devices and is similar to the brightness that is currently offered by our primary competitors 
these megabright products have replaced some existing demand for our previous generation high brightness devices 
however  due to the megabright product line s higher performance  it has also generated new opportunities in other markets  particularly mobile appliance applications for blue and white led backlight designs 
blue and white leds have replaced a portion of the yellow green leds that have traditionally backlit mobile handsets as more handsets now offer blue backlit keypads and full color displays backlit by white leds 
the megabright product line also is being used in new automotive designs from both european and asian manufacturers for the model year 
during fiscal  we introduced our xbright family of leds  including blue  green and uv devices 
these products offer a higher brightness than our megabright products 
we completed the introduction of these devices in the second half of fiscal  however  we continue to work with customers to optimize our chip design for use in their packages 
while our xbright products did not contribute significantly to our revenue in fiscal  we project that they will be more significant to our revenue in fiscal for high brightness applications such as mobile appliances  display signs  traffic signals and lighting applications 
shipments of our standard brightness products were flat in fiscal in comparison to the prior year due to stable demand for automotive and indicator light applications 
sic wafer revenue was million and million  for fiscal and  respectively 
wafer revenue increased over the prior year due to greater sales to the corporate and university research customers 
wafer units declined while the average sales price increased during fiscal  due to a lower mix of shipments to osram  which uses wafers in commercial production 
since osram uses the wafers in commercial high volume production  they receive volume discounts on their purchases  therefore  these sales have a lower average sales price 
we also sold more wafers with epitaxial layers during fiscal  which contributed to a higher average sales price 
wafer revenue made up of our total revenue in fiscal 
table of contents sic material revenue from material sold for gemstone use was million and million  for fiscal and  respectively 
revenue from sales of our sic materials for use in gemstones increased during fiscal as compared to fiscal as c c increased their orders to us 
revenue from gemstone materials was of our total sales for fiscal during the fourth quarter of fiscal  we experienced lower yields of useable materials in our production of gemstone material 
revenue from microwave products was million and million  for fiscal and  respectively 
microwave revenue made up of our total revenue for fiscal revenue from these products decreased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal the decrease in revenue resulted from the termination of the supply agreement with spectrian in november approximately of cree microwave revenues were derived from shipments to spectrian in fiscal prior to the termination of the supply agreement  spectrian had reduced its purchase obligations beginning in march because our ldmos products had not been qualified 
we amended our agreement with spectrian in march  which resulted in spectrian ordering fewer products each quarter until the agreement was terminated in november we also had little success in gaining new customers in fiscal due to the poor economic environment for wireless infrastructure spending 
our ldmos products were released to production in november but these products have not yet contributed significantly to revenue 
design cycles can be to months for wireless infrastructure applications 
product sales mix for our cree microwave products remained constant as ldmos made up and of microwave revenue for fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
revenue attributable to bipolar devices was and for fiscal and  respectively 
approximately of cree microwave s revenue was from engineering services for fiscal as we continued to work with new customers toward design wins 
overall  our average sales price for cree microwave was fairly stable compared to the prior fiscal year 
the most significant factor impacting revenue for our cree microwave segment was the decline in units sold as a result of the termination of the spectrian supply agreement and the overall slowdown in spectrian s business prior to the termination of the supply agreement 
for fiscal  we target higher revenue for cree microwave 
however  if we are unable to secure new design wins for cree microwave  revenue from this segment may decline and the valuation of our assets may be impaired 
contract revenue was of total revenue for fiscal contract revenue received from us government agencies increased during fiscal compared to fiscal  due to additional contract awards that we received in in june  we were awarded two contracts by onr  with a total value of approximately million as part of the wide bandgap semiconductor technology initiative of darpa 
in july  the company was awarded government contracts totaling million  if fully funded  over a three year period from onr and the afrl 
in fiscal  we recognized approximately million in revenue from these contracts 
additionally  we were awarded with another contract in june funded by darpa  through the united states army robert morris acquisition center  to pursue the development of uv leds and lasers for a variety of military communications and bio threat detection applications under darpa s suvos program 
in fiscal  this darpa suvos contract from arl accounted for approximately million in total revenue 
we target that contract revenue will remain essentially the same during fiscal  as we expect to continue to recognize revenue under the majority of these contracts throughout fiscal gross profit 
gross profit increased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal compared to the prior year  gross margins increased from to of revenue 
in fiscal  gross profit included a million write down of inventory at cree microwave due to the termination of the supply agreement with spectrian 
in fiscal  gross profit included a million charge relating to an inventory write off and other related costs that were recorded as a part of the downsizing of cree microwave s operations 
in fiscal  gross margins were impacted by higher led margins being offset by negative margins from the cree microwave segment 
led margins improved as our average sales price decreased by while the average cost of our leds decreased by due to higher throughput in the 
table of contents factory and improved yields 
because a significant portion of our factory cost is fixed  higher throughput typically results in lower costs per unit produced 
in addition  during fiscal  our led costs per unit also were higher than during fiscal due to inefficiencies typically associated with new product introductions as we released both the megabright and xbright family of products during the year 
negative gross profits were million for our cree microwave business during fiscal as compared to gross profits of million recorded during fiscal  despite the million write off of inventory discussed above 
low factory throughput due to significantly reduced sales volume has dramatically impacted our cost per unit 
wafer costs for our sic materials sales were higher in fiscal than  due to the shift in product mix of wafers sold with epitaxy as compared to production volume wafers sold to osram 
contract margins declined from in fiscal to in fiscal due to a higher percentage of cost share contracts being worked on during the year 
research and development 
research and development expenses increased in fiscal to million from million in fiscal the increase in research and development spending supported our xbright  megabright plus  xbright plus  and razerthin product lines  and our power chip leds as well as higher brightness led research programs 
in addition  we funded development of our ldmos  sic and group iii nitride microwave devices  our schottky diode power program and our near uv lasers 
while research and development spending increased  customer support of certain research and development programs decreased by million  thereby further increasing costs 
from time to time  our customers and companies that we invest in participate in research and development funding for specific programs 
we record this third party funding as an offset against research and development expenses 
customers and third parties in which we invested funded  and million in fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
the majority of this funding was received from companies in which we have made investments 
for example  in fiscal  the entire customer funding we received came from an affiliate of lighthouse  in which we hold a private company equity investment 
in fiscal  microvision  the lighthouse affiliate  and xemod funded million  million and  respectively  of our research and development 
we held an investment in each of these companies at the time that they provided research and development funding to us 
in addition  spectrian  our largest customer for our cree microwave segment  also participated in funding our research and development programs for million 
when customers participate in funding our research and development programs  we record the amount funded as a reduction of research and development expenses 
we do not expect funding for research and development during fiscal at this time from these or any other customers or third parties in which we invested 
sales  general and administrative 
sales  general and administrative expenses increased in fiscal to million from million in fiscal the increase in expenses was due mostly to higher premiums for insurance and greater spending to support the growth of the business  including increased performance based compensation plans for all employees 
intangible asset amortization 
intangible asset amortization decreased to during fiscal from million during fiscal nine months of intangible asset amortization was included in fiscal resulting from the acquisition of cree microwave in december in march an analysis of goodwill and other intangible assets indicated that the carrying values of such assets had been fully impaired under statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of sfas see impairment of goodwill and loss on disposal of fixed assets 
therefore  we wrote off the entire amount of goodwill and other intangible assets in march prior to the write off of goodwill and intangible assets  we were amortizing these assets over periods ranging from five to ten years 
impairment of goodwill and loss on disposal of fixed assets 
impairment of goodwill decreased to during fiscal from million during fiscal in march  we determined that 
table of contents impairment existed and wrote off the entire balance of goodwill and other intangible assets 
an analysis was performed at that date and indicated that the carrying values of such assets had been fully impaired under sfas the analysis was performed as several impairment indicators had occurred during the march quarter as discussed below 
one of the significant impairment indicators related to a change in outlook for business at cree microwave related to the supply agreement between cree microwave and spectrian 
under the original terms of the agreement  if cree microwave were unable to supply components deemed competitive with components available from third party suppliers within a certain period  spectrian s quarterly minimum purchase commitment would be reduced each quarter by the dollar volume of the component that spectrian purchased from other vendors 
cree microwave and spectrian agreed to enter into the first amendment to the supply agreement in october because cree microwave was delayed in fully qualifying and completing development of its new ldmos technology 
technology similar to ldmos was made available to spectrian from a competitor in early as a result  the company agreed to reduce spectrian s commitments for the december quarter 
in addition  we amended the supply agreement to provide that if competitive components meeting the applicable requirements were not available from cree microwave on or after april   spectrian s quarterly minimum purchase commitment thereafter would be reduced by any purchases of such products from other vendors 
by march  cree microwave had not yet completed development and qualification testing of any of the components using its ldmos based transistors and thus had not released the components to production 
cree microwave then executed a second agreement of the supply agreement with spectrian in march and agreed to reduced minimum quarterly purchase commitments from spectrian in return for additional time in which to complete development and qualification testing of the ldmos components 
in addition  many of the products that spectrian indicated that it would purchase in the future had not yet been released to production 
under the amended supply agreement with spectrian  if cree microwave was not able to produce ldmos devices in a timely manner  revenue from spectrian would be significantly reduced after the june quarter 
in addition  the outlook for acquiring additional customers decreased due to the overall weakened economy and the length of qualification cycles 
due to the change in outlook for business at cree microwave and the reduction in expected revenue per quarter  we performed an asset impairment analysis under sfas as a result of this analysis  the full amount of goodwill and intangible assets of million was written off and recorded as impairment of goodwill under operating expenses on our consolidated statements of operations 
please refer to the business combinations footnote summary of significant accounting policies and other matters in the consolidated financial statement included in item of this report for further information about the valuation of cree microwave 
loss on the disposal of fixed assets decreased to million in fiscal from million recorded in fiscal during fiscal  we recorded a million write down for fixed assets associated with a novel epitaxy equipment project that we discontinued before the equipment was delivered to us by the vendor 
the amount represented a deposit that we paid for the equipment 
we also disposed of  of other assets during the year 
during fiscal  we took a million charge to write down fixed assets due to decisions made based on changes in technology 
this impairment reflected management s decision to focus our technology in certain directions based on feedback from our research and development teams 
after extensively testing certain reactor technology equipment  we narrowed a preference for certain processes  and as a result  we wrote off non producing reactor equipment that did not use the preferred processes 
also  in december  management prepared for a wafer transition over the next several years 
as a result  during that period we wrote off non convertible crystal growth equipment that was not expected to be used 
finally  yield improvements in our existing facility also resulted in the obsolescence of certain other equipment 
all equipment written off in the second quarter of fiscal was dismantled and destroyed  if proprietary in nature  or sold by june severance charges and other operating expense 
severance charges decreased by to  in fiscal from  in fiscal in the first quarter of fiscal  we incurred  of severance charges at our cree microwave segment 
in the third quarter of fiscal  we recorded an 
table of contents  severance charge also associated with cree microwave 
in both periods we recorded the severance charge in the same period that the employees were laid off and received their severance payments 
other operating expense decreased to in fiscal from  in fiscal this reduction was primarily caused by a  one time retention bonus paid to cree microwave employees pursuant to a contractual commitment made as a part of the acquisition of cree microwave from spectrian in the second quarter of fiscal other operating income gain on termination of supply agreement 
gain on the termination of supply agreement increased to million in fiscal from in fiscal in the second quarter of fiscal  we received a million one time payment from spectrian associated with the termination of the supply agreement between cree microwave and spectrian 
loss on investments in marketable securities and loss on long term investments 
loss on investments in marketable securities declined to million in fiscal from million recorded in fiscal the million recorded in fiscal related to marketable securities that we sold during the second quarter of fiscal the million loss recorded in fiscal related to an entry to reclassify other comprehensive losses from equity to loss on investments in marketable securities in our consolidated statements of operations 
in addition  we also recorded additional write downs for other than temporary declines in the market value of these investments of these companies as well as the overall stock market declines 
this charge was partially offset by a gain on the sale of marketable trading securities of  loss on long term investments declined to in fiscal from million recorded in fiscal in fiscal  we recorded write downs for some investments we had made in privately held companies as many of the companies were experiencing deteriorating financial conditions and or an inability to raise additional capital  which represented significant indicators of value impairment 
in the second quarter of fiscal  we recorded a write down of million in privately held investments 
the majority of the write down was taken on our investment in xemod based on data regarding the company s valuation 
we recorded an million write down on the investment to bring the market capitalization estimate for the entire company to million 
in  a third party purchased xemod for approximately million 
we also took an additional million write down on our investment in lighthouse based on data regarding the company s valuation 
a million write down was also taken on our investment in world theatre based on data regarding the company s valuation 
world theatre also attempted to raise capital during the december quarter and only raised one half of the amount expected in a convertible debt round 
in the fourth quarter of  we wrote down an additional million related to our privately held investments 
our investment in emf limited emf was fully written down by million based on data regarding the company s valuation 
we further wrote down our lighthouse investment by million  based on data regarding the company s valuation 
during the fourth quarter of  we also fully wrote down our investment in world theatre based on data regarding the company s valuation 
the amount of the additional write down was million 
world theatre has recently filed for bankruptcy protection 
a million charge was also taken to fully write down our investment in kyma technologies inc kyma based on data regarding the company s valuation 
other non operating income 
other non operating income increased to  in fiscal from in fiscal in the fourth quarter of fiscal  we received a contractually agreed upon payment from one of our customers  representing a settlement for a foreign currency translation adjustment included in our sales contract 
interest income  net 
interest income  net decreased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal the reduction from the comparative period in the prior year resulted primarily from lower interest rates available for our liquid cash over the period 

table of contents income tax expense benefit 
income tax expense for fiscal was million compared to a million tax benefit recorded in fiscal the income tax benefit resulted from the million net pre tax loss resulting mainly from the charges taken during the period 
these charges included write downs for the impairment of fixed assets of million  a million charge to reserve for the decline in value of investments in privately held companies  a million write down for other than temporary declines in the fair market value of our marketable securities  a million write down of goodwill and other intangibles and a million reserve taken for inventory and other items 
our effective income tax rate was for fiscal compared to a rate during the comparative period in fiscal due to greater tax benefits in fiscal associated with the losses reported in that year 
at june   we also maintained million in deferred tax assets that we did not reserve for as we target profitable operations over the next several periods and target being able to use the assets in their entirety 
the minimum amount of future taxable income that will be required to realize existing deferred tax assets is approximately million  applicable within the next years to offset existing net operating losses 
the new tax act  the job creation and workers assistance act of  is expected to allow us to recover past alternative minimum tax that had been previously paid 
this amount has been recorded as a tax receivable 
the new legislation also allows us more favorable depreciation 
historically  our reported taxable income has been significantly lower than income reported for financial reporting purposes 
the primary reasons for this difference are the timing differences for depreciation  stock option deductions for tax purposes  other tax planning strategies and impairment charges expensed for financial accounting purposes that are not tax deductible 
comparison of fiscal years ended june  and june  revenue 
revenue declined to million in fiscal from million in fiscal this decrease was attributable to lower product revenue  which declined to million in fiscal from million in fiscal this decrease included results of our mid year fiscal acquisition of the ultrarf business from spectrian  which subsequently reduced the overall decrease by approximately 
the decline in revenue from our traditional business was mainly attributable to lower average selling prices for our led and sic wafer products 
led revenue was million and million for fiscal and  respectively 
led revenue made up of total revenue in fiscal average led sales prices declined for the twelve months ended june compared to the prior year 
this decrease was related to increased price competition in the marketplace due to weaknesses in the worldwide economy 
the overall demand for nitride leds declined during our fiscal for fiscal  our led chip volume increased over prior year shipments 
the introduction of the megabright uv  blue  and green products in fiscal generated new design wins for our customers 
the megabright product line was not fully introduced until february  when our green devices in this line were released 
during fiscal  we also introduced our new xbright family of leds 
we completed the introduction of these devices in the second half of fiscal these devices did not contribute significantly to revenue in fiscal  as we continued to work with customers to optimize our chip design in packaged solutions and to address die attach issues 
shipments of our standard brightness products were flat in fiscal  in comparison to the prior year  due to stable demand for automotive and indicator light applications 
sic wafer revenue was million and million  respectively for fiscal and wafer revenue was of total revenue for fiscal overall  for fiscal  sic wafer sales decreased from the prior year due to lower pricing for wafers sold to corporate and research communities  including certain customers using our wafers for commercial production 
wafer units increased  while average sales prices declined due to a higher mix of volume sales related to wafers used in commercial production by osram and infineon 

table of contents revenue for sic materials sold for gemstone applications was million and million for fiscal and  respectively 
revenue for sic materials for use in gemstones was of total revenue for fiscal sales of gemstone materials declined during fiscal as compared to fiscal due to declining orders from c c 
microwave revenue was million and million in fiscal and  respectively 
microwave revenue was of total revenue in fiscal revenue from cree microwave increased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal the increase in revenue represented an additional six months of sales for the segment due to our mid year acquisition of cree microwave from spectrian in fiscal our average quarterly revenue in fiscal was lower than fiscal due to the current market environment for wireless infrastructure spending 
product mix shifted to ldmos during fiscal  which comprised of microwave revenue  an increase of from fiscal revenue attributable to bipolar devices was and related to other products during fiscal approximately of cree microwave revenues were derived from shipments to spectrian in fiscal as well as fiscal overall  our average sales prices for this business segment were fairly stable  with quarterly average volume being reduced in fiscal as compared to fiscal contract revenue was of total revenue in fiscal contract revenue received from us government agencies and non governmental customers increased during fiscal compared to fiscal  due to additional contract awards received 
in june  we were awarded two contracts by onr  with a total value of approximately million as part of the wide bandgap semiconductor technology initiative of darpa 
additionally  we were awarded with another contract in june funded by darpa  through arl  to pursue the development of uv leds and lasers for a variety of military communications and bio threat detection applications under darpa s suvos program 
gross profit 
gross profit decreased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal compared to the prior year  gross margins declined from to of total revenue 
in fiscal  gross profit included a million charge relating to an inventory write off and other related costs that were recorded as a part of the downsizing of cree microwave s operations 
lower margins were attributed to a combination of lower revenue and reduced profitability for led and wafer products and lower profitability at cree microwave related to weak demand for rf devices 
led margins declined due to average sales prices decreasing at a faster rate than average costs 
during fiscal  led average sales prices declined  which was in line with our plans  while costs were only lower 
led costs did not decline as quickly as revenue due to reduced worldwide demand for blue  green and uv led products  this put pressure on average sales prices and lowered our factory throughput 
because a significant portion of our factory cost is fixed  lower throughput typically results in higher costs per unit produced 
in addition  our led costs per unit were higher due to inefficiencies typically associated with new product introductions as we released both the megabright and xbright family of products during the year 
in the fourth quarter of fiscal  we had product returns and inventory write downs that resulted in a  reduction in gross profit 
this reduction was related to packaging issues identified by some customers after the release of the xbright family of products 
despite the lower throughput of volume and new product inefficiencies  we were still able to reduce led costs by due to improved yield  cost cutting measures and other efficiencies 
gross margin at cree microwave was during fiscal and was impacted by the million write off of inventory discussed above which decreased said margin by approximately 
low factory throughput due to reduced sales volumes and the qualification of ldmos significantly impacted our cost per unit during fiscal research and development 
research and development expenses increased in fiscal to million from million in fiscal the increase in research and development spending supported our megabright and xbright product lines  our power chip led devices as well as new higher brightness led research programs 
in addition  we funded development of our next generation ldmos  sic and gan microwave devices  our schottky diode power program and our near uv lasers 
while research and 
table of contents development spending increased  customer support of certain programs decreased by million  thereby further increasing costs 
from time to time  our customers and companies that we invest in participate in research and development funding for specific programs 
we record this funding from third parties as an offset against research and development expenses 
customers and third parties in which we invested funded million and million in fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
the majority of this funding was received from companies that we had made investments in 
finally  the mid year acquisition of cree microwave during fiscal  which added approximately to research and development expenses  also contributed to the higher spending variance 
in fiscal  microvision  a lighthouse affiliate and xemod funded million  million and  respectively  of our research and development programs 
we held an investment in each of these companies at the time that they provided research and development funding to us 
in addition  spectrian  which was the largest customer for our cree microwave segment  also funded our research and development programs for million 
in fiscal  microvision  a lighthouse affiliate and xemod funded million  million and million  respectively  of our research and development 
we held an investment in each of these companies at the time 
in addition  spectrian funded million and c c funded  of our research and development programs 
when customers or third parties in which we invested fund our research and development  we record the amount funded as a reduction of research and development expenses 
sales  general and administrative 
sales  general and administrative expenses increased in fiscal to million from million in fiscal the increase in expenses was attributed mostly to costs associated with intellectual property litigation subsequently resolved in fiscal the mid year acquisition of cree microwave during fiscal added approximately to sales and general and administrative expenses  which also contributed to the higher spending variance 
in addition  costs were higher due to higher premiums for insurance and greater spending to support the growth of the business 
intangible asset amortization and in process research and development costs 
intangible asset amortization increased to million during fiscal from million during fiscal nine months of intangible asset amortization was included in fiscal and six months of amortization was included in fiscal resulting from the acquisition of cree microwave in december an analysis of goodwill and other intangible assets indicated that the carrying values of such assets had been fully impaired under sfas see impairment of goodwill and loss on disposal of fixed assets 
therefore  we wrote off the entire balance of goodwill and other intangible assets in march prior to the write off of goodwill and intangible assets  we were amortizing these assets over periods ranging from five to ten years 
as a result of the acquisition of cree microwave in december  we recorded a charge of million in the third quarter of fiscal associated with acquired in process research and development costs ipr d 
management is primarily responsible for the valuation of ipr d 
the ipr d projects ongoing at the acquisition date were ldmos non module technologies which were estimated to be complete at the acquisition date and ldmos module technologies then estimated to be complete at the acquisition date 
at the acquisition date  we estimated that both of these technologies would be completed with in six months 
the ldmos non module technology was abandoned in march the ldmos module device r d was completed successfully in calendar the projections for revenue and costs for the ldmos non module technology as of the acquisition date december  differed from actual results as the project was never completed and was abandoned in march the projections as of the acquisition date for revenue and cost for the ldmos module device also differed from actual results because even though the technology was completed in  the devices are being customized for specific customers and have not generated significant revenue to date 
the abandonment of the ldmos non module technology and our failure to obtain significant design wins for the ldmos module technologies to date has impacted our expected return on investment and our future results of operations and financial position 
as a result  we wrote off all of the intangible assets for cree microwave in march impairment of goodwill and loss on disposal of fixed assets 
impairment of goodwill increased to million during fiscal from during fiscal in march  we wrote off the entire balance 
table of contents of goodwill and other intangible assets 
an analysis was performed at that date and indicated that the carrying values of such assets had been fully impaired under sfas the analysis was performed as several impairment indicators had occurred during the quarter 
one of the significant impairment indicators related to a change in outlook for business at cree microwave related to the supply agreement between cree microwave and spectrian 
cree microwave amended its supply agreement with spectrian in the third quarter of fiscal  which reduced quarterly revenue expectations 
also  many of the products that spectrian indicated that it would purchase in the future had not yet been released to production 
under the amended supply agreement with spectrian  if cree microwave were not able to produce ldmos devices in a timely manner  revenue from spectrian would be significantly reduced after the june quarter 
in addition  the outlook for acquiring additional customers decreased due to the weakened economy and the long qualification cycles 
due to the change in outlook for business at cree microwave and the reduction in expected revenue per quarter  we performed an asset impairment analysis under sfas as a result of this analysis  the full amount of goodwill and intangible assets of million was written off and recorded as impairment of goodwill under operating expenses on our consolidated statements of operations 
please refer to the business combinations footnote summary of significant accounting policies and other matters in the consolidated financial statement included in item of this report for further information about the valuation of cree microwave 
loss on the disposal of fixed assets increased to million in fiscal from  recorded in fiscal during the fiscal  we took a million charge to write down fixed assets 
this impairment reflected management s decision to focus our technology in certain directions based on feedback from our research and development teams 
after extensively testing certain reactor technology equipment  we redefined our preference for certain processes  and as a result  we wrote off non producing reactor equipment that did not use the preferred processes 
also  in december  management prepared for a wafer transition over the next several years 
as a result  we wrote off non convertible crystal growth equipment that was not used 
finally  yield improvements also resulted in the obsolescence of certain other equipment that could not meet our yield expectations 
all equipment written off in the second quarter of fiscal was dismantled and destroyed  if proprietary in nature  or sold by june severance charges and other operating expense 
severance charges increased to  in fiscal from in fiscal in the third quarter of fiscal  we recorded an  severance charge associated with employment reduction at cree microwave 
we recorded the severance charge in the same period that the employees were laid off and received their severance payment 
other operating expense increased to  in fiscal from in fiscal this increase was primarily caused by a  one time retention bonus paid to cree microwave employees pursuant to a commitment made as a part of the acquisition of cree microwave from spectrian in the second quarter of fiscal loss gain on investments in marketable securities and loss on long term investments 
in fiscal  we recorded a million loss on investments in marketable securities compared to a million gain recorded in fiscal the million loss recorded in fiscal related to an entry to reclassify other comprehensive losses from equity to loss on investments in marketable securities in our consolidated statements of operations related to write downs for the other than temporary declines in the market value of investments in microvision and emcore 
this charge was partially offset by a gain on the sale of marketable trading securities of  in fiscal  we recognized a million realized gain on the sale of marketable trading securities 
see note  to the consolidated financial statements 
loss on long term investments increased to million in fiscal from million recorded in fiscal in fiscal  we reserved for some investments we had made in privately held companies as many of the companies were experiencing deteriorating financial conditions and or an inability to raise additional capital  which represented significant indicators of value impairment 
in the second quarter 
table of contents of fiscal  we reserved million in privately held investments 
the majority of the reserve was taken on our investment in xemod  based on data regarding the company s valuation and in the company had difficulty raising capital 
we recorded an million write down on the investment to bring the market capitalization estimate to million 
in  a third party purchased xemod for approximately million 
we also took an additional million write down on our investment in lighthouse based on data regarding the company s valuation 
a million write down was taken on our investment in world theatre based on data regarding the company s valuation 
world theatre also attempted to raise capital during the december quarter and only raised one half of the amount expected in a convertible debt round 
in the june quarter  we wrote down an additional million related to our privately held investments 
our investment in emf  was fully written down by million based on data regarding the company s valuation 
we further wrote down our lighthouse investment by million  based on data regarding the company s valuation 
during the june quarter  we also fully wrote down our investment in world theatre based on data regarding the company s valuation 
the amount of the additional write down was million 
finally  a million charge was taken to fully write down our investment in kyma during the quarter based on data regarding the company s valuation 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal  we took a million reserve against our investments in privately held companies 
a million reserve was taken against our investment in xemod based on data regarding the company s valuation 
in addition  a million reserve was taken on our investment in lighthouse based on data regarding the company s valuation 
also  in the fourth quarter of fiscal a  write down was taken for our investment in world theater based on data regarding the company s valuation 
other non operating expense 
other non operating expense decreased to in fiscal from million in fiscal in fiscal  we made a one time charitable contribution pledge of million to the university of california at santa barbara to endow a cree  inc chair in solid state lighting and displays and for other uses 
in addition  a  charge was recorded related to one time charges for expenses incurred for the acquisition of nitres  inc we acquired nitres  inc 
in may and these charges were adjustments to estimates for expenses that were made 
interest income  net 
interest income  net decreased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal due to significantly lower interest rates available in fiscal in addition  slightly lower cash amounts were available as million was used to repurchase our own stock during fiscal income tax expense benefit 
income tax expense benefit for fiscal was a benefit of million compared to an expense of million in fiscal the income tax benefit resulted from the million net pre tax loss resulting mainly from the charges taken during the period 
these charges included write downs for the impairment of fixed assets of million  a million charge for the reserve for investments in privately held companies  a million write down for other than temporary declines in the fair market value of marketable securities  a million write down of goodwill and other intangibles and a million reserve taken for inventory and other items 
the effective tax rate during fiscal was compared to in fiscal liquidity and capital resources we have funded our operations  to date  through sales of equity  bank borrowings and from product and contract gross profits 
as of june   we had working capital of million  including million in cash  cash equivalents and short term investments held to maturity 
as of june   we invested million in long term securities held to maturity in order to receive a higher interest rate on our cash 
operating activities generated million in fiscal compared with million generated 
table of contents during fiscal this increase was primarily attributable to a million increase in deferred income tax assets recorded in fiscal that was generated from the million in pretax charges taken in fiscal operating results were also more profitable in fiscal than fiscal depreciation and amortization increased by million in fiscal  due to new equipment purchased 
prepaid and other current assets also declined by million due to a reduction in short term tax receivable balances  while accrued expenses increased by million due to timing 
these inflows of cash were partly offset by a million increase in accounts receivable due to higher revenue 
cash used by investing activities in fiscal was million 
net investments of million were made in securities held to maturity and million was invested in property and equipment and in additional deposits for property and equipment 
the majority of the increase in spending was due to new equipment additions to increase manufacturing capacity in our crystal growth  epitaxy  clean room and package and test areas 
finally  million was invested in patents and the purchase of patent rights 
cash provided by financing activities included the receipt of million for the exercise of stock options and shares issued under our employee stock purchase program 
we target approximately to million in capital spending in fiscal  which is lower than fiscal we estimate lower spending despite higher revenue targets for fiscal  including targeting million of revenue from sumitomo ending in june capital expenses are expected to be lower as we aim to receive benefits in fiscal from capital expenditures made in fiscal  and we target yield improvements in our factory 
we anticipate that the majority of the expenditures will be made for new equipment and will be funded by cash from operations 
we target that our cash from operations will be higher in fiscal than it was in fiscal due to higher targeted profitability resulting from greater revenue 
we also project that we will be free cash flow defined as cash from operations less capital spending positive for fiscal therefore  we plan to meet the cash needs for the business for fiscal through cash from operations 
we also anticipate that long term cash needs will be met with cash flow from operations or cash on hand over the next two fiscal years 
actual results may differ from our targets for a number of reasons as we discuss herein 
we may also issue additional shares of common stock for the acquisition of complementary businesses or other significant assets 
from time to time  we evaluate potential acquisitions in complementary businesses as strategic opportunities and anticipate continuing to make such evaluations 
as of june   our cash and cash equivalents  short term investments held to maturity and marketable securities accounts combined increased by million or over balances reported as of june  due to increased cash flow from operations 
our accounts receivable balance increased by million or over the accounts receivable balance as of june   which resulted from the overall increase in revenue 
our revenue in the fourth quarter of fiscal was million  which was higher than the fourth quarter of fiscal revenue of million 
our net property and equipment has also increased by million or since june  due to investments made to expand production capacity 
these investments are targeted to aid us in meeting current and what we view as increasing  future customer product demands on a cost effective basis 
we target that these investments in additional equipment will allow us to meet any increase in demand for our products and thus may lead to higher revenue for us 
the higher property investment will also result in higher depreciation expense 
the deferred income tax asset account declined by million or since june  due to the use of tax assets toward our current year tax provision  as we were profitable in fiscal other assets declined by million or since june  due to a million decrease in deposits that were related to fixed asset additions 
our deferred revenue account increased by million to million as a result of the distributorship agreement with sumitomo which requires us to establish reserves at the time we ship led products to sumitomo based upon a percentage of the total purchase price of such products 
revenue is recognized from our customers at shipment 
for certain customers we defer revenue for certain sales costs incurred in selling our products and for managing our inventory  up to the balance of the deferred revenue 

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk quantitative disclosures as of june   we no longer hold investments in marketable securities  however  an adverse movement of equity market prices would likely have an impact on our portfolio of non marketable strategic equity securities  although the impact cannot be directly quantified 
such a movement and the related underlying economic conditions could negatively affect the prospects of the companies we invest in  their ability to raise additional capital and the likelihood of our being able to realize our investments through liquidity events such as initial public offerings  mergers and private sales 
at june   our non marketable strategic equity securities had a net book value of million 
we have invested some of the proceeds from our january public offering into high grade corporate debt  commercial paper  government securities and other investments at fixed interest rates that vary by security 
these investments are a grade or better per our cash management policy 
at june   we had million invested in these securities 
although these securities generally earn interest at fixed rates  the historical fair values of such investments have not differed materially from the amounts reported on our consolidated balance sheets 
therefore  we believe that potential changes in future interest rates will not create material exposure for us from differences between the fair values and the amortized cost of these investments 
we currently have no debt outstanding 
with two of our larger customers  we maintain a foreign currency adjustment to our sales price if certain exchange rates against the us dollar are not maintained 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal  we recognized  of other non operating income associated with proceeds received from one of these customers for foreign currency adjustments 
these revenue adjustments represent our main risk with respect to foreign currency  since our contracts and purchase orders are denominated in us dollars 
we also have no commodity risk 
qualitative disclosures we hold no investments in publicly traded equity securities at this time
