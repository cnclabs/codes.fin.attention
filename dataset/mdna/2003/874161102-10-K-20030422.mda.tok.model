the 
table of contents company assumes no obligation for updating any such forward looking statements to reflect actual results  changes in assumptions or changes in other factors affecting such forward looking statements 
the following discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based upon the company s consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america and should be read in conjunction with these statements and the notes thereto 
critical accounting policies the preparation of the company s financial statements require the company to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  the company evaluates its estimates  including those related to inventories  product returns  customer programs and incentives  bad debts and income taxes 
the estimates are based on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results would differ from these estimates if actual events or experience were different from their assumptions 
talbots believes the following critical accounting policies require more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements inventory markdown reserve 
merchandise inventory is a significant portion of the company s balance sheet  representing approximately of total assets at february  talbots manages its inventory levels by holding four major sale events a year in its stores and catalog  consisting of two mid season sales and two end of season clearance sales 
no other major promotional sale events are typically held 
these events serve to liquidate remaining inventory at the end of each selling season after which remainder goods are transferred to the company s outlet stores 
at the end of each reporting period reductions in gross margin and inventory are recorded for estimated future markdowns necessary to liquidate remaining markdown inventory 
the reserve calculation uses information related to markdown inventory levels  historical markdown trends and forecasted sales and markdowns 
the key factors influencing the reserve calculation are the overall level of markdown inventory at the end of the reporting period and the expectation of future markdowns for this same merchandise based on historical markdown percentages 
these percentages are reviewed regularly by comparing actual markdowns taken against previous estimates 
these results are then factored into future estimates 
throughout fiscal  overall inventory levels were reduced as part of an effort to maximize gross margin and cash flow during the year and to minimize the overall level of markdowns 
additionally  in  actual markdowns were taken prior to year end while in actual markdowns were not taken until after year end and included in the fiscal reserve 
if market conditions were to decline  talbots might be required to mark down inventory at a greater rate than estimated  possibly resulting in an incremental reduction in earnings 
management believes that at february   the markdown reserve is sufficient based on current markdown inventory levels  historical markdown trends and reasonable sales and markdown forecasts 
sales return reserve 
as part of the normal sales cycle  the company receives customer merchandise returns through both its catalog and store locations 
to account for the financial impact of this process  management estimates future returns on previously sold merchandise 
reductions in sales and gross margin are recorded for estimated merchandise returns based on return history  current sales levels and projected future return levels 
the sales return reserve calculation consists of two separate components 
the stores component is based on an analysis that tracks daily sales over the preceding six months and actual returns processed against those sales 
a six month rolling average return rate is applied against the actual sales and the difference is booked as a reserve 
the model also applies a component to reduce the reserve for returns that result in merchandise exchanges 
these types of returns are tracked by the store systems and the estimate is applied 
table of contents against the return reserve 
the catalog component is based on a similar process except that sales are tracked by catalog and return rates are based on forecasted estimates for the entire life of the catalog and are based on current and historical return experience 
periodically both components of the calculation are validated by comparing the assumptions used to the actual returns processed 
management believes that at february   the reserve is sufficient based on current sales return trends and reasonable return forecasts 
the company records store generated revenue at the point of sale and catalog and internet revenue based on estimated receipt by the customer 
customer loyalty program 
talbots maintains a customer loyalty program in which customers receive appreciation awards based on reaching a specified purchase level on their talbots charge accounts 
customers may redeem their appreciation awards toward future merchandise purchases on the talbots charge card 
appreciation awards  by their terms  expire one year from the date of issuance 
typically  the customer receives one point for each of purchase 
each time a customer reaches points within the program year the customer is issued a appreciation award 
in fiscal the company ran two promotional events where the customer was credited points for each purchased 
in fiscal only one such event was held 
appreciation award expense is calculated as a percent of talbots charge sales and is based on expected redemption rates and is charged to selling  general and administrative expense 
ongoing analysis of issuances and redemptions is performed to identify trends in the expense rate 
a secondary analysis is performed that analyzes the accrual account balance and factors in the outstanding unredeemed awards  actual redemptions and the level of award points earned 
adjustments are made to the accrual based on trends and changes in the program 
several key statistics are monitored regularly  including expense as a percent of sales  redemptions as a percentage of sales and cumulative redemptions 
trends in these statistics are then factored into both the initial expense and the analysis of the liability account 
actual award grants and redemptions may vary from estimates based on actual customer responsiveness to the program and could result in additional expense 
management believes at february   its current allowance is sufficient based on recent purchase levels and expected redemption levels 
allowance for doubtful accounts 
customer accounts receivable consist entirely of outstanding receivables from the company s customers for purchases made using the company s proprietary credit card 
talbots maintains an allowance for doubtful accounts providing for estimated charge offs resulting from the inability of talbots charge customers to make required payments 
delinquent accounts are generally charged off automatically after a period of delinquency 
accounts are written off sooner in the event of customer bankruptcy or other circumstances that make further collection unlikely 
changes in the allowance are charged to selling  general and administrative expense 
the likelihood of collectibility of accounts receivable is evaluated based on a combination of factors including the level of accounts receivable balances  overall credit quality of the portfolio  historic charge off levels and projected future charge off levels 
an analytical review of accounts receivable is performed each reporting period  which categorizes delinquent accounts based on the number of days overdue 
bad debt estimates  by category  are then calculated based on historical collection rates 
for accounts that are not delinquent  a bad debt rate is imputed based on historical delinquency and collection rates 
in addition  bad debts resulting from factors other than delinquency  such as bankruptcy or fraud  are also factored into the calculation based on historical experience 
additionally  existing accounts are reviewed twice a year using standard industry credit scores 
an adjustment to the reserve is calculated based on movement in the portfolio s credit scores and current aging trends 
if the creditworthiness of talbots customers deteriorates  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additions to this reserve might be required 
management believes that at february   the allowance for doubtful accounts balance is sufficient in light of portfolio balance  portfolio quality  historical charge offs and reasonable charge off forecasts 
income taxes 
the company records a valuation allowance to reduce its deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
while the company has considered future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for the valuation allowance  if the company determined that it would not be able to realize all or part of its net deferred tax asset in the 
table of contents future  an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would be charged to income in the period such determination was made 
likewise  in the event it is determined that it would be able to realize deferred tax assets in the future in excess of its net recorded amount  an adjustment to the valuation allowance would increase income in the period such determination was made 
management believes that  at february   no valuation allowance was needed based on assumptions regarding future taxable income 
results of operations the fiscal year had weeks and ended february  the fiscal year had weeks and ended february  the fiscal year had weeks and ended on february  when making comparable store sales comparisons between fiscal and fiscal  the comparable week period for fiscal excludes the first week 
comparable stores are those which were open for at least one full fiscal year 
when a new talbots petites  woman  mens  kids or accessories shoes store is opened adjacent to or within the same center as an existing comparable misses store  such misses store is excluded from the computation of comparable store sales for a period of months so that the performance of the full misses assortment may be properly compared

seasonality and quarterly fluctuations the nature of the company s business is to have two distinct selling seasons  spring and fall 
the first and second quarters make up the spring season and the third and fourth quarters make up the fall season 
within the spring season  catalog sales are stronger in the first quarter  while retail store sales are slightly stronger in the second quarter 
within the fall season  catalog sales and retail store sales are the strongest in the fourth quarter

merchandise inventories typically peak in the third quarter 

table of contents the company s selling  general and administrative expenses are strongly affected by the seasonality of sales 
the two key elements of this seasonality are the catalog circulation strategy  which affects catalog sales volume and produces commensurately high catalog production costs and the major semiannual sale events in the second quarter and the fourth quarter  which require additional store payroll and selling supplies 
another factor is the store expansion program  which results in having more stores open in the fall than at the beginning of the year and  therefore  results in higher store payroll and operations related expenses 
the combined effect of the patterns of net sales  cost of sales  buying and occupancy expenses and selling  general and administrative expenses  described above  has produced higher operating income margins  as a percent of sales  in the first and third quarters
