 revenue recognition in financial statements 

table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations results of operations we develop  manufacture  market and service wafer and semiconductor fabrication equipment and related parts  supplies and services on a worldwide basis 
the products offered are grouped into two business segments the semiconductor equipment segment  which offers horizontal diffusion furnaces  processing robotic equipment for diffusion furnaces  related spare parts and manufacturing support services to semiconductor fabricators and silicon wafer manufacturers  and the polishing supplies segment  which offers supplies  including carriers and templates  and equipment for lapping and polishing  which are some of the last steps in the fabrication of silicon wafers 
demand for our products can change significantly from period to period as a result of numerous factors  including  but not limited to  changes in global and regional economic conditions  supply and demand for semiconductors or  more specifically  capacity utilization and production volume of manufacturers of semiconductors  silicon wafers  solar cells and optical components  and the profitability of semiconductor manufacturers and their silicon wafer suppliers 
for this and other reasons  our results of operations for  and may not necessarily be indicative of future operating results 
the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the selected financial data and the consolidated financial statements and notes appearing elsewhere in this report 
net revenues 
our net revenues for were million  compared to million in and million in  representing decreases of in and in our netherlands operation accounted for approximately of consolidated net revenues and of the net revenues of the semiconductor equipment segment 
our netherlands operation records all transactions in euros  its functional currency  which in turn are translated into united states us dollars  our reporting currency 
the us dollar decreased in value relative to the euro in both and as a result of these decreases  consolidated net revenues  and those of the semiconductor equipment segment  were approximately million and million higher in and  respectively  than they would have been had the exchange rates remained the same as the weighted average exchange rates for the following table reflects new orders net of cancellations  shipments and net revenues for each quarter and year during the three years in the period ended september   and the backlog as of the end those periods  on a consolidated basis  as well as for each of our two business segments 
fiscal quarter fiscal year semi conductor equipment segment polishing supplies segment first second third fourth dollars in thousands new orders shipments net revenues ending backlog new orders shipments net revenues ending backlog new orders shipments net revenues ending backlog new orders are net of cancellations 

table of contents our business has historically been subject to cyclical industry conditions  and  and were no exception 
as a result  there were significant fluctuations in our quarterly new orders and net revenues  both within and across years 
an example of these significant fluctuations is the large swing in revenues and income between the third and fourth quarters of demand for semiconductor and silicon wafer manufacturing equipment and related consumable products has also been volatile as a result of sudden changes in semiconductor supply and demand and other factors in both semiconductor devices and wafer fabrication processes 
customers delivery schedules on large system orders  and the timing of revenue recognition under our accounting policies  can also add to this volatility 
in  our new orders were million  the highest since the record level achieved in  and higher than in shipments in were million higher than in despite this increase in orders and shipments during  net revenues declined by to million in from million in the decrease in net revenues is primarily attributable to the much larger backlog at the beginning of both of the prior two years that we worked off  until the backlog reached its low point in during  slowing worldwide demand for semiconductors resulted in a rapid decrease in demand for manufacturing equipment and caused new orders for our products to decline  particularly during the second half of that year 
this decline in demand  as measured by new orders  reached its lowest level during the second half of and the first half of  resulting from the severe industry downturn and weakness in the macro economic climate and consumption of electronic goods  which translated into further capital spending cutbacks by semiconductor manufacturers 
within the global semiconductor equipment market  which is served by both of our business segments  each geographic region exhibits unique characteristics that can cause  and in the past have caused  capital equipment investment patterns to vary significantly from period to period 
in  and   and  respectively  of our total revenue was attributable to sales in asia  principally china  korea and taiwan 
our revenue from asia represents the highest proportion of net revenues since  and is a record level from that region 
the increase in sales in asia is partially due to the fact that china s economy has been very strong 
another factor is that significant portions of the semiconductor industry s operations have moved to asia 
this is a trend of increasing importance to us and to other suppliers to the industry 
one example of this trend is that many semiconductor fabricators have gone fabless  out sourcing the manufacturing operations to foundries in taiwan or elsewhere in asia 
as a result  silicon wafer manufacturing in asia has also increased 
for a more complete analysis of sales to customers by geographic region  see note of the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
our semiconductor equipment segment accounted for  and of net revenues in  and  respectively 
this segment also accounted for of the operating loss in and and of operating income in and  respectively 
the semiconductor and optical component industries cycles peaked during in  as a result of the rapid decline in the demand for semiconductor devices  inventory buildups in telecommunications products  slower than expected personal computer sales and overall slower global economic growth  many semiconductor manufacturers re evaluated their capital spending plans 
as a result  we experienced cancellation orders and rescheduling of deliveries by customers in  and a significant decline in new orders during and this trend was reversed in  with new orders net of cancellations reaching million  the second highest in the history of our semiconductor segment and a million  or  increase compared to much of the increase in new orders came from asia  which is a particularly active region now 
the semiconductor equipment segment s net revenues for were million  representing a decrease of from the million of revenue reported for this segment in and the semiconductor equipment segment s total shipments for were million  compared to million in and million in  representing an increase of in and a decrease in the changes in net revenues did not parallel the changes in shipments because of much larger reductions in backlog in and compared to  particularly within the deferred revenue portion of the backlog 
see the components of deferred profit under revenue recognition in note of the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
revenues of the polishing supplies segment reached a record million in  as the semiconductor industry reached the peak of its business cycle 
by march  orders in the polishing supplies segment began a steep decline  reflecting excess supply inventories and capacity of that segment s customers 
the polishing supplies 
table of contents segment suffered a dramatic decrease in revenues  declining to million in and million in  before increasing slightly to million in these revenues represent a decrease of in and in and an increase of in while sales of consumables  which represent the majority of this segment s revenues  increased during  this increase was partially offset by the continued decline in machine sales 
machine sales  like other capital items  have been negatively impacted by the slow recovery in the manufacturing sector and the transfer of manufacturing to asia 
the following table sets forth certain operational data as a percentage of net revenues for each of the three years in the period ended september  year ended september  net revenues cost of sales gross margin selling  general and administrative expenses research and development operating income loss gross margin 
consolidated gross margin for was million  compared to million in and million in  representing a decrease of million  or  in  and a decrease of million  or  in in  the gross margin of the semiconductor equipment segment decreased by million  or  primarily due to the decline in revenues  described above 
the gross margin of the polishing supplies segment increased by million  or  in due to our fixed costs being covered by increased revenues 
in  the gross margin of the semiconductor equipment segment decreased by million  or  primarily due to million in inventory write offs taken in response to a decline in the worldwide semiconductor industry and a customer s decision to sell a plant from which future orders had been expected 
other factors contributing to the decline in the gross margin of the semiconductor equipment segment included learning curve and development costs incurred on customer orders for new products ie  mm diffusion furnace and related automation and s models with cassette to cassette capability and interfaces to smif pod openers and factory automation with secs ii gem and million in increased labor costs 
the gross margin of the polishing supplies segment declined by million  or  in due to the decrease in sales volume 
as a percentage of net revenues  the consolidated gross margin was in and in  compared to in write downs of excess or obsolete inventory of million in  compared to million in  contributed to the decline in gross margin as a percentage of revenues in compared to other factors contributing to the decline in gross margin as a percentage of revenues in were product mix and learning curve costs in of the semiconductor segment  underabsorption of factory expenses in the polishing supplies segment and competitive pricing pressure in both segments 
our gross margin has significantly fluctuated in the past and will continue to fluctuate in the future based on several factors including  but not limited to  the severity and duration of industry cycles  the timing of revenue recognition under evolving accounting principles  product mix and overhead absorption levels 
during  increased efficiencies from the higher level of plant utilization was offset by price compression  resulting from asian sales by our netherlands operation  which are typically transacted in us dollars  as is general practice of asian customers when importing equipment 
this price compression is attributable to the declining value of the us dollar relative to the euro  which is difficult to recover through higher us dollar prices 
selling  general and administrative expenses 
consolidated selling  general and administrative expenses were million in and  compared to million in in  general and administrative costs declined by million primarily due to a reduction in provisions for doubtful accounts  but this reduction was offset by increased selling costs  including commissions million  personnel costs million and other costs  such as tradeshows and advertising million 
the increase in commissions is attributable to increased sales in 
table of contents territories where we use sales representatives  such as asia 
the decline in selling  general and administrative expenses in compared to is due to decreased commissions of million in due to the decrease in shipments in both segments 
costs associated with implementing new data processing systems were higher in than in  further contributing to the decrease in general and administrative expenses in selling  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net revenues remained relatively constant during the three year period  ranging from in and and increasing to in  as the increase in sales from asia resulted in higher commissions expense 
research and development expenses 
during  and  expenditures accounted for as research and development were million  million and million  respectively 
in order to more accurately reflect research and development expenditures  we have reclassified million of expenses previously reflected as cost of sales to research and development in both and the reclassified costs primarily relate to the development engineering personnel at tempress  which were not separately tracked until during and  the most significant project included in research and development expenses was the development of a new technology asher pursuant to a joint product development agreement with psk tech 
in  development of a new model for our diffusion furnace product line became the most significant project 
the results of the feasibility work on the new technology asher were encouraging 
however  continued improvements in existing technologies have delayed our customers potential requirements for this product and thus further development has been postponed for an indeterminate length of time 
in  we completed the development of a mm horizontal diffusion furnace and related automation and s models with cassette to cassette capability and interfaces to smif pod openers and factory automation with secs ii gem 
however  a portion of these costs were incurred while completing customer orders and were charged  along with other costs of the order  to cost of sales and are therefore not included in research and development expenses 
operating income loss 
reduced revenues and gross margins and increased selling  general and administrative costs in resulted in an operating loss of million  compared to operating income of million  or less than of revenue  and million  or of revenue  in and  respectively 
operating income declined in due primarily to a decline in revenues and related gross margin in the polishing supplies segment and the lower gross margin of the semiconductor equipment segment  as discussed above 
interest income  net 
net interest income was less than million in and  compared to million in the decrease in net interest income in and is primarily the result of a decline in interest rates since and  to a lesser degree  fluctuations in excess cash available for investment 
income tax provision 
during  we recorded an income tax benefit of million  compared to the income tax provision recorded in and of million and million  respectively 
the effective rate stated as a percentage of income loss before income taxes and cumulative effect of the change in revenue recognition accounting principle was  and in  and  respectively 
the significantly higher effective tax rate in is primarily due to the impact of permanent differences between financial reporting and taxable income 
the significantly lower effective tax rate in is a result of the fact that more than all of the consolidated operating profit was earned in the netherlands where there is no state income taxes 
in addition  a state income tax benefit arose from operating losses in the us during our future effective income tax rate depends on various factors  such as tax legislation  the geographic composition of the pre tax income  non tax deductible expenses and the effectiveness of our tax planning strategies 
net income loss 
as a result of the operating results described above  resulted in a net loss of million  compared to the net income reported for and of million and million  respectively 
net income loss per diluted share was  
and 
in  and  respectively 
excluding the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle in  with the change in the revenue recognition accounting principle being applied retroactively  net income loss per diluted share was  
and 
in  and  respectively 

table of contents liquidity and capital resources as of september  and  cash and cash equivalents were million and million  respectively 
our ratio of current assets to current liabilities was and at september  and  respectively 
in  net cash used in operating activities was million  compared to cash provided by operations of million in and million in the net loss million was more than offset by million of non cash adjustments for depreciation million and the write down of inventory million 
however  the increase in inventories million  accounts receivable million and income taxes receivable million contributed to the use of operating cash in in  net cash provided by operating activities resulted primarily from net income adjusted for non cash items of million  decreases in accounts receivable of million and in inventories of million  which were partially offset by reductions in accrued liabilities of million and in deferred profit of million 
investing activities consisted of software  computer and equipment purchases and building improvements  which totaled million  million and million in  and  respectively 
financing activities provided million  and million in  and  respectively 
in  financing activities consisted mainly of the proceeds from an increase in the mortgage on the building in the netherlands  while in they consisted primarily of the issuance of common stock pursuant to the earn out provisions of the pr hoffman acquisition transaction 
at september   our principal sources of liquidity consisted of million of cash and cash equivalents 
since the only lien on our assets is a million mortgage loan  we believe that significant amounts of additional liquidity are available from various financing sources 
we believe that we have sufficient liquidity for our current operations and for at least certain elements of our growth strategy 
one element of that strategy is the acquisition of product lines or businesses that complement our existing product lines and business 
another element of that strategy is the development of new products  such as the proposed new technology asher 
our currently available cash and cash equivalents are expected to be sufficient for existing operations  planned research and development and at least one acquisition  depending on the size of the acquisition target 
however  significant unplanned development of new products or the completion of larger acquisitions may require additional capital resources that are expected to be obtained from one or more sources of financing  such as a private placement  a public offering  working capital loans or term loans from banks or other financial institutions  equipment leasing  mortgage financing and internally generated cash flow from operations 
there can be no assurance of the availability or sufficiency of these or any other source of funding for those purposes 
commitments key suppliers include two steel mills  one domestic and one german  capable of meeting the material specifications we require 
as of september   we had unconditional commitments to purchase million of steel  with delivery dates to be determined in the future 
due to minimum order quantities for this steel and long lead times  we have made purchase commitments that may be in excess of future production requirements  and it could take several years to use all of the steel commitments in production of our products 
these purchase commitments are not expected to result in any significant losses 
we lease buildings  vehicles and equipment under operating leases 
as of september   future minimum rental commitments under non cancelable operating leases with initial or remaining terms of one year or more totaled  of which     and  is payable in    and  respectively 
critical accounting policies management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations discusses our consolidated financial statements that have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions 
table of contents that affect the reported amount of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements  the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates and judgments  including those related to revenue recognition  inventory valuation  accounts receivable collectibility  warranty and impairment of long lived assets 
we base our estimates and judgments on historical experience and on various other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
the results of these estimates and judgments form the basis for making conclusions about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
a critical accounting policy is one that is both important to the portrayal of our financial position and results of operations  and also requires management s most difficult  subjective or complex judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
these uncertainties are discussed in the section below entitled trends  risks and uncertainties 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition 
we review product and service sales contracts with multiple deliverables to determine if separate units of accounting are present in the arrangements 
where separate units of accounting exist  revenue is allocated to delivered items equal to the total sales price less the greater of the fair market value of the undelivered items  and all contingent portions of the sales arrangement 
we recognize revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  the product has been delivered and title has transferred  or services have been rendered  the seller s price to the buyer is fixed or determinable and collectibility is reasonably assured 
for us  this policy generally results in revenue recognition at the following points for the semiconductor equipment segment  transactions where legal title passes to the customer upon shipment  we recognize revenue upon shipment for those products where the customer s defined specifications have been met with at least two similarly configured systems and processes for a comparably situated customer 
however  a portion of the revenue associated with certain installation related tasks  equal to the greater of the fair market value of those tasks or the portion of the contract price contingent upon their completion  generally of the system s selling price the holdback  and directly related costs are deferred and recognized into income when the tasks are completed 
for products where the customer s defined specifications have not been met with at least two similarly configured systems and processes  the revenue and directly related costs are deferred at the time of shipment and recognized into income at the time of customer acceptance or when this criteria has been met 
we have  on occasion  experienced longer than expected delays in receiving cash from certain customers pending system acceptance or final installation 
if some of our customers were to refuse to pay the remaining holdback  or otherwise delay final acceptance or installation  the deferred revenue would not be recognized  adversely affecting our future operating results 
equipment sold by the polishing supplies segment does not include process guarantees or acceptance criteria  therefore  the related revenue is recorded upon shipment 
our shipping terms for both segments are customarily fob our shipping point or equivalent terms 
for all segments  sales of spare parts and consumables are recognized upon shipment  as there are no post shipment obligations other than standard warranties 
service revenues are recognized upon performance of the services requested by the customer 
revenue related to service contracts is recognized ratably over the period of the contract  which generally coincides with the performance of the services requested by the customer 
during the fourth quarter of  we changed our revenue recognition policy retroactively to effective october   based on guidance provided in securities and exchange commission sec staff accounting bulletin no 
sab  revenue recognition in financial statements 
in accordance with guidance provided in sab  we recorded a non cash charge of  after reduction for income taxes of  or per basic share  to reflect the cumulative effect of the accounting change as of the beginning of the deferred profit balance as of the beginning of was  this amount is the deferred revenue  net of the related cost of sales  for equipment that was shipped and previously recorded as sales  but that had not been accepted or did not qualify for multiple element accounting as of september  of the  in deferred profit as of the beginning of    and  was recognized in  and 
table of contents respectively 
the pro forma amounts presented in item selected financial data were calculated assuming the accounting change was retroactively adopted as of october  inventory valuation 
we value our inventory at the lower of cost first in  first out method or net realizable value 
we regularly review inventory quantities and record a write down for excess and obsolete inventory 
the write down is primarily based on our estimated forecast of product demand and production requirements 
however  our industry is characterized by customers in highly cyclical industries  rapid technological changes  frequent new product developments and rapid product obsolescence 
during and  there was a significant decrease in worldwide demand for semiconductor capital equipment 
demand for our products has fluctuated significantly in the past  and may do so in the future  which could result in an increase in the cost of inventory or an increase in excess inventory quantities 
while inventory turns have returned to a level that is within historic norms on a consolidated basis  certain portions of the inventory are at higher levels than what are needed for related operating activities  a condition that may not change until there is further improvement in capital spending by our customers 
there can be no assurance that future developments will not necessitate further write downs 
allowance for doubtful accounts 
we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
this allowance is based on historical experience  credit evaluations and specific customer collection issues we have identified 
since a significant portion of our revenues are derived from the sale of high value systems  our accounts receivable are often concentrated in a relatively few number of customers 
a significant change in the liquidity or financial position of any one of these customers could have a material adverse impact on the collectibility of our accounts receivable and our future operating results 
warranty 
we provide a limited warranty  generally for to months  to all purchasers of our new products and systems 
a provision for the estimated cost of providing warranty coverage is recorded upon shipment of all systems 
on occasion  we have been required and may be required in the future to provide additional warranty coverage to ensure that the systems are ultimately accepted or to maintain customer goodwill 
while our warranty costs have historically been within our expectations and we believe that the amounts accrued for warranty expenditures are sufficient for all systems sold through september   we cannot guarantee that we will continue to experience a similar level of predictability with regard to warranty costs 
in addition  technological changes or previously unknown defects in raw materials or components may result in more extensive and frequent warranty service than anticipated  which could have a material adverse impact on our operating results for the periods in which such additional costs materialize 
impairment of long lived assets 
we evaluate whether events and circumstances have occurred that indicate the estimated useful lives of long lived assets or intangible assets may warrant revision or that the remaining balance may not be recoverable 
goodwill is also tested for impairment at least annually 
when factors indicate that an asset should be evaluated for possible impairment  we use an estimate of the related undiscounted net cash flows generated by the asset over the remaining estimated life of the asset in measuring whether the asset is recoverable 
we make judgments and estimates used in establishing the carrying value of long lived or intangible assets 
those judgments and estimates could be modified if adverse changes occurred in the future resulting in an inability to recover the carrying value of these assets 
we have not experienced any impairment to long lived assets during or future adverse changes could be caused by  among other factors  a downturn in the semiconductor industry  a general economic slowdown  reduced demand for our products in the marketplace  poor operating results  the inability to protect intellectual property or changing technologies and product obsolescence 
impact of recently issued accounting prounouncements on october   we adopted sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
under sfas no 
 goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives are no longer subject to amortization  but are tested for impairment at least annually 
accordingly  we review goodwill for impairment on an annual basis  or more frequently if circumstances dictate 
we have completed both the initial impairment testing required by sfas no 
and our updated annual impairment testing  noting no indication of impairment associated with the recorded goodwill balance of  goodwill amortization was   and  for  and  respectively 

table of contents in november   the eitf reached a consensus on issue  revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables eitf 
eitf addresses how to account for arrangements that may involve the delivery or performance of multiple products  services and or rights to use assets 
the consensus mandates how to identify whether goods or services or both that are to be delivered separately in a bundled sales arrangement should be accounted for separately 
the guidance can affect the timing of revenue recognition for such arrangements  even though it does not change rules governing the timing or patterns of revenue recognition of individual items accounted for separately 
the final consensus was applicable to agreements entered into in fiscal periods beginning after june  the adoption of eitf did not have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations  however  depending on the circumstances and contract terms of large multi system orders  eitf may cause us to experience significant quarterly fluctuations in revenues  profits and cash flows 
in january   the fasb issued interpretation no 
 consolidation of variable interest entities  an interpretation of arb no 
this interpretation addresses the consolidation by business enterprises of variable interest entities when the equity investors do not have the characteristics of a controlling financial interest as defined in the interpretation 
in october   the fasb deferred the effective date for implementation of this interpretation until december  we believe that we currently have no contractual or other business relationship with a variable interest entity  and therefore  do not believe that the adoption of this interpretation will have a material effect on our financial position or results of operations 
in december   the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure 
sfas no 
requires certain pro forma disclosures related to employee stock based compensation  and also amended the transition provisions of sfas no 
we adopted the pro forma disclosures required by sfas no 
in the second quarter of  and the remaining disclosure requirements are implemented within the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
in may   the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity 
sfas no 
establishes standards for how an issuer classifies and measures certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity 
it requires that an issuer classify a financial instrument that is within its scope as a liability or an asset in some circumstances 
for public entities  sfas no 
was effective for financial instruments entered into or modified after may   and otherwise was effective at the beginning of the first interim period beginning after june  the adoption of sfas no 
did not have a material effect on our financial position or results of operations 
trends  risks and uncertainties if demand for horizontal diffusion furnaces and related equipment declines  our financial position and results of operations could be materially adversely affected 
the revenues of our semiconductor equipment segment  which accounts for approximately three quarters of our consolidated revenues  is comprised of sales of horizontal diffusion furnaces and our processing robotic product line 
our processing robotic product line is useable only with horizontal diffusion furnaces 
there is a trend in the semiconductor industry  related to the trend to produce smaller chips on larger wafers  towards the use in semiconductor manufacturing facilities of newer technology  such as vertical diffusion furnaces 
vertical diffusion furnaces are more efficient to use than the horizontal diffusion furnaces in certain manufacturing processes of smaller chips on larger wafers 
because of this trend  we had expected that demand for our horizontal diffusion furnaces would decline 
we believe this trend has not adversely affected us yet primarily because we have experienced continued demand from manufacturers that do not require the more expensive vertical furnaces  such as from manufacturers of analog  power management  dsp and mems chips and micro controllers used in a number of consumer applications  including wireless phones  china s significant investments in its semiconductor industry have resulted in increased sales of our horizontal furnaces there  
table of contents certain larger equipment manufacturers have decided to de emphasize their horizontal product line  thereby allowing us to increase our market share  we are pursuing alternative markets  such as solar cell manufacturers and certain research and development facilities  and we believe that because of improvements in automation for horizontal diffusion furnaces  such as our robotic product line  horizontal diffusion furnaces may be becoming a more acceptable alternative to the vertical furnaces than they previously had been for certain devices 
however  to the extent that the trend to use vertical diffusion furnaces over horizontal diffusion furnaces continues  our revenues may decline and our corresponding ability to generate income may be adversely affected 
the ongoing volatility of the semiconductor equipment industry may negatively impact our business and results of operations and our corresponding ability to efficiently budget our expenses 
the semiconductor equipment industry is highly cyclical 
the purchasing decisions of our customers are highly dependent on the economies of both their domestic markets and the worldwide semiconductor industry 
the timing  length and severity of the up and down cycles in the semiconductor equipment industry are difficult to predict 
the cyclical nature of our marketplace affects our ability to accurately budget our expense levels  which are based in part on our projections of future revenues 
when cyclical fluctuations result in lower than expected revenue levels  operating results may be adversely affected and cost reduction measures may be necessary in order for us to remain competitive and financially sound 
during a down cycle  we must be able to make timely adjustments to our cost and expense structure to correspond to the prevailing market conditions 
in addition  during periods of rapid growth  we must be able to increase manufacturing capacity and personnel to meet customer demand 
we can provide no assurance that these objectives can be met in a timely manner in response to changes within the industry cycles 
if we fail to respond to these cyclical changes  our business could be seriously harmed 
during the most recent down cycle  beginning in the first half of  the semiconductor industry experienced excess production capacity that caused semiconductor manufacturers to decrease capital spending 
we do not have long term volume production contracts with our customers and we do not control the timing or volume of orders placed by our customers 
whether and to what extent our customers place orders for any specific products and the mix and quantities of products included in those orders are factors beyond our control 
insufficient orders would result in under utilization of our manufacturing facilities and infrastructure and will negatively affect our financial position and results of operations 
we are dependent on key personnel for our business development  product development and sales  and any loss of our key personnel to competitors or other industries could dramatically impact our ability to continue operations 
we are the beneficiary of a life insurance policy on the life of our president and chief executive officer  mr 
js whang  in the amount of  but there is no assurance that such amount will be sufficient to cover the cost of finding and hiring a suitable replacement for mr 
whang 
it may not be feasible for any successor to maintain the same business relationships that mr 
whang has established 
if we were to lose the services of mr 
whang for any reason  it could have a material adverse affect on our business 
in addition  historically  our product development has been accomplished through cooperative efforts with two key customers 
our relationship with one of these customers as well as with our joint development partner for the new technology asher  are substantially dependent on personal relations established by mr 
whang 
while there can be no assurance that such relationships will continue  such cooperation is expected to continue to be a significant element in our future development efforts 

table of contents we also depend on the management efforts of our officers and other key personnel and on the ability to attract and retain key personnel 
most of our products  other than the atmoscan and products acquired in the pr hoffman acquisition  were developed by our own personnel 
we presently employ two engineers at our tempe  arizona plant  including one with a phd we employ ten engineers  including two with phd s  in our netherlands operation 
these employees design and support the horizontal diffusion furnace and conveyor furnace product lines manufactured in the netherlands and the related process robotic products manufactured in tempe 
two engineers are employed in our carlisle  pennsylvania operation 
they design wafer lapping machines and carriers to meet customers processing requirements 
during times of strong economic growth  competition is intense for highly skilled employees 
there can be no assurance that we will be successful in attracting and retaining such personnel or that we can avoid increased costs in order to do so 
there can be no assurance that employees will not leave amtech or compete against us 
our failure to attract additional qualified employees  or to retain the services of key personnel  could negatively impact our financial position and results of operations 
we may not be able to keep pace with the rapid change in the technology we use in our products 
success in the semiconductor equipment industry depends  in part  on continual improvement of existing technologies and rapid innovation of new solutions 
for example  the semiconductor industry continues to shrink the size of semiconductor devices 
these and other evolving customer needs require us to respond with continued development programs 
technical innovations are inherently complex and require long development cycles and appropriate professional staffing 
our future business success depends on our ability to develop and introduce new products  or new uses for existing products  that successfully address changing customer needs  win market acceptance of these new products or uses and manufacture any new products in a timely and cost effective manner 
if we do not develop and introduce new products  technologies or uses for existing products in a timely manner in response to changing market conditions or customer requirements  our business could be seriously harmed 
our financial position and results of operations may be materially harmed if we are unable to recoup our investment in research and development 
the rapid change in technology in our industry requires that we continue to make investments in research and development in order to enhance the performance and functionality of our products  to keep pace with competitive products and to satisfy customer demands for improved performance  features and functionality 
there can be no assurance that revenues from future products or enhancements will be sufficient to recover the development costs associated with such products or enhancements  or that we will be able to secure the financial resources necessary to fund future development 
research and development costs are typically incurred before we confirm the technical feasibility and commercial viability of a product  and not all development activities result in commercially viable products 
in addition  we cannot ensure that products or enhancements will receive market acceptance  or that we will be able to sell these products at prices that are favorable to us 
our business could be seriously harmed if we are unable to sell our products at favorable prices  or if our products are not accepted by the markets in which we operate 
our current capital structure could delay  defer or prevent a change of control 
we are authorized to issue up to  shares of common stock and up to  shares of preferred stock 
as of december   there were  shares outstanding 
authorized but unissued common stock may be issued for such consideration as the board of directors determines to be adequate 
the board of directors may issue preferred stock with such rights  preferences  privileges and restrictions as they determine  without shareholder vote 
although we do not currently intend to issue any shares of our preferred stock  there can be no assurance that we will not do so in the future 
shareholders may or may not be given the opportunity to vote thereon  depending upon the nature of any such transactions  applicable law  the rules and policies of the national securities exchange on which the common stock or preferred stock  as the case may be  is then trading  if any  and the judgment of the board of directors 
shareholders have no preemptive rights to subscribe for newly issued shares of our capital stock 

table of contents on may   we declared a dividend distribution of one preferred share purchase right for each outstanding share of common stock 
the dividend was payable on june  to stockholders of record as of the close of business on that date 
each right entitles the registered holder to purchase one one hundredth of a share of series a participating preferred stock  subject to adjustment  at a price of per one one hundredth of a share of preferred stock  subject to adjustment 
the rights issuance was adopted as protection against a takeover by a third party 
mr 
whang and certain other key employees have severance arrangements that require us to make significant lump sum payments in the event of a change of control in ownership 
having the outstanding rights  and a substantial number of authorized and unreserved shares of common stock  preferred stock and severance arrangements with key employees could have the effect of making it more difficult for a third party to acquire a majority of our outstanding voting stock 
management could use the additional shares to resist a takeover effort even if the terms of the takeover offer are favored by a majority of the independent shareholders 
this could delay  defer or prevent a change in control 
if third parties violate our proprietary rights  in which we have made significant investments  or accuse us of infringing upon their proprietary rights  such events could result in a loss of the value of some of our intellectual property or costly litigation 
our success is dependent in part on our technology and other proprietary rights 
we own various united states and international patents  have additional pending patent applications relating to some of our products and technologies  and license the non exclusive right to manufacture products under a patent owned by a third party 
the process of seeking patent protection is lengthy and expensive  and we cannot be certain that pending or future applications will actually result in issued patents  or that  issued patents will be of sufficient scope or strength to provide meaningful protection or commercial advantage to us 
other companies and individuals  including our larger competitors  may develop technologies that are similar or superior to our technology or design around the patents we own 
the owner of the patent from whom we license the right to manufacture certain products may grant licenses to our competitors  diminishing or eliminating any competitive advantage we may have 
we also maintain trademarks on certain of our products and claim copyright protection for certain proprietary software and documentation 
however  we can give no assurance that our trademarks and copyrights will be upheld or successfully deter infringement by third parties 
while patent  copyright and trademark protection for our intellectual property is important  we believe our future success in highly dynamic markets is most dependent upon the technical competence and creative skills of our personnel 
we attempt to protect our trade secrets and other proprietary information through agreements with our customers  suppliers  employees and consultants and through other security measures 
we also rely on trade secret protection for our technology  in part through confidentiality agreements with employees  consultants and third parties 
we also maintain exclusive and non exclusive licenses with third parties for the technology used in certain products 
however  these employees  consultants and third parties may breach these agreements  and we may not have adequate remedies for wrongdoing 
in addition  the laws of certain territories in which we develop  manufacture or sell our products may not protect our intellectual property rights to the same extent as do the laws of the united states 
from time to time  we have received communications from other parties asserting the existence of patent rights or other intellectual property rights that they believe cover certain of our products  processes  technologies or information 
in such cases  we evaluate our position and consider the available alternatives  which may include seeking licenses to use the technology in question on commercially reasonable terms or defending our position 
based on industry practice and prior experience  we believe that licenses or other rights  if necessary  will be available on commercially reasonable terms for existing or future claims 
nevertheless  we cannot ensure that licenses can be obtained  or if obtained will be on acceptable terms  or that litigation or other administrative proceedings will not occur 
defending our intellectual property rights through litigation could be very costly 
if we are not able to negotiate the necessary licenses on commercially reasonable terms or successfully defend our position  our financial position and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected 

table of contents our reliance on sales to a few major customers and granting credit to those customers places us at financial risk 
as of september   receivables from three customers comprised of our accounts receivable 
a concentration of our receivables from a small number of customers places us at risk 
if any one or more of our major customers is unable to pay us it could adversely affect our financial position and results of operations 
we attempt to manage this credit risk by performing credit checks  by requiring significant partial payments prior to shipment where appropriate and by actively monitoring collections 
if any of our customers cancel or fail to accept a large system order  our financial position and results of operations could be materially adversely affected 
our backlog includes orders for large systems  such as our diffusion furnaces  with system prices of up to million depending on the system configuration  options included and any special requirements of the customer 
in light of the significant dollars associated with larger system sales  should any of these orders be cancelled prior to shipment  or not be accepted by the customer  our financial position and results of operations could be materially adversely affected 
our business might be adversely affected by our dependence on foreign business 
during  of our sales were made to customers outside the united states as follows asia including singapore  indonesia  malaysia and india europe including or less to israel and africa because of our significant dependence on international revenues  our operating results could be negatively affected by a decline in the economies of any of the countries or regions in which we do business 
each region in the global semiconductor equipment market exhibits unique characteristics that can cause capital equipment investment patterns to vary significantly from period to period 
periodic local or international economic downturns  trade balance issues  political instability and fluctuations in interest and currency exchange rates could negatively affect our business and results of operations 
we recorded gains of million and million during and  respectively  and a loss of million in  as a result of foreign currency transactions 
while our business has not been materially affected in the past by currency fluctuations  there is a risk that it may be materially adversely affected in the future 
such risk includes possible losses due to currency exchange rate fluctuations  possible future prohibitions against repatriation of earnings  or proceeds from disposition of investments  and from possible social and military instability in the case of india  south korea  taiwan and possibly elsewhere 
our wholly owned subsidiary  tempress systems  has conducted its operations in the netherlands since as a result  such operations are subject to the taxation policies  employment and labor laws  transportation regulations  import and export regulations and tariffs  possible foreign exchange restrictions  international monetary fluctuations  and other political  economic and legal policies of that nation  the european economic union and the other european nations in which it conducts business 
consequently  we might encounter unforeseen or unfamiliar difficulties in conducting our european operations 
changes in such laws and regulations may have a material adverse effect on our revenues and costs 
the semiconductor equipment industry is competitive and we are relatively small in size and have fewer resources in comparison with our competitors 
our industry includes large manufacturers with substantial resources to support customers worldwide 
our future performance depends  in part  upon our ability to continue to compete successfully worldwide 
some of our competitors are diversified companies having substantially greater financial resources and more extensive research  engineering  manufacturing  marketing and customer service and support capabilities than we can provide 
we face competition from companies whose strategy is to provide a broad array of products  some of which compete with the products and services that we offer 
these competitors may bundle their products in a manner that may discourage customers from purchasing our products 
in addition  we face competition from smaller emerging semiconductor equipment companies whose strategy is to provide a portion of the products and services that we offer  using innovative technology to sell products into specialized markets 
loss of competitive position could impair our prices  customer orders  revenues  gross margin and market share  any of which would negatively affect our financial position and results of operations 
our failure to compete successfully with these other companies would seriously harm our business 
there is risk that larger  better financed competitors will develop and market more advanced products than those that we currently offer  or that competitors with greater financial resources may decrease prices thereby putting us under financial pressure 
the occurrence of any of these events could have a negative impact on our revenues 

table of contents if we make additional acquisitions  it could result in an increase in our operating costs  divert management s attention away from other operational matters and expose us to other risks associated with potential acquisitions 
we continually evaluate potential acquisitions 
we might make acquisitions of  or significant investments in  other businesses with synergistic products  services and technologies 
acquisitions involve numerous risks  including  but not limited to difficulties and increased costs in connection with integration of the personnel  operations  technologies and products of acquired companies  diversion of management s attention from other operational matters  the potential loss of key employees of acquired companies  lack of synergy  or inability to realize expected synergies  resulting from the acquisition  the risk that the issuance of our common stock in an acquisition or merger could be dilutive to our stockholders  if anticipated synergies are not realized  and acquired assets becoming impaired as a result of technological advancements or worse than expected performance of the acquired company 
if our critical suppliers fail to deliver sufficient quantities of quality product in a timely and cost effective manner  it could negatively affect our business 
we use a wide range of materials and services in the production of our products including custom electronic and mechanical components  and we use numerous suppliers to supply materials 
we generally do not have guaranteed supply arrangements with our suppliers 
because of the variability and uniqueness of customer orders  we do not maintain an extensive inventory of materials for manufacturing 
key suppliers include two steel mills capable of producing the types of steel needed for carriers to the tolerances that we require  an injection molder that molds plastic inserts into our steel carriers  an adhesive manufacturer that supplies the critical glue used in the production of the semiconductor polishing templates and a pad supplier that produces a unique material used to attach semiconductor wafers to the polishing template 
we also rely on third parties for laser cutting  machined parts  steel frames and metal panels and other components used particularly in the assembly of semiconductor production equipment 
although we make reasonable efforts to ensure that parts are available from multiple suppliers  this is not always practical or even possible  accordingly  some key parts are being procured from a single supplier or a limited group of suppliers 
during the semiconductor industry peak years  increases in demand for capital equipment has resulted in longer lead times for many important system components  which could cause delays in meeting shipments to our customers 
because the selling price of some systems exceeds million  the delay in the shipment of even a single system could cause significant variations in quarterly revenues  operating results and the market value of our common stock 
we have sought  and will continue to seek  to minimize the risk of production and service interruptions and shortages of key parts by selecting and qualifying alternative suppliers for key parts  monitoring the financial stability of key suppliers  and maintaining appropriate inventories of key parts 
there can be no assurance that our financial position and results of operations will not be materially and adversely affected if  in the future  we do not receive in a timely and cost effective manner a sufficient quantity and quality of parts to meet our production requirements 

table of contents we might require additional financing to expand our operations 
on september   we issued  shares of common stock  and warrants to purchase an aggregate of up to  shares of common stock  in a private placement pursuant to a stock and warrant purchase agreement 
we received net proceeds of million  after deducting placement agents  legal  accounting and registration fees 
the proceeds will be used to fund our growth initiatives 
while we believe that revenues generated from our operations  as well as the proceeds received from this private placement  are sufficient to provide adequate working capital for the foreseeable future and for a limited number of growth initiatives  additional financing is expected to be required for further implementation of our plans for expansion 
there is no assurance that any additional financing will be available if and when required  or  even if available  that it would not materially dilute the ownership percentage of the then existing shareholders 
if our securities become ineligible for trading on the nasdaq system  they might be subject to rule g of the securities exchange act of  which imposes additional sales practice requirements on broker dealers who sell such securities to persons other than established customers and accredited investors 
while our common stock is now included on the nasdaq national market  continued inclusion will depend on our ability to meet certain eligibility requirements established from time to time by the nasdaq national market 
loss of nasdaq eligibility could result if we sustain material operating losses  or if the market price of our common stock falls below per share 
for transactions covered by the rule  the broker dealer must make a special suitability determination for the purchaser and receive the purchaser s written consent to the transaction prior to the sale 
the rule may adversely affect the ability of broker dealers to sell our securities  and consequently may limit the public market for  and the trading price of  our common stock 
terrorist attacks and threats or actual war may negatively impact all aspects of our operations  revenues  costs and stock price 
recent terrorist attacks in the united states  as well as future events occurring in response or connection to them  including  without limitation  future terrorist attacks against united states targets  rumors or threats of war  actual conflicts involving the united states or its allies or military or trade disruptions impacting our domestic or foreign suppliers of parts  components and subassemblies  may impact our operations  including  among other things  by causing delays or losses in the delivery of supplies and decreased sales of our products 
more generally  any of these events could cause consumer confidence and spending to decrease or result in increased volatility in the united states and worldwide financial markets and economy 
they could also result in economic recession in the united states or abroad 
any of these occurrences could have a significant adverse impact on our financial position and results of operations 
we are subject to environmental regulations  and our inability or failure to comply with these regulations could adversely affect our business 
we are subject to environmental regulations in connection with our business operations  including  but not limited to  regulations related to manufacturing and our customers use of our products 
from time to time  we receive notices regarding these regulations 
it is our policy to respond promptly to these notices and to take any necessary corrective action 
our failure or inability to comply with existing or future environmental regulations could result in significant remediation liabilities  the imposition of fines and or the suspension or termination of development  manufacturing or use of certain of our products  each of which could damage our financial position and results of operations 

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to financial market risks  including changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates 
our operations in the united states are conducted in us dollars 
our operation in the netherlands  a component of the semiconductor equipment segment  conducts business primarily in the euro and the us dollar 
the functional currency of our netherlands operation is the euro 
the functional currency for all other operating units is the us dollar 
during  approximately of our net revenues were transacted in a currency other than the functional currency of the operating unit generating that revenue 
that exposure to the risk of changing foreign currency exchange rates was partially offset by transacting purchases during the year equal to approximately of our cost of sales in a currency other than the functional currency of the operating unit making the purchase 
as of september   we did not hold any stand alone or separate derivative instruments 
we recorded gains of million and million during and  respectively  and a loss of million in  as a result of foreign currency transactions 
our investment in and advances to our netherlands operation totals million 
a change in the value of the euro relative to the us dollar would cause a million foreign currency translation adjustment  a type of other comprehensive income loss  which would be a direct adjustment to our stockholders equity 
when the value of the euro increases relative to the value of the us dollar  our operation in the netherlands becomes less competitive outside the european market  as it must raise prices to those customers that normally make purchases in us dollars  in order to maintain the same profit margins 
when this occurs  this operation attempts to have transactions denominated in the euro and to increase its purchases denominated in us dollars  which become less expensive 
when the value of the euro declines relative to the value of the us dollar  our operation in the netherlands can be more competitive against united states based equipment suppliers  as the cost of purchases denominated in us dollars becomes more expensive 
in  the purchases and sales of this foreign operation that were denominated in currencies not linked to its functional currency  including us dollars  were approximately million and million  respectively 
in  the purchases and sales of this foreign operation that were denominated in currencies not linked to its functional currency  including us dollars  were approximately million and million  respectively 
most of those purchases were denominated in us dollars and provide a partial hedge against fluctuations in exchange rates on sales denominated in that currency 
because it is difficult to predict the volume of us dollar denominated transactions arising from our netherlands operation  we do not hedge against the effects of exchange rate changes on future transactions 
the euro was at a relatively high value relative to the us dollar at the end of  leaving our netherlands operation at a competitive disadvantage compared to other suppliers based in the united states
