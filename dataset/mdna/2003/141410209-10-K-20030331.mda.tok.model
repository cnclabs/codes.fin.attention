results of operations year ended december  compared to year ended december  on september  we acquired survivalink which enabled us to enter the rapidly growing public access defibrillation market and has contributed significantly and positively to the results of our operations 
on november  we acquired a ownership interest in artema which allowed us to gain access to a line of manual emergency defibrillators and patient monitors 
in addition to the new product line  we significantly expanded our international distribution channel through which we were able to sell additional powerheart aeds and crms during we also established our international sales and marketing headquarters in copenhagen  denmark where artema had certain operations 
in  we also made a fundamental shift in the way we market the powerheart crm in the us away from a capital equipment model  where sales of the powerheart were made to a large distributor medtronic physio control  to a recurring revenue business model 
under this model  we market the powerheart to us hospitals directly  and agree to place powerheart units in a customer s facility  while retaining ownership of the unit  with no upfront capital equipment charge  in exchange for an agreement to purchase a specific number of our proprietary  disposable defibrillation electrodes monthly or quarterly 
we believe this model will increase the rate of adoption of our aecd technology by addressing the capital budget constraints many us hospitals face and will ultimately result in higher levels of recurring revenue from disposable electrodes 
net sales for the year ended december  increased  or to  as compared to  for the year ended december  this increase was primarily attributable to our acquisition of survivalink which generated  in powerheart aed and related accessory sales in as compared to  in this increase in aed revenue was largely due to the timing of the survivalink acquisition which we owned for approximately days in in addition  based on our acquisition of artema  we sold approximately  of emergency defibrillators and monitors in  as compared to  for the one month we owned the company in sales of powerheart crms were  for the year ended december   a decrease of  or compared to  for the comparable period in  as a result of transitioning from a traditional capital equipment distribution model to our strategy of placing powerheart units at customer locations

critical accounting policies our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amount of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amount of revenue and expenses for each period 
the following represents a summary of our critical accounting policies  defined as those policies that we believe are a the most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations  and b that require our most difficult  subjective or complex judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effects of matters that are inherently uncertain 
valuation of accounts receivable we maintain an allowance for uncollectible accounts receivable to estimate the risk of extending credit to customers 
the allowance is estimated based on customer compliance with credit terms  the financial condition of the customer and collection history  where applicable 
additional allowances could be required if the financial condition of our customers were to be impaired beyond our estimates 
valuation of inventory inventory is valued at the lower of cost estimated using the first in  first out method or market 
we periodically evaluate the carrying value of inventories and maintain an allowance for obsolescence to adjust the carrying value  as necessary  to the lower of cost or market 
the allowance is based on physical and technical functionality as well as other factors affecting the recoverability of the asset through future sales 
unfavorable changes in estimates of obsolete inventory would result in an increase in the allowance and a decrease in gross profit 
goodwill and other intangibles in accordance with sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  which became effective january   goodwill and other intangible assets with indeterminate lives are no longer subject to amortization but are tested for impairment annually or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the asset might be impaired 
other intangible assets with finite lives continue to be subject to amortization  and any impairment is determined in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
should an impairment in goodwill be determined  it could result in a material charge to operations see note and note of the consolidated financial statements for further discussion on intangibles and amortization periods 
valuation of long lived assets in accordance with sfas no 
 long lived assets and intangible assets with determinate lives are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
the company evaluates potential impairment by comparing the carrying amount of the asset with the estimated undiscounted future cash flows associated with the use of the asset and its eventual disposition 
should the review indicate that the asset is not recoverable  the company s carrying value of the asset would be reduced to its estimated fair value  which is generally measured by future discounted cash flows 
in our estimate  no provision for impairment is currently required on any of our long lived assets 
revenue recognition we record revenue in accordance with sec staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition in financial statements sab  as amended 
product sales are recognized when there is persuasive evidence of an arrangement which states a fixed and determinable price and terms  delivery of the product has occurred in accordance with the terms of the sale  and collectibility of the sale is reasonably assured 
some of the company s customers are distributors which sell goods to third party end users 
the company is not contractually obligated to repurchase any inventory from distributors or end user customers 
license fees are generally deferred and recognized systematically over the term of the license agreement 
we record sales when we have received a valid customer purchase order for product at a stated price  the customer s credit is approved and we have shipped the product to the customer 
product warranty products sold are generally covered by a warranty against defects in material and workmanship for a period of one to five year 
we accrue a warranty reserve to estimate the risk of incurring costs to provide warranty services 
the accrual is based on our historical experience and our expectation of future conditions 
an increase in warranty claims or in the costs associated with servicing those claims would result in an increase in the accrual and a decrease in gross profit 
discontinued operations we have classified certain facilities operations related to our mcs gas business see note of the consolidated financial statements as discontinued operations in accordance with sfas no 
sfas no 
established accounting and reporting standards requiring that long lived assets to be disposed of be reported as discontinued operations if management has committed to a plan to dispose of the asset under usual and customary terms within one year of establishing the plan 
subsequent to the initial one year period  the company follows the guidance of eitf  accounting for certain events not addressed in issue no 
relating to an acquired operating unit to be sold 
litigation and others contingencies we regularly evaluate our exposure to threatened or pending litigation and other business contingencies 
because of the uncertainties related to the amount of loss from litigation and other business contingencies  the recording of losses relating to such exposures requires significant judgment about the potential range of outcomes 
we are not presently affected by any litigation or other contingencies that have had  or are currently anticipated to have  a material impact on our results of operations or financial position 
as additional information about current or future litigation or other contingencies becomes available  we will assess whether such information warrants the recording of additional expense relating to these contingencies 
to be recorded as expense  a loss contingency must generally be both probable and measurable 
if a loss contingency is material but is not both probable and estimable  we will disclose it in notes to the financial statements 
recent accounting pronouncements in june  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued sfas no

the scope of sfas no 
also includes costs related to terminating a contract that is not a capital lease  and termination benefits that employees who are involuntarily terminated receive under the terms of a one time benefit arrangement that is not an ongoing benefit arrangement or an individual deferred compensation contract 
the company does not believe that the adoption of sfas no 
will have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements 
in november  the fasb issued interpretation no 
fin  guarantor s accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees  including indirect guarantees of indebtedness of others  an interpretation of fasb statements no 
  and and rescission of fasb interpretation no 
fin relates to the accounting for and disclosure of guarantees and addresses an obligation to stand ready to perform over the term of the guarantee in the event that the specified triggering events or conditions occur and a contingent obligation to make future payments if those triggering events or conditions occur 
fin excludes certain types of guarantees from its initial recognition and measurement  including guarantees accounted for as derivative instruments and hedging activities  guarantees relating to performance of non financial assets that are owned by the guaranteed party eg  product warranties  guarantees issued in a business combination that represents contingent consideration  and others 
they are subject to its disclosure requirements
