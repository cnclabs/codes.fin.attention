overview oakley is an innovation driven designer  manufacturer and distributor of consumer products that include high performance eyewear  footwear  watches  apparel and accessories 
the company s products are sold in the united states through a carefully selected base of approximately  active accounts with approximately  locations comprised of optical stores  sunglass retailers and specialty sports stores  including bike  surf  ski and golf shops  and motorcycle  athletic footwear and sporting goods stores and limited department store distribution 
the company also operates oakley retail stores in the united states that offer the full range of oakley products 
in november  the company acquired iacon  inc  a sunglass retailing chain headquartered in scottsdale  arizona  with sunglass specialty retail stores at december  internationally  the company sells its products in over countries outside the united states  with direct offices in france  germany  united kingdom  italy  japan  mexico  south africa  canada  australia  new zealand and brazil 
in those parts of the world not serviced by the company or its subsidiaries  oakley products are sold through distributors who possess local expertise 
these distributors sell the company s products either exclusively or with complementary  non competing products and agree to respect the marketing philosophy and practices of the company 
sales to the company s distributors are denominated in us dollars 
the company is exposed to gains and losses resulting from fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates relating to transactions of its international subsidiaries 
the company and its subsidiaries use foreign exchange contracts in the form of forward contracts to manage the level of exposure to the risk of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates 
significant accounting policies and certain risks and uncertainties the company s historical success is attributable  in part  to its introduction of products which are perceived to represent an improvement in performance over products available in the market 
the company s future success will depend  in part  upon its continued ability to develop and introduce such innovative products  although there can be no assurance of the company s ability to do so 
the consumer products industry  including the eyewear  apparel  footwear and watch categories  is fragmented and highly competitive 
in order to retain its market share  the company must continue to be competitive in the areas of quality  technology  method of distribution  style  brand image  intellectual property protection and customer service 
these industries are subject to changing consumer preferences and shifts in consumer preferences may adversely affect companies that misjudge such preferences 
the company s consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
as such  the company is required to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent liabilities at the balance sheet dates and the reported amounts of revenue and expense during the reporting periods 
actual results could significantly differ from such estimates 
the company believes that the following discussion addresses the company s most significant accounting policies  which are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating the company s reported financial results 
revenue recognition the company recognizes revenue when merchandise is shipped to a customer 
generally  the company extends credit to its customers and does not require collateral 
the company performs ongoing credit evaluations of its customers and historic credit losses have been within management s expectations 
the company s shipping terms with all customers are fob shipping point 
sales agreements with dealers and distributors normally provide general payment terms of to days  depending on the product category 
although none of the company s sales agreements with any of its customers provides for any rights of return by the customer  except for product warranty related issues  the company occasionally accepts returns at its sole discretion 
the company records a provision for sales returns and claims based upon historical experience 
actual returns and claims in any future period may differ from the company s estimates 
in addition  although the company  at its sole discretion  may repurchase its own products to protect the company image  this practice is infrequent and  historically  the value of these repurchases has not been significant 
accounts receivable the company performs ongoing credit evaluations of its customers and adjusts credit limits based upon payment history and the customer s current creditworthiness  as determined by the company s review of their current credit information 
the company continuously monitors its customer collections and payments and maintains a provision for estimated credit losses based upon the company s historical experience and any specific customer collection issues that have been identified 
while such credit losses have historically been within the expectations and the provisions established by the company  there can be no assurances that the company will continue to experience the same credit loss rates that have been experienced in the past 
inventories inventories are stated at the lower of cost to purchase and or manufacture the inventory or the current estimated market value of the inventory 
the company regularly reviews its inventory quantities on hand and records a provision for excess and obsolete inventory based primarily on the company s estimated forecast of product demand and production requirements 
as experienced in  demand for the company s products can fluctuate significantly 
factors which could affect demand for the company s products include unanticipated changes in general market conditions or other factors  which may result in cancellations of advance orders or a reduction in the rate of reorders placed by retailers  continued weakening of economic conditions  which could reduce demand for products sold by the company and which could adversely affect profitability  and future terrorist acts or war  or the threat thereof  which could adversely affect consumer confidence and spending  interrupt production and distribution of product and raw materials and  as a result  adversely affect the company s operations and financial performance 
additionally  management s estimates of future product demand may be inaccurate  which could result in an understated or overstated provision required for excess and obsolete inventory 
long lived assets in the normal course of business  the company acquires tangible and intangible assets 
the company periodically evaluates the recoverability of the carrying amount of its long lived assets including property  plant and equipment  and other intangible assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be fully recoverable 
an impairment is assessed when the undiscounted expected future cash flows derived from an asset are less than its carrying amount 
impairments are recognized in operating earnings 
the company uses its best judgment based on the most current facts and circumstances surrounding its business when applying these impairment rules to determine the timing of the impairment test  the undiscounted cash flows used to assess impairments  and the fair value of a potentially impaired asset 
changes in assumptions used could have a significant impact on the company s assessment of recoverability 
numerous factors  including changes in the company s business  industry segment  and global economy  could significantly impact management s decision to retain  dispose of  or idle certain of its long lived assets 
goodwill the company evaluates the recoverability of goodwill at least annually based on a two step impairment test 
the first step compares the fair value of each reporting unit with its carrying amount  including goodwill 
if the carrying amount exceeds fair value  then the second step of the impairment test is performed to measure the amount of any impairment loss 
fair value is determined based on estimated future cash flows  discounted at a rate that approximates the company s cost of capital 
such estimates are subject to change and the company may be required to recognize impairments losses in the future 
warranties the company provides a one year limited warranty against manufacturer s defects in its eyewear 
all authentic oakley watches are warranted for one year against manufacturer s defects when purchased from an authorized oakley watch dealer 
footwear is warranted for days against manufacturer s defects  and apparel is warranted for days against manufacturer s defects 
the company s standard warranties require the company to repair or replace defective product returned to the company during such warranty period 
while warranty costs have historically been within the company s expectations  there can be no assurance that the company will continue to experience the same warranty return rates or repair costs as in the prior years 
a significant increase in product return rates  or a significant increase in the costs to repair product  could have a material adverse impact on the company s operating results 
income taxes current income tax expense is the amount of income taxes expected to be payable for the current year 
a deferred income tax asset or liability is established for the expected future consequences of temporary differences in the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities 
the company considers future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the value of its deferred tax assets 
if the company determines that it is more likely than not that these assets will not be realized  the company would reduce the value of these assets to their expected realizable value  thereby decreasing net income 
evaluating the value of these assets is necessarily based on the company s judgment 
if the company subsequently determined that the deferred tax assets  which had been written down  would be realized in the future  the value of the deferred tax assets would be increased  thereby increasing net income in the period when that determination was made 
see note in notes to consolidated financial statements 
foreign currency translation the company has direct operations in continental europe  united kingdom  japan  canada  mexico  south africa  australia  new zealand and brazil which collect at future dates in the customers local currencies and purchase finished goods in us dollars 
accordingly  the company is exposed to transaction gains and losses that could result from changes in foreign currency 
assets and liabilities of the company denominated in foreign currencies are translated at the rate of exchange on the balance sheet date 
revenues and expenses are translated using the average exchange rate for the period 
gains and losses from translation of foreign subsidiary financial statements are included in accumulated other comprehensive income 
gains and losses on short term intercompany foreign currency transactions are recognized as incurred 
as part of the company s overall strategy to manage its level of exposure to the risk of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates  the company and its subsidiaries have entered into various foreign exchange contracts in the form of forward contracts 
see note in notes to consolidated financial statements 
vulnerability due to supplier concentrations the company relies on a single source for the supply of several components  including the uncoated lens blanks from which substantially all of its sunglass lenses are cut 
in the event of the loss of its source for lens blanks  the company has identified an alternate source which may be available 
the effect of the loss of any of these sources including any possible disruption in business will depend primarily upon the length of time necessary to find a suitable alternative source and could have a material adverse effect on the company s business 
there can be no assurance that  if necessary  an additional source of supply for lens blanks or other critical materials can be located or developed in a timely manner 
vulnerability due to customer concentrations net sales to sunglass hut accounted for approximately  and of the company s net sales for the years ended december   and  respectively 
in april  luxottica  one of the company s largest competitors  acquired sunglass hut and implemented changes which adversely affected the company s net sales to sunglass hut in in december  the company and luxottica entered into a new three year commercial agreement for the distribution of oakley products through sunglass hut retail stores 
the agreement applies to sunglass hut locations in the united states  canada  the united kingdom and ireland  and marked the resumption of the business relationship between the two companies  which had been substantially reduced since august  oakley and luxottica also have resumed their business together on mutually agreed terms for the markets not specifically covered by this new agreement 
the arrangements between the companies do not obligate luxottica to order product from the company  and there can be no assurances as to the future of the relationship between the company and luxottica 
commitments and contingencies the company has entered into operating leases  primarily for facilities and retail stores  and has commitments under endorsement contracts with selected athletes and others who endorse the company s products 
minimum future payments under these leases and endorsement contracts are identified in note in notes to consolidated financial statements

sunglass unit sales were   and  for the years ended december   and  respectively 
year ended december  compared to year ended december  net sales net sales increased to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december   an increase of million  or 
one factor contributing to the growth in net sales was a increase in gross sunglass sales 
gross sunglass sales were million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  the growth in gross sunglass sales is composed of a increase in average selling price slightly offset by a decrease in sunglass unit volume 
the increase in average selling price is attributable to the continued shift in product mix to more technical and premium priced items  the weakening of the us dollar  increasing contribution from the company s retail stores and the impact of a retail price increase in north america on most sunglasses in july several factors contributed to the unit decline including soft consumer spending and reduced demand attributable to the weak retail environment  especially in the latter half of the year 
in addition  delayed deliveries of summer sunglass introductions to retailers resulted in fewer inventory turns during the summer selling season and a reduction of the level of reorders during the holiday season 
the delayed deliveries were a result of key raw material shortages caused in part by greater increases in summer demand than originally anticipated 
in addition  sunglass hut s return as a customer negatively impacted demand from the company s other retailers in the fourth quarter  compared to the prior year period when sunglass hut was not purchasing oakley products 
the increase in gross sunglass sales was driven by strong sunglass sales of the company s newer sunglasses such as the half jacket  splice  wire tap  and half wire  introduced in  the switch and e wire  introduced in  and the square wire introduced in  offsetting declines in sales of more mature products 
sales of the company s polarized styles for the year ended december  also contributed to the increase in gross sales with a  or million  increase over the year ended december  gross sales from the company s newer product categories  comprised of footwear  apparel  watches and prescription eyewear  represented of the company s total gross sales for  compared to in sales from these newer product categories increased  or million  to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  apparel gross sales increased to million in  compared with million in prescription eyewear revenue doubled in each of the three years prior to in  prescription eyewear gross sales grew to million in  compared to million in footwear gross sales grew to million in over million in the growth rate for the company s footwear business was more modest when compared to the other newer categories due to reduced orders and limited distribution for the company s fall footwear line 
watch gross sales increased to million in  compared to million in management believes these increases are a result of its expanded product lines  expanded distribution and retail initiatives  including its greater dealer base  and increasing consumer acceptance of the company s newer categories 
the company s total us net sales increased for the year ended december  to million from million in excluding the company s retail store operations  us net sales increased to million in the year ended december  from million in  as a result of a increase in sales to the company s largest us customer  sunglass hut  coupled with a increase in net sales to the company s broad specialty store account base and other domestic sales 
sales to sunglass hut increased million to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  in april  luxottica  one of the company s largest competitors  acquired sunglass hut  and implemented changes which adversely affected the company s net sales to sunglass hut in the latter half of in december  the company and luxottica entered into a new three year commercial agreement for the distribution of oakley products through sunglass hut retail stores which marked the resumption of the business relationship between the two companies 
net sales from the company s retail store operations  including iacon acquired on october   were million for the year ended december   up from million for the year ended december   an increase of million 
during the year ended december   the company added new iacon stores  bringing the total stores to at december   and eight new oakley stores  bringing the total to retail sales represented of total net sales for and are expected to represent an increasing percentage of sales in the future when compared to prior periods 
during the year ended december   the company s international net sales increased  or million  to million from million during the year ended december  on a constant dollar basis  international sales grew for the year ended december  when compared to the year ended december  although the company s international sales during the year have been impacted by weak retail environments  especially in europe and japan  all major markets other than latin america experienced growth during the year 
during the second quarter of  international net sales were more adversely affected than us net sales by the sunglass delivery issues discussed above due to the longer lead times required for delivery outside the united states 
in addition  the company s european sunglass sales were impacted by competitive pressures from strong fashion brands 
latin america experienced a large decrease in net sales in the period due to delays in the transition to direct distribution in brazil from the previous independent distributor and overall weak economic conditions in the region 
sales from the company s direct international offices represented of total international sales for  compared to for gross profit gross profit increased to million  or of net sales  for the year ended december  from million  or of net sales  for the year ended december   an increase of million  or 
the decrease in gross profit as a percentage of net sales reflects higher overall sales discounts  coupled with a lower concentration of sunglass and prescription eyewear products relative to sales of lower gross margin product categories 
iacon sales of sunglass brands other than oakley  as well as the associated occupancy costs  have also had a negative impact on the company s year over year gross margin comparison due to iacon being included for only two months of the comparable period 
foreign exchange had a favorable impact on gross margin relative to the comparable period 
the company s footwear margins were lower in when compared to due to successful efforts to reduce inventory levels of prior season close out products at reduced margins  increased tooling costs per unit and provisions for slow moving inventory 
operating expenses in december  the company announced plans to restructure its european operations with significant changes to the regional sales and distribution organization 
as part of this plan  relationships with several outside sales agents have been modified or terminated  and changes are being implemented to rationalize other warehousing and distribution functions within the european markets which resulted in a million pre tax charge to selling and shipping and warehousing expenses

this increase was a result of i increased sales salaries primarily due to the increased retail operations  ii increased sports marketing expenses primarily for footwear and apparel and iii displays and display depreciation to support the new distribution initiatives  partially offset by reduced commissions due to a realigned commission structure 
as a percentage of net sales  selling expenses excluding the restructure charge remained at of net sales for the year ended december  shipping and warehousing expenses as a percentage of net sales decreased to of net sales for the year ended december  from of net sales for the year ended december  excluding million related to the european restructuring charge  shipping and warehousing expenses as a percentage of sales decreased to of net sales for the year ended december  from of net sales for the year ended december  as the company leveraged its shipping expenses over higher sales

year ended december  compared to year ended december  net sales net sales increased to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december   an increase of million  or 
the increase in net sales was attributable to several factors  including a  or million  increase in gross sunglass sales 
gross sunglass sales were million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  for  the company experienced a decrease in sunglass unit volume and a increase in average selling prices 
the increase in gross sunglass sales was driven by strong sunglass sales of the company s wire products including the square wire  c wire  and a wire  straight jacket  twenty xx  minute  x metal line  and the company s polarized styles  as well as strong sales of new products offsetting declines in sales of more mature products 
new sunglass introductions in  which include the why  introduced in march  the four s  introduced in april  e wire  introduced in may  scar and x metal penny  introduced in june  switch  introduced in september  and fives  introduced in november  contributed to the increase in sales  and as a group  represented of the company s gross sunglass sales 
however  the content of new sunglass sales as a percent of total sunglass sales was below the company s historical levels 
the company believes new sunglass product sales were negatively affected by the temporary disruption in its relationship with luxottica s sunglass hut retail chain and the impact of the tragic events of september th on consumer travel and spending patterns 
sales from the company s newer product categories  comprised of footwear  apparel  watches and prescription eyewear  continued to grow with gross sales increasing  or million  to million  or of gross sales  for the year ended december  compared to million  or of gross sales  for the year ended december  footwear gross sales grew to million in compared to million in apparel sales increased to million in from million in watch sales increased million  to million for over million for sales of the company s prescription products more than doubled to million in from million in management believes these increases were a result of its expanded product lines  and expanded distribution and retail initiatives  including its greater dealer base 
the company s us net sales increased to million in from million in  principally as a result of a increase in net sales to the company s broad specialty store account base and other us sales  while sales to the company s largest us customer  sunglass hut  decreased to million in from million in see discussion regarding sunglass hut in principal customers above 
the company s retail store sales also contributed to the increase in us net sales by increasing to million in from million in during  international net sales surpassed us net sales for the first time in the company s history with an increase of to million in from million in the increase was driven by continued strength in almost all regions of the world in which the company sells its products  with the strongest growth in europe  japan  latin america  asia and canada 
the only region that showed a decline in net sales was australia new zealand 
additionally  in  sales in this region benefited from the sydney olympics 
sales from the company s direct international offices represented of total international sales for  compared to for on a constant dollar basis  international sales increased approximately for over during the fourth quarter of  the company experienced a year over year decline in international sales due to weak consumer environment in major markets  especially those highly dependent on leisure travel activity 
in addition  sales in australia and new zealand  one of the company s largest international markets  were negatively impacted by the disruption in sunglass hut shipments  magnifying the difficult comparisons to the prior year s fourth quarter sales  which benefited from the sydney olympics 
gross profit gross profit increased to million  or of net sales  for the year ended december   from million  or of net sales  for the year ended december   an increase of million  or 
the decrease in gross profit as a percentage of net sales is attributable in part to product mix changes as the company experienced an increased sales contribution from the lower gross margin categories of footwear  apparel and goggles and higher sunglass production costs per unit due to the reduced production volumes associated with the sunglass hut disruption and increased material and labor costs due to the production of more complex multi layered lens products  as well as a higher percentage of polarized lens products

shipping and warehousing expenses increased to million  or of net sales  in from million  or of net sales  for this increase is principally due to the increased mix of new product category sales with higher average shipping costs in addition to set up costs for the us apparel and footwear distribution center in ontario  california and the costs of the company s third party warehouses in japan and europe 
general and administrative expenses increased million to million  or of net sales  in from million  or of net sales  in this increase in general and administrative expenses was principally a result of increased personnel related costs and infrastructure and information technology costs necessary to manage the company s growth 
operating income the company s operating income decreased to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december   a decrease of million 
as a percentage of net sales  operating income decreased to in from  in as a result of the factors discussed above 
interest expense  net the company had net interest expense of million in  as compared with net interest expense of million in the increase in interest expense is due to greater average balances on the company s line of credit which was used to finance the company s growth as well as the company s share repurchase programs in  partially offset by lower average interest rates

in thousands net sales      gross profit      historically  the company s aggregate sales have been highest in the period from march to september  the period during which sunglass use is typically highest in the northern hemisphere 
as a result  operating margins are typically lower in the first and fourth quarters  as fixed operating costs are spread over lower sales volume 
in anticipation of seasonal increases in demand  the company typically builds sunglass inventories in the fourth quarter and first quarter when net sales have historically been lower
