sales at jack in the box company operated restaurants open more than one fiscal year same store sales declined in and in compared with the respective prior year 
these declines are primarily due to increased competitive activity and economic softness in certain markets  which were offset in part by new product introductions  including our new line of premium salads  and modest selling price increases 
we continue to address pressures facing the quick service restaurant industry and make changes that we anticipate will improve sales and provide long term growth potential 
in  these changes included the addition of upgraded products to our menu and improvements in restaurant operations  including speed of service  order accuracy and menu appearance 
on the strength of these product introductions and operations improvements  same store sales increased in the fourth quarter of compared with the fourth quarter of distribution and other sales include distribution sales to jack in the box and qdoba franchise operated restaurants and sales from our fuel and convenience stores quick stuff 
distribution and other sales grew to million in from million in and million in  principally due to increases in the number of quick stuff locations and distribution sales to franchised restaurants 
the number of quick stuff locations at the end of the fiscal year grew to in from in and nine in distribution sales to franchised restaurants grew due to an increase in the number of jack in the box franchises serviced by our distribution centers  as well as the addition of certain qdoba franchised restaurants in higher psa fuel sales also contributed to the overall increase in franchise rents and royalties increased to million in from million in and million in  primarily reflecting an increase in the number of jack in the box franchised restaurants 
the number of jack in the box franchised restaurants increased to at the end of the fiscal year from in and in as a percentage of franchise restaurant sales  franchise rents and royalties were  and in  and  respectively 
the slight percentage decline in is primarily due to the consolidation of qdoba s results of operations in in  qdoba received royalties of of franchise restaurant sales  and jack in the box had combined average rents and royalties of 
in  the percentage growth compared with primarily relates to increases in rents at certain franchised restaurants 
other revenues include gains and fees from the conversion of jack in the box company operated restaurants to franchises  as well as interest income from notes and investments receivable 
other revenues increased to million in from million in and million in  primarily due to our continued strategy of selectively converting jack in the box company operated restaurants to franchises 
we converted company operated restaurants in compared with in and in  resulting in franchise gains of million  million and million  respectively 
costs and expenses restaurant costs of sales  which include food and packaging costs  increased to million in from million in and million in as a percentage of restaurant sales  costs of sales were in  in and in the percentage increase in compared with principally resulted from higher food and packaging costs associated with the initial rollout of jack s ultimate saladstm in the third quarter 
these cost increases were offset in part by certain margin improvement initiatives and modest selling price increases 
restaurant costs of sales as a percentage of restaurant sales improved in compared to  as the impact of slightly higher ingredient costs was offset by increased selling prices and certain margin improvement initiatives 
restaurant operating costs grew with the addition of company operated restaurants to million  million and million in  and  respectively 
as a percentage of restaurant sales  operating costs increased to in from in and in the percentage increase in compared with was primarily due to higher workers compensation insurance expenses  utilities and costs related to our new point of sale system 
these cost increases were partially offset by decreases in incentive compensation and intangibles amortization expense attributable to the reclassification of our trading area rights to goodwill  which is no longer amortized per the provisions of sfas  goodwill and other intangible assets 
restaurant operating costs as a percentage of restaurant sales increased in compared with  primarily due to higher insurance costs and occupancy costs on newer stores whose sales had not yet matured  which were partially offset by lower utility and supply costs 
additionally  in and  savings generated from our profit improvement program helped to offset the percent of sales impact on occupancy and other fixed costs from same store sales declines at jack in the box company operated restaurants 
insurance expenses and costs associated with the new point of sale system are expected to continue at higher levels in fiscal year costs of distribution and other sales were million in  million in and million in as a percentage of distribution and other sales  these costs were in  in and in the higher percentage in compared with is primarily due to a change in our fuel pricing strategy designed to achieve higher sales volumes at certain quick stuff locations 
continuing reductions in quick stuff labor costs and other profit improvement initiatives partially offset the impact of lower fuel margins 
in  distribution margins remained constant compared with the cost percentage increased in compared with  primarily due to reduced margins in our distribution business related to softer sales at jack in the box restaurants 
franchised restaurant costs  principally rent expense and depreciation on properties leased to jack in the box franchisees and other miscellaneous costs  increased to million in from million in and million in  primarily reflecting an increase in the number of franchised restaurants 
selling  general and administrative expenses were million  million and million in  and  respectively 
these expenses were approximately of revenues in  in and in in  cost reduction initiatives from our profit improvement program  lower incentive bonus expense and the benefit provided from higher other revenues more than offset higher pension costs and the reduction in jack in the box same store sales 
in  higher pension  bonus and legal costs were mitigated in part by the increased leverage from higher revenues as well as savings generated from our profit improvement program 
pension costs have increased due to declines in discount rates and in the return on plan assets  and these costs are expected to increase further in fiscal year fiscal year includes an unusual charge of million related to the assumption of certain lease obligations arising from the recent bankruptcy of the chi chi s restaurant chain  which was previously owned by the company 
the company anticipates it will not incur any additional charges related to the chi chi s bankruptcy in future years 
fiscal year also includes unusual charges of million to settle a class action lawsuit in california  and million for impairment and lease exit costs related to the closure of eight under performing restaurants 
excluding these unusual charges  which were and of revenues in and  respectively  selling  general and administrative expenses were approximately of revenues in  in and in the company believes it is useful to provide the impact that the unusual items in and had on selling  general and administrative expenses because it facilitates more relevant comparisons to prior period financial results and to the results of the company s competitors 
interest expense was million  million and million in  and  respectively 
interest expense in compared with includes costs associated with the early retirement of our higher interest rate financing lease obligations  the amortization of fees associated with the company s refinancing in january  and an increase in total debt  primarily due to the acquisition of qdoba 
the reduction in interest expense in compared with reflects lower average levels of debt and lower average interest rates 
the income tax provisions reflect effective annual tax rates of  and of pre tax earnings in  and  respectively 
the lower rates in and resulted from the favorable resolutions of long standing tax matters 
in  the favorable tax rate resulted from our ability to realize previously unrecognized tax benefits  including business tax credit  tax loss and minimum tax credit carryforwards 
our effective tax rate is expected to be higher in fiscal in  we adopted staff accounting bulletin sab which requires that we recognize certain franchise percentage rents  which are contingent upon certain annual sales levels  in the period in which the contingency is met instead of being accrued for ratably 
as a result of adopting sab  we recorded a one time after tax cumulative effect from this accounting change of million related to the deferral of franchise percentage rents not yet earned as of the beginning of fiscal year net earnings were million  or per diluted share  in  million  or per diluted share  in and million  or per diluted share  in each year includes unusual items as described above 
in  net earnings included million  or

per diluted share  for costs associated with the settlement of a class action lawsuit in california and the closure of eight under performing restaurants 
in  net earnings included million  or 
per diluted share  for the cumulative effect of the sab accounting change 
excluding all of these unusual items  net earnings were million  or per diluted share  in  million  or per diluted share  in  and million  or per diluted share  in the company believes it is useful to provide the impact that the unusual items in each year had on net earnings and earnings per share amounts because it facilitates more relevant comparisons to prior period financial results and to the results of the company s competitors 
liquidity and capital resources general 
cash and cash equivalents increased million to million at september  from million at the beginning of the fiscal year due to a temporary increase in cash balances  principally resulting from reductions in capital expenditures from savings in new store build out costs and from leasing a greater portion of our new restaurants 
we generally expect to maintain low levels of cash and cash equivalents  reinvesting available cash flows from operations to develop new or enhance existing restaurants  and to reduce borrowings under the revolving credit agreement 
at september   we had no borrowings under our revolving credit facility 
financial condition 
our working capital deficit decreased million to million at september  from million at september  this decrease is primarily due to the temporary increase in our cash balance at the end of the fiscal year  the reclassification of our revolving credit facility to long term debt and the repayment of financing lease obligations in january the company and the restaurant industry in general  maintain relatively low levels of accounts receivable and inventories  and vendors grant trade credit for purchases such as food and supplies 
we also continually invest in our business through the addition of new units and refurbishment of existing units  which are reflected as long term assets and not as part of working capital 
at the end of the year  our current ratio was to compared with to at september   improving due to our high cash balance  the credit facility reclassification and debt repayment discussed above 
on january   we replaced our existing revolving credit facility with a new senior credit facility 
our new credit facility provides for borrowings in the aggregate amount of million and is comprised of i a million revolving credit facility maturing on january  with a rate of london interbank offered rate libor plus and ii a million term loan maturing on july  with a rate of libor plus 
this new credit facility requires the payment of an annual commitment fee based on the unused portion of the credit facility 
the credit facility s interest rates and the annual commitment rate are based on a financial leverage ratio  as defined in the credit agreement 
to secure our respective obligations under the new credit facility  the company and certain of its subsidiaries granted liens on substantially all personal property assets 
under certain circumstances  the company and each of its certain subsidiaries will be required to grant liens on certain real property assets to secure their respective obligations under the new credit facility 
additionally  certain of our real and personal property secure other indebtedness of the company 
at september   we had no borrowings under our revolving credit facility and had letters of credit outstanding of million 
we are subject to a number of customary covenants under our various debt instruments  including limitations on additional borrowings  acquisitions  loans to franchisees  capital expenditures  lease commitments and dividend payments  as well as requirements to maintain certain financial ratios  cash flows and net worth 
as of september   we were in compliance with all such covenants 
total debt outstanding increased to million at september  from million at the beginning of the fiscal year  primarily reflecting our acquisition of qdoba which was funded by borrowings under our new credit facility 
new financing 
in december  we began efforts to secure a new million senior secured term loan and to amend our existing revolving credit facility 
we intend to use the proceeds from the new term loan to refinance our existing million term loan and redeem million of senior subordinated notes due april  the amended revolving credit facility will continue to support general corporate purposes 
we believe the new credit facility will provide a more flexible capital structure  including extension of the maturities of both our revolver and term loan  facilitate the execution of our strategic plan  and decrease borrowing costs 
while management is confident about the prospects for the new credit facility  no assurance can be given that the facility can be arranged on terms and conditions acceptable to the company 
in the event that we are unable to obtain this new facility on acceptable terms  the current facility will remain in place  and we believe it is adequate to support the company s current operations and anticipated growth 
other transactions 
in january  we entered into financing lease arrangements with two limited partnerships the partnerships  in which we sold interests in restaurants for a specified period of time 
the acquisition of the properties  including costs and expenses  was funded through the issuance of million in senior secured notes by a special purpose corporation acting as agent for the partnerships 
on august   we entered into an agreement to repurchase the interests in the restaurant properties that had been encumbered by the financing lease obligations for a consent fee of million 
on january   we used borrowings under our credit facility and sinking fund payments to reacquire the interests in the restaurant properties and retire the high interest rate bearing financing lease obligations 
during the last three years we have continued our strategy of selectively converting company operated restaurants to franchises 
in  and  these conversions generated cash proceeds of approximately million  million and million  respectively 
in fiscal years and  our board of directors authorized the repurchase of our outstanding common stock in the open market for an aggregate amount not to exceed million 
under these authorizations  the company repurchased  shares of jack in the box common stock during fiscal year since the initiation of the share repurchase program in fiscal year through september   we acquired  shares at an aggregate cost of million  and at september  we had no repurchase availability remaining 
the stock repurchase program was intended to increase shareholder value and offset the dilutive effect of stock option exercises 
on january   we acquired qdoba  operator and franchiser of qdoba mexican grill  for approximately million in cash 
the primary assets acquired include million in net property and equipment and other long term assets  million in intangible assets and million in goodwill 
qdoba operates in the fast casual segment of the restaurant industry and  as of september   operated or franchised restaurants in states 
this acquisition is consistent with the company s long term strategy to transition from a regional quick service restaurant chain to a national restaurant company 
contractual obligations and commitments 
the following is a summary of the company s contractual obligations and commercial commitments as of september  payments due by period in thousands less than after total year years years years contractual obligations credit facility term loan     revolving credit facility capital lease obligations      other long term debt obligations 
    operating lease obligations      guarantees  total contractual obligations      other commercial commitments stand by letters of credit   consists of guarantees associated with two chi chi s properties 
due to the bankruptcy of the chi chi s restaurant chain  previously owned by the company  we are obligated to perform in accordance with the terms of the guarantee agreements and have begun making lease payments in connection with these two properties effective october  consists primarily of letters of credit for workers compensation and general liability insurance 
capital expenditures 
capital expenditures decreased million to million in from million in this decrease relates to lower expenditures on new restaurants  reflecting a reduction in the number of new jack in the box restaurant openings to in from a year ago  as well as cost savings generated on our restaurant prototypes 
furthermore  we purchased fewer new sites in compared with  as the company is now leasing a greater portion of its new restaurants due to favorable lease terms 
we plan on spending approximately million during fiscal year on capital expenditures 
the projected increase from fiscal reflects an increase in qdoba restaurant growth  spending related to our strategy to re invent the jack in the box brand and costs associated with our new innovation center which will support our product marketing  research and development and quality assurance departments 
these increases are partially offset by a decrease in new restaurant expenditures reflecting a reduction in the number of new jack in the box restaurant openings in fiscal year pension funding 
due to the downturn in the equity markets over the past two years  the market value of our pension plan assets have declined 
additionally  lower interest rates and a reduction in our assumed long term rate of return on plan assets have contributed to an increase in our accumulated benefit plan obligation during a minimum pension liability adjustment is required when the accumulated benefit obligation exceeds the fair value of plan assets at the measurement date 
as such  we were required to recognize an additional minimum pension liability at september  and september  the additional liability recognized in both years  resulted in a cumulative charge to other comprehensive income in the consolidated statements of stockholders equity of million  an increase of million compared with a year ago when the company recorded a charge of million for similar reasons 
future liquidity 
we require capital principally to grow the business through new restaurant construction  as well as to maintain  improve and refurbish existing restaurants  and for general operating purposes 
our primary short term and long term sources of liquidity are expected to be cash flows from operations  the revolving bank credit facility  and the sale and leaseback of certain restaurant properties 
additional potential sources of liquidity include financing opportunities and the conversion of company operated restaurants to franchised restaurants 
based upon current levels of operations and anticipated growth  we expect that cash flows from operations  combined with other financing alternatives available  will be sufficient to meet our debt service  capital expenditure and working capital requirements 
discussion of critical accounting policies we have identified the following as the company s most critical accounting policies  which are those that are most important to the portrayal of the company s financial condition and results and require management s most subjective and complex judgments 
information regarding the company s other significant accounting policies are disclosed in note of our consolidated financial statements 
pension benefits the company sponsors pension and other retirement plans in various forms covering those employees who meet certain eligibility requirements 
several statistical and other factors which attempt to anticipate future events are used in calculating the expense and liability related to the plans  including assumptions about the discount rate  expected return on plan assets and the rate of increase in compensation levels  as determined by the company using specified guidelines 
in addition  our outside actuarial consultants also use certain statistical factors such as turnover  retirement and mortality rates to estimate the company s future benefit obligations 
the actuarial assumptions used may differ materially from actual results due to changing market and economic conditions  higher or lower turnover and retirement rates or longer or shorter life spans of participants 
these differences may impact the amount of pension expense recorded by the company 
due principally to decreases in interest rates and declines in the return on assets in the plans  the pension expense in fiscal year is expected to be approximately million higher than fiscal year self insurance the company is self insured for a portion of its current and prior years losses related to its workers compensation  general liability  automotive  medical and dental programs 
in estimating the company s self insurance reserves  we utilize independent actuarial estimates of expected losses  which are based on statistical analyses of historical data 
these assumptions are closely monitored and adjusted when warranted by changing circumstances 
should a greater amount of claims occur compared to what was estimated  or medical costs increase beyond what was expected  reserves might not be sufficient  and additional expense may be recorded 
long lived assets property  equipment and certain other assets are reviewed for impairment when indicators of impairment are present 
if the sum of undiscounted future cash flows is less than the carrying value of the asset  we recognize an impairment loss by the amount which the carrying value exceeds the fair value of the asset 
our estimates of future cash flows may differ from actual cash flows due to  among other things  economic conditions or changes in operating performance 
in the fourth quarter of fiscal year  we recorded million in impairment charges related to eight under performing restaurants scheduled for closure in fiscal year during the fourth quarter of  we determined that our fixed assets and finite life intangible assets were not impaired at september  goodwill and other intangibles we also evaluate goodwill and intangible assets not subject to amortization annually  or more frequently if indicators of impairment are present 
if the determined fair values of these assets are less than the related carrying amounts an impairment loss is recognized 
the methods we use to estimate fair value include future cash flow assumptions  which may differ from actual cash flows due to  among other things  economic conditions or changes in operating performance 
during the fourth quarter of  we reviewed the carrying value of our goodwill and indefinite life intangible assets and determined that no impairment existed as of september  allowances for doubtful accounts our trade receivables consist primarily of amounts due from franchisees for rents on subleased sites  royalties and distribution sales 
we also have receivables related to short term financing provided on the sale of company operated restaurants to certain qualified franchisees 
we continually monitor amounts due from franchisees and maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our franchisees to make required payments 
this estimate is based on our assessment of the collectibility of specific franchisee accounts  as well as a general allowance based on historical trends  the financial condition of our franchisees  consideration of the general economy and the aging of such receivables 
the company has good relationships with its franchisees and high collection rates  however  if the future financial condition of our franchisees were to deteriorate  resulting in their inability to make specific required payments  additions to the allowance for doubtful accounts may be required 
legal accruals the company is subject to claims and lawsuits in the ordinary course of its business 
a determination of the amount accrued  if any  for these contingencies is made after analysis of each matter 
we continually evaluate such accruals and may increase or decrease accrued amounts as we deem appropriate 
future accounting changes in january  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued interpretation  consolidation of variable interest entities an interpretation of accounting research bulletin no 
which requires companies that control another entity through interests other than voting interests to consolidate the controlled entity 
this interpretation applies immediately to variable interest entities created after january  for variable interest entities that existed prior to february   the fasb has delayed the requirements of this interpretation until the first fiscal year or interim period ending after december  the company has assessed the impact that interpretation may have on its consolidated financial statements  and concluded that the continued consolidation of the company s marketing funds is appropriate 
based on a review of the franchise agreements and after considering the policies and procedures the company has in place related to franchising activities  the company has determined that the franchise arrangements entered into after january  do not result in these franchises qualifying as variable interest entities  and as such  consolidation of these franchises is not required 
we will continue to monitor this literature to determine if any changes will have an impact on the company 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our primary exposure relating to financial instruments is to changes in interest rates 
our credit facility  which is comprised of a revolving credit facility and a term loan  bears interest at an annual rate equal to the prime rate or the libor plus an applicable margin based on a financial leverage ratio 
the majority of the credit facility borrowings are libor based 
as of september   our applicable margins for the libor based revolving loans and term loan were set at and  respectively 
a hypothetical one percent increase in short term interest rates  based on the outstanding balance of our revolving credit facility and term loan at september   would result in a reduction of million in annual pre tax earnings 
changes in interest rates also impact our pension expense  as do changes in the expected long term rate of return on our pension plan assets 
an assumed discount rate is used in determining the present value of future cash outflows currently expected to be required to satisfy the pension benefit obligation when due 
additionally  an assumed long term rate of return on plan assets is used in determining the average rate of earnings expected on the funds invested or to be invested to provide the benefits to meet our projected benefit obligation 
a hypothetical basis point reduction in the assumed discount rate and expected long term rate of return on plan assets would result in an estimated increase of million and million  respectively  in our future annual pension expense 
we are also exposed to the impact of commodity and utility price fluctuations related to unpredictable factors such as weather and various other market conditions outside our control 
our ability to recover increased costs through higher prices is limited by the competitive environment in which we operate 
from time to time we enter into futures and option contracts to manage these fluctuations 
open futures and option contracts at september  were not significant 
at september   we had no other material financial instruments subject to significant market exposure
