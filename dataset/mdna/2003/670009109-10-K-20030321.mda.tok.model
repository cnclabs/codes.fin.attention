item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with noven and novogyne s financial statements and the related notes included in this form k 
general from our inception in through  we engaged primarily in the development of advanced transdermal and transmucosal drug delivery systems 
during this period  our revenues consisted primarily of amounts paid to us under license agreements with novartis and aventis 
beginning in  when our first generation transdermal estrogen delivery system received initial regulatory approvals  we derived a significant portion of our revenues from the sale of our products to our licensees  novartis and aventis 
novogyne and novartis in may  we formed novogyne with novartis to market and sell women s prescription healthcare products in the united states and canada 
novogyne markets vivelle  vivelle dot and combipatch in the united states 
the establishment of novogyne modified a prior relationship in which we had licensed to novartis the exclusive right to market vivelle in the united states and canada and had received royalties from novartis based upon novartis sales 
we hold a equity interest in novogyne  and novartis holds a equity interest 
under the terms of the joint venture agreements  we manufacture and supply vivelle  vivelle dot and combipatch to novogyne  perform marketing  sales and promotional activities  and receive royalties from novogyne based on novogyne s sales of certain of the products 
novartis distributes vivelle  vivelle dot and combipatch and provides certain other services to novogyne  including marketing to the managed care sector  legal  accounting and regulatory services 
our share of novogyne s income  after an annual million preferred return to novartis  increases as product sales increase  subject to a maximum of 
novogyne s income resulted in our recognition of million  million and million in income in  and  respectively 
the income we recognize from novogyne is a non cash item 
we receive cash from novogyne in the form of cash distributions declared by novogyne s management committee 
the amount of cash that we receive from novogyne in any period may not be the same as the amount of income we recognize from novogyne for that period 
in  and  we received million  million and million in distributions from novogyne based upon novogyne s results of operations for the years ended december   and  respectively 
we invested all of the distributions we received in from novogyne  plus an additional million  in novogyne to fund our portion of the payments associated with the combipatch license transaction 
these investments did not increase our share of novogyne s equity 
we expect that a significant portion of our earnings and cash flow for the next several years will be generated through our interest in novogyne  but we cannot assure you of novogyne s future profitability or cash distributions 
see novogyne s audited financial statements included herein 
novogyne acquired the exclusive united states marketing rights to combipatch in march in a series of transactions involving novogyne  noven  novartis and aventis 
in the 
table of contents transaction  novogyne paid aventis million at closing  plus an additional million  which was due in four quarterly installments of million  with the final payment made in march as a consequence of the transaction and under the terms of our existing license agreement with aventis  we received million from aventis  which amount was deferred and recognized as license revenue over ten years beginning in the first quarter of see products transdermal combination estrogen progestin delivery system above for a more complete description of the transaction 
novogyne s relaunch of combipatch in may did not meaningfully increase total prescriptions  and since the publication of the hrt studies described below  prescriptions for combipatch have declined 
if novogyne is unable to increase combipatch prescriptions  novogyne s growth may slow and its contribution to our earnings and cash flow may be reduced 
any failure by novogyne to remain profitable or to continue to make distributions could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition 
under the terms of the novogyne joint venture  novartis is responsible for distribution of novogyne s products  including vivelle  and for selling novogyne s products to its trade customers 
novartis regularly reports inventory information to the novogyne management committee 
in the third quarter of  novartis reported that trade inventory levels of vivelle in the aggregate were higher than in prior periods and appeared to have grown to levels that exceeded current demand 
this situation has continued into during  vivelle returns also increased  and novogyne increased its reserve for sales allowances and returns 
based on information that we have received from novartis  we believe that current inventory levels at novogyne have increased and are higher than desirable in light of our trade customers current and expected demand 
to align inventories with demand  novogyne is curtailing product shipments to its trade customers  and we are deferring product shipments to novogyne 
these actions will adversely impact novogyne s and our financial results 
we expect that sales of novogyne s products in future periods will be adversely impacted as trade customers are expected to reduce their inventories and as novogyne and we take affirmative steps to attempt to reduce novogyne s inventory levels 
we also expect that our sales to novogyne  and our gross margin on those sales  will be adversely impacted  both as a result of an expected decline in orders from trade customers seeking to reduce their inventory levels which would reduce novogyne s sales and by novogyne s reduction of its higher than normal inventory levels which would reduce our sales to novogyne 
a further decline in prescriptions of novogyne s hrt products  whether as a result of the hrt studies  related product label changes  or otherwise  could further exacerbate this situation 
we are unable to predict either the timing or the magnitude of the impact of this situation on future sales and results of operations 
our supply agreement with novogyne for vivelle and vivelle dot expired in january the parties are negotiating an extension to the agreement 
since the expiration of the vivelle and vivelle dot supply agreement  the parties have continued to operate in accordance with the supply agreement s commercial terms  and we expect that the supply agreement will be extended on satisfactory terms 
however  we cannot assure that the agreement will be extended on satisfactory terms or at all 
failure to extend the supply agreement could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations  financial conditions and prospects 
designation of a new supplier and approval of a new supply agreement would require the affirmative vote of of the members of 
table of contents novogyne s management committee 
accordingly  novartis and we must agree on novogyne s supplier 
in november  we entered into an exclusive license agreement with novartis ag pursuant to which we granted novartis ag the right to market vivelle dot under the name estradot in all countries other than the united states  canada and japan 
we received a million license payment upon execution of the agreement 
for accounting purposes  the payment was deferred and is being recognized as license revenue over years beginning in the fourth quarter of noven subsequently received a million milestone payment that is being recognized as license revenue beginning in the first quarter of through the fourth quarter of under the terms of the agreement  novartis ag is responsible for seeking approval to market estradot in its territories 
the product has been approved for marketing in over foreign countries and the regulatory authorities of other countries are reviewing novartis registration applications 
novartis ag has launched the product in germany and a number of smaller countries 
however  novartis ag has informed us that pricing and reimbursement issues are adversely impacting its launch plans in many countries  including the united kingdom  france  spain and italy 
accordingly  we cannot assure that novartis ag will be successful in effecting additional registrations of estradot or that novartis ag will launch estradot in any particular country 
novartis ag markets several other transdermal hrt products in addition to our products  which may limit the efforts novartis ag devotes to our products 
in some countries  including the united kingdom and france  novartis ag is seeking a marketing partner to launch the product but to date has been unsuccessful 
we cannot assure that novartis ag will be successful in securing a marketing partner or in launching estradot in those countries 
hrt studies in july  the nih released data from its whi study on the risks and benefits associated with long term use of oral hrt by healthy women 
the nih announced that it was discontinuing the arm of the study investigating the use of oral estrogen progestin combination hrt products after an average follow up period of years because the oral hrt product used in the study was shown to cause an increase in the risk of invasive breast cancer 
the study also found an increased risk of stroke  heart attacks and blood clots and concluded that overall health risks exceeded benefits from use of the orally delivered combined estrogen plus progestin product among healthy postmenopausal women 
also in july  results of an observational study sponsored by the nci on the effects of ert were announced 
the main finding of the study was that postmenopausal women who used ert for or more years had a higher risk of developing ovarian cancer than women who never used hrt 
in october  a significant hrt study being conducted in the united kingdom was also halted 
our transdermal hrt products differ from the products used in the whi study and the primary products observed in the nci and united kingdom studies 
there are  however  no studies comparing the safety of our products against other hrt therapies 
although the range of consequences of these studies cannot be predicted  it is possible that they could result in a significant permanent decrease in the market for our hrt products  either as physicians withdraw their patients from hrt or as women elect to discontinue hrt on their own 
in addition  the market growth that would have been expected if hrt had been found safe and 
table of contents effective for additional indications  such as heart disease  is now unlikely to materialize 
in january  the fda announced that marketers of hrt products  including novogyne  are required to modify their hrt product labels to include additional safety information and warnings 
among other things  the labels must indicate that hrt should be used for short term therapy only and that  in the absence of clinical studies demonstrating that hrt products other than the oral product studied in the whi are safe  physicians should assume that all hrt products carry the same risks 
novartis has informed us that it intends to submit proposed revised labeling to the fda and to begin using the revised label at the time it reaches agreement with the fda on the language 
healthcare regulators also could delay the approval of new hrt products  such as those presently under development by novartis ag and us  or require that any new hrt products be subject to more extensive or more rigorous study and testing prior to being approved 
further  because these studies show that certain uses of certain hrt products may result in a higher likelihood of certain adverse health effects  it is possible that we could be named as a defendant in product liability lawsuits relating to our hrt products 
other studies evaluating hrt are currently underway or in the planning stages 
in particular  the estrogen only arm of the whi study is ongoing 
we are unable to predict the effect of new study results  once available  on the short and long term prospects for the hrt market or on the market for our transdermal hrt products 
since publication of the whi and nci study data  united states prescriptions have declined for substantially all hrt products  including our products  and prescriptions in europe have also declined 
the whi safety board re evaluates the risk benefit profile of the estrogen only arm as frequently as twice per year 
if the estrogen only study or any other currently ongoing hrt study is halted  the market for hrt products  including ours  both in the united states and abroad  could be further adversely impacted 
the hrt label changes mandated by the fda may also negatively impact our products  particularly with physicians and patients who now believe that transdermal hrt products are safer than orally delivered hrt products 
currently  our liquidity  results of operations and business prospects are almost entirely dependent on sales  license royalties and fees associated with transdermal hrt products 
accordingly  any further adverse change in the market for hrt products including any adverse changes resulting from the foregoing studies could have a material adverse impact on our liquidity  results of operations and business prospects 
methypatch we have developed a once daily transdermal methylphenidate delivery system for the treatment of adhd  which is intended to be marketed under the trade name methypatch 
our review of primary efficacy data from our phase iii clinical trial indicates that methypatch reduces the symptoms of adhd 
we filed an nda with the fda in june in february  we signed an agreement to license the exclusive global rights to market methypatch to shire for payments of up to million and ongoing manufacturing revenue 
consideration for the transaction is payable as follows a million payable upon closing of the transaction  b million upon receipt of final marketing approval for methypatch by the fda  and c million each upon shire s achievement of million  million and million in annual net sales of methypatch  respectively 
shire s annual net sales will be measured quarterly on a trailing month basis  with each milestone payment due days after the end of the first quarter during which trailing month sales exceed the applicable threshold 
for accounting purposes  all payments will be deferred and recognized as revenue over a period of years 
closing of the transaction is conditioned on  among other things  the expiration of any regulatory waiting period 
table of contents under the hart scott rodino antitrust improvements act of  and is expected to take place in april under the terms of the transaction  we remain responsible for securing final regulatory approval for methypatch 
if we receive a non approval letter from the fda or if fda approval has not been granted within two years of the closing date  shire may require us to repurchase the product rights for million 
shire has agreed that it will not sell any other product containing methylphenidate as an active ingredient until the earlier of a five years from the closing date or b payment of all of the sales milestones 
on the closing date  we will enter into a long term supply agreement under which we will manufacture and supply methypatch to shire 
the agreement will give shire the right to qualify a second manufacturing source and purchase a portion of its requirements from the second source 
no assurance can be given that the product will be approved by the fda 
the fda will examine efficacy data from the phase iii study together with safety and other data from this and other methypatch studies sponsored by us  and there can be no assurance that the fda will deem all of such data sufficient to approve the product for marketing or to authorize the product s use in the manner described by us 
we believe that methypatch is the first transdermal adhd product submitted to the fda for approval  and there can be no assurance that the fda will not have questions or raise objections including questions or objections specific to transdermal delivery that could delay or prevent an approval 
questions or objections specific to transdermal delivery of methylphenidate could raise new issues that would require us to expend significant additional time and resources to address  and any such questions or objections could necessitate further clinical testing which could significantly delay fda approval of methypatch 
additionally  there can be no assurance that the fda will not place conditions or restrictions on any approval  which could adversely affect the market potential of methypatch

product sales were higher in as a result of increases in sales of vivelle dot and vivelle to novogyne and the commencement of estradot sales to novartis ag in the first quarter of  partially offset by lower sales of combipatch to novogyne and menorest and estalis to novartis ag 
product sales for the year ended included million in minimum fee payments related to sales of menorest in certain european countries in these minimum fee payments did not recur in the million  or  increase in revenues compared to was primarily attributable to an increase in license revenue  resulting from the license of estradot to novartis ag in the fourth quarter of and the license of combipatch to novogyne in the first quarter of product sales were slightly higher in as a result of higher sales of combipatch in the united states and  to a lesser extent  higher sales of estalis outside of the united states  partially offset by a decline in sales of vivelle and vivelle dot to novogyne 
based on information that we have received from novartis  we believe that current trade inventory levels of vivelle exceed current demand  and current novogyne vivelle inventory levels are higher than desirable 
a further decline in prescriptions of novogyne s hrt products  whether as a result of the hrt studies  related product label changes  or otherwise  could further exacerbate this situation 
we are unable to predict either the timing or the magnitude of the impact of this situation on future sales and results of operations 
however  as trade customers and novogyne reduce orders and attempt to return inventories to desirable levels  and as we curtail shipments to facilitate this process  we expect that sales of novogyne s products and our sales to novogyne in future periods will be adversely impacted 

table of contents gross margin our gross margin was or gross profit of million in compared to or gross profit of million in the increase resulted from a favorable product mix we sold more product in the united states where sales have a higher gross margin and to increases in production volume resulting in more favorable overhead absorption  partially offset by a lower minimum fee payment in our gross margin was or gross profit of million in compared to or gross profit of million in the decrease resulted from an unfavorable product mix we sold more product outside of the united states where sales have a lower gross margin 
the decrease in gross margin was partially offset by higher minimum fee payments from novartis ag

marketing  general and administrative expenses the million  or  increase in marketing  general and administrative expenses compared to was primarily attributable to increases in methypatch pre launch marketing expenses and higher incentive plan costs  partially offset by lower outside consulting services related to the implementation of our enterprise resource planning system and nonrecurring reserves for obsolete production equipment in 
table of contents the million  or  increase in marketing  general and administrative expenses compared to was primarily attributable to an increase in outside consulting services related to the implementation of an enterprise resource planning system  consulting costs related to improvements in production efficiencies  reserves for obsolete production equipment and higher legal fees as a result of the combipatch license transaction 
the increase in expenses was partially offset by a decline in recruitment costs and other related expenses 
other income and expenses interest income interest income  net  decreased approximately million  or  in compared to  primarily due to lower interest rates 
interest income  net  increased approximately million  or  in compared to  primarily due to higher average balances in cash and cash equivalents  partially offset by lower interest rates 
income taxes our effective tax rate was for both and the provision for income taxes is based on the federal statutory and state income tax rates 
net deferred income tax assets are measured using the average graduated tax rate for the estimated amount of annual taxable income in the years that the liability is expected to be settled or the asset recovered 
the effect of adjusting the expected tax rate related to the net deferred income tax assets is included in the provision for income taxes 
as of december   we had a net deferred tax asset of million 
realization of this deferred tax asset depends upon the generation of sufficient future taxable income 
although realization is not assured  we believe it is more likely than not that the deferred income tax asset will be realized based upon estimated future taxable income 
an income tax benefit of million for resulted from the recognition of a deferred income tax benefit of million  partially offset by a current income tax expense of million 
this resulted from an million reduction of the valuation allowance on the deferred income tax asset

short term and long term liquidity in december  we entered into a secured revolving credit facility the credit facility providing for borrowings of up to the lesser of million or eligible accounts receivable 
the credit facility was extended in march and it will terminate in april we do not expect to extend the credit facility s term 
the credit facility bears interest at libor plus at december  
at december  and  there were no amounts outstanding under the credit facility 
terms of the credit facility include minimum net worth  revenue and operating results requirements  as well as maintenance of certain financial ratios  measured on a quarterly basis 
our principal sources of short term liquidity are existing cash  cash generated from product sales  fees and royalties under license agreements  distributions from novogyne and is expected to include payments from shire in connection with the methypatch transaction 
for the year ended december   approximately of our income before income taxes was comprised of equity in earnings of novogyne  a non cash item 
our short term liquidity is dependent on sales  royalties and license fees associated with transdermal hrt products 
any decrease in sales of those products by us or our licensees or any increase in returns of products to novogyne including any such changes resulting from the results of the recent or ongoing hrt studies  the pending product label changes or decreases resulting from novogyne and or novogyne s trade customers reducing their inventory levels  the failure of the transdermal hrt market to resume its prior growth trends  or the inability or failure of novogyne to pay distributions would have a material adverse effect on our short term liquidity and require us to rely more heavily on our existing cash reserves or on borrowings to support our operations and business 
although we expect to receive distributions from novogyne  there can be no assurance that novogyne will have sufficient profits or cash flow to pay distributions or that novogyne s management committee will authorize such distributions 
closing of the shire transaction is subject to  among other things  termination of the waiting period under the hart scott rodino antitrust improvements act of we cannot assure that the transaction will close or that  if it closes  we will receive any payments from shire 
in the first quarter of  our board of directors authorized a share repurchase program under which we may acquire up to million of our common stock 
as of march   we had repurchased  shares of our common stock at an aggregate price of million 
any 
table of contents repurchases of common stock under our share repurchase program could adversely affect our short term liquidity 
we believe that we will have sufficient cash available to meet our operating needs and anticipated short term capital requirements 
for our long term operating needs  we intend to utilize funds derived from the above sources  as well as funds generated through sales of products under development or products that we may license or acquire from others 
we expect that such funds will be comprised of payments received pursuant to future development and licensing arrangements  as well as direct sales of our own products 
we expect that our cash requirements will continue to increase  primarily to fund clinical studies for products under development and for plant and equipment to expand production capacity 
we cannot assure that we will successfully complete the development of such products  that we will obtain regulatory approval for any such products  that any approved product may be produced in commercial quantities  at reasonable costs  and be successfully marketed  or that we will successfully negotiate future licensing or product acquisition arrangements 
because much of the cost associated with product development is incurred prior to product launch  if we are unable to launch additional commercially viable products that we develop or that we license or acquire from others  we will have incurred the up front costs associated with product development or acquisition without the benefit of the liquidity generated by sales of those products  which could adversely affect our long term liquidity needs 
many factors that could impact our ability to develop or acquire and launch additional commercially viable products are discussed under cautionary factors that may have an impact on future results 
we are unable to predict the effect of the results of the discontinued and ongoing hrt studies discussed above on the short and long term prospects for the hrt market or for the market for our transdermal hrt products 
accordingly  we are not able to predict the effect that those studies may have on our short term or long term liquidity  results of operations and business prospects 
to the extent that capital requirements exceed available capital  we will seek alternative sources of financing to fund our operations 
we do not intend to extend our credit facility  which expires in april no assurance can be given that alternative financing will be available  if at all  in a timely manner  or on favorable terms 
if we are unable to obtain satisfactory alternative financing  we may be required to delay or reduce our proposed expenditures  including expenditures for research and development and plant and equipment  in order to meet our future cash requirements

table of contents critical accounting policies our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to allowance for doubtful accounts  inventories  intangible assets  accrued liabilities  income and other tax accruals  revenue recognition and contingencies and litigation 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
many of our critical accounting policies are those which we believe require the most subjective or complex judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
using different assumptions could result in materially different results 
a discussion of our critical accounting policies  the underlying judgments and uncertainties affecting their application and the likelihood that materially different amounts would be reported under different conditions or using different assumptions  is as follows revenue recognition substantially all of our product sales are to our licensees  novogyne and novartis ag 
revenues from product sales are recognized at the time of shipment when both title and the risks and rewards of ownership have been transferred to the buyer 
however  we defer the recognition of of the profit on our product sales to novogyne until those products are sold by novogyne 
certain license agreements provide for an adjustment to the price of the product based upon the licensee s actual sales price 
we record such adjustments to revenues at the time that the information necessary to make the determination is received from the licensees 
certain license agreements entitle us to minimum fees 
we record revenue related to minimum fees when sufficient supporting data is provided by the licensee 
if the minimum fees are not determinable  we record the fees on a cash basis 
these fees are included in product sales 
royalty revenue consists of royalties payable by novogyne on sales of vivelle and vivelle dot estradot in the united states and canada 
royalty revenue is recognized when earned and determinable and is included in product sales 
license revenue consists of up front  milestone and similar payments under license agreements and is recognized when earned under the terms of the applicable agreements 
in most cases  license revenue is deferred and recognized over the estimated product life cycle or the length of relevant patents  whichever is shorter 
these estimates of product life cycle or the length of relevant patents may prove to be inaccurate  in which case an adjustment to the associated license revenue would be recognized in our revenue at the time of such determination 
contract revenue consists of contract development fees and milestone payments earned under contracts with third parties 
we recognize revenue under the agreements as the work is performed 
these estimates of work completed under the contract may prove to be inaccurate  in which case any resulting adjustments to contract revenue recorded would be recognized in our revenue at the time of such determination 
deferred revenue represents the portion of all refundable and nonrefundable payments received that have not been earned 
costs incurred in performing

 accounting for stock issued to employees and related interpretations in accounting for our employee stock options as allowed pursuant to sfas  as amended by sfas accordingly  no compensation expense has been recognized for the years ended december   and our accounting for employee stock options complies with accounting practices generally accepted in the united states 
however  from time to time  proposals have been put forth to change the method of accounting for employee stock options that  if adopted  would require us to include the fair value of employee stock options in our compensation expense 
congress  the securities and exchange commission and the accounting profession are reevaluating employee compensation and its accounting  and several new proposals concerning the proper accounting for employee stock options have recently been put forth 
it is not possible to predict whether any such proposal will be adopted  or  if such a policy is adopted  what its requirements may be 
however  it is possible that we may in the future be required under accounting principles generally accepted in the united states to include the fair value of our employee stock options in our compensation expense 
had compensation cost for our stock option plans been determined on the basis of fair value at the grant date for awards under those plans  consistent with sfas  and as amended by sfas  and our existing valuation method for our employee stock options  the black scholes option pricing model  we estimate that our net income for the years ended december   and would have been reduced by  and  respectively 
however  sfas requires the use of option valuation models that use highly subjective assumptions  including expected stock price volatility  and to date  a uniform standard for calculating the fair value of employee stock options in accordance with sfas has not been adopted 
because our stock options have characteristics significantly different from traded options and because changes in the subjective input assumptions can materially affect the fair value estimate  in management s opinion  the existing models do not necessarily provide a reliable measure of the fair value of our employee stock options 
in addition  the effect of applying the fair value method of accounting for stock options on reported net income for  and may not be representative of the effects for future years because outstanding options vest over a period of several years and additional awards are generally made each year 
income taxes accounting principles generally accepted in the united states require that we not record a valuation allowance against our net deferred tax asset if it is more likely than not that we will be able to generate sufficient future taxable income to utilize our net deferred tax asset 
although realization is not assured  we believe it is more likely than not that the net deferred income tax asset will be realized based upon our estimated future taxable income and  accordingly  no valuation allowance for the net deferred income tax asset was deemed necessary 
subsequent revisions to the 
table of contents estimated net realizable value of the net deferred tax asset could cause our provision for income taxes to vary significantly from period to period 
investment in novogyne we entered into a joint venture novogyne with novartis  effective may   to market and sell women s prescription healthcare products in the united states and canada 
we account for our investment in novogyne under the equity method and report our share of novogyne s earnings as equity in earnings of novogyne on our statements of operations 
we defer the recognition of of our profit on products sold to novogyne until the products are sold by novogyne 
as of december   novogyne had a long term asset of million related to the acquisition of the marketing rights to combipatch 
accounting principles generally accepted in the united states require that novogyne record this asset at cost and that the asset be tested for recoverability whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that its carrying amount may not be recoverable 
testing for impairment requires novogyne to estimate the undiscounted future cash flow of the asset and compare that amount to the carrying value of the asset 
if this analysis indicates that a possible impairment exists undiscounted future cash flows are less than the carrying value  novogyne would be required to estimate the fair value of the asset 
the determination of fair value of this asset involves numerous uncertainties because there is no viable actively traded market for the marketing rights of a pharmaceutical product 
as permitted by accounting principles generally accepted in the united states  novogyne determines the estimated fair value of the marketing rights of combipatch utilizing a discounted cash flow analysis 
a discounted cash flow analysis values an asset on the basis of the net present value of the cash expected to be generated by that asset over its estimated useful life 
this analysis requires novogyne to make a number of significant assumptions and judgments 
for example  estimates need to be made regarding prescription growth  sales price and unit cost among many other factors including the discount rate to be applied to the estimated cash generated by sales of the product 
a material change in any of these assumptions  may require novogyne to record a valuation allowance  which would adversely affect novogyne s operating results in the period in which the determination or allowance were made  and would reduce the earnings attributable to our investment in novogyne for that period and the amount of our investment in novogyne 
neither novogyne nor we are able to predict the effect of the recently discontinued and currently ongoing hrt studies  and the pending product label changes  on the prospects for the hrt market or the market for combipatch 
any adverse change in the market for hrt products could have a material adverse impact on the ability of novogyne to recover its investment in combipatch which could require novogyne to revalue that asset 
novogyne records sales net of sales allowances for chargebacks  medicaid rebates  managed healthcare rebates  cash discounts  product returns and other allowances 
the returns portion of the sales allowance is based in part on novartis returned goods policy 
novartis controls and maintains the reserves associated with such sales allowances and returns on behalf of novogyne and pays all monies owed and issues credits to individual customers as deemed necessary 
the contracts that underlie these transactions are maintained by novartis for its business as a whole and those transactions relating to novogyne are estimated by novartis 
based on an analysis of the underlying activity  the amounts recorded by novogyne represent novartis best estimate of charges that apply to sales by novogyne 
however  neither novogyne nor we can control novartis analysis of the 
table of contents underlying activity or its application of that analysis to novogyne 
if novartis materially changes the assumptions it uses in allocating reserves or in the actual determination of the gross reserve  novogyne may be required to record an additional reserve allowance on its financial statements  which would adversely affect novogyne s operating results during the period in which the determination or reserve were made  and would consequently also reduce the earnings attributable to our investment in novogyne for that period 
the critical accounting policies discussed herein are not intended to be a comprehensive list of all of our accounting policies 
in many cases  the accounting treatment of a particular transaction is specifically dictated by accounting principles generally accepted in the united states  with no need for management s judgment in their application 
there are also areas in which management s judgment in selecting any available alternative would not produce a materially different result 
outlook among the principal factors that we expect will influence our financial results are prescription trends in the hrt market  both in the us and abroad  inventory levels for our hrt products in the us  the timing of any major market launches of our hrt products outside the us  and the timing of any methypatch approval and launch  the magnitude of launch orders placed by shire and our ability to scale up production to meet shire s demands 
full year us hrt 
as part of an inventory management initiative intended to align inventory with the reduced demand that followed the early termination of the whi study  we expect to ship less product in the united states in the first quarter than in the fourth quarter 
this initiative has reduced novogyne s inventory since december  but has also reduced the revenue that we recognize on sales to novogyne 
based on inventory trends at novogyne and forecast levels of demand for novogyne s hrt products  we expect that the initiative will align product inventory with demand by mid we cannot assure  however  that the initiative will have such a result or that demand for novogyne s hrt products will  in fact  correspond with novogyne s forecasts 
if we are successful in re aligning inventory  including inventory held in the trade distribution channel  with then current and forecast demand levels by mid  and if prescriptions remain consistent with current levels  we would expect our domestic hrt business to grow in the second half of international hrt 
we do not expect international sales to contribute to noven s growth in unless novartis ag launches estradot in additional major markets 
estradot has been launched in germany and in several other countries  but  according to novartis ag  significant pricing and reimbursement issues in the remaining major markets  including the united kingdom  france  spain and italy  have to date prevented novartis ag from launching in those countries 
because of these significant reimbursement and pricing issues and novartis lack of success to date in securing a marketing partner in the united kingdom and france for estradot  we do not expect any additional major market launches of estradot in 
table of contents methypatch 
under the terms of the shire transaction  if the shire transaction closes and methypatch is approved by the fda this year  we should receive payments totaling at least million from shire in however  if we do not obtain fda approval of methypatch during  we would not receive million of those payments until fda approval is obtained 
because we will recognize a portion of any such payments as revenue and do not expect to incur further significant methypatch launch costs  if the transaction closes  we would expect it to be accretive to our earnings 
in addition  we expect that shire will place launch orders with us when the fda approves methypatch  which would be expected to generate additional manufacturing revenue for us in cautionary factors that may have an impact on future results except for historical information contained herein  the matters discussed in this report are forward looking statements made pursuant to the safe harbor provisions of the private securities litigation reform act of these forward looking statements include  but are not limited to  statements about our and our strategic partners respective plans  objectives  expectations  estimates  strategies  product approvals and development plans  and anticipated financial results 
these statements are typically identified by the use of terms such as anticipates  believes  estimates  expects  intends  may  plans  could  should  will  would and similar words 
these statements are based on our current expectations and beliefs concerning future events but are subject to risks and uncertainties  including but not limited to economic  competitive  governmental and technological factors affecting our operations  results of operations  markets  products  prices and prospects  and other factors discussed below and elsewhere in this report and the other documents filed by us with the securities and exchange commission sec 
these factors may cause our results to differ materially from the statements made in this report or otherwise made by or on behalf of us 
the following is a brief summary of some of the risk factors  which are not listed in order of priority  that could adversely affect our results 
most of these factors are described elsewhere in this report  but the risks described below are not the only risks we face 
we do not undertake to update any of these forward looking statements or to announce the results of any revisions to these forward looking statements except as required by law 
we face competition from a number of companies in the development of transdermal drug delivery products  and competition is expected to intensify as more companies enter the field 
some of these companies are substantially larger than we are and have greater resources than we do  as well as greater experience in developing and commercializing pharmaceutical products 
as a result  they may succeed before us in developing competing technologies or obtaining governmental approvals for products 
our products compete with other transdermal products as well as alternative dosage forms of the same or comparable chemical entities  as well as non drug therapies 
we cannot assure that our products will compete successfully against competitive products or that developments by others will not render our products obsolete or uncompetitive 
if we cannot maintain competitive products and technologies  our current and potential strategic partners may choose to adopt the drug delivery technologies of our competitors or their own internally developed technologies 

table of contents our equity in earnings of novogyne contributed of our income before income taxes in  and novogyne s results will likely continue to be material to us in the future 
because  among other things  we are vastly different in size from novartis  and because novartis and its affiliates sell competing products outside of novogyne  our interests may not always be aligned 
this may result in potential conflicts between novartis and us on matters relating to novogyne which we may not be able to resolve on favorable terms 
novartis has the right to dissolve novogyne under certain circumstances 
novogyne s management committee is comprised of a majority of representatives from novartis  and we do not control novogyne 
in addition  the joint venture operating agreement has a buy sell provision which allows either party to compel either the purchase of the other party s interest in novogyne or the sale of its own interest at a price set by the party triggering the buy sell provision 
novartis is a larger company with greater financial resources  and therefore may be in a better position to be the purchaser if the provision is triggered 
if the provision is triggered and novartis is the purchaser  there can be no assurance that we would be able to reinvest the proceeds of the sale in a manner that would result in sufficient earnings to offset the loss of earnings from novogyne 
if the provision is triggered and we are the purchaser  there can be no assurance that we would not be adversely affected by the changes in capital and or debt structure that likely would be required to finance the purchase transaction 
under the terms of the novogyne joint venture  novartis is responsible for distribution of novogyne s products  including vivelle  and for selling novogyne s products to its trade customers 
novartis regularly reports inventory information to the novogyne management committee 
in the third quarter of  novartis reported that trade inventory levels of vivelle in the aggregate were higher than in prior periods and appeared to have grown to levels that exceed current demand 
during  novogyne significantly increased its reserve for sales allowances and returns 
based on information that we have received from novartis  we believe that current inventory levels at novogyne have increased and are higher than desirable in light of our trade customers current and expected demand 
to align inventories with demand  novogyne is curtailing product shipments to its trade customers  and we are deferring product shipments to novogyne 
these actions will adversely impact novogyne s and our financial results 
we expect that sales of novogyne s products in future periods will be adversely impacted as trade customers are expected to reduce their inventories and as novogyne and we take affirmative steps to attempt to reduce novogyne s inventory levels 
we also expect that our sales to novogyne  and our gross margin on those sales  will also be adversely impacted  both as a result of an expected decline in orders from trade customers seeking to reduce their inventory levels which would reduce novogyne s sales and by novogyne s reduction of its inventory levels which would reduce our sales to novogyne 
a further decline in prescriptions of novogyne s hrt products  whether as a result of the recent or ongoing studies  required label changes or otherwise  could further exacerbate this situation 
we are unable to predict either the timing or the magnitude of the impact of this situation on future sales and results of operations 
almost all of our revenues are currently generated through sales of hrt transdermal delivery systems 
although the range of consequences of the hrt studies described above cannot be predicted  it is possible that they could result in a significant permanent decrease in the market for our hrt products either as physicians withdraw their patients from hrt or as women elect 
table of contents to discontinue hrt on their own 
in addition  we do not expect the market growth to materialize as would have been expected had hrt been found safe and effective for additional indications  such as heart disease 
in january  the fda announced that marketers of hrt products  including novogyne  are required to modify their hrt product labels to include additional safety information and warnings 
among other things  the labels must indicate that hrt should be used for short term therapy only and that  in the absence of clinical studies demonstrating that hrt products other than the oral product studied in the whi are safe  physicians should assume that all hrt products carry the same risks 
novartis has informed us that it intends to submit proposed revised labeling to the fda and to begin using the revised label after reaching agreement with the fda on the label s language  but we cannot assure you that novartis proposed labeling will be submitted to the fda or acted on by the fda in a timely manner or at all 
healthcare regulators also could delay the approval of new hrt products  such as those presently under development by novartis ag and us  or require that any new hrt products be subject to more extensive or more rigorous study and testing prior to being approved 
the fda has mandated that all companies engaged in clinical development of hrt products inform study subjects of the risks identified in the referenced studies 
further  because these studies show that certain uses of certain hrt products may result in a higher likelihood of certain adverse health effects  it is possible that we could be named as a defendant in product liability lawsuits relating to our hrt products 
other studies evaluating hrt are currently underway or in the planning stages 
in particular  the estrogen only arm of the whi study is ongoing 
we are unable to predict the effect of these study results on the short and long term prospects for the hrt market or on the market for our transdermal hrt products 
however  since publication of the whi and nci study data  united states prescriptions have declined for substantially all hrt products  including our products  and prescriptions in europe have also declined 
the whi safety board reevaluates the risk benefit profile of the estrogen only arm as frequently as twice per year 
if the estrogen only study or any other currently ongoing hrt study is halted  the market for hrt products  including ours  both in the united states and abroad  could be further adversely impacted 
currently  our liquidity  results of operations and business prospects are almost entirely dependent on sales  license royalties and fees associated with transdermal hrt products 
accordingly  any further adverse change in the market for hrt products including any adverse changes resulting from the foregoing studies could have a material adverse impact on our liquidity  results of operations and business prospects 
novogyne recorded the acquisition of combipatch marketing rights at cost and tests this asset for impairment on a periodic basis 
any further adverse change in the market for hrt products could have a material adverse impact on the ability of novogyne to recover its investment in its combipatch marketing rights  which could require novogyne to revalue that asset 
impairment of that asset would adversely affect novogyne s  and consequently our  operating results 
because novartis is responsible for estimating and recording sales allowances for novogyne  including reserves and allowances related to product returns  we may have limited ability to accurately forecast the amount of such sales allowances in any period 
if novartis materially changes the assumptions it uses in allocating reserves or in the actual determination of the gross reserve  novogyne may be required to record an additional reserve allowance on its financial statements  which would adversely affect novogyne s operating results during the period in 
table of contents which the determination or reserve were made  and would  consequently also reduce our earnings attributable to our investment in novogyne for that period 
in  we expect that estrasorb  the first prescription estrogen cream product in the united states  will be approved by the fda for the treatment of menopausal symptoms and launched by novavax  inc and king pharmaceuticals 
we are unable to predict the impact of this product launch on novogyne s sales and market share  but it is expected that this product will gain some market share at the expense of novogyne s products  and the impact on novogyne s sales could be material 
we expect to be dependent on sales to novartis ag and novogyne  as well as fees and royalties generated from such parties sales of our transdermal hrt delivery systems  for a significant portion of our expected revenues for at least the next several years  and no assurance can be given regarding the amount and timing of such revenues 
failure of either of these parties to market our products successfully would cause the quantity of products purchased from us and the amount of fees and royalties ultimately paid to us to be reduced and would therefore have a material adverse effect on our business and operations 
in the short term  our growth depends in part on novartis ag s launch plans and marketing efforts with respect to estalis and estradot 
the scope and success of those efforts are outside of our control 
we receive firm orders from novartis ag on a partial year basis  which limits our ability to accurately forecast full year sales to novartis ag 
novartis and its affiliates sell competing products  both in the united states and abroad  and there can be no assurance that novartis will promote our products at the expense of its other products 
the supply agreement for vivelle and vivelle dot has expired  and the parties are currently negotiating an extension to the agreement 
since the expiration of the vivelle supply agreement  the parties have continued to operate in accordance with the supply agreement s commercial terms  and we expect that the supply agreement will be extended on satisfactory terms 
however  we cannot assure that we will enter into a new supply agreement on satisfactory terms or at all 
due to our dependence on novogyne and novartis ag  we may be unable to negotiate favorable business terms with them or resolve any dispute that we may be involved in with them in a favorable manner 
our pharmaceutical company partners market and sell many of the products we develop and manufacture 
some of those partners  such as novartis and shire  market and sell products competitive with ours 
if one or more partners fails to pursue the marketing of our products as planned  or if marketing of any of those products including estradot  a second dosage strength of estalis or methypatch is otherwise delayed  our revenues and gross profits may be adversely affected which may also adversely affect our short term liquidity 
we cannot control the timing and other aspects of the development and launch of products incorporating our technologies and marketed by others 
our partners may have different and  sometimes  competing priorities 
even if our marketing partners aggressively pursue the launch and marketing of our products  regulatory matters or other external factors may prevent or delay the launch and marketing 
therefore  the commercialization and marketing of products we have under development may be delayed unexpectedly 
our principal commercialized products are marketed and sold by licensees  and we do not presently have a significant direct marketing channel to health care providers for our drug delivery technologies 
the marketing organizations of our partners may be unsuccessful  or those partners may assign a lower level of priority to the marketing of our products 
if marketing efforts 
table of contents for our products are not successful  our revenues and results of operations may be adversely affected  which may also adversely affect our short term liquidity 
we expect that revenues from product sales to our licensees will fluctuate from quarter to quarter and year to year depending upon various factors not in our control  including the marketing efforts of each licensee  the inventory requirements of each licensee  the impact of competitive products  the timing and scope of estalis and estradot launches and commercialization efforts by novartis ag  the growth  if any  in combipatch prescriptions in the united states  the impact of the hrt studies on prescriptions for our hormone replacement products  the product pricing of each licensee  the timing of certain royalty reconciliations and payments under our license agreements  the timing of fda approval of methypatch and the subsequent product launch by shire  and the success of shire s commercialization efforts 
our earnings may fluctuate because of  among other things  fluctuations in research and development spending resulting from the timing of clinical trials involving products in development 
pharmaceutical prices  including prices for our products  in europe and certain other countries are significantly lower than in the united states 
because our agreements with novartis ag provide for us to receive a percentage of novartis ag s net selling price subject to a minimum price  our gross margins are generally much lower for product sold to novartis ag for resale outside of the united states than for product sold to novogyne for sale in the united states 
in addition  the lower prices restrict novartis ag s gross margin realized from selling our products 
because our products compete for sales and marketing resources with other novartis ag products  including competitive hormone replacement products  there can be no assurance that the relatively low gross margins generated from selling our products will not cause novartis ag to focus its resources on other products or even not launch our products in certain countries 
novartis ag has informed us that pricing and reimbursement issues are adversely impacting its launch plans for estradot in many countries  including the united kingdom  france  spain and italy 
novartis ag is seeking a marketing partner to launch estradot in the united kingdom and france  but to date has been unsuccessful 
our long term strategy is dependent  in part  upon the successful development  licensing or acquisition of new products  such as methypatch  and their successful commercialization 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to identify commercially promising products or technologies 
the length of time necessary to complete clinical trials and obtain marketing approval from regulatory authorities may be considerable 
no assurance can be given that we will have the financial resources necessary to complete products under development  that those projects to which we dedicate sufficient resources will be successfully completed  that we will be able to obtain regulatory approval for any such product  or that any approved product can be produced in commercial quantities  at reasonable costs  and be successfully marketed  either by us or by a licensing partner 
a project can fail or be delayed at any stage of development  even if each prior stage was completed successfully  which could adversely impact our ability to recover our investment in the product 
some of our development projects will not be completed successfully or on schedule 
many of the factors which may cause a product in development to fail or be delayed  such as difficulty in enrolling patients in clinical trials  the failure of clinical trials  lack of sufficient supplies or raw materials  inability to apply the subject product or technology on a commercial scale on an economical basis and changes in regulations  are beyond our control 
in some cases  we have begun and  in the future  may begin development of a 
table of contents product that we do not intend to independently develop through clinical trials and market  with the expectation that a licensee will be identified to assist in development and or marketing 
there can be no assurance that we will attract a business partner for any particular product or will be able to negotiate an agreement on commercially reasonable terms 
if an agreement is not reached  our initial development investment in any such product may not be recovered 
historically  our ability to improve our gross margins has depended on our ability to increase our manufacturing throughput 
therefore  if the impact of the hrt studies  the effect of lower pharmaceutical prices outside of the united states  competitive factors or other matters affecting novartis ag s marketing efforts  or any other factors cause our manufacturing volume to decrease  we would expect our gross margins to decline  which could have a material adverse effect on our financial results 
we depend upon collaborative agreements with pharmaceutical companies  some of whom are our competitors  to obtain regulatory approval for  market and sell certain of our products 
additionally  we intend to seek developmental partners to develop  test and obtain regulatory approval for  and commercialize certain of our products presently under development 
the number of our products that are successfully developed and commercialized will affect our revenues 
because transdermal patches generally are more expensive to manufacture than oral formulations  it may be more difficult for us to attract development partners than for drug delivery companies with lower cost delivery systems 
if we do not enter into additional agreements in the future  or if our current or future agreements do not result in successful marketing of our products  our revenue and results of operations may be adversely affected 
our operations are subject to extensive regulation by governmental authorities in the united states and other countries with respect to the testing  approval  manufacture  labeling  marketing and sale of pharmaceutical products 
these regulations are wide ranging and govern  among other things adverse drug experience reporting  product promotion  product pricing and discounting  drug sample accountability  product manufacturing  including good manufacturing practices  and product changes or modifications 
our facilities handle controlled substances  resulting in additional extensive regulatory requirements and oversight 
we devote significant time  effort and expense addressing the extensive government regulations applicable to our business 
even if a product is approved by a regulatory authority  product approvals may be withdrawn after the product reaches the market if compliance with regulatory standards is not maintained or if problems occur regarding the safety or efficacy of the product 
failure to comply with governmental regulations may result in fines  warning letters  unanticipated compliance expenditures  interruptions or suspension of production and resulting loss of sales  product seizures or recalls  injunctions prohibiting further sales  withdrawal of previously approved marketing applications  and criminal prosecution 
under the terms of the novogyne joint venture  novartis is responsible for providing regulatory services 
while we believe that novartis provides these services adequately  there can be no assurance that a violation of any of these regulations will not have an adverse effect on us 
fda approval of a product incorporating our technologies  including methypatch and our hrt products  includes approval of the product label 
typically  a pharmaceutical company will submit its initial marketing materials and proposed marketing claims to the fda s division of drug marketing  advertising and communication ddmac  although there is no 
table of contents requirement to do so 
ddmac then determines whether a company s proposed claims are consistent with the approved product label and may limit the approved claims 
in that event  revenues derived from that product may be limited 
failure to comply with these marketing restrictions can result in severe penalties  and there can be no assurance that our marketing partners will comply with the foregoing restrictions with respect to claims that they may assert about our technology or products 
our supply agreements with our licensees also impose strict obligations on us with respect to the manufacture and supply of our products 
we devote significant time  effort and expense complying with these requirements 
failure to comply with the terms of these supply agreements may result in our being unable to supply product to our licensees  resulting in lost revenue by us and potential responsibility for damages and losses suffered by our licensees 
the federal and state governments in the united states  as well as many foreign governments  from time to time explore ways to reduce medical care costs through health care reform 
in the united states  these proposals include government programs involving prescription drug reimbursement benefits for seniors 
due to the diverse range of proposals put forth from country to country and the uncertainty of any proposal s adoption  we cannot predict what impact any reform proposal ultimately adopted may have on the pharmaceutical industry or on our business or operating results 
substantially all of our revenues are generated through sales of transdermal delivery systems 
our products are marketed primarily to physicians  some of whom are reluctant to prescribe a transdermal delivery system when an alternative delivery system is available 
we and our licensees must demonstrate to prescribing physicians the benefits of transdermal delivery  especially with respect to products such as methypatch for which there is presently no transdermal system on the market 
the commercial success of our products is also based in part on patient preference  and difficulties in obtaining patient acceptance of our transdermal delivery systems may similarly impact our ability to market our products 
our success will depend  in part  on our ability to obtain or license patents for our products  processes and technologies 
if we do not do so  our competitors may exploit our innovations and deprive us of the ability to realize revenues from those innovations 
there is no assurance that we will be issued patents for any of our patent applications  that any existing or future patents that we receive or license will provide competitive advantages for our products  or that we will be able to enforce successfully our patent rights 
additionally  there can be no assurance that our patents or any future patents will prevent other companies from developing similar or functionally equivalent products  or challenging  invalidating or avoiding our patent applications or any existing or future patents that we receive or license 
many of our patents are formulation patents and would not preclude others from developing and marketing products that deliver drugs transdermally through non infringing formulations 
furthermore  there is no assurance that any of our future processes or products will be patentable  that any pending or additional patents will be issued in any or all appropriate jurisdictions or that our processes or products will not infringe upon the patents of third parties 
we also rely on trade secrets  unpatented proprietary know how and continuing technological innovation 
we use confidentiality agreements with licensees  suppliers  employees and 
table of contents consultants to protect our trade secrets  unpatented proprietary know how and continuing technological innovation  but there can be no assurance that these parties will not breach their agreements with us 
we also cannot be certain that we will have adequate remedies for any breach 
disputes may arise concerning the ownership of intellectual property or the applicability of confidentiality agreements 
furthermore  we cannot be sure that our trade secrets and proprietary technology will not otherwise become known or that our competitors will not independently develop our trade secrets and proprietary technology 
we also cannot be sure  if we do not receive patents for products arising from our research  that we will be able to maintain the confidentiality of information relating to our products 
our success will also depend in part on our ability to operate without infringing the proprietary rights of others  and there can be no assurance that our products and processes will not infringe upon the patents of others 
if a third party asserts a claim of infringement  we may have to seek licenses  defend infringement actions or challenge the validity of those third party patents in court 
if we cannot obtain the required licenses  or are found liable for infringement or are not able to have these patents declared invalid  we may be liable for significant monetary damages  encounter significant delays in bringing products to market or be precluded from participating in the manufacture  use or sale of products or methods of drug delivery covered by the patents of others 
there can be no assurance that we have identified  or that in the future we will be able to identify  all us and foreign patents that may pose a risk of potential infringement claims 
like all pharmaceutical companies  the testing  manufacturing and marketing of our products may expose us to potential product liability and other claims resulting from their use 
the publication of the hrt study data described above may increase the likelihood of product liability claims against us 
if any such claims against us are successful  we may be required to make significant compensation payments and suffer the associated adverse publicity 
we maintain product liability insurance  but there can be no assurance that our insurance will cover all future claims or that we will be able to maintain existing coverage or obtain additional coverage at reasonable rates 
the trend in the pharmaceutical insurance market is toward narrower coverage and higher premiums  with certain pharmaceutical compounds specifically excluded from coverage 
if a claim is not covered or if our coverage is insufficient  we may incur significant liability payments that would negatively affect our earnings and our business 
certain raw materials and components used in the manufacture of our products  including essential polymer adhesives  are available from limited sources  and  in some cases  a single source 
our nda for methypatch  for example  seeks approval for only one source of the product s active drug ingredient 
any curtailment in the availability of such raw materials could be accompanied by production or other delays  and  in the case of products for which only one raw material supplier exists  could result in a material loss of sales 
additionally  regulatory authorities must generally approve raw material sources for pharmaceutical products 
without adequate approved supplies of raw materials or packaging supplies  our manufacturing operations may be interrupted until another supplier could be identified  our products approved and trading terms with it negotiated 
we may not be able to identify an alternative supplier and any supplier that we do identify may not be able to obtain the requisite regulatory approvals in a timely manner  or at all 
furthermore  we may not be able to negotiate favorable terms with an alternative supplier 
any disruptions in our manufacturing operations from the loss of an approved supplier may cause us to incur increased costs and lose revenues and may have an adverse effect on our relationships with our partners and customers  any of which could have 
table of contents adverse effects on our business and results of operations 
some raw materials used in our products are supplied by companies that restrict certain medical uses of their products 
while our use is presently acceptable  there can be no assurance that such companies will not expand their restrictions to include our applications 
the dea sets quotas for controlled substances  including methylphenidate  and we must receive authorization from the dea to handle these substances 
we cannot assure that we will be granted sufficient dea quota to meet shire s methypatch production requirements 
failure to meet such requirements would affect our revenues and could affect the success of shire s product launch 
all of our products are manufactured at a single facility in miami  florida 
an interruption of manufacturing resulting from regulatory issues  technical problems  casualty loss including hurricane or other factors could result in our inability to meet production requirements  which may cause us to lose revenues and which could have an adverse effect on our relationships with our partners and customers  any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial results 
without our existing production facility  we would have no other means of manufacturing our products until we were able to restore the manufacturing capability at our facility or develop an alternative manufacturing facility 
although we carry business interruption insurance to cover lost revenues and profits  this insurance does not cover all possible situations and there can be no assurance that any event of casualty to our facility would be covered by such insurance 
in addition  our business interruption insurance would not compensate us for the loss of opportunity and potential adverse impact on relations with our existing partners and customers resulting from our inability to produce products for them 
our receipt of the sales based milestones under the shire agreement depends on the methypatch sales levels achieved by shire 
the adhd market is very competitive 
competitors marketing or developing adhd products include johnson johnson  novartis  glaxo smithkline  bristol myers squibb  abbott laboratories  celltech plc and eli lilly 
shire also markets non methylphenidate adhd products 
there are other once daily preparations on the market and a non stimulant  non controlled substance therapy was launched by eli lilly in the first quarter of there are also other  non controlled substance drugs in development for the treatment of adhd 
these competitive products  especially those not designated as controlled substances  may negatively impact shire s ability to gain market share for methypatch and therefore may decrease the likelihood that we will receive the sales based milestone payments 
methypatch is a new product that we have never manufactured on a commercial scale 
we are modifying our manufacturing plant to prepare for the expected product launch in we cannot assure that our modifications will be completed successfully or in time to meet shire s launch requirements or that we will not otherwise experience manufacturing difficulties  particularly in the early stages of commercial manufacture 
the terms of the shire transaction will permit shire to qualify a second manufacturing source and purchase a portion of its requirements from the second source 
failure to meet shire s requirements would affect our revenues and could affect the success of shire s product launch and may result in shire relying 
table of contents more heavily on its second source  reducing the manufacturing revenues that we would otherwise realize 
the active ingredient in methypatch is more expensive than the active ingredients in our hrt patch products 
if we experience manufacturing difficulties such as quality problems  yield deficiencies or similar issues  our overall manufacturing costs may be higher than anticipated 
in such event  our manufacturing margins would suffer and  in an extreme case  we could suffer losses in manufacturing and supplying methypatch to shire 
closing of the shire transaction is conditioned on  among other things  the expiration of any regulatory waiting period under the hart scott rodino antitrust improvements act of we cannot assure that the united states antitrust authorities will approve the transaction in a timely manner or at all 
if the antitrust authorities do not approve the transaction or if they request additional information from the parties  or if the transaction does not close or if the closing is delayed for any other reason  we may not receive any payments from shire even if methypatch is approved by the fda 
failure to receive antitrust approval could prevent the transaction from ever closing  in which case we would be forced to seek other strategies to commercialize methypatch 
prior to our decision to engage in the shire transaction  one aspect of our corporate strategy was to establish a sales force  and to launch and market methypatch ourselves 
with the shire transaction  we expect to avoid the significant launch and ongoing marketing expenses that we would have incurred had we launched the product ourselves 
we cannot assure that we will deploy the cash expected to be received from shire  or the cash that we would otherwise have spent  in a manner that will produce a satisfactory return 
we also cannot assure that the milestone payments and manufacturing revenue that we may receive from shire will be greater than the revenues that we would have realized from launching and marketing methypatch ourselves 
there is an ongoing public debate in the united states regarding the appropriateness of using methylphenidate and other medications to treat children with adhd 
we expect that this debate will continue for the foreseeable future 
the outcome of this debate is uncertain  and we cannot predict what impact  if any  the increased public attention will have on the market for products indicated for adhd or on methypatch 
because at least part of the stigma results from the fact that most of the current products are schedule ii controlled substances  the non stimulant product launched by eli lilly may benefit from this controversy at the expense of the methylphenidate and amphetamine based products on the market 
our ability and our marketing partners ability to commercialize our products  including methypatch  is dependent in part on obtaining reimbursement from government health authorities  private health insurers and managed care organizations 
the trend toward managed healthcare in the united states and the prominence of health maintenance organizations hmos and similar entities could significantly influence the purchase of our products  resulting in lower prices and lower demand 
this is particularly true in a market that includes generic alternatives  such as the adhd market 
there can be no assurance that shire will obtain acceptable reimbursement status for methypatch 
there can also be no assurance that managed care agreements established by novartis will not adversely affect novogyne s financial results 

table of contents from time to time we may need to acquire licenses to patents and other intellectual property of third parties to develop  manufacture and commercialize our products 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to acquire such licenses on commercially reasonable terms 
the failure to obtain such a license could negatively affect our ability to develop  manufacture and commercialize certain products  and could therefore have an adverse effect on our business and financial results 
we rely on insurance to protect us from many business risks  including product liability  business interruption  property and casualty loss  employment practices liability and directors and officers liability 
an increase in the number of securities class action suits  an increase in damages and or settlements paid in connection with certain of these class actions  an increase in the number of product liability claims and the resulting damages and settlements  including those resulting from the hrt studies discussed above  and other factors we have experienced  and expect to continue to experience  could result in difficulty in obtaining adequate coverage at historical rates 
in most cases  as is the trend in the pharmaceutical industry  as insurance policies expire  we may be required to procure policies with narrower coverage  more exclusions  and higher premiums 
in some cases  coverage may not be available at any price 
there can be no assurance that the insurance that we maintain and intend to maintain will be adequate  or that the cost of insurance and limitations in coverage will not adversely affect our business and financial results 
the sarbanes oxley act of imposed significant new administrative burdens on publicly traded companies 
we expect to incur significant incremental costs in complying with the provisions of the sarbanes oxley act 
we cannot assure you that these additional costs will result in any increase in revenue or that they will not have a material adverse effect on our financial results 
in addition  because we are a small company with relatively few employees  the individuals responsible for complying with the new statutory and regulatory requirements also have responsibility for business matters 
as a result  our business may suffer if these individuals are forced to spend a disproportionate amount of time on compliance matters 
in  we implemented a new enterprise resource planning system 
we expect that  over time  the new system will result in improved business processes and increased operating efficiencies 
as our employees become familiar with the new system  we expect that some errors may occur  some of which could adversely impact our business and financial results 
there can be no assurance that the system will perform as expected or that the anticipated improvements in business processes and operating efficiencies will be achieved 
in the event of serious system malfunctions or deficiencies  we might experience business interruptions  which could adversely impact our business and financial results 
our success is dependent on our ability to attract and retain qualified  experienced personnel 
we face significant competition in recruiting competent personnel 
in the past  our location in an area with relatively few pharmaceutical companies has made recruitment more difficult  as many candidates prefer to work in places with a broad pharmaceutical industry presence 
the loss of key personnel  or the inability to attract and retain additional  competent employees  could adversely affect our business and financial results 
our corporate charter documents  delaware law and our stockholders rights plan include provisions that may discourage or prevent parties from attempting to acquire us 
these provisions may have the effect of depriving our stockholders of the opportunity to sell their stock at a price in 
table of contents excess of prevailing market prices in an acquisition of noven 
our board of directors has the authority to issue up to  shares of preferred stock and to determine the rights  preferences and privileges of those shares without any further vote or action by our stockholders 
the rights of holders of our common stock may be adversely affected by the rights of the holders of any preferred stock that may be issued in the future 
additional provisions of our certificate of incorporation and bylaws could have the effect of making it more difficult for a third party to acquire a majority of our outstanding voting common stock 
these include provisions that limit the ability of stockholders to bring matters before an annual meeting of stockholders  call special meetings or nominate candidates to serve on our board of directors 
we are also subject to the provisions of section of the delaware general corporation law  which prohibits a publicly held delaware corporation from engaging in a business combination with an interested stockholder for a period of three years after the date of the transaction in which the person became an interested stockholder  unless the business combination is approved in a prescribed manner 
for purposes of section  a business combination includes a merger  asset sale or other transaction resulting in a financial benefit to the interested stockholder  and an interested stockholder is a person who  either alone or together with affiliates and associates  owns or within the past three years  did own or more of the corporation s voting stock 
we also have a stockholders rights plan  commonly referred to as a poison pill  which is intended to cause substantial dilution to a person or group who attempts to acquire us on terms that our board of directors has not approved 
the existence of the stockholders rights plan could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire a majority of our common stock without the consent of our board of directors 
the market price of our common stock was extremely volatile in and may continue to be volatile going forward 
in  our common stock traded as low as per share and as high as per share before closing at on december   the last trading day of the year 
any number of factors  including some over which we have no control and some unrelated to our business or financial results  may have a significant impact on the market price of our common stock  including announcements by us or our competitors of technological innovations or new commercial products  changes in governmental regulation  receipt by us or one of our competitors of regulatory approvals  developments relating to our patents or proprietary rights of one of our competitors  publicity regarding actual or potential medical results or risks for products that we or one of our competitors market or has under development  and period to period changes in financial results and the economy generally 
we  like any other company with a volatile stock price  may be subject to further securities litigation  which could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial results 
fluctuations in our operating results may lead to fluctuations or declines in our stock price 
our operating results may fluctuate from quarter to quarter and from year to year depending on demand by our customers for our products and timing of shipments to them  new product introductions  pharmaceutical company ordering patterns  the number and timing of product development milestones that we achieve  the timing of royalty and true up payments and the level of our spending on new drug delivery technology development and technology acquisition  and internal product development 

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we had no variable rate debt outstanding during the year ended or at december  therefore  changes in interest rates did not affect interest expense  earnings or cash flows in we cannot predict market fluctuations in interest rates and their impact on any variable rate debt that we may have outstanding from time to time  nor can there be any assurance that fixed rate long term debt will be available at favorable rates  if at all
