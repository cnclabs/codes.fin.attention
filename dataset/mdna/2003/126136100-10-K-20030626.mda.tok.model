during  the us patent and trademark office patent office reexamined the company s primary licensed patent and rejected certain claims 
the company has joined its licensor in the exercise of its right to contest the action of the patent office 
the company and its licensor have amended and are also seeking to further amend certain claims to provide the company with additional protection under the patent 
the final outcome of the reexamination is uncertain 
although an adverse ruling could narrow the range of protection available for nasal dilators and limit the breadth of the company s patent protection  the company believes that its current portfolio of both pending patent applications and issued patents will enable it to maintain significant patent protection for its nasal strip products

the first period to be reported in was a three month stub period ending march  fiscal is from april  through march  in fiscal  the company continued to expand its breathe right product line by launching breathe right snore relief throat spray

accounting for income taxes 
as part of the process of preparing financial statements  the company is required to estimate income taxes  both state and federal 
this process involves management estimating the actual current tax exposure together with assessing temporary differences resulting from different treatment for tax and accounting purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included within the consolidated balance sheet 
management must then assess the likelihood that deferred tax assets will be utilized to offset future taxable income during the periods in which these temporary differences are deductible 
based on the level of historical taxable income and projections of future taxable income for the periods  in which the deferred tax assets are deductible  management believes that it is more likely than not the company will realize the benefits of these deductible differences 
accordingly  the company has eliminated the valuation allowance of million against the net deferred tax assets as of march  valuation of product rights 
management assesses the impairment of product rights whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
factors that are considered important for the assessment include significant underperformance of a product line relative to projected or historical results  significant change in the market in relation to competitive products and significant negative industry or economic trends 
management currently does not believe that it is necessary to record an impairment charge at this time and that the carrying value of these assets will be recoverable
