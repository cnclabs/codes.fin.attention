actual results may vary from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
critical accounting policies are defined as those that are reflective of significant judgments and uncertainties  and potentially result in materially different results under different assumptions and conditions

at the time a loss on a contract becomes known  the entire amount of the estimated ultimate loss is accrued
