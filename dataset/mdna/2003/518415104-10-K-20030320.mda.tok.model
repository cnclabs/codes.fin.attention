 fpga cpld spld prior to the acquisition of agere fpga  we had no revenue from fpga products 
during  the semiconductor and pld markets experienced a significant downturn  which continued through our revenue decrease in as compared to and our revenue decrease in as compared to  was a result of this downturn and the resultant decrease in demand for our products 
revenue declined across all geographies  and demand across most end markets remains weak 
our sales by geographic region were as follows year ended dec

 year ended dec 
 in thousands united states export sales europe asia other revenue from export sales as a percentage of total revenue was approximately for  for and for we expect export sales to continue to represent a significant portion of revenue 
during  total units sold decreased by and our overall average selling prices decreased by three percent when compared to both units sold and average selling price were adversely impacted by the continued downturn in the semiconductor and pld markets 
during  total units sold decreased by while the average selling price of our products was approximately flat when compared to although selling prices of mature products generally decline over time  this decline is at times offset by higher selling prices of new products 
our ability to maintain or increase the level of our average selling price is dependent on the continued development  introduction and market acceptance of new products 
see factors affecting future results 
gross margin 
our gross margin percentage was for  for  and for the decrease in gross margin percentage in was primarily due to the increased proportion of fixed manufacturing costs due to a decline in production volume 
reductions in our overall manufacturing costs and improvements in our product mix generally offset an increased proportion of fixed manufacturing costs in product mix in was favorably affected by a higher ratio of previously deferred income compared to income from direct customer sales 
reductions in manufacturing costs resulted primarily from on going yield improvements  migration of products to more advanced technologies and smaller die sizes 
research and development 
research and development expense was million for  million for  and million in research and development expenses consist primarily of labor  masks  prototype wafers  third party design automation software and assembly tooling and qualification expenses 
the increase in when compared to was primarily due to increased headcount and related spending due to our acquisition of agere fpga see note to our consolidated financial statements 
the decrease in when compared to was attributable to a decrease in discretionary spending which more than offset headcount increases 
we believe that a continued commitment to research and development is essential in order to maintain product leadership and provide innovative new product offerings  and therefore we expect to continue to make significant future investments in research and development 
selling  general and administrative 
selling  general and administrative expense was million in  million in  and million in the decrease in when compared to was primarily due to reduced revenue and associated reductions in variable costs and reductions in discretionary spending 
the decrease in when compared to was primarily due to lower variable costs associated with reduced revenue  reductions in discretionary spending and  to a lesser extent  the reversal in the third quarter of of million of reserves established in the vantis acquisition related to litigation settled in in process research and development 
ipr d consists of those products obtained through acquisition that are not yet proven to be technologically feasible but have been developed to a point where there is value associated with them in relation to potential future revenue 
because technological feasibility was not yet proven and no alternative future uses are believed to exist for the in process technologies  the assigned value was expensed immediately upon the closing date of the acquisitions 
ipr d recorded in resulted from the completion of the agere fpga and cerdelinx acquisitions described below agere fpga the fair value underlying the million assigned to acquired ipr d in the agere fpga acquisition was determined by identifying research projects in areas for which technological feasibility had not been established and there was no alternative future use 
projects in the ipr d category are the orca fpga family  the next generation fpga family and the fpsc field programmable system chips 
the following is a brief description of these projects 
the orca fpga family project  increasing speed and density and enhancing yields  was approximately complete and estimated to be completed by at an estimated cost of million 
this project was completed during with no material change in cost 
the next generation fpga family project  increasing speed and density while reducing die size  was approximately complete and estimated to be completed by at an estimated cost of million 
there has been no material change in the schedule or estimated cost of this project 
the future development of fpsc field programmable system chips field programmable system chips which combine embedded pre defined logic circuits with an fpga platform was approximately to complete  and estimated to be completed by at an estimated cost of million 
there has been no material change in the schedule or estimated cost of this project 
the ipr d value of million was determined by an income approach where fair value is the present value of projected free cash flows that will be generated by the products incorporating the acquired technologies under development  assuming they are successfully completed 
the estimated net free cash flows generated by the products over year periods were discounted at rates ranging from to percent in relation to the stage of completion and the technical risks associated with achieving technological feasibility 
the net cash flows for such projects were based on management s estimates of revenue  expenses and asset requirements 
any delays or failures in the completion of these projects could impact our expected return on investment and future results 
in addition  our financial condition would be adversely affected if the value of other intangible assets acquired became impaired 
all of these projects have completion risks related to silicon functionality  architecture performance  process technology availability  packaging technology  continued availability of key technical personnel  product reliability and availability of software support 
to the extent that estimated completion dates are not met  the risk of competitors product introductions is greater and revenue opportunity may be permanently lost 
cerdelinx the fair value underlying the million assigned to acquired ipr d from the cerdelinx acquisition was determined by identifying research projects in areas for which technological feasibility had not been established and there were no alternative future uses 
the acquired ipr d consists of low power cmos transceivers and backplane interfaces with embedded high speed serdes i o 
these products were approximately complete and are estimated to be completed in at an estimated cost of approximately million 
there has been no material change in the schedule or estimated cost of this project 
the fair value was determined by an income approach where fair value is the present value of projected free cash flows that will be generated by the products incorporating the acquired technologies under development  assuming they are successfully completed 
the estimated net free cash flows generated by the products over six year periods were discounted at rates ranging from to percent in relation to the stage of completion and the technical risks associated with achieving technological feasibility 
the net cash flows for such projects were based on management s estimates of revenue  expenses and asset requirements 
all of these projects have completion risks related to silicon functionality  architecture performance  process technology availability  packaging technology  continued availability of key technical personnel and product reliability 
to the extent that estimated completion dates are not met  the risk of competitive product introduction is greater and revenue opportunity may be permanently lost 
amortization of intangible assets 
amortization of intangible assets is related to our acquisitions  discussed above  our vantis acquisition and our acquisition of integrated intellectual property  inc ip 
amortization expense was million in  million in  and million in the decrease in amortization for compared to was due to the cessation of amortizing goodwill in see note to our consolidated financial statements which more than offset the increased amortization of intangible assets related to our acquisitions of agere fpga and cerdelinx 
the increase in amortization for as compared to was primarily due to the ip acquisition 
loss gain on foundry investments 
the gain on foundry investments recorded in the first quarter of and the loss on foundry investments recorded in the third quarter of represent equity market appreciation and subsequent impairment loss on our umc common shares 
in the september quarter  the carrying value of the umc shares was reduced as we recorded a million loss representing a decline in the market value of our umc shares 
in each quarter that the market value of the umc investment is below carrying value  we evaluate whether the investment is other than temporarily impaired 
we recorded the unrealized loss on our umc investment in the september  statement of operations 
at that time  we believed the investment was other than temporarily impaired for the following reasons it was becoming increasingly likely that the stock price would not recover based on the increasing size of the unrealized loss  the extended time period during which the stock price had continued to decline without a trend reversal  and the dampening volatility  which indicated to us that the stock price was becoming more stable  umc s financial performance had weakened relative to earlier quarters  the opinion of many industry observers and analysts regarding the semiconductor downturn had become significantly more negative  the events of september  further exacerbated market conditions  we had previously believed that umc would initiate an adr conversion program that would enable us to sell our shares at a premium on the new york stock exchange  but such a program was never initiated  and although we still had the intent and ability to hold the shares for an indefinite period  we concluded this fact did not overcome the negative factors associated with the shares 
interest income 
interest income was million in  million in  and million in the decrease in when compared to was due to lower invested balances as a result of our acquisition of agere fpga see note to our consolidated financial statements and lower interest rates on invested balances 
the increase in when compared to was attributable to overall increased cash balances generated from our follow on stock offering  completed in july  which more than offset lower interest rates on invested balances in interest expense 
interest expense was approximately million in and million in both and substantially all interest expense resulted from the debt issued to partially fund our vantis acquisition 
the decrease in when compared to and is due to the extinguishment of approximately million of our convertible notes during the year see note to our consolidated financial statements 
other income 
other income  net  was million in  million in and insignificant in for  the amount recorded consists primarily of a million gain in conjunction with the extinguishment of a portion of our convertible notes see note to our consolidated financial statements  and a million gain in conjunction with the sale of a portion of our umc shares see note to our consolidated financial statements 
provision benefit for income taxes 
the provision for income taxes for of million is primarily the result of a million charge to income tax expense recorded in the fourth quarter of  representing a full valuation allowance for our recorded deferred tax assets see note to our consolidated financial statements 
absent this charge  the benefit for income taxes in would have resulted in an effective tax rate of  as compared to a benefit for income taxes for resulting in an effective tax rate of and as compared to effective tax rate in the tax benefit in before recording the valuation allowances and the tax benefit in is the result of the pretax loss reported in the period 
the effective tax rate for  prior to recording the valuation allowances  is higher than the benefit rate for due to less tax exempt income resulting from the use of cash for our acquisition of agere fpga see note to our consolidated financial statements and lower interest rates on the invested balances 
the rate associated with the tax benefit in is higher than the provision rate in because of the proportional impact of our marginal tax rate applied to the unrealized gain in and subsequent impairment loss in related to our foundry investments see note to our consolidated financial statements in comparison to taxes on operating income and non taxable investment income 
the effective rates in and are lower than the combined federal and state statutory rates primarily because of tax exempt investment income and tax credits 
factors affecting future results a continuing downturn in the communications equipment and computing end markets has caused a reduction in demand for our products and limited our ability to maintain or increase revenue levels and operating results 
a significant portion of our revenue is derived from customers in the communications equipment and computing end markets 
a downturn in the overall global economy or in the economies of the countries where we derive significant revenue could lead to a contraction of capital spending on information technology 
this in turn could lead to a reduction in the demand for communications or computing equipment and for our products 
due to a deterioration in overall economic conditions and a significant reduction in information technology capital spending  the communications and computing end markets are currently experiencing significant and prolonged downturns 
in addition  the abrupt transition from an environment of rapid growth to the current environment in these end equipment markets resulted in an excess of inventory within our end customers 
at present and in the future when these or other similar conditions exist  there is likely to be an adverse effect on our operating results 
the cyclical nature of the semiconductor industry may limit our ability to maintain or increase revenue levels and operating results during current or future industry downturns 
the semiconductor industry is highly cyclical  to a greater extent than other less dynamic or less technology driven industries 
our financial performance has periodically been negatively affected by downturns in the semiconductor industry 
factors that contribute to these industry downturns include the cyclical nature of the demand for the products of semiconductor customers  general reductions in inventory levels by customers  excess production capacity  general decline in end user demand  and accelerated declines in average selling prices 
beginning in  the semiconductor industry experienced a significant downturn 
at present and in the future when these or other similar conditions exist  there is likely to be an adverse effect on our operating results 
we may experience unexpected difficulties integrating the field programmable gate array  or fpga  business which we recently purchased from agere 
on january   we acquired the fpga business of agere systems and are currently in the process of completing the integration of this business with our operations 
if our integration is unsuccessful  more difficult or more time consuming than originally planned  we may incur unexpected disruptions to our ongoing business 
these disruptions could harm our operating results 
further  the following specific factors may adversely affect our ability to integrate the fpga business of agere we may experience unexpected losses of key employees or customers  we may not achieve expected levels of revenue growth  we may not be able to coordinate our new product and process development in a way which permits us to bring future new products to the market in a timely manner  and we may discover unexpected liabilities 
in addition  as part of our acquisition  we entered into agreements with agere to obtain certain manufacturing support and services and future intellectual property 
these support agreements with agere do not have a material impact upon costs 
however  in the event that agere fails to provide this support and service  or provides such support and service at a level of quality and timeliness inconsistent with the historical delivery of such support and service  our ability to integrate the fpga business will be hampered and our operating results may be harmed 
we may be unsuccessful in defining  developing or selling new products required to maintain or expand our business 
as a semiconductor company  we operate in a dynamic environment marked by rapid product obsolescence 
our future success depends on our ability to introduce new or improved silicon and software products that meet customer needs while achieving acceptable margins 
if we fail to introduce these new products in a timely manner or these products fail to achieve market acceptance  our operating results would be harmed 
the introduction of new silicon and software products in a dynamic market environment presents significant business challenges 
product development commitments and expenditures must be made well in advance of product sales 
the market reception of new products depends on accurate projections of long term customer demand  which by their nature are uncertain 
our future revenue growth is dependent on market acceptance of our new silicon and software product families and the continued market acceptance of our current products 
the success of these products is dependent on a variety of specific technical factors including successful product definition  timely and efficient completion of product design  timely and efficient implementation of wafer manufacturing and assembly processes  product performance  and the quality and reliability of the product 
if  due to these or other factors  our new silicon and software products do not achieve market acceptance  our operating results would be harmed 
our products may not be competitive if we are unsuccessful in migrating our manufacturing processes to more advanced technologies or alternative fabrication facilities 
to develop new products and maintain the competitiveness of existing products  we need to migrate to more advanced wafer manufacturing processes that use larger wafer sizes and smaller device geometries 
we also may need to use additional foundries 
because we depend upon foundries to provide their facilities and support for our process technology development  we may experience delays in the availability of advanced wafer manufacturing process technologies at existing or new wafer fabrication facilities 
as a result  volume production of our advanced process technologies at the fabs of seiko epson  umc  chartered semiconductor or future foundries may not be achieved 
this could harm our operating results 
in late  umc informed us that as part of an overall capacity rationalization they were planning to close certain of their fabrication facilities 
we were developing an advanced wafer manufacturing process at one of the umc fabs that has been closed 
with umc s support  we have transferred this process to another umc fab 
however  as a result  our new product introduction schedules were delayed 
this could harm our operating results 
our marketable securities  which we hold for strategic reasons  are subject to equity price risk and their value may fluctuate 
currently we hold substantial equity in umc  which we acquired as part of a strategic investment to obtain certain manufacturing rights 
the market price and valuation of these equity shares has fluctuated widely due to market and other conditions over which we have little control 
during the year ended december   we recorded a million pre tax impairment loss related to this investment 
in the future  umc shares may continue to experience significant price volatility 
in the second quarter of  we sold a portion of our umc shares  but have otherwise not attempted to reduce or eliminate this equity price risk through hedging or similar techniques and hence substantial  sustained changes in the market price of umc shares could impact our financial results 
to the extent that the market value of our umc shares experiences a significant decline for an extended period of time  our net income could be reduced 
our future quarterly operating results may fluctuate and therefore may fail to meet expectations 
our quarterly operating results have fluctuated and may continue to fluctuate 
consequently  our operating results may fail to meet the expectations of analysts and investors 
as a result of industry conditions and the following specific factors  our quarterly operating results are more likely to fluctuate and are more difficult to predict than a typical non technology company of our size and maturity general economic conditions in the countries where we sell our products  conditions within the end markets into which we sell our products  the cyclical nature of demand for our customers products  excessive inventory accumulation by our end customers  the timing of our and our competitors new product introductions  product obsolescence  the scheduling  rescheduling and cancellation of large orders by our customers  our ability to develop new process technologies and achieve volume production at the fabs of seiko epson  umc  chartered semiconductor or at other foundries  changes in manufacturing yields  adverse movements in exchange rates  interest rates or tax rates  and the availability of adequate supply commitments from our wafer foundries and assembly and test subcontractors 
as a result of these factors  our past financial results are not necessarily a good predictor of our future results 
our stock price may continue to experience large fluctuations 
in recent years  the price of our common stock has fluctuated greatly 
these price fluctuations have been rapid and severe and have left investors little time to react 
the price of our common stock may continue to fluctuate greatly in the future due to a variety of company specific factors  including quarter to quarter variations in our operating results  shortfalls in revenue or earnings from levels expected by securities analysts  and announcements of technological innovations or new products by other companies 
presently  our stock price is trading near our consolidated book value 
a sustained decline in our stock price may result in a write off of goodwill see note to our consolidated financial statements 
our wafer supply may be interrupted or reduced  which may result in a shortage of finished products available for sale 
we do not manufacture finished silicon wafers 
currently  substantially all of our silicon wafers are manufactured by seiko epson in japan  umc in taiwan  and chartered semiconductor in singapore 
if seiko epson  through its us affiliate  epson electronics america  umc or chartered significantly interrupts or reduces our wafer supply  our operating results could be harmed 
in the past  we have experienced delays in obtaining wafers and in securing supply commitments from our foundries 
at present  we anticipate that our supply commitments are adequate 
however  these existing supply commitments may not be sufficient for us to satisfy customer demand in future periods 
additionally  notwithstanding our supply commitments we may still have difficulty in obtaining wafer deliveries consistent with the supply commitments 
we negotiate wafer prices and supply commitments from our suppliers on at least an annual basis 
if any of seiko epson  epson electronics america  umc or chartered semiconductor were to reduce its supply commitment or increase its wafer prices  and we cannot find alternative sources of wafer supply  our operating results could be harmed 
many other factors that could disrupt our wafer supply are beyond our control 
since worldwide manufacturing capacity for silicon wafers is limited and inelastic  we could be harmed by significant industry wide increases in overall wafer demand or interruptions in wafer supply 
additionally  a future disruption of seiko epson s  umc s or chartered semiconductor s foundry operations as a result of a fire  earthquake or other natural disaster could disrupt our wafer supply and could harm our operating results 
if our foundry partners experience quality or yield problems  we may face a shortage of finished products available for sale 
we depend on our foundries to deliver reliable silicon wafers with acceptable yields in a timely manner 
as is common in our industry  we have experienced wafer yield problems and delivery delays 
if our foundries are unable for a prolonged period to produce silicon wafers that meet our specifications  with acceptable yields  our operating results could be harmed 
the majority of our revenue is derived from products based on a specialized silicon wafer manufacturing process technology called e cmos 
the reliable manufacture of high performance e cmos semiconductor wafers is a complicated and technically demanding process requiring a high degree of technical skill  state of the art equipment  the absence of defects in the masks used to print circuits on a wafer  the elimination of minute impurities and errors in each step of the fabrication process  and effective cooperation between us and the wafer supplier 
as a result  our foundries may experience difficulties in achieving acceptable quality and yield levels when manufacturing our silicon wafers 
if our assembly and test subcontractors experience quality or yield problems  we may face a shortage of finished products available for sale 
we rely on subcontractors to assemble and test our devices with acceptable quality and yield levels 
as is common in our industry  we have experienced quality and yield problems in the past 
if we experience prolonged quality or yield problems in the future  our operating results could be harmed 
the majority of our revenue is derived from semiconductor devices assembled in advanced packages 
the assembly of advanced packages is a complex process requiring a high degree of technical skill  state of the art equipment  the absence of defects in lead frames used to attach semiconductor devices to the package  the elimination of raw material impurities and errors in each step of the process  and effective cooperation between us and the assembly subcontractor 
as a result  our subcontractors may experience difficulties in achieving acceptable quality and yield levels when assembling and testing our semiconductor devices 
deterioration of conditions in asia may disrupt our existing supply arrangements and result in a shortage of finished products available for sale 
all three of our major silicon wafer suppliers operate fabs located in asia 
our finished silicon wafers are assembled and tested by independent subcontractors located in china  malaysia  the philippines  south korea and taiwan 
a prolonged interruption in our supply from any of these subcontractors could harm our operating results 
economic  financial  social and political conditions in asia have historically been volatile 
financial difficulties  governmental actions or restrictions  prolonged work stoppages or any other difficulties experienced by our suppliers may disrupt our supply and could harm our operating results 
our wafer purchases from seiko epson are denominated in japanese yen 
the value of the dollar with respect to the yen fluctuates 
substantial deterioration of dollar yen exchange rates could harm our operating results 
export sales account for a substantial portion of our revenues and may decline in the future due to economic and governmental uncertainties 
our export sales are affected by unique risks frequently associated with foreign economies including changes in local economic conditions  exchange rate volatility  governmental controls and trade restrictions  export license requirements and restrictions on the export of technology  political instability or terrorism  changes in tax rates  tariffs or freight rates  interruptions in air transportation  and difficulties in staffing and managing foreign sales offices 
for example  our export sales have historically been affected by regional economic crises 
significant changes in the economic climate in the foreign countries where we derive our export sales could harm our operating results 
we may not be able to successfully compete in the highly competitive semiconductor industry 
the semiconductor industry is intensely competitive and many of our direct and indirect competitors have substantially greater financial  technological  manufacturing  marketing and sales resources 
if we are unable to compete successfully in this environment  our future results will be adversely affected 
the current level of competition in the programmable logic market is high and may increase in the future 
we currently compete directly with companies that have licensed our technology or have developed similar products 
we also compete indirectly with numerous semiconductor companies that offer products and solutions based on alternative technologies 
these direct and indirect competitors are established multinational semiconductor companies as well as emerging companies 
we also may experience significant competition from foreign companies in the future 
we may fail to retain or attract the specialized technical and management personnel required to successfully operate our business 
to a greater degree than most non technology companies or larger technology companies  our future success depends on our ability to attract and retain highly qualified technical and management personnel 
as a mid sized company  we are particularly dependent on a relatively small group of key employees 
competition for skilled technical and management employees is intense within our industry 
as a result  we may not be able to retain our existing key technical and management personnel 
in addition  we may not be able to attract additional qualified employees in the future 
if we are unable to retain existing key employees or are unable to hire new qualified employees  our operating results could be adversely affected 
if we are unable to adequately protect our intellectual property rights  our financial results and competitive position may suffer 
our success depends in part on our proprietary technology 
however  we may fail to adequately protect this technology 
as a result  we may lose our competitive position or face significant expense to protect or enforce our intellectual property rights 
we intend to continue to protect our proprietary technology through patents  copyrights and trade secrets 
despite this intention  we may not be successful in achieving adequate protection 
claims allowed on any of our patents may not be sufficiently broad to protect our technology 
patents issued to us also may be challenged  invalidated or circumvented 
finally  our competitors may develop similar technology independently 
companies in the semiconductor industry vigorously pursue their intellectual property rights 
if we become involved in protracted intellectual property disputes or litigation we may utilize substantial financial and management resources  which could have an adverse effect on our operating results 
our industry is characterized by frequent claims regarding patents and other intellectual property rights of others 
we have been  and from time to time expect to be  notified of claims that we are infringing the intellectual property rights of others 
if any third party makes a valid claim against us  we could face significant liability and could be required to make material changes to our products and processes 
in response to any claims of infringement  we may seek licenses under patents that we are alleged to be infringing 
however  we may not be able to obtain a license on favorable terms or without our operating results being adversely affected 
critical accounting policies critical accounting policies are those that are both most important to the portrayal of a company s financial condition and results and require management s most difficult  subjective and complex judgements  often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
a description of our critical accounting policies follows 
use of estimates 
the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  such as accounts receivable  inventory and deferred income taxes and liabilities  such as accrued liabilities  income taxes and deferred income  disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the fiscal periods presented 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
revenue recognition 
revenue from direct customers is recognized upon shipment provided that persuasive evidence of a sales arrangement exists  the price is fixed  title has transferred  collection of resulting receivables is probable  there are no customer acceptance requirements and no remaining significant obligations 
certain of our sales are made to distributors under agreements providing price protection and right of return on unsold merchandise 
revenue and costs relating to such distributor sales are deferred until the product is sold by the distributor and related revenue and costs are then reflected in income 
deferred income 
in determining the amount of deferred income related to sales to distributors  we make estimates regarding sales prices and margins to be earned by our distributors upon sales to our end customers 
inventory 
we value inventory at the lower of cost or market on a quarterly basis 
in addition  we write down unproven  excess and obsolete inventories to net realizable value 
to value our inventory  we make a number of estimates and assumptions including future price declines and forecasted demand for our products 
long lived assets 
we account for our long lived assets  primarily property and equipment and amortizable intangible assets  in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
sfas  accounting for the disposal of long lived assets  which requires us to review the impairment of long lived assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
impairment is measured by comparing the estimated undiscounted cash flows to the carrying amount 
a loss is recorded if the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the estimated undiscounted cash flows 
intangible assets are generally being amortized over five years  and fifteen years for income tax purposes  on a straight line basis 
accounting for income taxes 
to report income tax expense related to operating results  we record current and deferred income tax assets and liabilities in our balance sheet 
in determining the value of our deferred tax assets  we make estimates of future taxable income 
as of december   we have recorded full valuation allowances for all of our deferred tax assets due to uncertainties regarding their realization 
new accounting pronouncements in june  the fasb issued sfas  which supersedes apb opinion no 
 intangible assets 
sfas  among other things  establishes new standards for intangible assets acquired in a business combination  eliminates amortization of goodwill and sets forth requirements to periodically evaluate goodwill for impairment 
we adopted this statement during the first quarter of and thus goodwill and certain intangibles with indefinite lives are no longer being amortized 
accordingly  approximately million of previous quarterly amortization is no longer being recorded 
to apply sfas  a company is divided into separate reporting units  each representing groups of products that are separately managed 
for this purpose  we have one reporting unit 
to determine whether or not goodwill may be impaired  a test is required comparing the book value of the reporting unit to its trading price 
similar tests are required in the future  at least annually  and more often where there is a change in circumstances that could result in an impairment of goodwill 
if the trading price of our common stock is below the book value for a sustained period  a goodwill impairment test will be performed by comparing book value to estimated market value trading price plus a control premium 
the excess of book value over estimated market value will then be subtracted from the goodwill account with a resulting charge to operations 
subsequent unrealized recoveries in market value  if any  will not be recorded 
we completed an initial goodwill impairment assessment as of january  to determine if a transition impairment charge should be recognized under sfas upon assessment  no transition impairment charge was recorded 
we also completed our annual goodwill impairment assessment in december  upon which no impairment charge was recorded 
the following table presents the impact of sfas on our net income and our net income per share had the new standard been in effect for the years ended december  and year ended dec

accumulated amortization amounted to approximately million at december  we do not have any financial partnerships with unconsolidated entities  such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities  which are often established for the purpose of facilitating off balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes 
accordingly  we are not exposed to any financing  liquidity  market or credit risk that could arise if we had such relationships

future minimum lease commitments before consideration of sublease receipts discussed below at december  are as follows in thousands year amount later years included in these amounts are certain properties which are currently subleased 
a portion of this sublease income is payable to the property owner 
future minimum sublease receipts  based on agreements in place at december   net of such payments are as follows in thousands year amount we currently own approximately million shares of umc common stock

there were no repurchases of common stock in in march and as subsequently amended in january  we entered into an advance payment production agreement with seiko epson and epson electronics america  inc eea under which we agreed to advance up to approximately million  payable upon completion of specific milestones  to seiko epson to finance construction of an eight inch sub micron semiconductor wafer manufacturing facility 
under the terms of the agreement  the advance is to be repaid with semiconductor wafers over a multi year period 
no interest income is recorded 
the agreement calls for wafers to be supplied by seiko epson through eea pursuant to purchase agreements with eea 
payments of approximately million have been made under this agreement 
cumulatively  approximately million of these payments have been repaid to us in the form of semiconductor wafers 
approximately million of the outstanding advances are expected to be repaid with semiconductor wafers during fiscal year and are thus reflected as part of prepaid expenses and other current assets in our consolidated balance sheet 
we do not anticipate making additional payments under this agreement 
we believe that our existing liquid resources  expected cash generated from operations and existing credit facilities combined with our ability to borrow additional funds will be adequate to meet our operating and capital requirements and obligations for the next months  including the extinguishment of a portion of our convertible subordinated notes discussed above 
we may in the future seek new or additional sources of funding 
in addition  in order to secure additional wafer supply  we may from time to time consider various financial arrangements including joint ventures  equity investments  advance purchase payments  loans  or similar arrangements with independent wafer manufacturers in exchange for committed wafer capacity 
to the extent that we pursue any such additional financing arrangements  additional debt or equity financing may be required 
there can be no assurance that such additional financing will be available when needed or  if available  will be on favorable terms 
any future equity financing will decrease existing stockholders equity percentage ownership and may  depending on the price at which the equity is sold  result in dilution 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk as of december  and december  our investment portfolio consisted of fixed income securities of million and million  respectively 
as with all fixed income instruments  these securities are subject to interest rate risk and will decline in value if market interest rates increase 
if market rates were to increase immediately and uniformly by from levels as of december  and december   the decline in the fair value of our portfolio would not be material 
further  we have the ability to hold our fixed income investments until maturity and  therefore  we would not expect to recognize such an adverse impact in our income or cash flows 
we have international subsidiary and branch operations 
additionally  a portion of our silicon wafer purchases are denominated in japanese yen 
we therefore are subject to foreign currency rate exposure 
to mitigate rate exposure with respect to our yen denominated wafer purchases  we maintain a yen denominated bank account and bill our japanese customers in yen 
if the foreign currency rates were to fluctuate by from rates at december  and december   the effect on our consolidated financial statements would not be material 
however  there can be no assurance that there will not be a material impact in the future 
we are exposed to equity price risk due to our equity investment in umc see note to our consolidated financial statements 
neither a increase nor a further decrease in equity price related to this investment would have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements 
we have not attempted to reduce or eliminate this equity price risk through hedging or similar techniques 
as a result  sustained changes in the market price of umc shares could impact our financial results 
to the extent that the market value of our umc shares experiences further deterioration for an extended period of time  our net income could be reduced
