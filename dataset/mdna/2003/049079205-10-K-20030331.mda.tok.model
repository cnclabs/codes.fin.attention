item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations forward looking statements and analysts reports this report contains forward looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws  including statements concerning future rates  revenues  costs  capital expenditures  and financing needs and availability and statements of management s expectations and beliefs 
actual results could differ materially from these statements as a result of many factors  including future economic and political conditions in guyana  the matters discussed in the gt t regulation section of this report and in note to the consolidated financial statements included in this report 
investors should also be aware that while the company does  from time to time  communicate with securities analysts  it is against the company s policy to disclose to them any material non public information or other confidential information 
accordingly  shareholders should not assume that the company agrees with any statement or report issued by an analyst irrespective of the content of the statement or report 
furthermore  the company has a policy against issuing or confirming financial forecasts or projections issued by others 
thus  to the extent that reports issued by securities analysts contain any projections  forecasts or opinions  such reports are not the responsibility of the company 
introduction the company s revenues and income from operations are derived principally from the operations of its telephone subsidiary  gt t 
historically  gt t derived most of its revenues from international telephone services 
in  the fcc issued a report and order setting maximum international settlement rates for telecommunications traffic between the us and many countries 
this order became effective with respect to traffic between the us and guyana on january  and required that from that date the settlement rate for traffic between the us and guyana be reduced from 
per minute to 
per minute 
the international settlement rate is the amount which gt t receives from us carriers for inbound traffic from the united states and which gt t pays to us carriers for traffic from guyana to the united states 
since the volume of inbound traffic from the united states to guyana is traditionally times the volume of outbound traffic from guyana to the united states  the reduction in the international settlement rate for us guyana traffic negatively impacted gt t s operating profits 
during  the government of guyana announced its intention to introduce competition into guyana s telecommunications sector 
the company believes that the introduction of wireline based competition would require the termination of the monopoly provisions of gt t s license  and thus would require appropriate compensation to gt t and a rebalancing of rates so that the rates for each service represent the real economic cost of such services 
the company also believes that the government is considering a shifting from rate of return regulation to incentive rate cap regulation 
in february  gt t began negotiations with the government on these issues and all other outstanding issues between gt t and the government  however negotiations languished since the second quarter of the company is unable at this time to assess the impact of the government s proposals on the future financial position or results of operations of the company 
the principal components of operating expenses for the company s telephone operations are plant specific operations expenses  plant non specific operations expenses  customer operations expenses  corporate operations expenses  international long distance expenses  taxes other than income taxes and general and administrative expenses 
these categories are consistent with fcc accounting practices 
plant specific operations expenses relate to support and maintenance of telephone plant and equipment and include vehicle expense  land and building expense  central office switching expense and cable and wire expense 
plant non specific operations expenses consist of depreciation charges for telephone plant and equipment and expenses related to telephone plant and network administration  engineering  power  materials and supplies  provisioning and plant network testing 
customer operations expenses relate to marketing  providing operator services for call completion and 
table of contents directory assistance  and establishing and servicing customer accounts 
corporate operations expenses include gt t s expenses for executive management and administration  corporate planning  accounting and finance  external relations  personnel  labor relations  data processing  legal services  procurement and general insurance 
international long distance expenses consist principally of charges from international carriers for outbound international calls from guyana and payments to audiotext providers from whom gt t derives international audiotext traffic 
taxes other than income taxes include gross receipts taxes  property taxes  and other miscellaneous taxes 
general and administrative expenses consist principally of parent company overheads and amortization 
for accounting purposes  the december split up transaction of the company into two separate publicly held companies the company and the emerging communications  inc was treated as a non pro rata split off of a business in which the split off entity is to be accounted for at fair value 
the company was considered to be the split off entity since emerging communications  inc had the greater market capitalization and greater asset value immediately after the transaction  retained more of the pre transaction top management of the company and had greater net income in accordingly  the balance sheet of the company at december  was adjusted to fair value as evidenced by the market capitalization of the company immediately after the consummation of the transaction 
this adjustment included an approximately million reduction in the company s consolidated net fixed assets  and an approximately million reduction in the company s consolidated stockholders equity 
the fair value adjustment reduced the carrying value on the company s consolidated financial statements of its fixed assets significantly below their historical cost and replacement value 
therefore  depreciation expense for periods after december  is not a reliable indicator of the company s cost of replenishing its assets 
the company s consolidated financial statements include  in addition to gt t  the subsidiaries and affiliates listed in note to the consolidated financial statements included in this report 
critical accounting policies the company has based its discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations on its consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america gaap 
the company periodically evaluates its critical accounting policies and estimates  including those related to foreign currency  revenue recognition  valuation of accounts receivable  property  plant and equipment  long lived and intangible assets  tax related accruals and contingencies 
the company bases its estimates on operating experience and on various conditions existing in the market and it believes them to be reasonable under the circumstances 
those estimates form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ materially from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
the following critical accounting policies affect the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of the company s consolidated financial statements foreign currency from the period from inception of gt t s operations through december   the majority of gt t s cash receipts and expenditures have been in us dollars or other hard currencies 
accordingly  the us dollar has been gt t s functional currency 
with the decline in international settlement rates  the expansion of gt t s cellular business and the increases that gt t has received and hopes to receive in its rates for local service  the guyana dollar may become gt t s functional currency in the future 
if this were to occur  a decline in value of the guyana dollar in relation to the us dollar might have an adverse impact on the company s reported consolidated results of operations 
as of december   million of the company s million of consolidated cash and cash equivalents was denominated in the guyanese dollar 
revenue recognition local exchange service and international long distance revenues are recognized when earned  regardless of the period in which they are billed 
the company determines the country of origin of traffic it receives from foreign carriers to apply the appropriate rate to minutes of long distance traffic carried by it 
the 
table of contents company also applies estimates based on historical collections experience in estimating amounts for which revenue is not recognized 
the company s principal subsidiary operates in a regulated industry 
therefore its pricing is subject to regulatory commission oversight 
such oversight could result in changes to the amount it bills customers in current and future periods 
the company recognizes revenue from subscriptions to choice communications internet and cable service over the period that services are provided 
valuation of accounts receivable a considerable amount of judgment is required when assessing the ultimate realization of receivables  including assessing the probability of collection and the current credit worthiness of customers 
the company establishes reserves for possible unreported or uncollectible minutes from foreign carriers and doubtful accounts from customers 
the amounts the company will ultimately realize upon settlement could differ in the near term from the amounts assumed in estimating these revenues and the related accounts receivable 
property  plant and equipment the company operates in an environment where rapid changes in technology or changes in the intended use of property  plant and equipment may cause the estimated period of use or the value of these assets to change 
the company provides for depreciation using the straight line method 
with respect to the company s principal subsidiary  gt t  the cost of depreciable property retired  together with removal cost less any salvage realized  is charged to accumulated depreciation 
no gain or loss is recognized at gt t in connection with ordinary retirements of depreciable property 
as of january   gt t adopted new and generally shorter lives in connection with a tariff application filed on december  with the guyana public utilities commission 
in february  the puc accepted these lives for purposes of setting interim rates without expressly approving them  and ordered gt t not to change its depreciation rates in the future without the approval of the puc 
because gt t operates in a regulated environment  it accounts for costs in accordance with the accounting principles for regulated enterprises 
accordingly  fixed assets are depreciated over lives approved by regulators  and certain costs and obligations are deferred based on approvals received from regulators to permit recovery of such amounts in future years 
long lived and intangible assets in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for impairment or disposal of long lived assets and sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  the company evaluates the carrying value of fixed assets and intangible assets in relation to the operating performance and future undiscounted cash flows of the underlying business 
the company assesses impairments when necessary and adjusts the net book value of the underlying assets if the sum of the expected future cash flows is less than book value 
tax related accruals the company s estimate of deferred and current income taxes and the significant items giving rise to the deferred assets and liabilities are shown in note income taxes to its consolidated financial statements 
these reflect the assessment of actual current and future taxes to be paid on items reflected in the financial statements  giving consideration to both timing and probability of realization 
actual income tax could vary from these estimates due to future changes in tax law or results from final review of our tax returns by taxing authorities 
the company is also subject to tax audits from various jurisdictions 
it makes estimates based on the available information and consults with experts where necessary 
the company believes its estimates are reasonable  however  they may change materially in the future due to new developments or changes 
contingencies the company is subject to proceedings  lawsuits  audits and other claims related to lawsuits and other legal and regulatory proceedings that arise in the ordinary course of business 
it is required to assess the likelihood of any adverse judgments or outcomes to these matters as well as potential ranges of probable losses 
a determination of the amount of loss accrual required  if any  for these contingencies are made after careful analysis of each individual issue 
the company consults with legal counsel and other experts where necessary in connection with our assessment of any contingencies 
the required accrual for any such contingency may change materially in the future due to new developments or changes in each matter

the tax and regulatory issues discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements included in this report could have a material adverse impact on the company s liquidity 
gt t is not subject to any contractual restrictions on the payment of dividends 
the continued expansion of gt t s network is dependent upon the ability of gt t to purchase equipment with us dollars 
a portion of gt t s taxes in guyana may be payable in us dollars or other hard currencies 
as a result of the rate increases recently awarded to and currently sought by gt t  the order of the us fcc that reduced the settlement rate for us guyana traffic and the general trend toward lower international settlement rates  it is likely that an increasing portion of the company s revenues will be earned in guyana currency

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk although the majority of gt t s revenues and expenditures are currently transacted in us dollars or other hard currencies  the results of future operations nevertheless may be affected by changes in the value of the guyana dollar 
from february until early  the guyana dollar remained relatively stable at the rate of approximately to the us dollar 
in the guyana dollar declined in value to approximately to the us dollar 
it remained relatively stable at approximately that rate through from december   through december  the guyana dollar further declined in value to approximately to the us dollar 
through december   the value of the guyana dollar has remained stable at approximately to the us dollar 
the effect of the devaluation of the guyana dollar on the company s consolidated financial results has not been significant in the periods presented 

table of contents a substantial majority of the company s consolidated cash balances are kept in us dollar denominated short term investments  and gt t generally endeavors to maintain a balance between its guyana dollar cash deposits and local receivables which are denominated in guyana dollars  and its local tax and other payables which are also denominated in the guyana dollar 
under generally accepted international accounting principles  which  in the company s view  are statutorily applicable to the rate making process in guyana  gt t s functional currency has been the us dollar because the majority of gt t s revenues and expenditures have been transacted in us dollars 
accordingly  in the company s view  gt t is currently entitled to its agreed upon minimum return on rate base computed in us dollars on a us dollar historical cost rate base 
accordingly  devaluations of the guyana dollar should have had no long term impact on the value of gt t s earnings in us dollars 
the guyana public utility commission has neither approved nor disapproved this position of the company 
moreover  with the decline in international settlement rates and the increases that gt t hopes to have in local revenue  the guyana dollar may become gt t s functional currency at some time in the future
