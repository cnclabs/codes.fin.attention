item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations for more information about the effect of geographic concentration and the alaska economy on us 
factors that may affect our business and future results our use of leverage will reduce cash flow from operations available to fund our business and may cause a decline in our credit rating and or limit our ability to raise additional capital 
as of december   we had total outstanding debt of million 
we may incur additional indebtedness in the future as we implement our business plan  subject to limitations imposed by our credit agreements 
in connection with the execution of our business strategies  we routinely evaluate acquisition opportunities with respect to each of our business segments and we may elect to finance acquisitions by incurring additional indebtedness 
we must use a portion of our future cash flow from operations to pay the principal and interest on our indebtedness  which will reduce the funds available for our operations  including capital investments and business expenses 
this could hinder our ability to adjust to changing market and economic conditions 
if we incur significant additional indebtedness  our credit rating could be adversely affected 
as a result  our borrowing costs would likely increase and our access to capital may be adversely affected 
our credit facilities restrict our ability to incur additional indebtedness and make capital expenditures  and contain certain other restrictions on our business operations 
our existing credit facilities restrict our and certain of our subsidiaries ability to incur additional indebtedness  make certain capital expenditures  pay dividends or make certain other restricted payments  consummate certain asset sales  enter into certain transactions with affiliates and incur liens 
these credit facilities also impose restrictions on the ability of a subsidiary to pay dividends or make certain payments to us  merge or consolidate with any other person or sell  assign  transfer  lease  convey or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all of our assets 
these credit facilities also require that we maintain certain financial ratios 
a breach of any of these covenants could result in a default under the credit facilities 
our current business strategy includes the acquisition of additional assets and the expansion of our existing businesses and service offerings 
in addition  our business strategy may in the future be expanded to include activities outside the state of alaska 
it is possible that our current and future expansion and growth plans will require significant additional capital in excess of capital generated from operations and will result in significant capital expenditures 
if we are unable to negotiate modifications to these restrictions  they could hinder our ability to follow through with expansion and growth plans 
we have a history of operating losses 
if we do not maintain profitability  we may be unable to make capital expenditures necessary to implement our business plan  meet our debt service requirements or otherwise conduct our business in an effective and competitive manner 
this would require us to divert cash from other uses  which may not be possible or may detract from the growth of our businesses 
these events could limit our ability to increase our revenues and net income or cause these amounts to decline 
we depend on a small number of customers for a substantial portion of our revenue and business 
as previously described see part i  item business  long distance services  customers  services that we provide to worldcom and to sprint contribute significantly to our total revenues 
these two customers are free to seek out long distance communication services from our competitors upon expiration of their contracts in march  in the case of worldcom  subject to reaffirmation of the contract in the bankruptcy process  and in march  in the case of sprint or earlier upon a default or the occurrence of certain events 
these events are a force majeure event or a substantial change in applicable law or regulation under the applicable contract 
the impact of worldcom s bankruptcy filing on us 
we provide long distance and other services to worldcom  a related party and a major customer  as further described in notes and to the notes to consolidated financial statements included in part ii of this report 
on july  worldcom and substantially all of its active us subsidiaries filed voluntary petitions for reorganization under chapter of the us bankruptcy code in the united states bankruptcy court 
chapter allows a company to continue operating in the ordinary course of business in order to maximize recovery for the company s creditors and shareholders 
the filings have enabled worldcom to continue to conduct business while it develops a reorganization plan 
through december  we have recognized a million bad debt reserve for uncollected balances due from worldcom as of july  we currently cannot predict the timing or amount that worldcom will pay on outstanding balances due us as of their bankruptcy filing date 
a conversion of worldcom s bankruptcy petition to chapter  unfavorable reaffirmation or cancellation of our pre filing contracts and agreements with worldcom  or a migration of worldcom s traffic off our network without it being replaced by other common carriers that interconnect with our network could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
we expect that our contract with worldcom will ultimately be reaffirmed and that we will work out some form of agreement with respect to the pre petition receivables balance and that worldcom will ultimately exit bankruptcy with their business intact 
we cannot predict how long it may take worldcom to work their way through the bankruptcy process or what effect the process or the economy may have on their traffic levels and ultimately  their requirements for service in alaska 
mergers and acquisitions in the telecommunications industry are relatively common 
if a change in control of worldcom or sprint were to occur  it would not permit them to terminate their existing contracts with us  but could in the future result in the termination of or a material adverse change in our relationships with worldcom or sprint 
in addition  worldcom and sprint s need for our long distance services depends directly upon their ability to obtain and retain their own long distance customers and upon the needs of those customers for long distance services 
the loss of one or both of worldcom or sprint as customers  a material adverse change in our relationships with them or a material loss of or reduction in their long distance customers would have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
we depend on a limited number of third party vendors to supply telecommunications equipment 
we depend on a limited number of third party vendors to supply cable  internet and telephony related equipment 
if our providers of this equipment are unable to timely supply the equipment necessary to meet our needs or provide them at an acceptable cost  we may not be able to satisfy demand for our services and competitors may fulfill this demand 
prolonged service interruptions could affect our business 
we rely heavily on our network equipment  telecommunications providers  data and software  to support all of our functions 
we rely on our networks and the networks of others for substantially all of our revenues 
we are able to deliver services only to the extent that we can protect our network systems against damage from power or telecommunication failures  computer viruses  natural disasters  unauthorized access and other disruptions 
while we endeavor to provide for failures in the network by providing back up systems and procedures  we cannot guarantee that these back up systems and procedures will operate satisfactorily in an emergency 
should we experience a prolonged failure  it could seriously jeopardize our ability to continue operations 
in particular  should a significant service interruption occur  our ongoing customers may choose a different provider  and our reputation may be damaged  reducing our attractiveness to new customers 
to the extent that any disruption or security breach results in a loss or damage to our customers data or applications  or inappropriate disclosure of confidential information  we may incur liability and suffer from adverse publicity 
in addition  we may incur additional costs to remedy the damage caused by these disruptions or security breaches 
certain of our major switching centers and transmission hubs carry significant concentrations of our traffic 
while we have followed industry practices to construct  secure and protect these facilities from extended power outages  fire  earthquakes  and other natural or man made disasters  such an event could result in an extended outage for a significant portion of our traffic 
such an extended outage could have a material impact on our business and results of operations 
if a failure occurs in our undersea fiber optic cable  our ability to immediately restore the entirety of our service may be limited 
our telecommunications facilities include an undersea fiber optic cable that carries a large portion of our internet voice and data traffic to and from the contiguous lower states 
we have obtained what we believe is adequate backup capacity through early and continue to seek arrangements to obtain alternative telecommunications facilities as backup facilities 
if a failure of our undersea fiber optic facilities occurs before we are able to secure adequate backup facilities  some of the telecommunications services we offer to our customers could be interrupted  which could have a material impact on our business and results of operations 
we serve many rural and remote alaska locations solely via satellite communications 
each of our c and ku band satellite transponders is backed up on the same spacecraft with multiple backup transponders 
we have arranged for backup satellite capacity on another spacecraft for all of our current c band satellite transponders in the unlikely event of a total primary spacecraft failure 
if such a failure occurs  service may not be fully restored for up to a week or longer 
due to variations in satellite earth coverage and other technical performance differences between the primary satellite and the backup satellite  a small percentage of our services may not be restorable on the backup satellite 
we own one ku band satellite transponder on the same primary spacecraft that provides our c band service 
in the event of total primary spacecraft failure  we would not be able to restore our ku band transponder traffic  as no other spacecraft offering is presently suitable and similar performance coverage of alaska on which we have prior arranged restoration services 
panamsat has announced plans to launch and place in service during a spacecraft with identical performance to our current primary spacecraft which could provide us with ku band and additional c band backup capacity at that time 
our businesses are currently geographically concentrated in alaska 
we offer a variety of voice  video and data services to residential  commercial and governmental customers in the state of alaska 
because of this geographic concentration  our growth and operations depend in part upon economic conditions in alaska 
we may not be able to continue to increase our market share of the existing markets for our services and no assurance can be given that the alaskan economy will continue to grow and increase the size of the markets we serve or increase the demand for the services we offer 
you should see part ii  item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations for more information 
our best growth opportunities may be in geographic areas that differ from those of our existing businesses 
we have achieved significant market penetration in the state of alaska for many of the services we offer 
however  opportunities for expanding our market geographically in the state of alaska or attaining significant additional market penetration in the state of alaska are limited 
as a result  the best opportunities for expanding our business may arise in other geographic areas such as the contiguous lower states 
there can be no assurance that we will find attractive opportunities to grow our businesses outside the state of alaska or that we will have the necessary expertise to take advantage of such opportunities 
the alaska voice  video and data telecommunications markets are unique and distinct within the united states due to alaska s large geographical size and its distance from the rest of the united states 
the expertise we have developed in operating our businesses in the state of alaska may not provide us with the necessary expertise to successfully enter other geographic markets 
we may fail to develop our wireless services 
we offer wireless mobile services by reselling other providers wireless mobile services 
we offer wireless local telephone services over our own facilities  and have purchased pcs and lmds wireless broadband licenses in fcc auctions covering markets in alaska 
we have fewer subscribers to our wireless services than to our other service offerings 
the geographic coverage of our wireless services is also smaller than the geographic coverage of our other services 
some of our competitors offer or propose to offer an integrated bundle of communications  entertainment and information services  including wireless services 
if we are unable to expand and further develop our wireless services  we may not be able to meet the needs of customers who desire packaged services  and our competitors who offer theses services would have an advantage 
this could result in the loss of market share for our other service offerings 
our efforts to develop cable telephony may be unsuccessful 
an element of our business strategy is to develop voice telephone service utilizing our coaxial cable facilities 
if we are able to develop this service  we will be able to utilize our own cable facilities to provide local access to our customers and avoid paying local loop charges to ilecs 
in order to successfully develop and market this new service  we must integrate new technology with our existing facilities 
the viability of this service depends on the availability of the equipment necessary to provide the service at cost effective prices 
the development and marketing of this service will require a substantial capital investment 
if we are unable to successfully develop and market voice telephone service  we will not be able to fully recover any capital investment we may make and the margins on our local telephone services business will not improve 
we do not have insurance to cover certain risks to which we are subject 
we are self insured for damage or loss to certain of our transmission facilities  including our buried  under sea  and above ground transmission lines 
we self insure with respect to employee health insurance and workers compensation  subject to stop loss insurance with other parties that caps our liability at specified limits 
if we become subject to substantial uninsured liabilities  our financial results may be adversely affected 
economic and security impacts on telecommunications 
the economic stagnation in the united states began with a decline in business capital spending and investment 
businesses continue to limit spending on equipment  software  real estate  inventories and other investments 
the terrorist attacks on america on september  and their aftermath worsened already deteriorating economic conditions 
recent economic indicators reflect an improving economy  however concerns over war and renewed terrorist threats continue to mute economic growth and optimism 
the telecommunications sector has been significantly impacted by the recent economic downturn 
the nasdaq telecommunications index through february has dropped from the high reached in february  including a drop during investors reportedly fear that carriers with high debt loads may face liquidity crises 
the telecommunications sector has been affected by such liquidity concerns  bankruptcy filings of worldcom  global crossing ltd 
and mcleodusa inc  and concerns about the possibility of improper accounting 
the economic stagnation in the lower states appears to have dampened demand for services provided by our large common carrier customers 
to the extent that these customers experience reduced demand for traffic destined for and originating in alaska  it could adversely affect our common carrier traffic 
a protracted economic malaise in the lower states or a further disruption in the economy resulting from a war or renewed terrorist activity could affect our carrier customers which  in turn  could affect our revenues and cash flows 
if the economic conditions in the united states worsen or if a wider or global economic slowdown occurs  our results of operations and financial condition may be adversely affected 
as our business has grown  we have become increasingly subject to adverse changes in general economic conditions and economic conditions in the state of alaska  which can result in reductions in capital expenditures by customers  longer sales cycles  deferral or delay of purchase commitments for products or services and increased price competition 
although these factors have not materially affected us in recent years  if the current economic slowdown continues or worsens  these factors could adversely affect our business and results of operations 
with the terrorist events of september  the fcc and the communications community are determining their respective roles in ensuring homeland security 
the fcc s principal objectives are reportedly to secure the us s communications infrastructure and to enhance emergency response through communications 
expected fcc actions include re chartering the network reliability and interoperability council nric  consideration of a media counter part to nric  working with other agencies to ensure network protection  reliability and redundancy  continuing efforts to solve remaining public safety spectrum issues  continuing to work on interoperability restraints  continuing to address emergency issues  and working with other agencies on wireless priority access that balances the need for government response and critical needs of subscribers 
sales of a substantial number of shares of class a common stock  or the perception that such sales may occur  could cause the market price of class a common stock to decline and impede our ability to raise capital through sales of class a common stock or securities convertible into or exercisable for class a common stock 
a significant percentage of our voting securities are held by a small number of shareholders and these shareholders can control stockholder decisions on very important matters 
as of december   worldcom owned approximately and our executive officers and directors and their affiliates owned approximately of our combined outstanding class a and class b common stock 
because each share of class a common stock has one vote per share and each share of class b common stock has ten votes per share  worldcom and our executive officers and directors and their affiliates have approximately of the combined voting power of that stock including outstanding series b preferred stock voting with class a common stock on an as converted basis 
these shareholders can significantly influence if not control our management policy and all fundamental corporate actions  including mergers  substantial acquisitions and dispositions  and election of directors to the board 
this concentration of ownership may have the effect of discouraging third parties from making bids for us  delaying or preventing a change of control  or reducing premiums paid to our shareholders for their stock and could have an adverse effect on the market price of our class a common stock 
it may be difficult for a third party to acquire us  even if doing so may be beneficial to our shareholders 
certain provisions of our restated articles of incorporation may discourage  delay or prevent a change in control of our company that a shareholder may consider favorable 
these provisions include the following o authorizing our board of directors to issue preferred stock under terms developed by the board  which could increase the number of outstanding shares and thwart a takeover attempt  and o classifying our board of directors with staggered three year terms  which may lengthen the time required to gain control of our board of directors 
it is unlikely shareholders will receive a return on their shares through the payment of a cash dividend 
we have never declared or paid cash dividends on any of our common stock and have no intention of doing so in the foreseeable future 
as a result  it is unlikely that shareholders will receive a return on their shares through the payment of cash dividends 
if we are required to account for the market value of stock options as compensation expense  our net income and earnings per share will be significantly reduced 
this topic is currently under reexamination by accounting standards setters and regulators 
some companies have begun to account for stock options as a compensation expense thus resulting in a reduction of their net income and earnings per share 
we currently record compensation expense to the extent that stock options are priced below market value at the time of grant 
it is possible that future laws and regulations will require us to record the full fair market value of all stock options as a compensation expense in our consolidated financial statements 
if such a change occurs  our net income and earnings per share would be significantly reduced 
see notes t  u and to the notes to consolidated financial statements included in part ii of this report 
employees we employed  persons as of january   and are not parties to union contracts with our employees 
we believe our future success will depend upon our continued ability to attract and retain highly skilled and qualified employees 
we believe that relations with our employees are satisfactory 
other no material portion of our businesses is subject to renegotiation of profits or termination of contracts at the election of the federal government

management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations discusses our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates and judgments  including those related to unbilled revenues  long distance cost of sales and services accruals  allowance for doubtful accounts  depreciation and amortization periods  intangible assets  income taxes  and contingencies and litigation 
we base our estimates and judgments on historical experience and on various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions

general overview we have experienced significant growth in recent years through strategic acquisitions  deploying new business lines and expansion of our existing businesses 
we have historically met our cash needs for operations  regular capital expenditures and maintenance capital expenditures through our cash flows from operating activities 
cash requirements for significant acquisitions and major capital expenditures have been provided largely through our financing activities 
consolidated revenues increased by more than million in as compared to  or almost million from core operations if the million fiber sale is excluded 
our operating income increased by in this increase occurred in spite of our recording bad debt expense in of million related to our worldcom receivables  and because we discontinued the amortization of goodwill and cable certificates upon the adoption of sfas  goodwill and other intangible assets on january  adoption of sfas resulted in a decrease in amortization expense of approximately million as compared to our pre tax income increased by and our net income increased by 
excluding the fiber sale  our four business segments experienced year over year growth in units and revenues as we continued to strengthen our position in the markets we serve 
operating income increased in the long distance services and cable services segments  and decreased in the local access services and internet services segments 
basic and diluted earnings per share increased by in as compared to long distance services overview during long distance services revenue represented of consolidated revenues 
our provision of interstate and intrastate long distance services  private line and leased dedicated capacity services  and broadband services accounted for of our total long distance services revenues during factors that have the greatest impact on year to year changes in long distance services revenues include the rate per minute charged to customers  usage volumes expressed as minutes of use  and the number of private line  leased dedicated service and broadband products in use 
our long distance services segment faces significant competition from at t alascom  inc  long distance resellers  and local telephone companies that have entered the long distance market 
we believe our approach to developing  pricing  and providing long distance services and bundling different business segment services will continue to allow us to be competitive in providing those services 
our contract to provide interstate and intrastate long distance services to sprint was replaced in march extending its term to march with two one year automatic extensions to march beginning in april the new contract reduced the rate to be charged by us for certain sprint traffic over the extended term of the contract 
other common carrier traffic routed to us for termination in alaska is largely dependent on traffic routed to worldcom and sprint by their customers 
pricing pressures  general economic deterioration  new program offerings  business failures  and market consolidation continue to evolve in the markets served by worldcom and sprint 
if  as a result  their traffic is reduced  or if their competitors costs to terminate or originate traffic in alaska are reduced  our traffic will also likely be reduced  and our pricing may be reduced to respond to competitive pressures 
we are unable to predict the effect on us of such changes  however given the materiality of other common carrier revenues to us  a significant reduction in traffic or pricing could have a material adverse effect on our financial position  results of operations and liquidity 
see note in the accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements for a discussion of worldcom s chapter bankruptcy filing 
due in large part to the favorable synergistic effects of our integrated approach  the long distance segment continues to be a significant contributor to our overall performance  although the migration of traffic from voice to data continues 
cable services overview during  cable television revenues represented of consolidated revenues 
our cable systems serve communities and areas in alaska  including the state s three largest population centers  anchorage  fairbanks and juneau 
we generate cable services revenues from four primary sources digital and analog programming services  including monthly basic or premium subscriptions and pay per view movies or other one time events  such as sporting events  equipment rentals and installation  cable modem services shared with our internet services segment  and advertising sales 
during programming services generated of total cable services revenues  equipment rental and installation fees accounted for of such revenues  cable services allocable share of cable modem services accounted for of such revenues  advertising sales accounted for of such revenues  and other services accounted for the remaining of total cable services revenues 
the primary factors that contribute to year to year changes in cable services revenues are average monthly subscription and pay per view rates  the mix among basic  premium and pay per view services and digital and analog services  the average number of cable television and cable modem subscribers during a given reporting period  and revenues generated from new product offerings 
our cable services segment faces competition from alternative methods of receiving and distributing television signals and from other sources of news  information and entertainment 
we believe our cable television services will continue to be competitive by providing  at reasonable prices  a greater variety of programming and other communication services than are available off air or through other alternative delivery sources and superior technical performance and responsive local customer service 
local access services overview we generate local access services revenues from three primary sources business and residential basic dial tone services  business private line and special access services  and business and residential features and other charges  including voice mail  caller id  distinctive ring  inside wiring and subscriber line charges 
during local exchange services revenues represented of consolidated revenues

see the discussions below for more information by segment 
long distance services segment revenues long distance services segment revenues increased to million in message telephone service revenue from common carrier customers message telephone service revenues from other common carriers principally worldcom and sprint increased to million in resulting from a increase in wholesale minutes carried to million minutes 
after excluding certain low margin wholesale minutes no longer carried for other common carriers  comparable wholesale minutes carried for other common carriers increased over the prior year 
revenue increases resulting from increased wholesale minutes carried for other common carriers was partially off set by a decrease in the average rate per minute on minutes carried for other common carriers 
the increase is also due to the reclassification of approximately million minutes of traffic generated by a certain customer from retail in to wholesale in the average rate per minute decrease is primarily due to a reduced rate charged by us for certain sprint traffic due to a new contract commencing april after excluding certain low margin wholesale minutes not carried in for other common carriers  the comparable average rate per minute decreased from the prior year 
revenues from and minutes carried for worldcom increased in as compared to the economic stagnation in the lower states appears to have dampened demand for services provided by our large common carrier customers 
to the extent that these customers experience reduced demand for traffic destined for and originating in alaska  it could adversely affect our common carrier traffic 
a protracted economic malaise in the lower states or a further disruption in the economy resulting from a war or renewed terrorist activity could affect our carrier customers which  in turn  could affect our revenues and cash flows 
we believe that our contract with worldcom will ultimately be reaffirmed and that we will develop an agreement with respect to the pre petition receivables balance and that worldcom may ultimately exit bankruptcy with their business intact 
we cannot predict how long it may take worldcom to complete the bankruptcy process or what effect the process or the economy may have on their traffic levels and ultimately  their requirements for service to and from alaska 
message telephone service revenue from residential  commercial and governmental customers message telephone service revenues from residential  commercial  and governmental customers decreased to million in primarily due to the following o a decrease in retail minutes carried for these customers to million minutes 
the decrease is primarily due to the loss of approximately million to million minutes earned annually from a certain retail customer and the reclassification of approximately million minutes of traffic generated by a certain customer from retail in to wholesale in  and o a decrease in the average rate per minute to per minute paid by these customers due to our promotion of and customers enrollment in calling plans offering a certain number of minutes for a flat monthly fee 
through may discounts recognized on revenue from certain private line and private network customers totaling million off set message telephone service revenue from residential  commercial and governmental customers 
beginning june these discounts off set revenue from private line and private network customers 
if these discounts had not been recognized in the message telephone service revenue from residential  commercial and governmental customers through may  revenues would have decreased to million in as compared to the decreases in message telephone service revenues from residential  commercial  and governmental customers described above are partially off set by a increase in the number of active residential  commercial  and governmental customers billed to  at december  revenue from private line and private network customers private line and private network transmission services revenues increased to million in the increase is partially off set by the effect of a reclassification of discounts recognized on revenue from certain private line and private network customers 
through may these discounts totaled approximately million and off set message telephone service revenue from residential  commercial and governmental customers  beginning july these discounts off set revenue from private line and private network customers 
if the discounts had been recognized in revenue from private line and private network customers during all of the increase in revenue would be to million 
the increase in revenue from private line and private network customers in is primarily due to an increased number of circuits leased by governmental customers 
revenue from broadband customers revenues from our packaged telecommunications offering to rural hospital and health clinic service and our schoolaccess tm offering to rural school districts increased in to million 
the increase is primarily due to the addition in the second quarter of of two new subscribers to our rural hospital and health clinic service for which we recognized a full year of revenue in  and our new schoolaccess tm offering called distance learning that started in late distance learning is a video conference based service and is used by six school districts in alaska 
long distance services segment cost of sales and services long distance services segment cost of sales and services decreased to million in long distance services segment cost of sales and services as a percentage of long distance services segment revenues decreased from in to in primarily due to the following o reductions in access costs due to distribution and termination of our traffic on our own local access services network instead of paying other carriers to distribute and terminate our traffic 
the statewide average cost savings is approximately 
and 
per minute for interstate and intrastate traffic  respectively 
we expect cost savings to continue to occur as long distance traffic originated  carried  and terminated on our own facilities grows  o the fcc multi association group mag reform order reducing the interstate access rates paid by interexchange carriers to lecs in january and again in july  and o in the course of business we estimate unbilled long distance services cost of sales and services based upon minutes of use processed through our network and established rates 
such estimates are revised when subsequent billings are received  payments are made  billing matters are researched and resolved  tariffed billing periods lapse  or when disputed charges are resolved 
in and  we had favorable and unfavorable adjustments of million and million  respectively 
excluding the adjustments  long distance services cost of sales and services as a percentage of long distance services revenues was and in and  respectively 
long distance services cost of sales and services in included a reversal of million in accrued costs upon the conclusion of a dispute with acs and a  non recurring refund from acs in respect of its earnings that exceeded regulatory requirements 
cable services segment revenues and cost of sales and services cable services segment revenues increased to million and average gross revenue per average basic subscriber per month increased or in the increases in revenues and rates per subscriber were accomplished without any meaningful rate increases during and are due primarily to continued deployment of our high value services including digital cable television and cable modems 
programming services revenues increased to million in resulting from the following o basic subscribers served increased approximately  to approximately  at december  as compared to december   o new facility construction efforts in resulted in approximately  additional homes passed  a increase from  and o digital subscriber counts increased to approximately  at december  as compared to december  programming services revenues from digital subscribers increased or million from to effective february  we increased rates charged for certain cable services and premium packages in six communities  including the state s three largest population centers anchorage  fairbanks and juneau 
the cable services segment s share of cable modem revenue offered through our internet services segment increased million to million in due to an increased number of cable modems deployed 
approximately of our cable homes passed are able to subscribe to our cable modem service 
we expect that that number will increase to approximately when we complete our upgrade of the ketchikan cable system which we expect to accomplish in we now offer digital programming in anchorage  fairbanks  juneau  kenai  and soldotna  which markets represent approximately of our homes passed at december  we signed new seven year retransmission agreements with the five local anchorage broadcasters and began up linking and distributing the local anchorage programming to all of our cable systems 
this was done to provide additional value to our cable subscribers and to allow us to differentiate our programming from that of our dbs competitors 
in addition  we have been successful in growing advertising revenues from our statewide advertising platform 
our ad insertion revenues increased approximately in cable services cost of sales and services increased to million in cable services cost of sales and services as a percentage of cable services revenues  which is less as a percentage of revenues than are long distance  local access and internet services cost of sales and services  decreased from in to in revenues earned from equipment rental and installation  cable services allocable share of cable modem services and advertising sales do not have significant corresponding costs of sales and services 
the decrease in cable services cost of sales and services as a percentage of cable services revenues is primarily due to an increase in the percentage of cable services revenues earned from equipment rental and installation  cable services allocable share of cable modem services and advertising sales from in to in the decrease in cable services cost of sales and services as a percentage of cable services revenues described above is off set by an increase in cable programming services cost of sales and services as a percentage of cable programming services revenue from in to in cable services rate increases did not keep pace with programming cost increases in programming costs increased for most of our cable services offerings  and we incurred additional costs on new programming introduced in and local access services segment revenues and cost of sales and services local access services segment revenues increased in to million primarily due to growth in the average number of customers served 
at december  an estimated  lines were in service as compared to approximately  lines in service at december  we estimate that our lines in service total represents a statewide market share of approximately 
at december  approximately  additional lines were awaiting connection 
the increase in local access services revenues described above was partially off set by the following o the fcc mag reform order reducing the interstate access rates paid by interexchange carriers to lecs in january and again in july  and o a reduction in interstate access rates charged by us to interexchange carriers in response to an fcc order forcing a competitor to reduce their interstate access rates 
local access services cost of sales and services increased to million in local access services cost of sales and services as a percentage of local access services revenues increased from in to in  primarily due to the following o decreased network access services revenues from other carriers as the number of customers purchasing both long distance and local access services from us increases  o an increase in the anchorage loop lease rates and residential wholesale rates paid to acs as described below  o the effect of offering one to two months of free service to significant numbers of new local access services customers acquired in while continuing to incur cost of sales and services for such new customers  and o the lease of wholesale circuits from acs in fairbanks and juneau pending completion of our facilities enabling service transition to une facilities and pricing 
the increases in local access services cost of sales and services as a percentage of local access services revenues described above are partially offset by further economies of scale and more efficient network utilization as the number of local access services subscribers and resulting revenues increase 
our access line mix continued to hold steady in  with residential lines representing approximately of our lines  business customers representing approximately  and internet access customers representing approximately 
approximately of our lines are provided on our own facilities or using leased local loops 
in anchorage  acs requested and received permission for a increase in the une loop rate to per month and a increase in their retail residential rates  both effective in november the wholesale service rate we pay is tied to the retail residential rate and increased approximately per line per month 
additionally  the cost of most residential features increased to approximately per line per month 
the increased rates resulted in an approximately million increase in our local access services cost of sales and services in the size of the local access services segment operating loss is exacerbated by the allocation of the benefit of access cost savings to the long distance services segment 
if the local access services segment received credit for the access charge reductions recorded by the long distance services segment  the local access services segment operating loss would have decreased by approximately million and the long distance services segment would be reduced by an equal amount in avoided access charges totaled approximately million during as compared to in the local access services segment operating loss is affected by the expected start up losses we are experiencing in the new fairbanks and juneau markets and our continued evaluation and testing of ip cable telephony technology 
internet services segment revenues and cost of sales and services internet services segment revenues increased to million in primarily due to growth in the number of customers served and the number of cable modems deployed 
we had approximately  internet subscribers at december  as compared to approximately  at december   of which approximately  are cable modem subscribers at december  as compared to approximately  at december  the internet services segment s allocable share of cable modem revenues increased to million in as compared to the internet services segment does not share in plan fee revenues associated with our bundled internet and long distance service package 
estimated annual plan fees related to this service offering is in excess of million per year and those revenues are included in the long distance services segment 
internet services cost of sales and services increased to million in  and as a percentage of internet services revenues  totaled and in and  respectively 
the decrease as a percentage of internet services revenues is primarily due to a million increase in internet s portion of cable modem revenue to million that generally has higher margins than do other internet services products 
as internet services revenues increase  economies of scale and more efficient network utilization continue to result in reduced internet cost of sales and services as a percentage of revenues 
we enhanced the value of our internet offerings in through the addition of electronic billing and presentment capabilities and the rollout of a product called e mail guard  which filters out e mail spam and viruses 
we upgraded the download speeds of all of our cable modem internet service offerings 
these new services and enhancements have proven to be very popular with our customers and are helping to further solidify our customer relationships 
all other revenues and costs of sales and services the decrease in all other revenues to million in is primarily due to the million fiber system capacity sale in  as described in note o in the accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements 
the decrease in revenues is partially offset by a million increase in managed services revenue to million in primarily due to the provision of additional services to and increased revenues from a certain customer as performance criteria was met

at december   we have tax net operating loss carryforwards of approximately million that will begin expiring in if not utilized  and alternative minimum tax credit carryforwards of approximately million available to offset regular income taxes payable in future years 
our utilization of remaining net operating loss carryforwards is subject to certain limitations pursuant to internal revenue code section tax benefits associated with recorded deferred tax assets are considered to be more likely than not realizable through future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences and future taxable income exclusive of reversing temporary differences and carryforwards 
the amount of deferred tax asset considered realizable  however  could be reduced in the near term if estimates of future taxable income during the carryforward period are reduced which would result in additional income tax expense

long distance services segment revenues and cost of sales and services in the fourth quarter long distance services segment revenues decreased to million 
the decrease primarily resulted from a decrease in long distance services revenues from residential  commercial  governmental  and other common carrier customers 
revenues from other common carriers decreased to million primarily due to the following o a decrease of approximately million due to a loss of minutes carried for other common carriers 
the decline in revenues and minutes is due in part to the substitution effects that are being experienced by other common carriers including worldcom and sprint 
in the past  these effects on us were partially off set by the strong growth in our wholesale other common carrier traffic 
during the fourth quarter of  in addition to expected seasonality  our wholesale other common carrier traffic was affected by the weak lower economy and changes in the carrier market  o a decrease in minutes carried for other common carriers to million minutes  o a decrease in the average rate per minute on minutes carried for other common carriers  and o a  incentive credit provided to an other common carrier customer in the fourth quarter of revenues from residential  commercial  and governmental customers decreased to million primarily due to the following o a decrease in the average rate per minute to per minute paid by residential  commercial and governmental customers  and o a decrease in retail minutes carried for residential  commercial and governmental customers to million minutes long distance revenues have historically been highest in the summer months because of temporary population increases attributable to tourism and increased seasonal economic activity such as construction  commercial fishing  and oil and gas activities 
long distance services cost of sales and services decreased to million in the fourth quarter 
long distance services cost of sales and services as a percentage of long distance services revenues increased from in third quarter to in fourth quarter primarily due to the following o the  incentive credit provided during the fourth quarter as previously described  o the effect of seasonality which resulted in a decrease in long distance service revenues in the fourth quarter with no corresponding decrease in certain fixed cost of sales and services  o increased costs associated with additional transponder and network backup capacity incurred in the fourth quarter  and o reduced revenues from worldcom and sprint of approximately million in the fourth quarter  as described above 
some of these revenues have a lower cost of sales and services as a percentage of revenues as compared to revenues from other traffic we carry 
cable services segment revenues and cost of sales and services cable services segment revenues increased to million and average gross revenue per average basic subscriber per month increased or in fourth quarter 
programming services revenues increased to million in fourth quarter resulting from the following o basic subscribers served increased approximately  to approximately  at december  as compared to september   o new facility construction efforts in resulted in approximately  additional homes passed  a increase from september   and o digital subscriber counts increased to approximately  at december  as compared to september  revenue from digital subscribers increased approximately or  from to the increase in number of basic subscribers is attributed primarily to the effects of normal seasonality 
cable programming services revenues have historically been highest in the winter months because consumers spend more time at home and tend to watch more television during these months 
the cable services segment s share of cable modem revenue offered through our internet services segment increased  to million in fourth quarter due to an increased number of cable modems deployed

equipment rental and installation  cable services allocable share of cable modem services and advertising sales revenues do not have corresponding costs of sales and services 
the decrease in cable services cost of sales and services as a percentage of cable revenues is primarily due to an increase in the percentage of cable revenues earned from equipment rental and installation  cable services allocable share of cable modem services  and advertising sales revenues from in third quarter to in fourth quarter 
increasing revenues from our new high value services are helping mitigate the effect of increasing programming costs on our margins 
local access services segment revenues and cost of sales and services local access services segment revenues increased  in the fourth quarter to million primarily due to growth in the average number of customers served 
at december  an estimated  lines were in service as compared to approximately  lines in service at september  local access services segment cost of sales and services decreased  to million in the fourth quarter 
local access services segment cost of sales and services as a percentage of local access services segment revenues decreased from in the third quarter to in the fourth quarter 
internet services segment revenues and cost of sales and services internet services segment revenues increased  to million in the fourth quarter primarily due to growth in the number of customers served and the number of cable modems deployed 
we had approximately  internet subscribers at december  as compared to approximately  at september   of which approximately  are cable modem subscribers at december  as compared to approximately  at september  the internet services segment s allocable share of cable modem revenues increased  to million in the fourth quarter as compared to the third quarter 
internet services cost of sales and services was million in the third and fourth quarters  and as a percentage of internet services revenues  totaled and in the third and fourth quarters  respectively 
all other revenues and costs of sales and services all other revenues increased  to million in the fourth quarter primarily due to the provision of additional services to and increased revenues from a certain customer 
all other costs of sales increased  to million in the fourth quarter  and as a percentage of all other revenues  totaled and in the third and fourth quarters  respectively 
selling  general and administrative expenses selling  general and administrative expenses increased  to million in the fourth quarter as compared to the third quarter 
as a percentage of revenues  fourth quarter selling  general and administrative expenses were as compared to for the third quarter 
the fourth quarter increase in selling  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenues is primarily due to increased labor costs 
bad debt expense bad debt expense decreased million to  in the fourth quarter as compared to the third quarter 
as a percentage of revenues  fourth quarter bad debt expense was as compared to for the third quarter 
the third quarter included a million bad debt expense for uncollected accounts due from worldcom  no additional bad debt expense for uncollected accounts due from worldcom was recognized in the fourth quarter 
other expense  net other expense  net of other income  increased to million due to the following o a increase in interest expense to million in the fourth quarter as compared to the third quarter due to the increased interest rate paid on our new senior facility starting november   o recognition of million in unamortized deferred loan fees upon the refinance of our senior holdings loan and fiber facility on november   and o increased deferred loan fees from our senior facility starting november net income we reported net income of  for the fourth quarter as compared to net income of million for the third quarter 
the decrease is primarily due to seasonal and other decreases in revenues without a corresponding decrease in cost of sales  and increased other expense  net of other income  in the fourth quarter as previously described  partially off set by decreased income tax expense in the fourth quarter 
liquidity and capital resources cash flows from operating activities totaled million in as compared to million in the decrease in is primarily due to the effect of the fiber system capacity sale partially offset by increased cash flow in from some of our segments 
uses of cash during include million of expenditures for property and equipment  including construction in progress  principal payments of long term borrowings and capital lease obligations of million  payment of million in notes receivable issued to related parties  and payment of preferred stock dividends of million 
other sources of cash in include million in long term borrowings and receipt of  in repayments of notes receivable issued to related parties 
net receivables decreased million from december  to december  primarily due to decreases in trade receivables for broadband services provided to hospitals and health clinics and telecommunication services provided to other common carriers 
the decrease in broadband trade receivables is due to a payment received in from the federal government 
the decrease in other common carrier trade receivables is net of the allowance for amounts due from worldcom preceding their filing for chapter bankruptcy  and due to the timing of payments received from a certain common carrier customer 
working capital totaled million at december   a million increase in working capital as compared to a deficit of million as of december  the increase is primarily attributed to classification of million of our senior holdings loan as current maturities of long term debt as of december  the senior holdings loan and fiber facility were subject to a refinancing agreement on november  as further described below  resulting in the classification of all such debt as long term at december on november  we closed our million bank facility senior facility to refinance the senior holdings loan and fiber facility 
the senior holdings loan and fiber facility had balances of approximately million and million  respectively  at november  the senior facility includes a term loan of million and a revolving credit facility of million 
the senior facility matures on november  and bears interest at libor plus 
we are required to pay a commitment fee equal to per annum on the unused portion of the commitment 
if the unused revolver is more than million the commitment fee increases to per annum on the unused portion of the commitment 
we recognized  in commitment fee expense during the year ended december  on november  we are required to prepay the term loan in an amount equal to of the amount by which earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation  and amortization exceeds certain fixed charges as defined in the senior facility agreement excess cash flow during the year ended september  on may  we are required to prepay the term loan in an amount equal to of the excess cash flow during the six months ended march  the prepayment required on november   if any  may be funded by a draw on the revolving credit facility 
the senior facility contains  among others  covenants limiting additional indebtedness and except for cash dividends on existing outstanding preferred stock  prohibits any direct or indirect distribution  dividend  redemption or other payment to any person on account of any general or limited partnership interest in  or shares of capital stock or other securities of gci  inc and subsidiaries 
under the senior facility we may not allow the o ratio of total indebtedness to annualized operating cash flow to be greater than  o ratio of senior secured indebtedness to annualized operating cash flow to be greater than  and o ratio of annualized operating cash flow to total interest expense to be less than capital expenditures  other than those incurred to build additional fiber optic cable system capacity  in any of the years ended september   march  and september  may not exceed o million  plus o of any excess cash flow during the applicable period less certain permitted investments of up to million during the applicable period 
the senior facility allows the issuance of up to million of subordinated debt  the proceeds of which could be used for the acquisition of backup fiber facilities 
we expect our expenditures for property and equipment for our core operations  including construction in progress  will total million to million 
million of the senior facility has been used to provide a letter of credit to secure payment of certain access charges associated with our provision of telecommunications services within the state of alaska 
the term loan is fully drawn and we have drawn million against the revolving credit facility plus a million letter of credit  which leaves million available at december  to draw under the revolving credit facility if needed 
the new facility provides us the flexibility to continue to pursue opportunities in the marketplace  however we are not planning to draw down the facility as we expect to continue investing only a portion of what we generate in cash flow in additional capital expenditures for our core business operations 
in connection with the funding of the senior facility  we paid bank fees and other expenses of approximately  during the year ended december  which will be charged to deferred loan fee expense over the life of the agreement 
we funded  of the bank fees and other expenses by a draw on the senior facility 
on january  we entered into an interest rate swap agreement to convert million in fixed rate to variable rate debt 
this interest rate swap agreement was called by the counter party at no cost and terminated on august  effective september   we entered into an interest rate swap agreement to convert million of variable interest rate debt equal to the day libor rate plus basis points to fixed rate debt plus applicable margins 
terms of the interest rate swap mirror the underlying variable rate debt  except the interest rate swap terminates on september  we were in compliance with all loan covenants at december  our semi annual senior notes interest payment of million was due february  and was paid in full at that time out of existing cash balances 
our next senior notes interest payment of million is due august  our expenditures for property and equipment  including construction in progress  totaled million and million during and  respectively 
our capital expenditures requirements are largely success driven and are a result of the progress we are making in the marketplace 
we expect our expenditures for property and equipment for our core operations  including construction in progress  to total million to million  depending on available opportunities and the amount of cash flow we generate during that number excludes any investment we may make with respect to additional undersea fiber capacity 
planned capital expenditures over the next five years include those necessary for continued expansion of our long distance  local exchange and internet facilities  supplementation of our existing network backup facilities  continuing development of our personal communication services  or pcs  network  cable telephony  and upgrades to our cable television plant 
the financial  credit and economic impacts of worldcom s bankruptcy filing on the industry in general and on us in particular are not yet fully understood and are not predictable 
we currently cannot predict the timing or amount that worldcom will pay on outstanding balances due us as of their bankruptcy filing date of july  unpaid balances due from worldcom for services rendered prior to their filing date total approximately million at december   against which we have reserved million 
we believe that payment for services provided to worldcom subsequent to their bankruptcy filing date will continue to be made timely  consistent with our status in worldcom s filing as a key service provider or utility to worldcom 
a conversion of worldcom s bankruptcy petition to chapter  unfavorable reaffirmation of our pre filing contracts and agreements with worldcom  or a migration of worldcom s traffic off our network without it being replaced by other common carriers that interconnect with our network  could have a materially adverse impact on our financial position  results of operations and liquidity 
dividends earned on our series b preferred stock are payable at the semi annual payment dates of april and october of each year 
the determination of whether the dividend due on april  will be paid in cash or additional fully paid shares of series b preferred stock will be made on or before the due date 
dividends earned on our series b preferred stock are payable in cash only beginning october  redemption is required on april  dividends earned on our series c preferred stock are payable in cash quarterly 
we may redeem the series c preferred stock at any time in whole but not in part 
mandatory redemption is required at any time after june  at the option of holders of of the outstanding shares of the series c preferred stock 
the redemption price is  per share plus the amount of all accrued and unpaid dividends  whether earned or declared  through the redemption date 
the long distance  local access  cable  internet and wireless services industries continue to experience substantial competition  regulatory uncertainty  and continuing technological changes 
our future results of operations will be affected by our ability to react to changes in the competitive and regulatory environment and by our ability to fund and implement new or enhanced technologies 
we are unable to determine how competition  economic conditions  and regulatory and technological changes will affect our ability to obtain financing 
the telecommunications industry in general is depressed due to high levels of competition in the long distance market resulting in pressures to reduce prices  an oversupply of long haul capacity  excessive debt loads  several high profile company failures and potentially fraudulent accounting practices by some companies 
our ability to refinance existing debt and to obtain new debt under acceptable terms and conditions in the short term and long term may be diminished as a result 
we believe that we will be able to meet our current and long term liquidity and capital requirements  fixed charges and preferred stock dividends through our cash flows from operating activities  existing cash  cash equivalents  short term investments  credit facilities  and other external financing and equity sources 
should cash flows be insufficient to support additional borrowings and principal payments scheduled under our existing credit facilities  capital expenditures will likely be reduced 
new accounting standards in july  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for asset retirement obligations 
sfas no 
provides accounting and reporting standards for costs associated with the retirement of long lived assets 
this statement requires entities to record the fair value of a liability for an asset retirement obligation in the period in which it is incurred 
when the liability is initially recorded  the entity capitalizes a cost by increasing the carrying amount of the related long lived asset 
over time  the liability is accreted to its present value each period  and the capitalized cost is depreciated over the useful life of the related asset 
upon settlement of the liability  an entity either settles the obligation for its recorded amount or incurs a gain or loss upon settlement 
we will adopt this statement january  upon adoption  we expect to record a cumulative effect of approximately  as a decrease in equity due to a change in accounting principle  and expect to record an asset retirement obligation of approximately million and capitalized costs of approximately  in july  the fasb issued sfas no  accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities 
upon adoption of sfas  enterprises may only record exit or disposal costs when they are incurred and can be measured at fair value 
the recorded liability will be subsequently adjusted for changes in estimated cash flows 
sfas revises accounting for specified employee and contract terminations that are part of restructuring activities 
we will adopt this statement january  and do not expect it to have a material effect on our results of operations  financial position and cash flows 
on december   the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure 
this statement amends sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  to provide alternative methods of transition for a voluntary change to the fair value based method of accounting for stock based employee compensation 
in addition  this statement amends the disclosure requirements of sfas no 
to require prominent disclosures in both annual and interim financial statements about the method of accounting for stock based employee compensation and the effect of the method used on reported results 
the transition provisions and annual statement disclosure requirements of sfas no 
have been adopted for the year ended december  the interim statement disclosure requirements are effective for the first interim statement that includes financial information after december  we have elected to continue to apply the intrinsic value method 
critical accounting policies our accounting and reporting policies comply with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions 
the financial position and results of operations can be affected by these estimates and assumptions  which are integral to understanding reported results 
critical accounting policies are those policies that management believes are the most important to the portrayal of the company s financial condition and results  and require management to make estimates that are difficult  subjective or complex 
most accounting policies are not considered by management to be critical accounting policies 
several factors are considered in determining whether or not a policy is critical in the preparation of financial statements 
these factors include  among other things  whether the estimates are significant to the financial statements  the nature of the estimates  the ability to readily validate the estimates with other information including third parties or available prices  and sensitivity of the estimates to changes in economic conditions and whether alternative accounting methods may be utilized under generally accepted accounting principles 
for all of these policies  management cautions that future events rarely develop exactly as forecast  and the best estimates routinely require adjustment 
management has discussed the development and the selection of critical accounting policies with the company s audit committee 
those policies considered to be critical accounting policies for the year ended december  are described below 
o we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
we base our estimates on the aging of our accounts receivable balances  financial health of specific customers  and our historical write off experience  net of recoveries 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate or if they are unable to emerge from reorganization proceedings  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
if their financial condition improves or they emerge successfully from reorganization proceedings  allowances may be reduced 
such allowance changes could have a material effect on our consolidated financial condition and results of operations 
refer to note in the accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding our provision of a million allowance for worldcom receivable balances 
o we record all assets and liabilities acquired in purchase acquisitions  including goodwill and other intangibles  at fair value as required by sfas goodwill and indefinite lived assets such as our cable segment franchise agreements are no longer amortized but are subject  at a minimum  to annual tests for impairment 
other intangible assets are amortized over their estimated useful lives using the straight line method  and are subject to impairment if events or circumstances indicate a possible inability to realize the carrying amount 
the initial goodwill and other intangibles recorded and subsequent impairment analysis requires management to make subjective judgments concerning estimates of how the acquired asset will perform in the future using a discounted cash flow analysis 
additionally  estimated cash flows may extend beyond ten years and  by their nature  are difficult to determine over an extended timeframe 
events and factors that may significantly affect the estimates include  among others  competitive forces  customer behaviors and attrition  changes in revenue growth trends  cost structures and technology  and changes in discount rates  performance compared to peers  material and ongoing negative economic trends  and specific industry or market sector conditions 
in determining the reasonableness of cash flow estimates  we review historical performance of the underlying asset or similar assets in an effort to improve assumptions utilized in our estimates 
in assessing the fair value of reportable operating segments  we may consider other information to validate the reasonableness of our valuations including public market comparables  multiples of recent mergers and acquisitions of similar businesses and third party assessments 
these evaluations could result in a change in useful lives in future periods and could result in write down of the value of intangible assets 
because of the significance of the identified intangible assets and goodwill to our consolidated balance sheet  the annual impairment analysis will be critical 
any changes in key assumptions about the business and its prospects  or changes in market conditions or other externalities  could result in an impairment charge and such a charge could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial condition and results of operations 
refer to note in the accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding intangible assets 
o we estimate unbilled long distance segment cost of sales based upon minutes of use carried through our network and established rates 
we estimate unbilled costs for new circuits and services  and when network changes occur that result in traffic routing changes or a change in carriers 
carriers that provide service to us regularly change their networks which can lead to new  revised or corrected billings 
such estimates are revised or removed when subsequent billings are received  payments are made  billing matters are researched and resolved  tariffed billing periods lapse  or when disputed charges are resolved 
revisions to previous estimates could either increase or decrease costs in the year in which the estimate is revised which could have a material effect on our consolidated financial condition and results of operations 
o our income tax policy provides for deferred income taxes to show the effect of temporary differences between the recognition of revenue and expenses for financial and income tax reporting purposes and between the tax basis of assets and liabilities and their reported amounts in the financial statements in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes 
we have recorded deferred tax assets of approximately million associated with income tax net operating losses that were generated from to  and that expire from to pre acquisition income tax net operating losses associated with acquired companies are subject to additional deductibility limits 
we have recorded deferred tax assets of approximately million associated with alternative minimum tax credits that do not expire 
significant management judgment is required in developing our provision for income taxes  including the determination of deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowances that may be required against the deferred tax assets 
in conjunction with certain acquisitions  we determined that approximately million of the acquired net operating losses would not be utilized for income tax purposes  and elected with our december  income tax returns to forego utilization of such acquired losses 
deferred tax assets were not recorded associated with the foregone losses and  accordingly  no valuation allowance was provided 
we have not recorded a valuation allowance on the deferred tax assets as of december  based on management s belief that future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences and estimated future taxable income exclusive of reversing temporary differences and carryforwards  will  more likely than not  be sufficient to realize the benefit of these assets over time 
in the event that actual results differ from these estimates or if our historical trends change  we may be required to record a valuation allowance on deferred tax assets  which could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial condition and results of operations 
refer to note in the accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding income taxes 
other significant accounting policies  not involving the same level of measurement uncertainties as those discussed above  are nevertheless important to an understanding of the financial statements 
polices related to revenue recognition including fiber sales transactions and financial instruments require difficult judgments on complex matters that are often subject to multiple sources of authoritative guidance 
certain of these matters are among topics currently under reexamination by accounting standards setters and regulators 
although no specific conclusions reached by these standard setters appear likely to cause a material change in our accounting policies  outcomes cannot be predicted with confidence 
significant accounting policies are discussed in note in the accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements 
geographic concentration and the alaska economy we offer voice and data telecommunication and video services to customers primarily throughout alaska 
because of this geographic concentration  growth of our business and of our operations depends upon economic conditions in alaska 
the economy of alaska is dependent upon the natural resource industries  and in particular oil production  as well as investment earnings  tourism  government  and united states military spending 
any deterioration in these markets could have an adverse impact on us 
in fiscal the state s preliminary actual results indicate that alaska s oil revenues and federal funding supplied and  respectively  of the state s total revenues 
all of the federal funding is dedicated for specific purposes  leaving oil revenues as the primary funding source of general operating expenditures 
in fiscal state economists forecast that alaska s federal funding and oil revenues will supply and  respectively  of the state s total projected revenues 
the volume of oil transported by the transalaska oil pipeline system over the past years has been as high as million barrels per day in fiscal production has been declining over the last several years with an average of million barrels produced per day in fiscal the state forecasts the production of million barrels per day in fiscal  and a production rate slightly above million barrels per day starting in fiscal the state attributes the production rate increase to future development of recent discoveries in the national petroleum reserve alaska and other new fields 
market prices for north slope oil averaged in fiscal and are forecasted to average in fiscal state economists forecast the average price of north slope oil to decline to in fiscal the closing price per barrel was on february  the state s forecasted average oil price assumes there will not be a war with iraq 
if there is a war  the state expects oil prices to increase to over per barrel in with a price decrease after a war  as iraq may increase its own oil production to raise needed cash to rebuild the country 
to the extent that actual oil prices vary materially from the state s projected prices the state s projected revenues and deficits will change 
every change in the price of oil results in a to million change in the state s revenue 
the production policy of the organization of petroleum exporting countries and its ability to continue to act in concert represents a key uncertainty in the state s revenue forecast 
the state of alaska maintains the constitutional budget reserve fund that is intended to fund budgetary shortfalls 
if the state s current projections are realized  the constitutional budget reserve fund will be depleted in the date the constitutional budget reserve fund is depleted is highly influenced by the price of oil 
if the fund is depleted  aggressive state action will be necessary to increase revenues and reduce spending in order to balance the budget 
the governor of the state of alaska and the alaska legislature continue to pursue cost cutting and revenue enhancing measures 
the governor submitted a budget proposal to the alaska legislature on march  that includes a number of cost reductions totaling over million  and proposes increased revenues totaling over million through  among other things  increased user fees  license fees  motor fuel tax  gaming fees  and filing fees 
in the alaska legislature passed and the governor signed legislation that  among other things  increased certain alcohol beverage taxes  increased the state minimum wage to per hour adjusted for inflation in future years  and extended the termination date of the rca one year to june  the governor has proposed legislation to the alaska legislature requesting that the rca be extended for an additional four years 
tourism  air cargo  and service sectors have helped offset the prevailing pattern of oil industry downsizing that has occurred during much of the last several years 
funds from federal sources totaling billion are expected to be distributed to the state of alaska for highways and other federally supported projects in fiscal should new oil discoveries or developments not materialize or the price of oil become depressed  the long term trend of continued decline in oil production from the prudhoe bay area is inevitable with a corresponding adverse impact on the economy of the state  in general  and on demand for telecommunications and cable television services  and  therefore  on us  in particular 
in the past year  there has been a renewed effort to allow exploration and development in the arctic national wildlife refuge anwr 
the us energy information agency estimates it could take nine years to begin oil field drilling after approval of anwr exploration 
deployment of a natural gas pipeline from the state of alaska s north slope to the lower states has been proposed to supplement natural gas supplies 
a competing natural gas pipeline through canada has also been proposed 
the economic viability of a natural gas pipeline depends upon the price of and demand for natural gas 
either project could have a positive impact on the state of alaska s revenues and the alaska economy 
according to their public comments  neither exxon mobil  bp nor conoco phillips  alaska s large natural gas owners  believe either natural gas pipeline makes financial sense based upon their preliminary analysis  though bp and conoco phillips have proposed certain federal income tax incentives that would take effect if the price for alaska natural gas goes below a certain level 
the governor of the state of alaska and certain natural gas transportation companies continue to support a natural gas pipeline from alaska s north slope by trying to reduce the project s costs and by advocating for federal tax incentives to further reduce the project s costs 
in april the us senate passed an energy bill mandating  among other items  federal tax incentives for a natural gas pipeline from the north slope to the lower this energy bill lapsed during the subsequent congressional adjournment 
development of the ballistic missile defense system project may have a significant impact on alaskan telecommunication requirements and the alaska economy 
the proposed system would be a fixed  land based  non nuclear missile defense system with a land and space based detection system capable of responding to limited strategic ballistic missile threats to the united states 
the preferred alternative is deployment of a system with up to ground based interceptor silos and battle management command and control facilities at fort greely  alaska  and an x band radar at eareckson air station on shemya island  alaska 
the us army corps of engineers awarded a construction contract in for test bed facilities 
the contract is reported to contain basic requirements and various options that could amount to million in construction  or possibly more  if all items are executed 
site preparation has been underway at fort greely since august of and construction began on the fort greely test bed shortly after the june  groundbreaking 
the test bed is due to be operational by september  we have  since our entry into the telecommunication marketplace  aggressively marketed our services to seek a larger share of the available market 
the customer base in alaska is limited  however  with a population of approximately  people 
the state of alaska s population is distributed as follows o are located in the municipality of anchorage  o are located in the fairbanks north star borough  o are located in the matanuska susitna borough  and o are located in the city and borough of juneau 
the remaining population is spread out over the vast reaches of alaska 
no assurance can be given that the driving forces in the alaska economy  and in particular  oil production  will continue at appropriate levels to provide an environment for expanded economic activity 
no assurance can be given that oil companies doing business in alaska will be successful in discovering new fields or further developing existing fields which are economic to develop and produce oil with access to the pipeline or other means of transport to market  even with a reduced level of royalties 
we are not able to predict the effect of changes in the price and production volumes of north slope oil on alaska s economy or on us 
seasonality long distance revenues primarily those derived from our other common carrier customers have historically been highest in the summer months because of temporary population increases attributable to tourism and increased seasonal economic activity such as construction  commercial fishing  and oil and gas activities 
cable television revenues  on the other hand  are higher in the winter months because consumers spend more time at home and tend to watch more television during these months 
local access and internet services are not expected to exhibit significant seasonality 
our ability to implement construction projects is also hampered during the winter months because of cold temperatures  snow and short daylight hours 
off balance sheet arrangements we have not created  and are not party to  any special purpose or off balance sheet entities for the purpose of raising capital  incurring debt or operating parts of our business that are not consolidated into our financial statements 
we do not have any arrangements or relationships with entities that are not consolidated into our financial statements that are reasonably likely to materially affect our liquidity or the availability of our capital resources 
schedule of certain contractual obligations the following table details future projected payments associated with our significant contractual obligations as of december  amounts in thousands 
payments due by period less than to to more than total year years years years long term debt    interest on long term debt     capital lease obligations  including interest      operating lease commitments      redeemable preferred stocks    total contractual obligations      for long term debt included in the above table  we have included principal payments on our senior facility and our senior notes 
interest on amounts outstanding under our senior facility is based on variable rates and therefore the amount is not determinable 
our senior notes require semi annual interest payments of approximately million through for a discussion of our long term debt  see note to the notes to consolidated financial statements included in part ii of this report 
for a discussion of our capital and operating leases  see note to the notes to consolidated financial statements included in part ii of this report

mandatory redemption is required at any time after the fourth anniversary date at the option of holders of of the outstanding shares of the series c preferred stock 
for more information about our redeemable preferred stock  see note e to the notes to consolidated financial statements included in part ii of this report 
regulatory developments you should read part i  item business  regulation  franchise authorizations and tariffs for more information about regulatory developments affecting us 
inflation we do not believe that inflation has a significant effect on our operations 
audit committee the audit committee  composed entirely of outside directors  meets periodically with our independent auditors and management to review the company s financial statements and the results of audit activities 
the audit committee  in turn  reports to the board of directors on the results of its review and recommends the selection of independent auditors 
the audit committee has approved the independent auditor to provide the following services o audit audit of financial statements filed with the sec  quarterly reviews  comfort letters  consents  review of registration statements  accounting consultations  and o audit related employee benefit plan audits and accounting consultation on proposed transactions 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to various types of market risk in the normal course of business  including the impact of interest rate changes 
we do not hold derivatives for trading purposes 
our new senior facility carries interest rate risk 
amounts borrowed under this agreement bear interest at libor plus 
should the libor rate change  our interest expense will increase or decrease accordingly 
on september   we entered into an interest rate swap agreement to convert million of variable interest rate debt to fixed rate debt plus applicable margin 
as of december   we have borrowed million of which million subject to interest rate risk 
on this amount  a increase in the interest rate would cost us  in additional gross interest cost on an annualized basis 
our satellite transponder capital lease carries interest rate risk 
amounts borrowed under this agreement bear interest at libor plus 
should the libor rate change  our interest expense will increase or decrease accordingly 
as of december   we have borrowed million subject to interest rate risk 
on this amount  a increase in the interest rate would cost us  in additional gross interest cost on an annualized basis
