pursuant to the terms of the acquisition agreement  an addi tional million of cash purchase price was paid by emcor to seller subsequent to the acquisition date due to an increase in net assets of the acquired comfort companies between the closing date and an agreed upon preclosing date 
the acquisition was funded with million of emcor s funds and million from borrowings under emcor s revolving credit facility 
the acquired comfort companies  which are based predominantly in the midwest united states and new jersey  are active in the installation and maintenance of mechanical system and the design and installation of process and fire protection systems

operating segments emcor s business consists of the following operating segments united states electrical construction and facilities services  united states mechanical construction and facilities services  united states other services  canada construction and facilities services  united kingdom construction and facilities services and other international construction and facilities services 
the segment united states other services principally consists of those operations which provide consulting and maintenance services  and other international construction and facilities services consists of emcor s operations outside of the united states  canada  and the united kingdom primarily south africa  the middle east and western europe performing electrical construction  mechanical construction and facilities services 
application of critical accounting policies the consolidated financial statements are based on the application of significant accounting policies  which require management to make significant estimates and assumptions 
emcor s significant accounting policies are described in note b summary of significant accounting policies of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in item of this form k 
there was no initial adoption of any accounting policies during other than those listed under new accounting pronouncements below 
emcor believes that some of the more critical judgment areas in the application of accounting policies that affect the financial condition and results of operations are the impact of changes in the estimates and judgments pertaining to a revenue recognition from i long term construction contracts for which the percentage of completion method of accounting is used and ii services contracts  b collectibility or valuation of accounts receivable  c insurance liabilities  d income taxes and e intangible assets 
revenue recognition for long term construction contracts and services contracts emcor believes its most critical accounting policy is revenue recognition from long term construction contracts for which emcor uses the percentage of completion method of accounting 
percentage of completion accounting is the prescribed method of accounting for long term contracts in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states  statement of position no 
 accounting for performance of construction type and certain production type contracts and  accordingly  the method used for revenue recognition within emcor s industry 
percentage of completion for each contract is measured principally by the ratio of costs incurred to date for each contract to the estimated total costs for each contract at completion 
certain of emcor s electrical contracting business units measure percentage of completion by the percentage of labor costs incurred to date for each contract to the estimated total labor costs for such contract 
provisions for the entirety of estimated losses on uncompleted contracts are made in the period in which such losses are determined 
application of percentage of completion accounting results in the recognition of costs and estimated earnings in excess of billings on uncompleted contracts in its consolidated balance sheets 
costs and estimated earnings in excess of billings on uncompleted contracts reflected on the consolidated balance sheets arise when revenues have been recognized but the amounts cannot be billed under the terms of contracts 
such amounts are recoverable from customers upon various measures of performance  including achievement of certain milestones  completion of specified units or completion of a contract 
costs and estimated earnings in excess of billings on uncompleted contracts also include amounts emcor seeks or will seek to collect from customers or others for errors or changes in contract specifications or design  contract change orders in dispute or unapproved as to both scope and price  or other customer related causes of unanticipated additional contract costs 
such amounts are recorded at estimated net realizable value and take into account factors that may affect the ability to bill and collect amounts billed 
due to uncertainties inherent within estimates employed to apply percentage of completion accounting  estimates may be revised as project work progresses 
application of percentage of completion accounting requires that the impact of those revised estimates be reported in the consolidated financial statements prospectively 
in addition to revenue recognition for long term construction contracts  emcor recognizes revenues from services contracts as these services are performed in accordance with staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition in financial statements sab 
there are two basic types of services contracts fixed price services contracts which are signed in advance for maintenance  repair and retrofit work over periods typically ranging from one to three years for which there may be emcor employees on the customer s site full time and services contracts not signed in advance for similar maintenance  repair and retrofit work on an as needed basis 
fixed price services contracts are generally performed evenly over the contract period  and accordingly  revenue is recognized on a pro rata basis over the life of the contract 
revenues derived from other services contracts are recognized when the services are performed in accordance with sab expenses related to all service contracts are recognized as services are provided 
accounts receivable emcor is required to estimate the collectibility of accounts receivable 
a considerable amount of judgment is required in assessing the realization of receivables  which assessment factors include the creditworthiness of the customer  emcor s prior collection history with the customer and related aging of the past due balances 
the provisions for bad debts during   and amounted to approximately million  million and million  respectively 
at december  and  accounts receivable of million and million  respectively  included allowances of million and million  respectively 
specific accounts receivable are evaluated when emcor believes a customer may not be able to meet its financial obligations due to a deterioration of its financial condition  credit ratings or bankruptcy 
the allowance requirements are based on the best facts available and are re evaluated and adjusted as additional information is received 
insurance liabilities emcor has deductibles for certain workers compensation  auto liability  general liability and property claims  has self insured retentions for certain other casualty claims  and is self insured for employee related health care claims 
losses are recorded based upon estimates of the liability for claims incurred and an estimate of claims incurred but not reported 
the liabilities are derived from known facts  historical trends and industry averages utilizing the assistance of an actuary to determine the best estimate of these obligations 
emcor believes its liabilities for these obligations are adequate 
however  such obligations are difficult to assess and estimate due to numerous factors  including severity of injury  determination of liability in proportion to other parties  timely reporting of occurrences and effectiveness of safety and risk management programs 
therefore  if actual experience differs from the assumptions and estimates used for recording the liabilities  adjustments may be required and would be recorded in the period that the experience becomes known 
income taxes emcor has net deferred tax assets primarily resulting from deductible temporary differences  which will reduce taxable income in future periods 
a valuation allowance is required when it is more likely than not that all or a portion of a deferred tax asset will not be realized 
as of december  and  the total valuation allowance on net deferred tax assets was approximately million and million  respectively 
intangible assets as of december   emcor had goodwill and net identifiable intangible assets of million and million  respectively  in connection with the acquisition of certain companies 
the determination of related estimated useful lives for identifiable intangible assets and whether those assets are impaired involves significant judgments based upon short and long term projections of future performance 
certain of these forecasts reflect assumptions regarding the ability to successfully integrate acquired companies 
statement of financial accounting standards no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets sfas requires goodwill to be tested for impairment under certain circumstances  and written down when impaired  rather than being amortized as previous standards required 
furthermore  sfas requires identifiable intangible assets other than goodwill to be amortized over their useful lives unless these lives are determined to be indefinite 
changes in strategy and or market conditions may result in adjustments to recorded intangible asset balances 
as of december   no indicators of impairment of its goodwill or identifiable intangible assets existed after emcor s initial and first annual impairment review in accordance with the provisions of sfas see note b summary of significant accounting policies of the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional discussion of the provisions of sfas discussion and analysis of results of operations revenues revenues for the year ended december  increased to billion compared to billion of revenues for the million increase in revenues for when compared to was primarily due to revenues of million from companies acquired in and to increased revenues in the united states other services  canada and the united kingdom segments of million  million and million  respectively 
partially offsetting this increase was a reduction  when compared to  of rev venues related to fast track projects with accelerated time tables earlier than typical contracts for similar projects telecom and other contracts  as well as a shift to larger longer term projects which typically result in revenue being recognized over a longer period of time 
revenues for of billion represented a decrease over revenues of billion for the million decrease in revenues for compared to was primarily due to reduced fast track data center construction in the new york  chicago  washington d 
c 
and california markets  as well as a reduced level of activity in the las vegas and ohio markets and in canada 
the decrease was partially offset by growth in revenues associated with energy generation projects and transportation infrastructure construction on the united states west and east coasts and revenue growth from various operations in the boston area market 
the following table presents emcor s revenues by operating segment and the approximate percentages of total revenues for the years ended december   and in millions  except for percentages of of of total total total revenues united states electrical construction and facilities services    united states mechanical construction and facilities services    united states other services total united states operations    canada construction and facilities services united kingdom construction and facilities services other international construction and facilities services total worldwide operations    revenues for emcor s united states electrical construction and facilities services segment for decreased by million compared to the decrease in revenues was primarily due to a reduction in fast track telecom and other contracts in compared to the prior year 
during  transportation infrastructure work increased and energy generation work remained steady compared to the prior year 
the million  or  decrease in revenues attributable to this segment compared to was due to reduced levels of fast track data center and commercial construction in the new york  chicago  washington d 
c 
and california markets  as well as reduced levels of activity in the las vegas and ohio markets 
the decrease was partially offset by increases in revenues associated with energy generation and transportation infrastructure construction markets on the west and east coasts and increased revenues from various activities in the salt lake city market 
united states mechanical construction and facilities services revenues increased in by million  or when compared to this increase in revenues was primarily attributable to million of revenues from the acquired comfort companies and growth in revenues in the northern california market 
these increases were partially offset by decreased revenues as a result of the performance of fewer fast track contracts 
a million  or  decrease in revenues for compared to was due to reduced fast track data center construction  reduced levels of activity in the las vegas and denver markets and planned reductions in operations at emcor s poole kent subsidiary operations in the north and south carolina markets 
the decrease in revenues was partially offset by increased revenues associated with energy generation construction on the west and east coasts and increased revenues from the boston area market 
united states other services revenues  which include those operations that principally provide consulting and maintenance services  increased by million  or  for compared to the increase in revenues was attributable primarily to an increase in facilities services contracts and  to a lesser extent  to revenues from the acquisition of ces  partially offset by a decline in telecommunications related work 
revenues for increased by million compared to the increase in revenues was primarily attributable to an increase in maintenance services provided to customers 
revenues of canada construction and facilities services increased by million  or  for as compared to revenues 
the increase in revenues was primarily attributable to the performance of work on certain long term contracts 
the million  or  decrease in revenues for compared with was attributable to project start date delays in eastern canada and a reduction of revenues in western canada due to timing of anticipated projects 
united kingdom construction and facilities services revenues increased million  or  for compared to revenues principally due to growth in the facilities services market  offsetting a decline in the overall construction market 
the decline in the overall construction market principally resulted in fewer attractive bid opportunities  and thereby caused emcor to be more selective in submitting project bids 
construction revenues for do not include revenues from certain multi year rail projects that were awarded in which will produce revenues in future periods 
the million  or  increase in revenues compared with revenues was principally due to growth in construction and facilities markets in the united kingdom during the first half of other international construction and facilities services revenues primarily consist of emcor s operations in the middle east  south africa and europe 
revenues from those operations were zero for  million for and million for all of the projects in these markets are being performed by joint ventures 
the results of these joint venture operations are accounted for under the equity method of accounting because emcor has less than majority ownership in foreign joint ventures  and  accordingly  revenues attributable to such joint ventures are not reflected as revenues in the consolidated financial statements 
in  certain european projects were performed entirely by emcor subsidiaries and therefore  revenues were recorded 
emcor continues to pursue new business selectively in these markets  however  the availability of opportunities has been significantly reduced as a result of local economic factors  particularly in the middle east 
cost of sales and gross profit the following table presents emcor s cost of sales  gross profit  and gross profit as a percentage of revenues  for the years ended december   and in millions  except for percentages cost of sales    gross profit gross profit as a percentage of revenues 
gross profit increased million  or  for compared to gross profit as a percentage of revenues was for compared to for the increase in gross profit was primarily due to gross profit of million earned by companies acquired in the increase in gross profit of million attributable to emcor s other subsidiaries was due to the type and location of construction and facilities services contracts performed  efficient deployment of local labor  effective procurement of materials and focus on risk management programs 
the increase in gross profit as a percentage of revenues was principally attributable to the acquired comfort companies and their higher gross profit as a percentage of sales in as compared to emcor in  as well as improvements for gross margin in emcor s other subsidiaries 
gross profit increased million  or  for compared to  and gross profit as a percentage of revenues increased to for compared with for the dollar increase in gross profit  as well as the increase in gross profit as a percentage of revenues  were primarily due to an increase in gross profits realized due to the type and location of construction and facilities services contracts performed and continued improvement in project management

goodwill amortization expense for the year ended december  and was zero and million  respectively 
amortization expense of certain identifiable intangible assets associated with the acquired comfort companies was million for the year ended december  operating income the following table presents emcor s operating income  and operating income as a percentage of segment revenues  for the years ended december   and in millions  except for percentages of of of segment segment segment revenues revenues revenues operating income loss united states electrical construction and facilities services united states mechanical construction and facilities services united states other services total united states operations canada construction and facilities services united kingdom construction and facilities services other international construction and facilities services corporate administration total worldwide operations other corporate items interest expense interest income income before taxes operating income increased for the united states electrical construction and facilities services operations for compared to the dollar increase in operating income for of million  or  as compared to  and the related increase as a percentage of revenues  was primarily attributable to the increased activity from increased transportation infrastructure and continuing energy generation construction projects on the west coast  the successful completion and settlement of several contracts and increased operating income attributable to various commercial and industrial projects in the san diego  las vegas  washington dc and denver markets offset  in part  by a reduction in fast track data center construction work across other markets 
operating income for for the united states electrical construction and facilities services operations increased million  or  from levels 
the increase in operating income  and operating income  as a percentage of revenues  for versus was attributable to an increase in operations associated with transportation infrastructure and power plant construction contracts on the west and east coasts  and increased levels of activity in the salt lake city market 
this increase in operating income was partially offset by reduced levels of fast track data center construction projects in the san francisco  washington dc and denver markets and the decrease in construction activity in the las vegas market 
united states mechanical construction and facilities services operating income increased million for  a increase over this increase in dollars and increase as a percentage of revenues was primarily due to i operating income from the acquired comfort companies of million  ii operating income associated with power plant construction contracts on the west coast and iii improved results at the poole kent subsidiary operations which had losses in the prior year

united states other services operating income was million for compared to operating losses of million for the increase in operating profit was primarily attributable to new facilities services contracts and a decrease in selling  general and administrative expenses as the facilities services operations became more established and thus required less overhead spending relating to the development of new business 
the contribution to operating income by ces  which was acquired on december   was not material 
operating losses in this segment for compared to increased by million primarily due to costs associated with the continued development of the consulting operations and maintenance services activities of emcor 
canada construction and facilities services operating income increased by million for compared to principally due to increased work on longer term contracts that result in profit recognition over an extended time period  partially offset by a reduction in the number of fast track type contracts 
for compared to  operating income decreased by million principally due to project start date delays in eastern canada for certain projects in backlog and a reduction of revenues in western canada due to the timing of anticipated projects 
united kingdom construction and facilities services operating income decreased by million for compared to the decrease in operating income was primarily attributable to unfavorable settlements and closeouts of certain construction projects completed during the year 
during the facilities services business continued to realize increased revenues and operating income while the construction activities have slowed since for  operating income increased by million as compared to this increase was primarily attributable to growth in construction and facilities markets in the united kingdom during the first half of other international construction and facilities services operating losses were million for compared to operating losses of million in and operating income of million in emcor continues to pursue new business selectively in the middle eastern  south african and european markets  however  the availability of opportunities has been significantly reduced as a result of local economic factors  particularly in the middle east 
general corporate expenses for increased by million from levels  and increased by million between and the increase in general corporate expenses was primarily due to the expansion of operations support activities such as information technology infrastructure  human resources and communications in order to meet the level of service expected by clients and manage the increased number of operations due to acquisitions 
costs associated with the integration of companies acquired during were approximately million of the million increase from to interest expense decreased by million in compared to principally due to the conversion of million of emcor s convertible subordinated notes into approximately million shares of emcor common stock in the second quarter of for the same reason  interest expense decreased by million in compared to interest income decreased by million in compared with interest income increased by million in compared to the decrease in interest income for compared to was due to a reduction in cash on hand in related to cash used for acquisitions and repayment of borrowings related to the acquisitions  and to lower interest rates 
liquidity and capital resources the following table presents emcor s net cash provided by used in operating activities  investing activities and financing activities for the years ended december  and in millions net cash provided by operating activities net cash used in investing activities net cash provided by financing activities the company s consolidated cash balance decreased by million from million at december  to million at december  primarily due to the use of cash for the acquisition of the acquired comfort companies and ces  partially offset by net cash provided by operating activities 
net cash provided by operating activities for was million  an increase of million from million for the cash provided by operating activities in was primarily due to increased net income  increased accounts payable  increased accrued expenses and decreased accounts receivable  partially offset by increased contracts in progress  net 
net cash used in investing activities in of million consisted primarily of payments of an aggregate of million for acquisitions in and earn out payments of million for acquisitions in prior periods  net disbursement for other investments of million and million for the purchase of property  plant and equipment 
this activity compares to net cash used in investing activities for of million for the purchase of property  plant and equipment  million for payments for acquisitions and related earn out agreements for prior year acquisitions and net disbursements for other investments of million 
net cash provided by financing activities for of million was primarily attributable to borrowings under working capital credit lines used to finance the ces acquisition in december and proceeds from the exercise of stock options  offset by a reduction due to net repayments of long term debt and capital lease payments 
the following is a summary of emcor s material contractual obligations and other commercial commitments in millions payments due by period less contractual than after obligations total year years years years notes payable other long term debt capital lease obligations operating leases open purchase obligations other long term obligations total contractual obligations amount of commitment expiration by period total less other commercial amounts than after commitments committed year years years years revolving credit facility letters of credit guarantees total commercial commitments represent open purchase orders for material and subcontracting costs related to the company s construction and service contracts 
these purchase orders are not reflected in emcor s consolidated balance sheet and should not impact future cash flows as amounts will be recovered through customer billings 
represent primarily insurance related liabilities  the timing for which payments beyond one year is not practical to estimate 
emcor classifies these borrowings as short term on its consolidated balance sheet because of emcor s intent and ability to repay the amounts on a short term basis 
on september   emcor entered into a new million five year revolving credit agreement the revolving credit facility 
the revolving credit facility  which replaced a credit facility entered into on december  the credit facility  is guaranteed by certain direct and indirect subsidiaries of emcor  is secured by substantially all of the assets of emcor and most of its subsidiaries  and provides for borrowings in the form of revolving loans and letters of credit 
the revolving credit facility contains various covenants requiring  among other things  maintenance of certain financial ratios and certain restrictions with respect to cumulative aggregate payments for dividends  common stock repurchases  investments  acquisitions  indebtedness and capital expenditures 
a commitment fee is payable on the average daily unused amount of the revolving credit facility 
the fee ranges from to of the unused amount  based on certain financial tests 
loans under the revolving credit facility bear interest at a rate which is the prime commercial lending rate announced by harris trust and savings bank from time to time at december  plus to  based on certain financial tests or at a libor rate at december  plus to based on certain financial tests 
the interest rates in effect at december  were and  respectively 
letter of credit fees issued under this facility range from to and are charged based on the type of letter of credit issued and certain financial tests 
as of december  and  emcor had approximately million and million of letters of credit outstanding  respectively 
emcor had borrowings of million outstanding under the revolving credit facility at december  no revolving loans were outstanding under the credit facility at december  in august  the company s canadian subsidiary  comstock canada ltd  renewed a credit agreement with a bank providing for an overdraft facility of up to cdn 
million 
the facility is secured by a standby letter of credit and provides for interest at the bank s prime rate at december  
there were no borrowings outstanding under this credit agreement at december  or a subsidiary of emcor has guaranteed indebtedness of a venture in which it has a interest  the other venture partner  baltimore gas and electric  has a interest 
the venture designs  constructs  owns  operates  leases and maintains facilities to produce chilled water for sale to customers for use in cooling 
these guarantees are not expected to have a material effect on emcor s financial position or results of operations 
each of the venturers is jointly and severally liable  in the event of default  for the venture s million borrowing due december during september  each venture partner contributed equity to the venture  of which emcor s contribution was million 
there are million in current maturities of emcor s long term debt and capital lease obligations as of december  million of this amount relates to notes payable to former owners of the acquired comfort companies  which were assumed in connection with the acquisition 
these notes accrue interest at an annual rate of and are payable in april emcor is contingently liable to sureties in respect of performance and payment bonds issued by sureties  usually at the request of customers in connection with construction projects which secure emcor payment and performance obligations under contracts for such projects 
in addition  at the request of unions representing emcor employees  bonds are provided to secure such obligations for wages and benefits payable to or for such employees 
as of december   sureties had issued bonds for the account of emcor in the aggregate amount of approximately billion 
to the extent such bonds were for the benefit of customers as opposed to unions  they related to over construction projects 
the bonds are issued by emcor s sureties in return for a premium which varies depending on the size of the bonds 
the individual amounts for bonded projects range up to million 
emcor has agreed to indemnify the sureties for any payments made by them in respect of bonds 
on march   emcor sold  pursuant to an underwritten public offering  million principal amount of convertible subordinated notes 
during the second quarter of  emcor called its convertible subordinated notes for redemption 
as a consequence  all of the convertible subordinated notes were converted into approximately million shares of emcor common stock 
emcor does not have any other material financial guarantees or off balance sheet arrangements other than those discussed herein 
the primary source of liquidity for emcor has been  and is expected to continue to be  cash generated by operating activities 
emcor also maintains a revolving credit facility that may be utilized  among other things  to meet short term liquidity needs in the event cash generated by operating activities is insufficient  or to enable emcor to seize opportunities to participate in joint ventures or to make acquisitions that may require access to cash on short notice or for any other reason 
emcor may also increase liquidity through an equity offering or other debt instruments 
short term changes in macroeconomic trends may have an effect  positively or negatively  on liquidity 
in order to manage through these uncertainties  emcor generally will not borrow funds to the maximum amounts allowable and  therefore  should have the capacity to borrow funds  if necessary  to meet short term requirements 
in addition to managing borrowings  emcor s focus on the facilities services market is intended to provide an additional buffer against economic downturns as the facilities services market is characterized by annual and multi year contracts that provide a more predictable stream of cash flows than the construction market 
the acquisition of ces in december  which is primarily facilities services market focused  is part of emcor s plan to grow its services business 
short term liquidity is also impacted by the type and length of construction contracts in place 
during economic downturns  such as the through period  construction contracts trended away from short cycle contracts toward larger longer term infrastructure and public sector contracts 
performance of longer duration contracts usually requires higher upfront cash requirements until billings can occur in accordance with contractual provisions 
while emcor strives to maintain a net over billed position with its customers  there can be no assurance that the net over billed position can be maintained 
emcor s net over billings  defined as the balance sheet accounts cost and estimated earnings in excess of billings on uncompleted contracts less billings in excess of costs and estimated earnings on uncompleted contracts  was million and million as of december  and long term liquidity requirements can be expected to be met through cash generated from operating activities  the revolving credit facility  and the sale of various secured or unsecured debt and or equity interests in the public and private markets 
based upon emcor s current credit ratings and financial position  emcor can reasonably expect to be able to issue long term debt instruments and or equity 
for example  in september  emcor was able to increase its capacity to borrow under credit facilities from million to million 
over the long term  emcor s primary revenue risk factor continues to be the level of demand for non residential construction services  which is in turn influenced by macroeconomic trends including interest rates and governmental economic policy 
in order to provide protection against demand cycles in private sector construction services  emcor has increased its participation  and its backlog of contracts  in the public sector and in the facilities services market 
emcor believes that current cash balances and borrowing capacity available under existing lines of credit or other forms of financing available through debt or equity offerings  combined with cash expected to be generated from operations  will be sufficient to provide short term and foreseeable long term liquidity and meet expected capital expenditure requirements 
however  emcor is a party to several lawsuits and other proceedings in which other parties seek to recover from it amounts ranging from a few thousand dollars to million 
if emcor was required to pay damages in one or more such proceedings  such payments could have a material adverse effect on its cash flow and or earnings 
certain insurance matters as of december   emcor was utilizing approximately million of letters of credit obtained under its revolving credit facility as collateral for its insurance obligations

fin clarifies the requirements of fasb statement no 
 accounting for contingencies  relating to the guarantor s accounting for  and disclosure of  the issuance of certain types of guarantees 
fin requires that upon issuance of a guarantee  the entity ie  the guarantor must recognize a liability for the fair value of the obligation it assumes under that guarantee 
the disclosure provisions of the interpretations are effective for financial statements of interim or annual periods that end after december  the interpretation s provisions for initial recognition and measurement should be applied on a prospective basis to guarantees issued or modified after december   irrespective of the guarantor s fiscal year end 
the guarantor s previous accounting for guarantees that were issued before the date of fin s initial application may not be revised or restated to reflect the effect of the recognition and measurement provisions of the interpretation 
emcor has guarantees that will be subject to the accounting and disclosure provisions of the interpretation  and therefore  adoption of fin may impact disclosures in the first quarter of its next fiscal year 
emcor is currently evaluating the recognition and measurement impacts of adoption

in addition  sfas amends the disclosure requirements of sfas to require prominent disclosures in both annual and interim financial statements of the method of accounting for stock based employee compensation and the effect of the method used on reported results 
sfas was effective for fiscal years beginning after december  and was adopted by emcor for all periods presented 
emcor did not change to the fair value based method of accounting for stock based employee compensation  and therefore  adoption of sfas will impact only future disclosures  not the financial results  of emcor 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk emcor has not used derivative financial instruments for any purpose during the years ended december  and  including trading or speculating on changes in interest rates  or commodity prices of materials used in its business 
emcor is exposed to market risk for changes in interest rates for borrowings under its revolving credit facility 
borrowings under the credit facility bear interest at variable rates  and the fair value of this borrowing is not significantly affected by changes in market interest rates 
as of december   there was million of borrowings outstanding under the revolving credit facility  and these borrowings bear interest at a rate which is the prime commercial lending rate announced by harris trust and savings bank from time to time at december  plus to  based on certain financial tests or at a libor rate at december  plus to based on certain financial tests 
based on the borrowings outstanding of million  if interest rates were to increase by  the net of tax interest expense would increase million in the next twelve months 
conversely  if interest rates were to decrease by  interest expense would decrease by million in the next months 
the revolving credit facility expires in september there is no guarantee that emcor will be able to renew the agreement at its expiration 
emcor is also exposed to market risk and its potential related impact on accounts receivable or costs and estimated earnings in excess of billings on uncompleted contracts 
the amounts recorded may be at risk if customers ability to settle these obligations is negatively impacted by economic conditions 
emcor continually monitors the credit worthiness of its customers and maintains on going discussions with customers regarding contract status with respect to change orders and billing terms 
therefore  emcor believes it takes appropriate action to manage market and other risks  but there is no assurance that it will be able to reasonably identify all risks with respect to collectibility of these assets 
refer also to the previous discussion of accounts receivable under the heading  application of critical accounting policies 
amounts invested in emcor s foreign operations are translated into u
