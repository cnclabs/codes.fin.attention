item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes contained elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
this discussion may contain forward looking statements based upon current expectations that involve risks and uncertainties 
our actual results and the timing of selected events could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward looking statements as a result of selected factors  including those set forth under risks related to our business in item all forward looking statements included here are based on information available to us as of the date hereof  and we assume no obligation to update any such forward looking statements 
overview urologix  inc  based in minneapolis  develops  manufactures and markets minimally invasive medical products for the treatment of urological disorders 
we have developed and offer non surgical  catheter based therapies that use a proprietary cooled microwave technology for the treatment of bph  a disease that dramatically affects more than million men worldwide by causing adverse changes in urinary voiding patterns 
we market our products under the targis and prostatron names 
both systems utilize cooled thermotherapy  a targeted microwave energy combined with a unique cooling mechanism that protects healthy tissue and enhances patient comfort while providing safe  effective  lasting relief from the symptoms of bph 
cooled thermotherapy can be performed without anesthesia or intravenous sedation and  as a result  can be performed in a physician s office or an outpatient clinic 
we believe cooled thermotherapy provides an efficacious  safe and cost effective solution for bph that is superior to medication without the complications and side effects inherent in surgical procedures 
we believe that third party reimbursement is essential to the acceptance of cooled thermotherapy  and that clinical efficacy  overall cost effectiveness and physician advocacy will be keys to obtaining this reimbursement 
we estimate that percent to percent of patients who receive treatment in the united states will be eligible for medicare coverage 
the remaining patients will either be covered by private insurers  including traditional indemnity health insurers and managed care organizations  or they will be private paying patients 
as a result  medicare reimbursement is particularly critical for widespread market acceptance of cooled thermotherapy in the united states 
the level of medicare reimbursement for cooled thermotherapy is dependent on the site of service 
beginning on august   the centers for medicare and medicaid services cms replaced the reasonable cost basis of reimbursement for outpatient hospital based procedures  including cooled thermotherapy  with a new fixed rate or prospective payment system 
under this method of reimbursement  a hospital receives a fixed reimbursement for each cooled thermotherapy treatment performed in its facility  although the rate varies depending on a wage index and other factors for each hospital 
the urologist performing the cooled thermotherapy treatment continues to be reimbursed approximately per procedure 
in january  cms began to reimburse for cooled thermotherapy treatments performed in the urologist s office 
the reimbursement rate inclusive of the physician s fee in calendar year for cooled thermotherapy procedures performed in the urologist s office is approximately  which is subject to geographic adjustment 
reimbursement rates for calendar will be published in the november edition of the federal register 
our goal is to grow cooled thermotherapy as a standard of care for the treatment of bph 
our business strategy to achieve this goal is to i increase the use of cooled thermotherapy by physicians who already have access to a cooled thermotherapy system  ii satisfy additional demand for cooled thermotherapy systems 
table of contents through the efficient use of existing systems in the field and iii increase market awareness of cooled thermotherapy 
we expect to continue to incur operating losses as we focus on growing our revenues  continue clinical trials in support of regulatory and reimbursement approvals  and continue to invest in our effort to protect our intellectual property 
our future profitability will be dependent upon  among other factors  our success in achieving increased treatment volume and market acceptance of the cooled thermotherapy procedures in the physician s office  our success in obtaining and maintaining necessary regulatory clearances  our ability to manufacture at the volumes and quantities the market requires  the extent to which medicare and other health care payers continue to reimburse costs of cooled thermotherapy procedures performed in hospitals  ambulatory surgery centers and physicians offices and the amount of reimbursement provided 
critical accounting policies in accordance with securities and exchange commission guidance  we set forth below those material accounting policies that we believe are the most critical to an investor s understanding of our financial results and condition  and require complex management judgment 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue from the sale of cooled thermotherapy system control units upon acceptance by the customer 
we recognize revenue from disposable product sales at the time of shipment 
in addition to our sales of cooled thermotherapy system control units  we place our cooled thermotherapy system control units with customers under a variety of programs for both evaluation and long term use 
we retain title to these control units and do not recognize any revenue on these control units until title has transferred 
these programs are designed to expand our installed base  and thus expand the market for our disposable catheters 
under these programs  we generally charge a higher price for each disposable procedure kit to include the use of our cooled thermotherapy system control unit by the customer 
we recognize revenue on these disposable procedure kits at the time of shipment 
revenue for warranty service contracts is deferred and recognized over the contract period 
we record a provision for estimated sales returns on product sales in the same period as the related revenue is recorded 
the provision for estimated sales returns is based on historical sales returns  analysis of credit memo data and other known factors 
if the historical data we used to calculate these estimates does not properly reflect future returns  our revenues could be overstated 
allowance for doubtful accounts we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
this allowance is a significant estimate and is regularly evaluated by us for adequacy by taking into consideration factors such as past experience  credit quality of the customer base  age of the receivable balances  both individually and in the aggregate  and current economic conditions that may affect a customer s ability to pay 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
product warranty we record a liability for warranty claims at the time of sale 
the amount of the liability is based on the trend in the historical ratio of product failure rates  material usage and service delivery costs to sales  the historical length of time between the sale and resulting warranty claim and other factors 
should actual product failure rates  material usage or repair costs differ from our estimates  revisions to the estimated warranty liability would be required 
inventories and related allowance for excess and obsolete inventory we value our inventories  consisting primarily of control units  disposable single use procedure kits  and raw materials to produce the control units and procedure kits  at the lower of cost or market value on the first in  first out fifo basis 
the inventory cost includes both merchandise and freight 
a periodic review of the inventory quantities on hand is performed to determine if the inventory is properly stated at the lower of cost or 
table of contents market 
in performing this analysis we consider  at a minimum  the following factors declines in average selling prices  reimbursement changes  and changes in demand for our products due to competitive conditions or market acceptance 
each type of inventory is analyzed to determine net realizable values 
a provision is recorded to reduce the cost of inventories to the estimated net realizable values  if required 
we also analyze the level of inventory on hand on a periodic basis  in relation to estimated customer requirements to determine whether write downs for excess  obsolete  or slow moving inventory are required 
any significant or unanticipated change in the factors noted above could have a significant impact on the value of our inventories and on our reported operating results 
valuation of long lived and intangible assets and goodwill in fiscal  we adopted statement of financial accounting standards sfas  goodwill and other intangible assets  and as a result  we have ceased to amortize approximately million of goodwill and million of trademarks 
goodwill and trademarks are tested for impairment annually  or more frequently if changes in circumstance or the occurrence of events suggests an impairment exists 
the test for impairment requires us to make several estimates about fair value  most of which are based on projected future cash flows 
our estimates associated with the impairment tests are considered critical  due to the amount of goodwill and trademarks recorded on our balance sheet and the judgment required in determining fair value amounts  including projected future cash flows 
other intangible assets consist of developed technologies  customer base and trademarks 
developed technologies and customer base are amortized using the straight line method over their estimated useful lives of and years  respectively 
the trademark asset is considered to be an intangible asset with an indefinite useful life  and it will not be amortized until its useful life is determined to be no longer indefinite 
we review the definite lived intangible assets for impairment as changes in circumstance or the occurrence of events suggests the remaining value is not recoverable 
results of operations fiscal years ended june  and net sales for fiscal decreased million or percent to million  compared to sales of million in the prior fiscal year 
the decrease in revenue was caused by a decrease in the number of cooled thermotherapy system control units sold as well as a drop in the average per unit selling price of these systems  and a decrease in the number of single use treatment catheters sold 
sales of disposable treatment catheters accounted for approximately percent of all revenue in fiscal compared to percent in fiscal both the volume of cooled thermotherapy system control units sold and the sales price of these systems were affected by competitive offerings in the marketplace 
in addition  the effort to expand our sales force during the first six months of fiscal limited the growth of treatment catheter sales as both sales management and our experienced sales representatives invested a significant amount of time recruiting and training new team members  which slowed work with existing customers and the effort to generate new business 
the sales force has now been refocused on increasing sales to both new and existing customers 
at june   we had an installed base of cooled thermotherapy system control units  including the units that are being used by customers pursuant to our evaluation and long term use programs 
cost of goods sold includes raw materials  labor  overhead and royalties incurred in connection with the production of our cooled thermotherapy system control units and treatment catheters 
cost of goods sold increased to million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal the increase in cost of goods sold resulted primarily from a  charge for a lower of cost or market adjustment to cooled thermotherapy system control unit inventory and future control unit purchase commitments  partially offset by reduced volumes of cooled thermotherapy system control units and single use treatment catheters sold 
gross profit as a percentage of sales decreased to percent in fiscal from percent in fiscal  due primarily to the decrease in the average per unit selling price of our cooled thermotherapy system control units and 
table of contents the  charge to cost of goods sold in the fourth quarter of fiscal for the lower of cost or market adjustment to cooled thermotherapy system control unit inventory and future purchase commitments 
research and development expenses  which include expenditures for product development  regulatory compliance and clinical studies  decreased to million in fiscal from million in the prior fiscal year 
the decrease in research and development expenses resulted from decreased expenditures on product development activities partially offset by increased clinical study activity 
we expect annual research and development expenses in fiscal to decrease from fiscal levels due to the restructuring and cost saving initiatives implemented in the fourth quarter of fiscal and a decrease in the clinical trial activity related to our next generation of cooled thermotherapy treatment catheters 
sales  general and administrative expenses increased to million in fiscal from million in the prior fiscal year 
the increase in expenses resulted from the expansion of our direct sales force during the first six months of fiscal and expenses related to a patent infringement suit that we filed to protect our intellectual property 
we expect annual sales and marketing expenses to decrease in fiscal as we utilize our direct sales force and marketing resources more efficiently in the effort to generate awareness and acceptance of cooled thermotherapy 
we also expect to continue to incur significant legal expense in fiscal in connection with our litigation efforts to protect our intellectual property  but we believe that these expenses will decrease from fiscal levels 
amortization of other intangible assets was  in fiscal as well as fiscal we expect future annual amortization expense to be consistent with fiscal and levels 
restructuring expense for fiscal totaled million compared to no restructuring expense in fiscal this restructuring action was initiated in may and concluded in june approximately million of this charge related to severance and company paid benefit expenses associated with the elimination of positions and approximately  related to vacated leased space resulting from a facility consolidation 
we expect all severance and company paid benefit payments to be completed by the fourth quarter of fiscal the lease on the vacated space continues until fiscal net interest income decreased to  during fiscal from  in the prior fiscal year 
the decrease was attributable to lower interest income due to lower cash and investment balances partially offset by lower interest expense 
fiscal years ended june  and net sales for fiscal increased million or percent to million  compared to sales of million in the prior fiscal year 
the growth in revenue was fueled primarily by a percent increase in sales of single use treatment catheters 
revenue in fiscal was also positively affected by a full year of revenue from the prostatron product line  compared to nine months in fiscal cost of goods sold increased to million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal the increase in cost of goods sold resulted from an increase in the volume of cooled thermotherapy system control units and single use treatment catheters sold in  partially offset by a reduction in the per unit production costs of our products  due to increased manufacturing efficiencies and lower product cost 
gross profit as a percentage of sales increased to percent in fiscal from percent in fiscal  due primarily to continued manufacturing process improvements  increased production volumes  decreased raw material costs  price reductions from key suppliers  and a continued mix shift to the sale of our higher margin single use treatment catheters from cooled thermotherapy system control unit sales 
research and development expenses  which include expenditures for product development  regulatory compliance and clinical studies  increased to million in fiscal from million in the prior fiscal year 

table of contents the increase in research and development expenses resulted from increased investments in new product development and clinical study activity 
sales  general and administrative expenses increased to million from million in the prior fiscal year 
the increase in expenses resulted from the continued expansion of our direct sales force  training and promotion  and expenses related to a patent infringement suit that we filed to protect our intellectual property 
amortization of goodwill and other intangible assets decreased to  in fiscal from million in fiscal the decrease in the amortization of goodwill and other indefinite lived intangible assets resulted from the adoption of financial accounting standard board fasb statement  business combinations  and statement  goodwill and other intangible assets  effective july  these statements eliminate the pooling of interests method of accounting for business combinations and the systematic amortization of goodwill 
net interest income decreased to  during fiscal from  in the prior fiscal year 
the decrease was attributable to lower interest income due to lower cash and investment balances and lower average investment yields 
liquidity and capital resources we have financed our operations since inception through sales of equity securities and  to a lesser extent  sales of our cooled thermotherapy system control units and single use treatment catheters 
as of june   we had total cash  cash equivalents and available for sale investments of million and working capital of million 
during fiscal  we used cash of million in operating activities  primarily as a result of our net loss of million partially offset by depreciation and amortization of million 
additionally  decreases in accounts receivable of million and prepaids and other assets of  and an increase in accrued expenses of  were offset by an increase in inventories of million and a decrease in accounts payable of  our investing activities generated million of cash in fiscal primarily resulting from the net sale of investments of million  offset by purchases of equipment of  we used  of cash in financing activities during fiscal due primarily to  of payments made on capital lease obligations partially offset by  of proceeds received through the issuance of common stock 
on october  we paid million in cash to edap in connection with the acquisition of edap s cooled thermotherapy product line  related patents and technologies 
this acquisition was funded through existing cash balances and the issuance of common stock and warrants to purchase common stock 

table of contents as part of the acquisition  we agreed to assume approximately million in lease obligations related to control units located at customer sites within the united states and also issued a promissory note to pay edap  plus accrued interest at an annual rate of percent  on december  future contractual commitments  including interest  that will affect cash flows are as follows in thousands total fiscal year ending june  acquired lease obligation promissory note building lease severance total we have no contractual commitments beyond fiscal year as of june   we had purchase commitments totaling  to edap for the purchase of prostatron control units for scheduled delivery in fiscal we expect to continue to incur additional losses  and we plan to continue offering customers a variety of programs for both evaluation and long term use of our cooled thermotherapy system control units in addition to purchase options 
as of june   our property and equipment  net  included approximately million of control units used in evaluation or long term use programs 
depending on the growth of these programs  we may use additional capital to finance the units used by these customers 
we believe the recently completed restructuring and cost reduction initiative will allow us to reduce our annual operating expenses by approximately percent from fiscal levels  while we focus on increasing sales and providing high quality support to our customers 
third party financing may also present opportunities to leverage the equipment used by our customers under evaluation and long term use programs 
based upon these factors  we believe our million in cash  cash equivalents and available for sale investments at june   together with the funds generated from product sales  will be sufficient to fund our working capital and capital resources needs for the next months 
there can be no assurance  however  that we will not require additional financing in the future or that any additional financing will be available to us on satisfactory terms  if at all 

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our financial instruments include cash  cash equivalents and available for sale investments 
our financial investment portfolio at june   is carried at market value 
increases and decreases in prevailing interest rates generally translate into decreases and increases in the fair value of these instruments 
also  fair values of interest rate sensitive instruments may be affected by the credit worthiness of the issuer  prepayment options  relative values of alternative instruments  the liquidity of the instrument and other general market conditions 
market risk was estimated as the potential decrease in fair value resulting from a hypothetical percent change in interest rates for the issues contained in the investment portfolio and was not materially different from the year end carrying value 
due to the nature of our short term investments  we have concluded that we do not have a material market risk exposure 
our policy is not to enter into derivative financial instruments 
we do not have any significant foreign currency exposure  since we do not generally transact business in foreign currencies 
therefore  we do not have significant overall currency exposure 
in addition  we do not enter into any futures or forward contracts and  therefore  do not have significant market risk exposure with respect to commodity prices
