shareholder value our goal is to deliver both a superior and a more predictable financial performance 
this includes improving our operating return on sales  maintaining a strong balance sheet and improving shareholder return 
industry background the complex process of fabricating semiconductor devices involves several distinct phases that are repeated numerous times 
because each production phase typically requires different processing technologies and equipment  no one semiconductor equipment supplier currently produces all of the types of tools needed to equip an entire state of the art fabrication facility 
instead  semiconductor device manufacturers typically equip their facilities by combining manufacturing equipment produced by a number of suppliers 
each set of equipment performs specific functions in the manufacturing process 
generally the need for new processes  larger substrates the underlying material silicon wafer upon which a semiconductor device or integrated circuit is formed and systems capable of manufacturing increasingly complex devices drives demand for new microelectronics manufacturing equipment and processes 
industries that use microelectronics increasingly demand higher performance devices from manufacturers 
over the last decade  device manufacturers have reduced the size and substantially increased the functionality of individual devices through a number of technological advances 

table of contents our business depends upon the microelectronics manufacturers capital equipment expenditures 
manufacturers expenditures in turn depend on the current and anticipated market demand for products that use microelectronic devices 
the microelectronics industry has been cyclical in nature and has experienced periodic downturns 
we continue to believe that microelectronics manufacturers are asking equipment suppliers to take an increasingly active role in meeting the manufacturers technology capital productivity requirements 
equipment suppliers satisfy this requirement by developing and supporting products and processes required to address the new trends in microelectronics manufacturing 
these trends include development of smaller geometries  transition to new materials  migration to mm wafers and wafer level packaging 
a number of semiconductor device manufacturers began the transition from mm to mm diameter wafers in calendar based upon a report published by the gartner group  a leading industry market research firm  in july  the percentages of investment in semiconductor process equipment allocated by semiconductor manufacturers to mm capable products were approximately in calendar  in calendar  and in calendar semiconductor manufacturers investment in mm capable products is forecasted to be approximately of their total equipment spending in calendar and of their total equipment spending in calendar the semiconductor equipment industry has experienced a significant decline since calendar purchases of semiconductor equipment by microelectronics manufacturers decreased from billion in calendar to billion in calendar as reported by the gartner group 
products the mix of products we sell has varied significantly from year to year 
the following table sets forth  for the periods indicated  the amount of revenues and approximate percentages of our total revenues by our principal product lines fiscal year ended august  august  august  dollars in thousands microlithography products surface conditioning products spare parts and service microlithography products since  we have sold microlithography products under a third party distribution agreement 
in  we began manufacturing microlithography products under a license agreement with a third party 
our microlithography products are used to deposit photoresist  which is light sensitive  etch resistant material used to transfer an image to the surface of a silicon wafer  or insulating films onto the surface of a wafer and develop the photosensitive films 
we have discontinued our active manufacture and sale of these products 
in connection with the discontinuation and exiting of the resist processing market  we established our pss business 
pss is focused on providing existing microlithography customers with key support services  including software maintenance  process applications support  engineering and equipment maintenance 
in addition  pss offers our customers robot refurbishment  system level and standard upgrades  systems operations and maintenance training  and spare parts 
customers can also update or upgrade existing tools to current standards of customer driven specifications through the pss refresh program 
the microlithography products we previously manufactured and sold and which are supported by our pss operations include polaris microlithography clusters 
these systems perform all photolithography processing steps except exposure 
photolithography is a process that uses light to transfer a circuit pattern onto a silicon 
table of contents wafer 
in the cluster  various process modules surround multiple cleanroom qualified robots in a self contained process environment 
the cluster is configured to meet or exceed the throughput capabilities of the integrated exposure tool stepper 
to operate  the robots transport wafers loaded into the cluster s input output module through the various process modules in a sequence programmed by the operator 
the process modules may or may not come from the same supplier 
polaris cluster system process modules can be serviced from outside the tool without disrupting other cluster process operations 
when technological advances make it necessary to replace equipment  individual modules can be replaced or modified with an upgraded module without rendering the entire system obsolete 
the polaris microlithography cluster extends the productivity benefits of the polaris mm cluster platform to mm wafer processing 
the tool can perform mm and smaller design applications 
each model uses the same kind of wafer handling system  environmental control system and software 
several process modules can accommodate both mm and mm wafers in a common module  which allows customers to process both wafer sizes with minimum changeover time between lots 
the price of our polaris clusters ranged from approximately  to  depending on wafer size  number of modules and number of robots required 
originally  the polaris cluster technology was licensed from texas instruments in many improvements have been incorporated into the product 
see patents  trademarks and intellectual property below for additional information regarding the polaris cluster license 
surface conditioning products our surface conditioning products perform front end of line feol fabrication steps  where integrated circuits or transistors are formed in and on the silicon wafer during the manufacturing process  back end of line beol fabrication steps  where metal wiring levels are formed on the surface of the wafer and are connected to the transistors  and packaging wafer cleaning and surface preparation functions  including cleaning  etching and stripping functions necessary to fabricate microelectronic devices 
spray processing systems 
our spray processing systems  which include the mercury and zeta surface conditioning systems  are sophisticated spray chemistry systems that clean  etch and strip wafers at various stages in the device fabrication process 
in these systems  centrifugal spray technology exposes wafers to a programmed  sequenced spray of fresh chemicals inside a closed  nitrogen filled chamber 
cassettes filled with wafers are loaded into a turntable in the process chamber 
processing chemicals  deionized water  which is ultrapure water that has been treated and is used to remove all possible contaminants from the surface of a silicon wafer such as ions  bacteria  silica  particles and dissolved metals  and nitrogen are sequentially dispensed into the chamber through one or more spray posts mounted in the chamber 
as the turntable rotates  nozzles apply a chemical spray to the wafers surfaces 
after chemical application  deionized water is sprayed on the wafer surfaces and all process chamber surfaces to remove chemical residues 
centrifugal force from the rotation  combined with a flow of nitrogen into the chamber  then dries the wafers and the chamber 
our spray processing systems include a microprocessor based controller to program  control and monitor the system s operating functions to ensure precise control and process repeatability 
the mercury system is a semi automated batch spray processor designed for the nanometers nm and nm technologies on a variety of wafer sizes ranging from mm to mm 
the system offers the benefits of low capital cost and low cost of ownership in a small footprint 
the mercury system ranges in price from  to  depending on features and regionally specific add ons 

table of contents the fully automated zeta surface conditioning system  a batch spray processor  is currently available in configurations for both mm and mm wafers 
the advanced process controls  process capability and automation are ideal for leading technology nodes  particularly nm and below 
the zeta products provide a reliable  automated environment to move wafers to and from the process chamber 
this tool s eight chemical flow system allows for a wide range of chemical blend ratios 
in december  we introduced a new generation of zeta surface conditioning systems that improved upon tool capabilities through a significant footprint reduction and are capable of an expanded range of process applications in both feol and beol 
the zeta system is also available in a semi automated configuration capable of processing either mm or mm wafers 
our zeta systems range in price from  to  in response to customers who require ozone technology  which is a form of oxygen having three atoms to the molecule  used for stripping or removing photoresist and other organic contamination from the surface of a silicon wafer  in their device manufacturing processes  we sell an ozonated water generation module for use with our zeta and mercury systems 
our ozone based resist stripping and cleaning technologies are based on our patented and patent pending high concentration ozonated water generation process and dynamic chemical processing 
the use of ozone in semiconductor processing is attractive because it uses only oxygen and water and can replace sulfuric acid in feol processing 
this lowers costs related to chemical and water usage and subsequent waste treatment 
in july  we introduced the flashclean advantage package consisting of hardware  software and process advancements to further enhance the zeta system s productivity and performance by shortening process time and increasing throughput 
field upgrades are available for installed systems and are standard on current factory shipped models 
vapor processing systems 
our excalibur vapor hf etching systems use anhydrous hydrogen fluoride hf gas in conjunction with water vapor to perform selective oxide etching applications 
the semi automated system is available for mm through mm wafers 
the system processes wafers individually  loading them from the wafer carrier into the process chamber by an automated handler to minimize particle contamination 
vapor hf processing offers advantages over processing systems using liquid chemicals  including providing unique high selective etch capabilities 
the high selectivity allows the removal of undesired oxides while etching little or none of the desired films 
this capability is unique to the excalibur vapor hf process and provides customers with the means to create device features not readily manufacturable by other methods 
the excalibur system ranges in price from  to  depending on the model  wafer size  number of process chambers and related electronic control requirements 
cryokinetic processing systems 
through a license agreement with ibm  we manufacture  market  and service products using ibm s cryogenic aerosol cleaning technology 
cryokinetic is an energy transfer process used to remove non chemically bonded particles from the surface of a microelectric device 
cryokinetic processing is dry and non reactive using frozen argon nitrogen aerosols to remove surface particles through momentum transfer  when the high velocity aerosols impact the particles 
the gas flow carries contaminants away from the wafer and removes them from the process chamber 
the antares cx advanced cleaning system is for mm and mm single wafer  fully automated processing 
the antares cx system removes surface particles that can be either process defects or fab contamination from sensitive new materials  such as copper and low k dielectric films 
low k dielectric film is a material used as insulation between interconnects for beol semiconductor manufacturing applications 
because low k dielectric films can be porous  a dry method such as the cryokinetic technology is especially attractive because it does not alter material properties as compared to wet and scrub methods 
antares cx systems range in price from  to  immersion processing systems 
with our acquisition of yieldup international in october  we expanded into the critical cleaning segment of the surface conditioning market through immersion processing 
immersion processing is a method used to clean silicon wafers by immersing the wafer in 
table of contents multiple tanks filled with process chemicals 
yieldup s operations were transferred to chaska  minnesota in september in june  we introduced the magellan immersion clean system and in august  released a mm version 
with this product  we expanded our immersion processing solutions by providing a system capable of multiple  mainstream cleans  including critical clean  resist strip and etch 
the magellan system is a fully automated immersion cleaning system designed for processing of mm and mm wafers at advanced technology nodes 
it is differentiated from the competition through rapid cycle time  flexibility and high performance in a footprint that is up to smaller than the leading competition when configured for specific applications 
the tool incorporates an extensive portfolio of exclusive intellectual property  including our surface tension gradient stg rinse dry technology  symflow etch technology  ozone oxide re growth and narrow gate compatible megasonic technology 
the magellan system ranges in price from  to  our customers have been running product demonstrations in our laboratory and we anticipate shipping the first system in december the yieldup system is a rinsing and drying system that delivers nm capable watermark free performance in a stand alone platform 
originally designed for mm wafer processing  its capabilities have been expanded to serve smaller wafers as well 
the yieldup module is also available for integration into a wet bench system 
the yieldup system is a two chamber etching  rinsing and drying system that provides integrated hydrofluoric acid etching 
yieldup immersion systems range in price from  to  spare parts and service we offer system upgrade packages  spare part kits  software maintenance licenses  individual spare part components and support services that provide product and process enhancements to extend the life of previously purchased and installed surface conditioning and microlithography equipment 
our customer service and process engineers assist and train customers worldwide to perform preventive maintenance on and to service our equipment 
in addition  our process engineering groups develop process applications to expand the capabilities of our equipment 
these upgrade and spare part packages and support service programs enable our worldwide customers to realize a higher return on their capital investment 
we sell a variety of process  service and maintenance programs 
a number of customers have purchased maintenance contracts in which our service employees work at the customer s facility to provide process service and maintenance support for our equipment 
backlog and seasonality our backlog consists of orders with delivery dates within the next months for which a customer s purchase order has been received 
our backlog at fiscal year end was million  of which related to surface conditioning products and related to the pss formerly microlithography products 
our backlog at fiscal year end was million  of which related to surface conditioning products and related to microlithography products 
approximately of our backlog at fiscal year end and of our backlog at fiscal year end was comprised of orders from two customers for each year 
texas instruments and sandia national labs were the top two customers in our backlog at the end of fiscal and the loss of any of these as a customer could have a material adverse effect on our operations 
all orders are subject to cancellation by the customer and in some cases a penalty provision could apply to a cancellation 
in fiscal  purchase orders aggregating approximately million  constituting of sales  were canceled and not rescheduled 
in fiscal  purchase orders aggregating approximately million  constituting of sales  were canceled and not rescheduled 
because of the timing and relative size of certain orders received by us and possible changes in delivery schedules and order cancellations  our backlog can vary from time to time so that backlog as of any particular date is not necessarily indicative of actual sales for any subsequent period 
our business is not seasonal to any significant extent 
see 
table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations for additional sales and backlog information 
research and development we believe that our future success depends in large part on our ability to enhance  in collaboration with our customers and other equipment and materials manufacturers  our existing product lines to meet the changing needs of microelectronics manufacturers 
we believe that industry trends  such as the use of smaller circuit geometries  increased use of larger substrates and manufacturers increased desire for integrated processing equipment  will make highly automated and integrated systems  including single substrate processing systems  more important to customers 
for assistance in our development efforts  we maintain relationships with our customers and others  who help identify and review industry trends and our development activities to meet the industry s advanced technology needs 
our current research and development programs are focused on the need for cleaner substrate surfaces due to smaller geometries  increased process control and flexibility through monitoring and software management systems and process automation  robotics automation in the cleanroom  and integration of our product offerings with other suppliers products 
each of these programs involves customer and other equipment manufacturers collaboration to ensure proper machine configuration and process development to meet industry requirements 
we maintain an  square foot  state of the art demonstration and process development laboratory for our surface conditioning business in our chaska  minnesota facility 
in addition  our japanese affiliate  m fsi  ltd  maintains a demonstration laboratory in its okayama  japan facility 
expenditures for research and development  which are expensed as incurred  during fiscal were approximately million  representing of total sales 
expenditures for research and development during fiscal were approximately million  representing of total sales  and expenditures for research and development during fiscal were approximately million  representing of total sales 
we expect to continue to make substantial investments in research and development 
we also recognize the importance of managing product transitions successfully  as the introduction of new products could adversely affect sales of existing products 
marketing  sales and support we market our products worldwide to manufacturers of microelectronic devices 
our marketing and sales efforts are focused on building long term relationships with our customers 
these efforts are supported by marketing  sales  and service personnel  along with process and applications engineers that work closely with individual customers to find solutions to their needs 
at the beginning of fiscal year  our products were directly sold and serviced in north america  while in europe  the asia pacific region and japan  products were distributed primarily through two affiliated distributors  metron technology  nv and m fsi  ltd 
on october   we announced the early termination of our distribution agreements with metron technology 
as of march   we moved to a direct responsibility for selling and servicing our products in europe and the asia pacific region 
metron technology continues to represent our products in israel and m fsi continues to be our affiliated distributor in japan 
see item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations for additional information regarding the termination of the metron technology distribution agreements 
this change occurred as a result of our customers asking us to strengthen our presence in these regions and to bring them the full capabilities of our organization 
we worked closely with metron technology to ensure a successful transition of sales  applications  service and spares logistical functions 
our direct sales and service support employees work with customers to understand their processing requirements and to configure our equipment to provide applications solutions to meet those requirements 

table of contents as of the end of fiscal  our sales effort was supported by approximately employees and contractors engaged in customer service and support 
see item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations for additional information regarding the transitioning of our sales and service efforts 
international sales  primarily in europe  asia pacific region and japan accounted for approximately of total sales in fiscal  of total sales in fiscal  and of total sales in fiscal as of august   we owned a equity interest in metron technology  nv we have sold a portion of our metron technology stock over the past few months 
as of november  we held approximately million shares of metron technology stock 
metron technology has an extensive distribution organization located in europe  israel  india  and in the asia pacific region  and sells materials and equipment on behalf of several semiconductor equipment and consumables manufacturers 
we own a equity interest in m fsi  ltd  a japanese joint venture company formed in with mitsui co  ltd 
and its wholly owned subsidiary  chlorine engineers corp  ltd 
collectively  mitsui 
mitsui owns a equity interest in m fsi 
in connection with its formation  we and mitsui granted m fsi certain product and technology licenses and product distribution rights 
in fiscal year  the majority of our international sales were made to metron technology or m fsi for resale to end users of our products 
in addition to metron technology prior to the termination of our distribution agreements and m fsi having a direct presence in europe  asia and japan  we augmented their support to customers with several sales and service personnel located in the regions 
in some cases  we also sold directly to an international customer  in which case we paid a commission to our affiliated distributor in connection with the sale 
when commissions are taken into account  the international sales to our affiliates are on terms generally no less favorable to us than international sales by us directly to non affiliates 
manufacturing  raw materials and suppliers we maintain manufacturing facilities in chaska  minnesota and allen  texas 
we are winding down the microlithography business in allen  texas and we plan to sell the manufacturing facility in spring we typically assemble our products and systems from components and prefabricated parts manufactured and supplied by others  such as process controllers  robots  integrated circuits  power supplies  stainless steel pressure vessels  chamber bowls  valves and relays 
certain of the items manufactured by others are made to our specifications 
typically  final assembly and systems tests are performed by our manufacturing personnel 
quality control is maintained through quality assurance programs with suppliers  incoming inspection of components  in process inspection during equipment assembly  and final inspection and operation of manufactured equipment prior to shipment 
we have a company wide quality program in place and received iso certification in certain of the components and subassemblies included in our products are obtained from a single supplier or a limited group of suppliers to ensure overall quality and delivery timeliness 
although we seek to reduce dependence on sole and limited source suppliers  disruption or termination of certain of these sources could have a temporary adverse effect on our operations 
we believe that alternative sources could be obtained and qualified to supply these products  if necessary  but that production delays would likely occur in some cases 
further  a prolonged inability to obtain certain components could have an adverse effect on our operating results  delay scheduled deliveries and result in damage to customer relationships 
competition in each of our regional markets we face intense competition from established competitors  some of which have greater financial  engineering  research  development  manufacturing  marketing  service and support resources 
to remain competitive  we must continue to invest in research and development  marketing  and customer service and support  and manage our operating expenses 
there can be no assurance that we will have sufficient resources to continue to make such investments or that our products will continue to be viewed as competitive as a result of technological advances by competitors or changes 
table of contents in semiconductor technology 
our competitors also may increase their efforts to gain and retain market share through competitive pricing  strategic alliances or mergers and acquisitions 
such competitive pressures may require us to reduce prices or may result in lost orders that could adversely affect our financial results 
if our competitors enter into strategic alliances with leading semiconductor manufacturers in the areas of surface conditioning  this could impair our ability to sell our products and adversely affect our operating results 
significant competitive factors in the equipment market include system price  quality  process repeatability  capability and flexibility  ability to integrate with other products  process or tool of record  incumbency and overall cost of ownership  including reliability  automation  throughput  system price and customer support 
we have experienced significant price competition from certain competitors 
however  we believe that we have the strategies in place to develop technological advantages over our competitors 
to realize and maintain these advantages will require a continued high level of investment by us in research and development  marketing  and customer service and support as well as controlling operating expenses 
our surface conditioning products compete with  among others  dainippon screen manufacturing co 
ltd  kaijo denki  sankyo sugai  semitool  inc  scp global technologies  the sez group  and tokyo electron ltd 
our pss organization competes with various small equipment refurbishment  equipment maintenance and spare parts providers 
customers we sell products from one or more of our product lines to most major microelectronics manufacturers 
we have an extensive history of sales to several of the largest integrated circuit manufacturers and we have over active customers worldwide 
texas instruments accounted for approximately of our total sales in fiscal  of our total sales in fiscal and of our total sales in fiscal ibm accounted for approximately of our total sales in  of our total sales in fiscal and less than in fiscal philips semiconductor accounted for approximately of our sales in fiscal and less than in each of fiscal and we have experienced  and expect to continue to experience  fluctuations in our customer mix 
the timing of an order for our equipment is primarily dependent upon the customer s expansion program  replacement needs  or requirements to improve productivity and yields 
consequently  a customer who places significant orders in one year will not necessarily place significant orders in subsequent years 
sales to metron technology and m fsi  our international distributors  accounted for approximately of our total sales in fiscal  of our total sales in fiscal  and of our total sales in fiscal usually these systems are purchased for resale to device manufacturers 
on october   we announced the termination of our distribution agreements with metron technology effective march  metron technology will continue to represent our products in israel 
see item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations for additional information regarding the termination of the metron technology distribution agreements 
under the m fsi distribution agreement  m fsi has exclusive distribution rights with respect to certain of our products in japan 
a licensing agreement allows m fsi to manufacture certain of our products 
the agreements may be terminated only upon the occurrence of certain events or conditions 
there is no obligation under the distribution agreement for m fsi to purchase a specified amount or percentage of our products 
patents  trademarks and intellectual property our success depends upon a variety of factors  including proprietary technology 
it is important to protect our technology by obtaining and enforcing patents 
consequently  we have an active program to file patent applications in the united states and other countries on inventions we consider significant 
we also 
table of contents possess other proprietary intellectual property  including trademarks  know how  trade secrets and copyrights 
we also protect our proprietary information through non disclosure agreements with our employees and with third parties 
we have a number of patents in the united states and other countries  and additional applications are pending 
these patents may be challenged  invalidated or circumvented  or may not provide any competitive advantages to us 
pending applications may not result in patents and the claims allowed in future patents may not be sufficiently broad to protect our technology 
the laws of some foreign countries may not permit the protection of our proprietary rights to the same extent as under the laws of the united states 
although we believe that protection afforded by our patents  patent applications  and other intellectual property rights has value  because of rapidly changing technology  our future success is primarily dependent on our employees engineering  marketing  service and manufacturing skills 
in the normal course of business  we from time to time receive and make inquiries about possible patent infringement 
in dealing with such inquiries  it may be necessary or useful for us to obtain or grant licenses or other rights 
however  there can be no assurance that such license rights will be available to us on commercially reasonable terms  or at all 
the inability to obtain certain license or other rights  or to obtain such licenses or rights on favorable terms  or the need to engage in litigation could have a material adverse effect on us 
see also item legal proceedings for a discussion of pending intellectual property litigation 
our microlithography polaris cluster was offered by us under a non exclusive license from texas instruments 
we have converted the license to a fully paid up  worldwide license to sell and manufacture the polaris cluster 
we also have the non exclusive right to manufacture and sell related texas instruments modules 
the license agreement continues until terminated 
it may be terminated by either party upon a breach by the other party  and the failure to cure  in accordance with the terms of the agreement 
our surface conditioning antares cx cleaning system is offered by us under license agreements from ibm 
the licenses require certain minimum royalties and system based royalties 
royalties are based on the royalty portion revenues of licensed equipment that excludes amounts for freight  taxes  customers duties  insurance  discounts  and certain equipment not manufactured by us 
we have approximately us patents 
expiration dates range from to employees as of august   we had approximately employees 
competition for highly skilled employees is intense 
we believe that a great part of our future success depends upon our continued ability to retain and attract qualified employees 
we are not subject to any collective bargaining agreement and have never been subject to a work stoppage 
we believe we have good relations with our employees 
environmental matters in january  we received our certificate of registration from bsi  inc for its iso environmental management system 
iso is an internationally recognized environmental management standard that empowers organizations to address the environmental impact of activities  services and processes 
the standard then provides a framework for enterprises to take steps to identify issues significant to them and implement environmental management programs to achieve improved performance 
registration with iso allows companies to reaffirm that environmental processes are essential components of their business strategy 
we have a long history of environmentally friendly practices and research and development programs that actively seek out ways to operate more environmentally efficient 
we registered with iso to emphasize our ongoing commitment to the preservation and protection of the environment  and to support existing environmental health and safety initiatives 

table of contents we implemented an enterprise wide program to actively engage our employees and to emphasize the importance of protecting the environment in everyday life at fsi 
our programs include recycling  water use reductions  chemical handling processes and equipment design for the environment 
we are subject to a variety of governmental regulations related to the discharge or disposal of toxic  volatile or otherwise hazardous chemicals used in the manufacturing process 
we believe we are in compliance with these regulations and that we have obtained all necessary environmental permits to conduct our business 
these permits generally relate to the disposal of hazardous wastes 
if we fail to comply with present or future regulations  fines could be imposed  production could be suspended  or operations could cease 
such regulations could require us to acquire significant equipment or take other actions to comply with environmental regulations at a potentially significant cost to us 
if we fail to control the use of  or adequately restrict the discharge or disposal of  hazardous substances  we could incur future liabilities 
see also item legal proceedings for a discussion of our environmental legal proceedings 
we believe that compliance with federal  state and local provisions that have been enacted or adopted regulating discharges of materials into the environment  or otherwise relating to the protection of the environment  will not have a material effect upon our capital expenditures  earnings and competitive position 
international sales our sales for each of the last three fiscal years are disclosed in the financial statements included in item of this report 
available information our annual reports on form k  quarterly reports on form q  current reports on form k  and amendments to those reports filed or furnished pursuant to section a or d of the exchange act of are available free of charge through our website at www

other risk factors we discuss certain risk factors in the risk factors section in the management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations included in item of this report 
item properties we own a  square foot facility in chaska  minnesota  which cost approximately million to construct and equip 
the facility contains our surface conditioning business and other administrative and support functions 
it includes research  laboratory and engineering facilities   square feet of class  and  cleanroom space  manufacturing support operations and a customer training center 
we also own a  square foot facility in allen  texas  which cost approximately million to construct and equip 
this facility contains the pss business manufacturing  support operations and engineering organization 
our plan is to sell this facility during spring and relocate the pss operations to a suitable sized facility 
our united states leased locations include a  square foot facility in milpitas  california and other smaller offices used primarily for sales and service 
the other smaller offices used primarily for sales and service were closed in early fiscal we also maintain small leased sales and service offices throughout europe and asia near our customer locations 
management believes its existing facilities are well maintained and in good operating condition 

table of contents item legal proceedings we generate minor amounts of liquid and solid hazardous waste and use licensed haulers and disposal facilities to ship and dispose of such waste 
in the past  we have received notice from state or federal enforcement agencies that we are a potentially responsible party prp in connection with the investigation of several hazardous waste disposal sites owned and operated by third parties 
in each matter  we have elected to participate in settlement offers made to all de minimis parties with respect to such sites 
the risk of being named a prp is that if any of the other prp s are unable to contribute its proportionate share of the liability  if any  associated with the site  those prp s that are financially able could be held financially responsible for the shortfall 
there has and continues to be substantial litigation regarding patent and other intellectual property rights in the microelectronics industry 
commercialization of new products or further commercialization of our current products could provoke claims of infringement by third parties 
in the future  litigation may be necessary to enforce patents issued to us  to protect trade secrets or know how owned by us or to defend us against claimed infringement of the rights of others and to determine the scope and validity of our proprietary rights 
any such litigation could result in substantial costs and diversion of effort by us  which by itself could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and operating results 
further  adverse determinations in such litigation could result in our loss of proprietary rights  subject us to significant liabilities to third parties  require us to seek licenses from third parties or prevent us from manufacturing or selling one or more products  any of which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
certain of our product lines are intended for use with hazardous chemicals 
as a result  we are notified by our customers from time to time of incidents involving our equipment that have resulted in a spill or release of a hazardous chemical 
in some cases it may be alleged that we or our equipment are at fault 
there can be no assurance that any future litigation resulting from such claims would not have a material adverse effect on our business or financial results 
in fall  pursuant to the employee stock purchase and shareholder agreement dated november  between eric c 
hsu and ssi the shareholder agreement and in connection with mr 
hsu s termination of his employment with ssi in august  the former shareholders of ssi purchased the shares of ssi common stock then held by mr

hsu the plaintiffs filed a lawsuit in the superior court of california  county of alameda  southern division  against semiconductor systems  inc ssi  our wholly owned subsidiary that was acquired in april  and the former shareholders of ssi 
the plaintiffs alleged that such purchase breached the shareholder agreement and violated the california corporations code  breached the fiduciary duty owed plaintiffs by the individual defendants and constituted fraud 
in september and october  certain of mr 
hsu s claims were tried to a jury in alameda county superior court in oakland  california 
at the conclusion of the trial  the jury made the following findings 
the jury found that ssi breached the shareholder agreement between it and mr 
hsu and that the damages that resulted were approximately million 
in addition  each of the individual defendant shareholders was found liable for conversion and damages of million were awarded 
certain individual defendants were also found to have intentionally interfered with mr 
hsu s prospective economic advantage and damages of million were awarded 
finally  several individual defendants and ssi were found to have violated certain provisions of the california corporation code and damages of million were awarded 
in proceedings subsequent to the trial  the court determined that plaintiffs are entitled to an award against ssi of prejudgment interest on the breach of contract damages approximately million at percent per annum from october in addition  the court awarded plaintiffs approximately  in costs and approximately million in attorneys fees against ssi and the individual defendants 
on november   the court signed its final judgment reflecting the jury s awards  interest  attorneys fees and costs assessed against each of the defendants 

table of contents following the entry of judgment  ssi and the other defendants filed post trial motions seeking reduction in the jury s damage awards and or a new trial 
the court denied these post trial motions and there was no reduction in damages against ssi 
hsu was awarded an additional  for attorneys fees and expenses incurred since the judgment was rendered in november the total judgment against ssi together with post judgment interest and attorneys fees as of august  aggregated approximately million 
ssi and the individual defendants have filed an appeal on a variety of grounds and we posted an appeal bond on behalf of ssi and defendants in the amount of million 
as part of the posting of the bond  we entered into a letter of credit in the amount of million with a surety company 
this letter of credit was collateralized with restricted cash of approximately the same amount 
in november  due to concerns related to our fiscal losses  the bonding company required us to increase the letter of credit to million and to increase the collateral to a similar level 
we  on behalf of ssi  have made a claim with respect to the lawsuit under the escrow created at the time of our acquisition of ssi 
the escrow was established to secure certain indemnification obligations of the former shareholders of ssi 
the escrow consists of an aggregate of  shares of our common stock paid to the former shareholders of ssi as consideration in the acquisition 
the former shareholders have agreed to hold us and ssi harmless from any claim arising out of any securities transactions between ssi and the shareholders or former shareholders of ssi 
the indemnification obligations of the individual ssi shareholders are capped at approximately million in the aggregate 
any shares in the escrow returned to us to satisfy any indemnification obligations will be valued at per share  the per share price of our common stock at the time of the ssi acquisition 
given the escrowed shares and the additional indemnification by the individual ssi shareholders  along with our litigation reserve  we believe we are adequately reserved for this potential liability 
however  there is considerable uncertainty as to the ultimate resolution of this matter and the respective liability  if any  of ssi 
we will continue with our appeal process and our defense

item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations industry update the microelectronics industry has been cyclical in nature and has experienced various downturns and upturns throughout the last decade 
the industry has experienced a significant decline since calendar approximately six months after the tragedy  certain semiconductor manufacturers  including our customers  started to realize improved demand for their products 
this overall electronics industry recovery turned out to be unsustainable as we approached summer the industry has experienced some improvement during our fiscal  however no significant rebound is expected until early calendar industry information includes information from gartner dataquest  vlsi research  inc and ic insights 
on a calendar year basis  demand for the semiconductor devices manufactured by many of our customers decreased in with a minor increase of approximately in semiconductor device demand is currently forecasted by analysts to increase up to in calendar as compared to the prior year 
our customers have been experiencing increased utilization rates for their fabrication facilities as device unit demand has increased over the past few quarters 
industry analysts are currently reporting utilization rates in the range of to 
total worldwide capital spending for semiconductor equipment decreased in calendar and in calendar industry analysts are predicting a recovery in calendar with an increase in semiconductor equipment spending of to as compared to calendar this improvement in equipment spending is dependent upon a global economic recovery  continued customer confidence  
table of contents stronger sustained demand for consumer electronics and an increased business spending on information technology infrastructure 
the increased demand for devices  coupled with semiconductor manufacturers need to produce devices with smaller features  copper metal interconnects and better dielectric or insulating materials  is expected to contribute to an increase in demand for semiconductor manufacturing equipment in calendar as compared to the prior year 
in addition  in an effort to reduce the cost of devices  semiconductor manufacturers are increasing their investments in equipment capable of processing mm diameter wafers as compared to the significant investment in mm process equipment during the last cycle 
we believe that any significant increase in equipment spending by device manufacturers will be led by the investment in mm capacity  smaller device feature sizes  and process technology required for new materials such as copper and low k dielectrics 
these are all technology areas where we have successfully focused our research and development investment the past few years and represent applications for which we have been receiving orders during the past to months 
application of critical accounting policies in accordance with securities and exchange commission guidance  those material accounting policies that we believe are the most critical to an investor s understanding of our financial results and condition and require complex management judgment are discussed below 
our critical accounting policies are as follows revenue recognition  valuation of long lived and intangible assets and goodwill  and estimating valuation allowances and accrued liabilities  specifically product warranty  inventory obsolescence  allowance for doubtful accounts and assessment of the probability of the outcome of current litigation 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred or services have been rendered  the seller s price is fixed or determinable and collectibility is reasonably assured 
if our equipment sales involve sales to our existing customers who have previously accepted the same type s of equipment with the same type s of specifications  we account for the product sales as a multiple element arrangement 
we recognize the equipment revenue upon shipment and transfer of title 
the other multiple elements also include installation and training 
equipment installation revenue is valued based on estimated service person hours to complete installation and published or quoted service labor rates and is recognized when the labor has been completed 
training revenue is valued based on published training class prices and is recognized when the customers complete the training classes 
the published or quoted service labor rates and training class prices are rates actually charged and billed to our customers 
all other product sales with customer specific acceptance provisions are recognized upon customer acceptance 
future revenues may be negatively impacted if we are unable to meet customer specific acceptance criteria 
revenue related to spare part sales is recognized upon shipment 
revenue related to maintenance and service contracts is recognized ratably over the duration of the contracts 
timing of revenue recognition is dependent on the mix of revenue recognized upon shipment versus acceptance and for revenue recognized upon acceptance  it is dependent upon when customer specific criteria are met 

table of contents valuation of long lived and intangible assets and goodwill we assess the impairment of identifiable intangibles  long lived assets and related goodwill at least annually  and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
if we do determine that the carrying value of intangibles  long lived assets and related goodwill may not be recoverable  we measure any impairment based on a projected discounted cash flow method using a discount rate determined by our management to be commensurate with the risk inherent in our current business model or another valuation technique 
net intangible assets and long lived assets amounted to million as of august  in  sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  became effective and as a result  we ceased to amortize approximately million of goodwill 
in lieu of amortization  we were required to perform an initial impairment review of our goodwill in and an annual impairment review thereafter 
as of august   we performed our initial evaluation of our goodwill for any indication of impairment 
as of that date  our market capitalization was approximately  this fair value was allocated to our two reporting units based on relative cash flows 
as of august   there was no indication of goodwill impairment 
subsequent to august   the world experienced the tragedy 
this caused economic uncertainty and delayed capital equipment purchases by many of our customers 
approximately six months after the tragedy  certain semiconductor manufacturers  including our customers  started to realize improved demand for their products 
at about the same time  we  along with a number of our peer companies  started to experience more positive order activity 
this overall electronics industry recovery turned out to be unsustainable as we approached summer this change in industry conditions had a negative impact on our market capitalization and our financial performance  including cash flows 
our market capitalization went from  as of august  to  as of august   the date of our annual goodwill impairment assessment 
we reviewed for impairment of goodwill according to the guidelines of sfas and  based upon the analysis  we deemed goodwill impaired 
as a result  we recorded a charge to selling  general and administrative expenses of million in the fourth quarter of fiscal the decrease in our market capitalization  the continued downturn in the electronics industry and the overall global economic conditions  all contributed to the impairment of our goodwill as of the end of fiscal our investment in our affiliate  metron technology  was accounted for by the equity method of accounting until the beginning of the fourth quarter of fiscal while we determined at august  that our investment in metron technology was not other than temporarily impaired  our decision on october  to use metron technology shares with a value of to settle the termination fee payment with metron technology triggered an impairment loss on that date for all of the shares we held 
accordingly  the difference between the per share carrying value and the per share value agreed upon for purposes of the transition agreement on the shares held was recorded as a non cash impairment charge of million in our quarter ended november  the per share value reflected the average closing price of the common stock of metron technology for the five business days prior to the execution of the transition agreement 
upon completion of the termination of the distribution agreements with metron technology  our ownership in metron technology was reduced from approximately to approximately 
see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements for a discussion of the early termination of our distribution agreements with metron technology 
as a result  in the fourth quarter of fiscal we began to account for our investment in metron technology as a marketable equity security available for sale and carried the investment at fair market per the closing price of metron technology s stock as reported on the nasdaq national market 
the fair value of metron technology is subject to stock market fluctuations 
as 
table of contents of august   the fair market value of our investment in metron technology was million  including unrealized holding gains of million 
in the second quarter of fiscal  we conducted a review of the long lived assets of the pss business 
accordingly  we recorded a write down of million against the property  plant and equipment assets of the pss business to write the assets down to their estimated fair value 
this write down included a million impairment charge associated with the pss facility and a million impairment charge related to the pss business equipment 
these impairment charges were based upon our review of the pss business equipment and their estimated fair values 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements for a discussion of impairment charges 
product warranty estimation we record a liability for warranty claims at the time of sale 
the amount of the liability is based on the trend in the historical ratio of claims to sales  the historical length of time between the sale and resulting warranty claim  anticipated releases of new products and other factors  including product performance 
the warranty periods for new equipment manufactured by us range from to months 
although management believes the likelihood to be relatively low  claims experience could be materially different from actual results because of the introduction of new  more complex products  a change in our warranty policy in response to industry trends  competition or other external forces  manufacturing changes that could impact product quality  or as yet unrecognized defects in products sold 
inventory reserves estimation we record reserves for inventory shrinkage and for potentially excess  obsolete and slow moving inventory 
the amounts of these reserves are based upon historical loss trends  inventory levels  physical inventory and cycle count adjustments  expected product lives  forecasted sales demand and recoverability 
results could be materially different if demand for our products decreased because of economic or competitive conditions  length of the industry downturn  or if products become obsolete because of technical advancements in the industry or by us 
we recorded million of inventory reserves in the second quarter of fiscal based on the estimated future sales and recoverability  specifically related to our decision to wind down the microlithography business 
we determined the million inventory reserves by comparing the inventory balance of the pss business as of march  to the inventory balance expected to be used for pss orders in backlog  anticipated orders  and anticipated order cancellations and adjusted the net inventory balance to its net realizable value 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal  we reduced the reserve by million 
this was primarily due to shipment of spare parts and upgrades  where the related inventory was previously written down to zero value 
in addition  we were able to reduce certain open purchase order commitments and inventory buyback requirements 
allowance for doubtful accounts estimation management must make estimates of the uncollectibility of accounts receivable 
the most significant risk is the risk of sudden unexpected deterioration in financial condition of a significant customer which is not considered in the allowance 
management specifically analyzes accounts receivable and analyzes historical bad debts  customer concentrations  customer credit worthiness  current economic trends and changes in our customer payment terms when evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts 
results could be materially impacted if the financial condition of a significant customer deteriorated and related receivables are deemed uncollectible 
litigation liability estimation management s current estimated range of liability related to some of the pending litigation is based on claims for which our management can estimate the amount and range of loss 
we have recorded the minimum estimated liability related to those claims  where there is a range of loss 
because of the 
table of contents uncertainties related to both the amount and range of loss on the pending litigation  management is not always able to make a reasonable estimate of the liability that could result from an unfavorable outcome 
as additional information becomes available  we will assess the potential liability related to our pending litigation and revise our estimates 
such revisions in our estimates of the potential liability could materially impact our results of operations and financial position 
results of operations wind down of microlithography business in march  we announced that we would wind down the microlithography business due to uncertain economic conditions and the weak semiconductor industry forecast 
the decision was also due to a history of operating losses of the microlithography business as a result of competitive pressures and general economic and industry conditions 
our decision to wind down the microlithography business was made after exploring the following options continue to fund the operating losses of the pss business with a goal to gain marketshare with mm customers and ultimately return the business to profitability 
establish a strategic relationship with another semiconductor process equipment manufacturer 
divestiture of the business to another process equipment company or a financial investor group 
spin out the business to a strategic and financial investor group 
discontinue strategic and new product applications development and operate the business in a maintenance mode until industry conditions improve 
prior to our decision to wind down the microlithography business  we had discussions with prospective strategic partners and a number of financial partners 
a number of these prospective partners conducted technology  customer  financial and operations due diligence 
we also approached several of the semiconductor manufacturers that are investing in mm facilities to see if they would have an interest in supporting us with multiple orders 
even though a number of these customers had a strong interest in supporting a second source in addition to tokyo electron ltd 
for this technology  they were unable to make the investment commitment under the timeline that we proposed 
none of these efforts yielded the results we were seeking 
as a result  we announced in march that we would discontinue our microlithography business operations and wind down the business operations over the next several quarters 
the pss business revenue represented million  or  of our total revenue of million for the fiscal year ended august  and million  or  of our total revenue of million for the fiscal year ended august  prior to the wind down of the microlithography business  approximately of our employees worked in this business 
we recorded million in severance expenses in fiscal we recorded million of inventory reserves in the second quarter of fiscal based on the estimated future sales and recoverability  specifically related to our decision to wind down the microlithography business 
we determined the million inventory reserve based on the inventory balance as of march  as compared to the inventory balance expected to be used for pss orders in backlog  anticipated orders and anticipated order cancellations and adjusted the net inventory balance to its net realizable value 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal  we reduced the inventory reserve by million 
this was primarily due to shipment of spare parts and upgrades where the related inventory was previously written down to zero value 
in addition  we were able to reduce certain open purchase order commitments and inventory buyback requirements 

table of contents we will continue to try to sell the impaired inventory to our customers as spares  refurbished systems and upgrades to existing systems 
if unsuccessful  some of the items will be disposed of 
only as items are sold or disposed of will the reserve be reversed or reduced 
gross margins will be higher if inventory carried at a reduced cost is sold 
the higher margins will fluctuate depending on the timing of product sales  specific customers and specific inventory sold 
we also recorded a write down of million against the property  plant and equipment assets of the pss business 
this write down included a million impairment charge for the microlithography business facility 
this impairment charge was based upon our estimate of fair value 
also included in the write down was an impairment charge of million to the microlithography business equipment 
this impairment charge was based upon our review of microlithography business equipment and its estimated fair value 
the employee headcount for the pss group was reduced from approximately to employees 
we started to recognize the full financial savings of this reduction in the fourth quarter of fiscal the anticipated savings  consisting primarily of employee salaries and benefits from the third quarter restructuring  was approximately million for the fourth quarter of fiscal and is expected to be to million on an annualized basis 
we expect that a majority of the cost savings will initially be in research and development expenses associated with the pss products 
our focus over the next several quarters is to successfully wind down this business 
our primary goals are to satisfy our remaining pss customer obligations and support requirements 
we are committed to providing a path for our customers to achieve a reasonable life for their polaris systems and have established key support services programs to support this goal 
we expect to generate to million of positive cash flow from this operation over the next several quarters as we continue to sell inventory  collect accounts receivable and assuming we are able to dispose of the owned facility in allen  texas in spring we also expect to relocate the remaining support services personnel to an appropriately sized facility 
transition agreement with metron technology on october   we entered into a transition agreement with metron technology related to the early termination of our distribution agreements with metron technology for europe and the asia pacific region  effective march  closing date 
under the terms of the transition agreement  we assumed direct sales  service and applications support and logistics responsibilities for the surface conditioning and microlithography products in europe and the asia pacific region as of the closing date  while metron technology will continue to represent our products in israel 
in conjunction with this transaction  we agreed to advance up to million to metron technology on a secured basis to repurchase inventory 
we advanced million pursuant to a note receivable shortly after we entered into the transition agreement and had a potential obligation to advance up to an additional million 
after completing a review of the inventory relative to our purchase obligations  it was determined that our obligation to repurchase inventory was approximately million 
we recorded approximately million of sales returns related to the inventory repurchased from metron technology during the second quarter of fiscal under the terms of the transition agreement  we agreed to pay metron technology on the closing date an early termination fee of approximately million 
we originally anticipated surrendering approximately million metron technology common shares owned by us in payment of this early termination fee as approved by metron technology s shareholders 
as a result of the inventory repurchase obligation being less than the advance of million  we delivered  shares  which is less than the million metron technology common shares originally contemplated 
we owned approximately million shares  or approximately of metron technology  after surrendering the  shares in april as of november   we owned approximately million shares of metron technology stock 

table of contents we recorded a charge of approximately million to selling  general and administrative expenses in the first quarter of fiscal associated with the early termination fee 
we also recorded a non cash impairment charge of approximately million in other expense in the first quarter of fiscal for the shares of metron technology that we owned 
the impairment charges were based upon the difference between the per share carrying value and the per share value agreed upon for purposes of the transition agreement 
the per share value reflected the average closing price of the common stock of metron technology for the five business days prior to the execution of the transition agreement 
on the closing date  we offered employment to approximately metron technology employees that had been dedicated to sales  technical service and applications engineering activities related to the distribution of our products in europe and the asia pacific region 
impairment of goodwill due to a significant decline in our stock price in the fourth quarter of fiscal  the continued downturn in the industry and the overall global economic conditions  an impairment review of goodwill was completed as of august  as a result  the balance of goodwill was deemed other than temporarily impaired and we recorded an impairment charge of million in the fourth quarter of fiscal fiscal restructuring during the second quarter of fiscal  in response to the continued delay in an industry recovery and the overall economy  we implemented cost reduction actions which included a reduction in the overall workforce  salary cuts for all employees  a decrease in planned capital expenditures and a reduction in other discretionary costs 
we eliminated positions in the restructuring  of which were manufacturing positions  eight were sales and service positions and one was an administrative position 
the eliminations of positions did not impact our segment operations  processes or products 
the anticipated savings on an annual basis was estimated to be million  consisting primarily of employee salaries 
we began recognizing these savings in the third quarter of fiscal while the anticipated savings related to these positions were achieved  other positions were added as a result of other activities  such as going direct internationally 
we recorded approximately  of realignment charges in the second quarter of fiscal  primarily related to severance costs  approximately of which were allocated to the pss segment and approximately of which were allocated to the surface conditioning segment 
the realignment charges were allocated as follows  to cost of goods sold   to selling  general and administrative expense and  to research and development expense 
fiscal restructuring in fiscal  we implemented cost reduction plans  including two reduction in workforce programs  merit increase delays  executive salary cuts of and a reduction in other discretionary spending costs 
as a result  we recorded million in realignment charges associated with reduction in forces that occurred in march and june of of which approximately were allocated to the pss segment and approximately were allocated to the surface conditioning segment 
the realignment charges were allocated as follows  to cost of goods sold  million to selling  general and administrative expense and  to research and development expense 
the anticipated savings from the realignment were approximately to million on an annual basis  consisting of primarily employee salaries 
we began realizing these savings in the first quarter of fiscal substantially all of these savings were achieved 
sales revenue and shipments in december  the staff of the securities and exchange commission issued staff accounting bulletin sab no 
 revenue recognition in financial statements 
the sec staff addressed several issues in sab  including the timing of revenue recognition for sales that involve contractual customer acceptance provisions and installation of the product if these events occur after shipment and 
table of contents transfer of title 
historically  we generally recognized system revenue when the product was shipped  risk of loss had passed to the customer and collection of the resulting receivable was probable 
under the new accounting method  we changed our method of accounting for system sales to generally recognize revenue once the system s pre determined specifications or acceptance criteria are met 
in the fourth fiscal quarter of  we implemented the provisions of sab  retroactive to the beginning of fiscal this was reported as a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle as of august  this change resulted in a cumulative change in accounting principle of approximately million  net of taxes  or a charge of per share  in fiscal sab may add additional cycle time between order acceptance booking and revenue 
our goal is to minimize the impact of cycle time  but our systems are complex instruments and may require lengthy installation and integration into the fab 
therefore  we expect that sab may result in a slower revenue ramp when bookings are accelerating and a slower revenue decline when bookings are decelerating 
based upon our revenue recognition policy  certain shipments to customers are not recognized until customer acceptance  therefore depending on timing of shipments and customer acceptances  there are time periods where shipments may exceed sales revenue or sales revenue may exceed shipments 
fiscal sales revenues were million as compared to million for fiscal sales revenues for pss decreased to million for fiscal as compared to million in fiscal sales revenues for surface conditioning decreased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal fiscal sales revenues were million as compared to million in fiscal sales revenues for pss decreased from million in fiscal to million in fiscal sales revenues for surface conditioning decreased from million in fiscal to million in fiscal the decreases in sales revenues in fiscal and were due to the industry downturn  competitive pricing pressures  and the global recession 
the decrease in fiscal was also due to the wind down of the microlithography business 
shipments were million in fiscal as compared to million in fiscal and million in fiscal pss shipments increased slightly from million in fiscal to million in fiscal surface conditioning shipments increased from million in fiscal to million in fiscal pss shipments decreased from million in fiscal to million in fiscal surface conditioning shipments decreased from million in fiscal to million in fiscal international sales were million for fiscal  representing of total sales during fiscal  million for fiscal  representing of total sales during fiscal  and million for fiscal  representing of total sales during fiscal international sales through our affiliates  metron technology and m fsi  represented approximately of international sales during fiscal  of our total international sales during fiscal  and of our total international sales during fiscal the decrease in international sales in fiscal as compared to fiscal was due to continued poor industry conditions 
we experienced higher sales as a percent of total sales in europe and japan in fiscal as compared to fiscal the significant decrease in international sales in fiscal was due to the impact of the global economy and poor industry conditions 
domestic sales were not impacted as significantly due to purchases of mm technology by tier one semiconductor companies located in the untied states 
due to its broader customer base  surface conditioning has a higher percentage of international sales than pss 
see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding the company s international sales 
we ended fiscal with a backlog of approximately million  as compared to million at the end of fiscal backlog consists of orders with delivery dates within the next months for which a customer purchase order has been received 
because of the timing and relative size of orders and the possibility of cancellations or customer delays  backlog is not necessarily indicative of sales for future 
table of contents periods 
deferred revenue was approximately million as of the end of fiscal deferred revenue is included in deferred profit which is net of deferred cost of goods sold on the consolidated balance sheet 
as a result of the fiscal year end backlog and deferred revenue levels  we expect first quarter fiscal revenue to be in the range of to million  including to million of revenue from the pss business 
we also expect first quarter orders to increase to from the fourth quarter of fiscal rate of million 
however  one or two million system orders can have a significant impact on the order growth rate given the base 
gross margin our gross margin fluctuates due to a number of factors  including the mix of products sold  as surface conditioning products generally have higher margins than the pss products  the proportion of international sales  as international sales generally have lower margins  competitive pricing pressures and utilization of manufacturing capacity 
gross margin as a percentage of sales was for fiscal as compared to for fiscal the decrease in margins was primarily impacted by inventory reserves of million recorded in the second quarter of the reserve was recorded to cost of goods sold based on estimated future sales and recoverability  specifically related to our decision to wind down the pss business 
we determined the million inventory reserves by comparing the inventory balance of the pss business as of march  to the inventory balance expected to be used for pss orders in backlog  anticipated orders and anticipated order cancellations and adjusted the net inventory balance to its net realizable value 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal  we reduced the inventory reserve by million 
this was primarily due to sales revenues generated from unanticipated spare parts and upgrades sales where the related inventory was previously written down to zero value 
in addition  we were able to reduce certain open purchase order commitments and inventory buyback requirements 
our gross margin as a percentage of sales in fiscal would have been  excluding the net inventory reserves recorded for the pss business 
gross margin before the net pss inventory reserves is not calculated in accordance with generally accepted accounting principals gaap 
our management believes that the presentation of gross margin before the net pss inventory reserves provides a useful analysis of our ongoing operating trends and helps investors compare our operating performance period over period 
the following is a reconciliation of our fiscal gross margin calculated in accordance with gaap to our fiscal gross margin before the net pss inventory reserves in thousands fiscal year fiscal year of ended of ended gaap sales adjustment non gaap sales august  august  sales cost of goods sold gross margin net pss inventory reserves 
we will continue to try to sell the impaired inventory to our customers as spares  refurbished systems and upgrades to existing systems 
if unsuccessful  some of the items will be disposed of 
only as items are sold or disposed of will the reserve be reversed or reduced 
any reversal or reduction will be disclosed 
gross margins will be higher if inventory carried at a reduced cost is sold 
margins in fiscal were also impacted by  of severance costs that were recorded to cost of goods sold in the third and fourth quarters of fiscal the margins for fiscal were impacted by  of realignment charges that were recorded to cost of goods sold in the second quarter of fiscal 
table of contents gross profit as a percentage of sales was for fiscal and for fiscal the decrease in margins was primarily related to lower manufacturing capacity utilization 
also during the year we increased our inventory obsolescence reserve by approximately million to account for the transition to the next generation products 
the increase in inventory reserves  net for fiscal as compared to was million 
the increase in inventory reserves  net for fiscal as compared to was million 
we expect the gross profit margins for the first quarter of fiscal to range from to of revenues 
this is lower than the fourth quarter of fiscal gross profit margin of due to the lower mix of higher margin surface conditioning products and continued under utilization of our manufacturing capacity  partially offset by anticipated use of pss inventory 
selling  general and administrative expenses selling  general and administrative expenses in fiscal were million  or of total sales  as compared to million  or of total sales  in fiscal and million  or of total sales  in fiscal the decrease in the dollar amount of selling  general and administrative expense in fiscal reflected the impact of our cost control efforts 
the decrease was partially offset by our infrastructure investment in going direct in europe and the asia pacific region  the related addition of sales and service personnel in these regions and the severance costs associated with the wind down of the microlithography division 
the decrease in selling  general and administrative expense in fiscal reflected the cost reduction actions implemented during the second half of fiscal  lower incentive compensation payments that resulted from lower orders and operating return on revenue 
the decrease also reflected a million reduction in amortization expense in fiscal the reduction in amortization expense was related to the implementation of sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
the decrease was offset by a litigation reserve for attorneys fees and other appeal costs in fiscal of approximately million 
selling  general and administrative expenses included realignment charges of million in fiscal  million in fiscal and million in fiscal selling  general and administrative expenses for the first quarter of fiscal are expected to be in the range of million to million 
impairment of goodwill due to a significant decline in our stock price in the fourth quarter of fiscal  the continued downturn in the industry and the overall global economic conditions  we completed an impairment review of goodwill as of august  as a result  the balance of goodwill was deemed other than temporarily impaired and we recorded an impairment charge of million in the fourth quarter of fiscal transition agreement termination fee in the first quarter of fiscal  we recorded a charge of approximately million associated with the early termination of the distribution agreements with metron technology 
write down of property  plant and equipment in the second quarter of fiscal  we conducted a review of the long lived assets of the pss business and the recorded a write down of million against the property  plant and equipment assets of the pss business to write the assets down to their estimated fair value 
this write down included a million impairment charge for the pss business facility and a million impairment charge related to the pss business equipment 
these impairment charges were based upon our review of the pss business equipment and their estimated fair values 

table of contents research and development expenses research and development expenses for fiscal were million  or of total sales  as compared to million  or of total sales  for fiscal and million  or of sales  for fiscal the decrease in the dollar amount of research and development expenses in fiscal as compared to fiscal was related to the wind down of the microlithography business and the cost control efforts in the surface conditioning area 
the decrease in fiscal as compared to fiscal was related to timing of expenses associated with key product development programs and cost reduction actions 
a significant portion of our research and development investment in was directed at reducing product costs  the magellan product development initiative  improving product reliability and expanding the application capabilities of a number of our products 
we expect research and development expenses to range from to million for the first quarter of fiscal other income expense  net other income expense  net was approximately million of expense  or of total sales  for fiscal as compared to million of income  or of total sales  for fiscal and million of income  or of total sales  for fiscal the change for fiscal as compared to fiscal related primarily to an approximately million non cash impairment charge in the first quarter of fiscal for the shares of metron technology that we owned 
the impairment charges were based upon the difference between our per share carrying value and the per share value agreed upon for purposes of the transition agreement 
the per share value reflected the average closing price of the common stock of metron technology for the five business days prior to the execution of the transition agreement 
the decrease in amounts for fiscal as compared to fiscal related to a decline in interest rates  partially offset by higher average cash and marketable securities balances in fiscal than in fiscal interest income is expected to be approximately  to  for the first quarter of fiscal  given our current level of cash reserves and the anticipated interest rates 
interest expense is expected to be minimal for us in fiscal year during the first quarter of fiscal  we have sold a portion of our metron technology stock 
as a result  we expect to record gains from the sales of marketable securities of to million in the first quarter of fiscal income tax benefit expense we recorded a tax expense of  for fiscal  primarily as a result of state franchise taxes 
we recorded a tax benefit of  for fiscal this benefit was primarily a result of a refund that became available due to a tax law revision enacted in the third quarter of fiscal we filed the appropriate federal tax returns and received a cash refund of approximately  during the fourth quarter of fiscal we recorded tax expense of  for fiscal the tax expense in fiscal related to state tax expense in states that do not allow loss carrybacks and tax expense related to the utilization of yieldup net operating losses and a corresponding reduction in goodwill 
our deferred tax assets on the balance sheet as of august  have been fully reserved for with a valuation allowance 
we do not expect to reduce our valuation allowance until we are consistently profitable on a quarterly basis 

table of contents overall  we have net operating loss carryforwards for federal income tax purposes of approximately  at august   which will begin to expire in fiscal through fiscal if not utilized 
of this amount  approximately  is subject to internal revenue code section limitations on utilization 
this limitation is approximately  per year 
equity in earnings losses of affiliates equity in earnings losses of affiliates was approximately million of losses for fiscal   of losses for fiscal  and million of income for fiscal the change from fiscal to fiscal reflected the impact that deteriorating industry conditions had on metron technology 
in fiscal  metron technology wrote off a significant amount of its goodwill and incurred additional expenses in connection with the transition of its fsi product distribution business to fsi 
the losses from metron technology were partially offset by a positive contribution from m fsi 
the loss in fiscal was also due to the impact that deteriorating industry conditions had on metron technology and m fsi 
the income in fiscal was due to profitable operations at both affiliates 
we will no longer record equity in losses from metron technology  since our ownership is now below percent 
we anticipate that equity in earnings from m fsi  our japanese affiliate  will range from  to  in the first quarter of fiscal net income loss based upon achieving anticipated revenue  gross margin and operating expense levels  we expect to record a net loss of to million in the first quarter of fiscal  excluding gains on sales of marketable securities 
liquidity and capital resources our cash  restricted cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities were approximately million as of august   a decrease of million from the end of fiscal the decrease in cash  restricted cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities was due primarily to funds used for operations of million  offset by the reclassification and change in accounting for our investment in metron technology 
historically  we accounted for our investment in metron technology under the equity method of accounting 
as a result of decreased ownership in metron technology  we now account for our investment as a marketable security available for sale 
the fair market value of metron technology as of august  was million 
we also had proceeds from stock option exercises and employee stock purchase plan issuances of million 
we purchased million of property  plant and equipment in fiscal accounts receivable decreased million from the end of fiscal trade accounts receivable from non affiliates increased million from the end of fiscal trade accounts receivable from affiliates decreased million from the end of fiscal the increase in trade accounts receivable from non affiliates and the decrease in trade accounts receivable from affiliates related to our transition from utilizing metron technology as a distributor to going direct in europe and the asia pacific region 
the overall decrease in trade accounts receivable related to lower shipments of million in the fourth quarter of fiscal as compared to million in the fourth quarter of fiscal the balance in trade accounts receivable from affiliates as of august  represented approximately of the fiscal sales to affiliates 
the balance in trade accounts receivable from affiliates as of august  represented approximately of the fiscal sales to affiliates 
the balance was a result of approximately of the fiscal shipments to affiliates occurring in the fourth quarter of fiscal the timing of shipments to affiliates is impacted by our affiliates receipt of customer purchase orders  our production lead times and the ultimate ship dates 
inventory decreased approximately million to million at the end of fiscal  as compared to million at the end of fiscal the decrease in inventory was due primarily to the 
table of contents million net  of non cash inventory reserves recorded in fiscal based on the estimated future sales and recoverability  specifically related to our decision to wind down the pss business 
inventory reserves were million at the end of fiscal  of which of the reserves related to surface conditioning and related to pss 
this compares to reserves of million at the end of fiscal  of which related to surface conditioning and related to pss 
as of august   our current ratio was to  and working capital was million 
our contractual cash obligations related to operating leases at august  are summarized as follows in thousands fiscal fiscal fiscal fiscal fiscal thereafter total as previously discussed  we have outstanding litigation regarding the hsu matter 
the total judgment against ssi together with post judgment interest as of august  aggregated approximately million 
ssi and the individual defendants have filed an appeal on a variety of grounds 
in the third quarter of fiscal  we posted an appeal bond on behalf of ssi and defendants in the amount of million 
as part of the posting of the bond  we entered into a letter of credit in the amount of million with the surety company 
this letter of credit is collateralized with restricted cash of approximately the same amount 
during fiscal  we entered into guarantees of  related to auto leases and payroll requirements in europe 
these guarantees were collateralized with  of restricted cash 
the total balance of restricted cash as of august  was million 
in november  we entered into  of additional guarantees related to auto leases in europe which were collateralized with  of restricted cash 
additionally  in november  due to concerns related to our fiscal losses  the bonding company required us to increase the letter of credit to million and to increase the collateral to a similar level 
in accordance with our israel distribution agreement with metron technology  if we give notice of a termination other than because of a breach of the agreement by metron technology  we are obligated to repurchase spare parts in metron technology s inventory 
the balance of spare parts in metron technology s inventory as of august  was approximately acquisitions of property  plant and equipment were million in fiscal  million in fiscal  and million in fiscal we expect capital expenditures to be between  and million in fiscal depreciation and amortization for fiscal is expected to be between approximately and million 
at the first quarter expected run rate  we anticipate using less than million of cash for operations in the first quarter of fiscal  depending on the timing of accounts receivable collections 
we believe that with existing cash  cash receipts  cash equivalents  marketable securities and internally generated funds  there will be sufficient funds to meet our currently projected working capital requirements  and to meet other cash requirements through at least fiscal we believe that success in our industry requires substantial capital to maintain the flexibility to take advantage of opportunities as they arise 
one of our strategic objectives is  as market and business conditions warrant  to consider divestitures  investments or acquisitions of businesses  products or technologies particularly those that are complementary to our surface conditioning business 
we may fund such activities with additional equity or debt financing 
the sale of additional equity or debt securities  whether to maintain flexibility or to meet strategic objectives  could result in additional dilution to our shareholders 

table of contents off balance sheet arrangements we do not have any off balance sheet arrangements 
new accounting pronouncements in december  the emerging issues task force issued eitf  revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables 
this issue addresses certain aspects of the accounting by a vendor for arrangements under which it will perform multiple revenue generating activities 
in some arrangements  the different revenue generating activities deliverables are sufficiently separable  and there exists sufficient evidence of their fair values to separately account for some or all of the deliverables that is  there are separate units of accounting 
in other arrangements  some or all of the deliverables are not independently functional  or there is not sufficient evidence of their fair values to account for them separately 
this issue addresses when and  if so  how an arrangement involving multiple deliverables should be divided into separate units of accounting 
this issue does not change otherwise applicable revenue recognition criteria 
this issue is applicable to us for revenue arrangements entered into beginning in the first quarter of fiscal we do not expect the adoption of eitf to have an effect on our consolidated financial statements 
risk factors our business faces significant risks 
the risks described below are not the only risks we face 
additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently believe are immaterial also may impair our business operations 
if any of the events or circumstances described in the following risks occurs  our business  operating results or financial condition could be materially adversely affected 
the following risk factors should be read in conjunction with the other information and risks set forth in this report 
because our business depends on the amount that manufacturers of microelectronics spend on capital equipment  downturns in the microelectronics industry may adversely affect our results 
the microelectronics industry experiences periodic downturns  which may have a negative effect on our sales and operating results 
our business depends on the amounts that manufacturers of microelectronics spend on capital equipment 
the amounts they spend on capital equipment depend on the existing and expected demand for semiconductor devices and products that use semiconductor devices 
the microelectronics industry has experienced downturns in business activity in the past  and the industry currently is experiencing a significant downturn 
when a downturn occurs  some semiconductor manufacturers experience lower demand and increased pricing pressure for their products 
as a result  they are likely to purchase less semiconductor processing equipment and have sometimes delayed making decisions to purchase capital equipment 
in some cases  semiconductor manufacturers have canceled or delayed orders for our products 
typically  the semiconductor equipment industry has experienced more pronounced decreases in net sales than the semiconductor industry as a whole 
we  along with others in the industry  have recently experienced a significant downturn in orders for new equipment as well as delays in or cancellations of existing orders 
we cannot predict the extent and length of the current downturn 
in addition the semiconductor industry may experience other  possibly more severe and prolonged  downturns in the future  any future recovery of the semiconductor industry may not result in an increased demand by semiconductor manufacturers for capital equipment or our products  and the semiconductor industry may not improve in the near future or at all 

table of contents our inability to implement additional cost reduction and restructuring actions could adversely affect our cash flows and results of operations 
as a result of the wind down of the microlithography business  we will be operating as a smaller company with a decrease in revenues 
we may lose some of our competitive advantages  including economies of scales  and may incur higher procurement costs 
furthermore  as a smaller company  we may face competitive disadvantages in obtaining future orders due to industry consolidation and customer s increasing reliance on large manufacturers capable of supporting multiple customer needs 
we will be relying on revenues generated by one division to cover our operating expenses  corporate overhead  existing facility charges and other fixed costs 
because of the decrease in revenues  we will need to reduce expenses and cash usage 
in the third quarter of fiscal  we implemented additional cost reduction and restructuring programs  including a reduction in headcount and other fixed costs 
it is our goal to restructure the company to a level in which we expect to be cash flow neutral at million to million in quarterly revenues 
there can be no assurance that we will be successful in achieving our restructuring goals 
our inability to implement cost reduction or restructuring actions may adversely affect our cash flows and results of operations 
the wind down of the microlithography business could adversely affect our order prospects for the surface conditioning business 
we continue to focus on winding down the microlithography business 
our primary goals are to satisfy our remaining microlithography customer obligations and support requirements and to obtain surface conditioning order prospects from these customers 
we have met with all of our microlithography business customers to review open orders and develop longer term service and spare parts logistics plans 
implementation of these service and spare parts logistics plans may cost more than we expected 
if we are unable to satisfy our remaining microlithography customer obligations  our future order and sales levels for our surface conditioning business may be adversely affected 
if we do not continue to develop new products  we will not be able to compete effectively 
our business and results of operations could decline if we do not develop and successfully introduce new or improved products that the market accepts 
the technology used in microelectronics manufacturing equipment and processes changes rapidly 
industry standards change constantly and equipment manufacturers frequently introduce new products 
we believe that microelectronics manufacturers increasingly rely on equipment manufacturers like us to design and develop more efficient manufacturing equipment  design and implement improved processes for microelectronics manufacturers to use  and make their equipment compatible with equipment made by other equipment manufacturers 
to compete  we must continue to develop  manufacture  and market new or improved products that meet changing industry standards 
to do this successfully  we must select appropriate products  design and develop our products efficiently and quickly  implement our manufacturing and assembly processes efficiently and on time  make products that perform well for our customers  market and sell our products effectively  and introduce our new products in a way that does not unexpectedly reduce sales of our existing products 

table of contents failure of our products to gain market acceptance would adversely affect our financial condition 
we believe that our growth prospects depend upon our ability to gain customer acceptance of our products and technology  particularly mm products 
market acceptance of products depends upon numerous factors  including compatibility with existing manufacturing processes and products  ability to displace incumbent suppliers or processes or tools of record  perceived advantages over competing products  and the level of customer service available to support such products 
moreover  manufacturers often rely on a limited number of equipment vendors to meet their manufacturing equipment needs 
as a result  market acceptance of our products may be affected adversely to the extent potential customers utilize a competitor s manufacturing equipment 
there can be no assurance that sales of new products will remain constant or grow or that we will be successful in obtaining broad market acceptance of our systems and technology 
we expect to spend a significant amount of time and resources to develop new systems and enhance existing systems 
in light of the long product development cycles inherent in our industry  we will make these expenditures well in advance of the prospect of deriving revenue from the sale of any new systems 
our ability to commercially introduce and successfully market any new systems is subject to a wide variety of challenges during this development cycle  including start up bugs  design defects and other matters that could delay introduction of these systems to the marketplace 
in addition  since our customers are not obligated by long term contracts to purchase our systems  our anticipated product orders may not materialize or orders that do materialize may be canceled 
as a result  if we do not achieve market acceptance of new products  we may not be able to realize sufficient sales of our systems in order to recoup research and development expenditures 
the failure of any of our new products  for example the magellan  to achieve market acceptance would harm our business  financial condition  and results of operations and cash flows 
product or process development problems could harm our results of operations 
our products are complex  and from time to time have defects or bugs that are difficult and costly to fix 
this can harm our results of operations in the following ways we may incur substantial costs to ensure the functionality and reliability of products early in their life cycle  repeated defects or bugs can reduce orders  increase manufacturing costs  adversely impact working capital and increase service and warranty expenses  and we may require significant lead times between product introduction and commercialization 
as a result  we may have to write off inventory and other assets related to products and could lose customers and revenue 
there is no assurance that we will be successful in preventing product and process development problems that could potentially harm our results of operations 
future acquisitions may dilute our shareholders ownership interests and have other adverse consequences 
because of consolidations in the semiconductor equipment industry we serve and other competitive factors  our management will seek to acquire additional product lines  technologies  and businesses if suitable opportunities develop 
acquisitions may result in the issuance of our stock  which may dilute our shareholders ownership interests and reduce earnings per share 
acquisitions also may increase debt levels 
table of contents and the related goodwill and other intangible assets  which could have a significant negative effect on our financial condition and operating results 
in addition  acquisitions involve numerous risks  including difficulties in absorbing the new business  product line  or technology  diversion of management s attention from other business concerns  entering new markets in which we have little or no experience  and possible loss of key employees of the acquired business 
because of the volatility of our stock price  the ability to trade fsi shares may be adversely affected and our ability to raise capital through future equity financing may be reduced 
our stock price has been volatile in the past and may continue to be so in the future 
in the fiscal year  for example  our stock price ranged from to per share 
the trading price of our common shares is subject to wide fluctuations in response to various factors  some of which are beyond our control  including factors discussed elsewhere in this report and the following failure to meet the published expectations of securities analysts for a given period  changes in financial estimates by securities analysts  press releases or announcements by  or changes in market values of  comparable companies  additions or departures of key personnel  and involvement in or adverse results from litigation 
the prices of technology stocks  including ours  have been particularly affected by extreme fluctuations in price and volume in the stock market generally 
these broad stock market fluctuations may have a negative effect on our future stock price 
in the past  securities class action litigation has often been brought against a company following periods of volatility in the market price of its securities 
in the future we could be the target of this type of litigation 
securities litigation may result in substantial costs and divert management s attention and resources  which can seriously harm our business 
because our quarterly operating results are volatile  our stock price could decrease 
in the past  our operating results have fluctuated from quarter to quarter and are likely to do so in the future 
these fluctuations may have a significant impact on our stock price 
the reasons for the fluctuations in our operating results  such as sales  gross profits  and net income  include the timing of significant customer orders and customer spending patterns 
during industry downturns  our customers may ask us to delay or even cancel the shipment of equipment orders 
delays and cancellations may adversely affect our operating results in any particular quarter if we are unable to recognize revenue for particular sales in the quarter in which we expected those sales 
the timing of new product and service announcements by us or our competitors 
new product announcements by us and our competitors could cause our customers to delay a purchase or to decide to purchase products of one of our competitors which would adversely affect our revenue and  therefore  our results of operations 
new product announcements by others may make it necessary for us to reduce prices on our products or offer more service options  which could adversely impact operating margins and net income 
the mix of products sold and the market acceptance of our new product lines 
the mix of products we sell varies from period to period  and because margins vary among or within different product lines  this can adversely affect our results of operations 
if we fail to sell our products which 
table of contents generate higher margins  our average gross margins may be lower than expected 
if we fail to sell our new product lines  our revenue may be lower than expected 
general global economic conditions or economic conditions in a particular region 
when economic conditions in a region or worldwide worsen  customers may delay or cancel their orders 
there also may be an increase in the time it takes to collect payment from our customers or even outright payment defaults 
this can negatively affect our cash flow and our results 
as a result of these factors  our future operating results are difficult to predict 
further  we base our current and future expense plans in significant part on our expectations of our longer term future revenue 
as a result  we expect our expense levels to be relatively fixed in the short run 
an unanticipated decline in revenue for a particular quarter may disproportionately affect our net income in that quarter 
if our revenue is below our projections  then our operating results will also be below expectations 
any one of the factors we list above  or a combination of them  could adversely affect our quarterly results of operations  and consequently may cause a decline in our share price 
because of our ownership position in m fsi  ltd  adverse results of m fsi could adversely affect our results 
the profits or losses of our affiliate  m fsi ltd  can also significantly affect our financial results 
as of august   we had a interest in m fsi 
if this affiliate loses the business of a significant company for which it distributes or sells products  loses a significant customer  or otherwise became less financially viable  it could have a negative effect on our financial condition 
the transition of our european and asia pacific sales and service from our distributor  metron technology  to a direct model may result in additional costs and risks 
sales through metron technology for fiscal were million  or of our total fiscal sales  and for fiscal were million  or of our total fiscal sales 
on october   we entered into a transition agreement with metron technology related to the early termination of our distribution agreements with metron technology for europe and the asia pacific region effective march  under the terms of the transition agreement  we assumed direct sales  service and applications support and logistics responsibilities for our surface conditioning and microlithography products in europe and the asia pacific region as of march   while metron technology will continue to represent our products in israel 
on march   we offered employment to approximately metron technology employees who are dedicated to sales  technical service and applications engineering activities related to the distribution of our products in europe and the asia pacific region 
our success in selling our products direct in these regions will be dependent upon hiring and retaining key support employees  implementing targeted marketing plans and developing direct relationships with our international customers key procurement personnel 
due to rapid changes in our industry  it is difficult to estimate the potential impact on the revenues  operating results and cash flow from the change in our business model resulting from the metron technology termination and the implementation of our direct international sales and service activities 
however  we anticipate our international revenues will be higher than under the prior business model 
we sold our products to metron technology at a discount 
metron technology would then sell our products to the end users at higher prices 
as part of the transition agreement  we paid lower commissions to metron technology on any orders that were in backlog as of march  the goals of our new business model are to improve customer satisfaction  increase marketshare by having a direct presence internationally and improve profitability 
one of the initial goals of our business model is to capture the additional revenues related to the mark up previously taken by metron technology to cover our operating costs 
depending on the product mix  the expected increase in international revenues can vary significantly  along with operating results 
we expect our cash outflows to increase initially due to our investment in infrastructure and also due to international customers having longer 
table of contents payment terms than metron technology 
we expect the additional costs for salary and benefits for the international employees to be at approximately million per quarter in fiscal the success of our transition to a primarily direct sales model in europe and the asia pacific region may be adversely impacted if we fail to have the appropriate systems and processes to continue to support the customers in these regions 
changes in demand caused by fluctuations in interest and currency exchange rates may reduce our international sales 
almost all of our direct international sales are denominated in us dollars 
nonetheless  changes in demand caused by fluctuations in interest and currency exchange rates may affect our international sales 
historically  most of our international sales  however  were through our affiliated distributors 
metron technology s sales of our products and other companies products are denominated primarily in us dollars  but metron technology s expenses are generally denominated in foreign currencies 
accordingly  fluctuations in interest and currency exchange rates may affect metron technology s financial results 
sales for m fsi are denominated in yen 
as a result  us dollar yen exchange rates may affect our equity interest in m fsi s earnings 
metron technology and m fsi sometimes engage in so called hedging or risk reducing transactions to try to limit the negative effects that the devaluation of foreign currencies relative to the us dollar could have on operating results 
they will do so if a sale denominated in a foreign currency is sufficiently large to justify the costs of hedging 
to hedge a sale  metron technology or m fsi typically will commit to buy us dollars and sell the foreign currency at a given price at a future date 
if the customer cancels the sale  metron technology or m fsi may be forced to buy us dollars and sell the foreign currency at market rates to meet its hedging obligations and may incur a loss in doing so 
to date  the hedging activities of metron technology and m fsi have not had any significant negative effect on us 
because we assumed direct sales  service and applications support and logistics responsibilities for our products in europe and the asia pacific region starting in march  we incur labor  service and other expenses in foreign currencies 
as of august   we had not entered into any hedging activities and our foreign currency transaction loss for fiscal was insignificant 
we intend to evaluate various hedging activities and other options to minimize fluctuations in interest and currency exchange rates 
there is no assurance that we will be successful in minimizing foreign exchange rate risks and such failure may reduce our international sales or negatively impact our operating results 
because of the need to meet and comply with numerous foreign regulations and policies  the potential for change in the political and economic environments in foreign jurisdictions and the difficulty of managing business overseas  we may not be able to sustain our historical level of international sales 
we operate in a global market 
in fiscal  approximately of our sales revenue derived from sales outside the united states 
in fiscal  approximately of our sales revenue derived from sales outside the united states 
in fiscal  approximately of our sales revenue derived from sales outside the united states 
these figures include sales through metron technology and m fsi  which accounted for of international sales in fiscal  of international sales in fiscal  and of international sales in fiscal we expect that international sales will continue to represent a significant portion of total sales 
sales to customers outside the united states involve a number of risks  including the following imposition of government controls  compliance with us export laws and foreign laws  political and economic instability  trade restrictions  changes in taxes and tariffs  
table of contents longer payment cycles  difficulty of administering business overseas  and general economic conditions 
in particular  the japanese and asia pacific markets are extremely competitive 
the semiconductor device manufacturers located there are very aggressive in seeking price concessions from suppliers  including equipment manufacturers like us 
in fiscal  approximately of our international sales were attributable to these markets 
we seek to meet technical standards imposed by foreign regulatory bodies 
however  we cannot guarantee that we will be able to comply with those standards in the future 
any failure by us to design products to comply with foreign standards could have a significant negative impact on us 
because of the significant financial resources needed to offer a broad range of products  to maintain customer service and support and to invest in research and development  we may be unable to compete with larger  better established competitors 
the microelectronics equipment industry is highly competitive 
we face substantial competition throughout the world 
we believe that to remain competitive  we will need significant financial resources to offer a broad range of products  to maintain customer service and support  and to invest in research and development 
we believe that the microelectronics industry is becoming increasingly dominated by large manufacturers who have the resources to support customers on a worldwide basis 
some of our competitors have substantially greater financial  marketing  and customer support capabilities than us 
large equipment manufacturers have or may enter the market areas in which we compete 
in addition  smaller  emerging microelectronics equipment companies provide innovative technology 
we expect that our competitors will continue to improve the design and performance of their existing products and processes 
we also expect them to introduce new products and processes with better performance and pricing 
we cannot guarantee that we will continue to compete effectively in the united states or elsewhere 
we may be unable to continue to invest in marketing  research and development and engineering at the levels we believe necessary to maintain our competitive position 
our failure to make these investments could have a significant negative impact on our business  operating results and financial condition 
because we do not have long term sales commitments with our customers  if these customers decide to reduce  delay or cancel orders or choose to deal with our competitors  then our results will be adversely affected 
if our significant customers  including ibm  texas instruments  stmicroelectronics or philips semiconductor  reduce  delay  or cancel orders  then our operating results could suffer 
our largest customers have changed from year to year  however  sales to our top five customers accounted for approximately of total sales in fiscal  of total revenues in fiscal and of total revenues in fiscal texas instruments accounted for of total sales in fiscal  of total revenues in fiscal and of total revenues in fiscal ibm accounted for approximately of total sales in fiscal and of total revenues in fiscal philips semiconductor accounted for approximately of our total revenues in fiscal we currently have no long term sales commitments with any of our customers 
instead  we generally make sales under purchase orders 
our backlog at august  was million  of which was comprised of orders from two customers 
all orders are subject to cancellation or delay by the customer 
our backlog may not result in future net sales 
we schedule the production of our systems based in part upon order backlog 
due to possible customer changes in delivery schedules and cancellations of orders  our backlog at any particular date is not necessarily indicative of actual sales for any succeeding period 
in addition  while we evaluate each customer order on a case by case basis to determine qualification for inclusion in backlog  there can be no assurance that amounts included in backlog ultimately will result in future sales 
a reduction in backlog 
table of contents during any particular period  or the failure of our backlog to result in future sales  could harm our business 
it may be difficult for us to compete with stronger competitors resulting from industry consolidation 
in the past several years  we have seen a trend toward consolidation in the microelectronics equipment industry 
we expect the trend toward consolidation to continue as companies seek to strengthen or maintain their market positions in a rapidly changing industry 
we believe that industry consolidations may result in competitors that are better able to compete 
this could have a significant negative impact on our business  operating results  and financial condition 
because we depend upon our management and technical personnel for our success  the loss of key personnel could place us at a competitive disadvantage 
our success depends to a significant extent upon our management and technical personnel 
the loss of a number of these key persons could have a negative effect on our operations 
competition is high for such personnel in our industry in all of our locations 
we periodically review our compensation and benefit packages to ensure that they are competitive in the marketplace and make adjustments or implement new programs for that purpose  as appropriate 
we cannot guarantee that we will continue to attract and retain the personnel we require to continue to grow and operate profitably 
our employment costs in the short term are to a large extent fixed  and therefore any unexpected revenue shortfall could adversely affect our operating results 
our operating expense levels are based in significant part on our headcount  which generally is driven by longer term revenue goals 
for a variety of reasons  particularly the high cost and disruption of lay offs and the costs of recruiting and training  our headcount in the short term is  to a large extent  fixed 
accordingly  we may be unable to reduce employment costs in a timely manner to compensate for any unexpected revenue or gross margin shortfall  which could have a material adverse effect on our operating results 
because our intellectual property is important to our success  the loss or diminution of our intellectual property rights through legal challenge by others or from independent development by others  could adversely affect our business 
we attempt to protect our intellectual property rights through patents  copyrights  trade secrets  and other measures 
however  we believe that our financial performance will depend more upon the innovation  technological expertise  and marketing abilities of our employees than on such protection 
in connection with our intellectual property rights  we face the following risks our pending patent applications may not be issued or may be issued with more narrow claims  patents issued to us may be challenged  invalidated  or circumvented  rights granted under issued patents may not provide competitive advantages to us  foreign laws may not protect our intellectual property rights  and others may independently develop similar products  duplicate our products  or design around our patents 
as is typical in the semiconductor industry  we occasionally receive notices from others alleging infringement claims 
we have been involved in patent infringement litigation in the past and one of our subsidiaries  scd mountain view  inc  is currently involved in such litigation 
we could become involved in similar lawsuits or other patent infringement claims in the future 
we cannot guarantee the outcome of such lawsuits or claims  which may have a significant negative effect on our business or operating results 
we are currently exposed to various risks related to legal proceedings or claims 
we currently are  and in the future  may be  involved in legal proceedings or claims regarding patent infringement  intellectual property rights  contracts and other matters 
these legal proceedings and claims  
table of contents whether with or without merit  could be time consuming and expensive to prosecute or defend  and could divert management s attention and resources 
there can be no assurance regarding the outcome of current or future legal proceedings or claims 
if we are not able to resolve a claim  negotiate a settlement of the matter  obtain necessary licenses on commercially reasonable terms and or successfully prosecute or defend its position  our business  financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected 
our sales cycle is long and unpredictable  which could require us to incur high sales and marketing expenses with no assurance that a sale will result 
sales cycles for some of our products can run as long as to months 
as a result  we may not recognize revenue from efforts to sell particular products for extended periods of time 
we believe that the length of the sales cycle may increase as some current and potential customers centralize purchasing decisions into one decision making entity 
we expect this may intensify the evaluation process and require us to make additional sales and marketing expenditures with no assurance that a sale will result 
changes to financial accounting standards may affect our reported results of operations 
we prepare our financial statements to conform with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america gaap 
the gaap are subject to interpretation by the american institute of certified public accountants  the securities and exchange commission  the financial accounting standards board and various bodies formed to interpret and create appropriate accounting policies 
a change in those policies can have a significant effect on our reported results and may even affect our reporting of transactions completed before a change is announced 
accounting policies affecting many other aspects of our business  including rules relating to purchase accounting for business combinations  revenue recognition  in process research and development charges  employee stock purchase plans and stock option grants  have recently been revised or are under review 
changes to those rules or the questioning of our current accounting practices may have a material adverse effect on our reported financial results or on the way we conduct business 
in addition  our preparation of financial statements in accordance with gaap requires that we make estimates and assumptions that affect the recorded amounts of assets and liabilities  disclosure of those assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statement and the recorded amounts of expenses during the reporting period 
a change in the facts and circumstances surrounding those estimates could result in a change to our estimates and could impact its future operating results 
we do not intend to pay dividends 
we have never declared or paid any cash dividends on our common stock 
we currently intend to retain any future earnings for funding growth and  therefore  do not expect to pay any dividends in the foreseeable future 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our cash flows and earnings are subject to fluctuations in foreign exchange rates due to investments in foreign based affiliates 
as of august  our investments in affiliates include a interest in metron technology and a interest in m fsi ltd 
metron technology operates mainly in europe  asia pacific and the united states 
m fsi ltd 
operates in japan 
approximately of fiscal sales to affiliates were to metron technology 
we denominate all us export sales in us dollars 
our investment in metron technology is currently accounted for as marketable securities and is subject to market fluctuations related to the stock price 
during fiscal  metron technology s stock price ranged from to 
because we assumed direct sales  service and applications support and logistics responsibilities for our products in europe and the asia pacific region starting in march  we have and will continue to incur labor  service and other expenses in foreign currencies 
as a result  we may be exposed to fluctuations in foreign exchange rate risks 
as of august   we had not entered into any hedging activities and 
table of contents our foreign currency transaction loss for fiscal was insignificant 
we are currently evaluating various hedging activities and other options to minimize these risks 
we do not have significant exposure to changing interest rates as all material outstanding debt was repaid on september  as of year end  amortized cost approximates market value for all outstanding marketable securities 
we do not undertake any specific actions to cover our exposure to interest rate risk and we are not party to any interest rate risk management transactions 
the impact on loss before income taxes of a change in short term interest rates would be approximately  based on cash  restricted cash  cash equivalents and marketable security balances as of august
