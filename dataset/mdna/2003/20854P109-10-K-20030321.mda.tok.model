item management s discussion and analysis of results of operations and financial condition general consol energy incurred a loss before income tax of million and realized income tax benefits of million  resulting in net income for consol energy s net income was million for the twelve month period ended december  this was a decline from the net income of million for the twelve month period ended december  total coal sales for the twelve months ended december  were million tons  including our portion of sales by equity affiliates  of which million tons were produced by consol energy operations  by our equity affiliates or sold from inventory of company produced coal  including coal sold from inventories and produced by equity affiliates 
this compares with total coal sales of million tons for the twelve months ended december   of which million tons were produced by consol energy operations or sold from inventory of company produced coal including coal sold from inventories and produced by equity affiliates 
demand for coal was weak due to the continued sluggish united states economy and the lingering effect of higher than normal customer inventory levels 
the decrease in tons sold was also due to the deferral of shipments by our customers during the year to later periods and reduced volumes from requirements contracts 
production from consol energy operations  including our percentage of the production from equity affiliates  was million tons during the twelve months ended december  and million tons for the twelve months ended december  lower production levels were the result of the announced plan to reduce production by seven to eight million tons from planned output for in order to match anticipated demand 
the following mines were idled during the period to implement reduction mine date idled date production resumed mcelroy may  august  blacksville june  july  robinson run june  july  mine june  july  mahoning valley june  november  humphrey june  august  vp june  july  shoemaker june  august  rend lake july  anticipated to remain idle until market conditions support reopening 
table of contents in addition  the humphrey  meigs  windsor  muskingum and dilworth mines closed permanently in the year ended december  the loveridge mine was idled on may  and development work began in the fourth quarter sales of coalbed methane gas  including our share of the sales from equity affiliates  increased to billion cubic feet in the period from billion cubic feet in the period 
the increased sales volume is primarily due to higher production and sales volumes as a result of the purchase of the remaining interest in the pocahontas gas partnership on august  our average sales price for coalbed methane gas  including our portion of sales from equity affiliates  was per million british thermal units in the period compared with per million british thermal units in the period 
the decrease in average sales price was primarily due to reduced demand for gas in the industrial sector and lower demand for gas during the winter heating season that resulted in higher levels of gas in storage in the beginning of the period compared to the period 
approximately of our anticipated production of billion cubic feet has been sold at a price of per million british thermal unit 
in march  our joint venture with allegheny energy supply company  llc  an affiliate of one of our largest coal customers  completed an megawatt  gas fired electricity generating facility which was placed into commercial service on june  the facility has operated for  megawatt hours and did not have a significant effect on earnings in the period

the decrease of million was primarily due to reduced depreciation and depletion expense as a result of the scheduled closing of the powhatan mine due to economically depleted reserves 
depletion and amortization expense was also reduced due to lower production tons in the period and items becoming fully amortized in the period 
these decreases were offset  in part  by increased depreciation expense related to assets placed in service after the period and additional depreciation expense on assets received in the acquisition of buchanan production company and mcnic oakwood gathering inc interest expense increased to million for the period compared to million for the period 
the increase of million was due primarily to higher average debt levels outstanding during the period compared to the period  along with an increase of in average interest rates 
higher debt levels resulted from the issuance of commercial paper to finance the purchase of buchanan production company  mcnic oakwood gathering inc and a mcn subsidiary that owns a interest in cardinal states gathering company in february  and the purchase of a joint venture interest in line creek mine on december  taxes other than income decreased to million for the period compared to million for the period 
the decrease of million was due primarily to reduced excise taxes in the period 
as discussed in note of the consolidated financial statements  consol energy is no longer required to pay certain excise taxes on export coal sales and  therefore  is no longer accruing for this expense 
due to these taxes on export coal sales being declared unconstitutional  prior year accruals of million which were not paid and are no longer owed  were reversed 
the decrease was partially offset by increased state severance taxes due to higher sales prices and increased property taxes due to increased assessments 
consol energy has filed claims with the internal revenue service seeking refunds for these unconstitutional excise taxes that were paid during the period through during the period  consol energy recognized million of pretax earnings net of other charges and million of interest income related to these claims 

table of contents restructuring charges were million in the period and represent charges for employee severance costs and outside professional consultant costs 
these costs related to the review of administrative and research staff functions that began in the quarter ended december  the purpose of the review was to assess the need for and to assist in a restructuring of those functions to enable consol energy to respond to the cost challenges of the current environment without losing the ability to take advantage of opportunities to grow the business over the longer term 
income taxes income taxes were million in the period compared to a million benefit in the period 
the increased effective tax rate in the period is due mainly to higher pre tax income  with some related loss of percentage depletion benefits 
the effective rate increase was partially offset due to additional gas tax benefits related to the acquisition of buchanan production company  mcnic oakwood gathering inc and a mcn subsidiary that owns a interest in cardinal states gathering company in february also  the tax benefit in the period was due primarily to the recording of an million benefit from a final agreement resolving disputed federal income tax items for the years  the recording of a million benefit resulting from filing the federal and various state tax returns for the period january  through december  in the period and the recording of a million benefit resulting from filing federal and various state tax returns for the period january  through june  in the period 
critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires management to make judgments  estimates and assumptions that affect reported amounts of assets and liabilities in the consolidated financial statements and at the date of the financial statements  as well as the reported amounts of income and expenses during the reporting period 
note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements in this annual report on form k describes the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements 
actual results could differ from those estimates upon subsequent resolution of identified matters 
management believes that the estimates utilized are reasonable 
the following critical accounting policies are materially impacted by judgements  assumptions and estimates used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements 
other post employment benefits consol energy provides retiree health benefits to employees that retire with at least years of service and have attained age our retiree health plans provide health benefits to approximately thousand of our former employees and were partially funded in by trusts that were exhausted late in leaving these benefits unfunded for after our review  various actuarial assumptions  including discount rate  expected trend in health care costs and per capita costs  are used by our independent actuary to estimate the cost and benefit obligations for our retiree health plan 
the discount rate is determined each year at the measurement date normally three months before the year end date 
the discount rate is an estimate of the current interest rate at which the other post employment benefit liabilities could be effectively settled at the measurement date 
in estimating this rate  consol energy looks to rates of return on high quality  fixed income investments that receive one of the two highest ratings given by a recognized ratings agency 
for the twelve months ended december   the discount rate was determined to be per annum 
the discount rate for the six months ended december  and the twelve months ended june  was determined to be per annum 
significant changes to interest rates for the rates of returns on instruments that could be used to settle the actuarily determined plan obligations introduce substantial volatility to our costs 
per capita costs on a per annum basis for other post retirement benefits were assumed to be  at december  this was a increase over the per capita cost on a per annum basis at december  if the actual increase in per capita cost of medical services or other post retirements benefits are significantly greater or less than the projected trend rates  the per capita cost assumption would need to be adjusted annually  which could have a significant effect on the costs and liabilities recognized in the financial statements 
the estimated liability recognized in the financial statements at december  was billion compared to billion at december  coal workers pneumoconiosis consol energy is responsible under the federal coal mine health and safety act of  as amended  for medical and disability benefits to employees and their dependents resulting from occurrences of coal workers pneumoconiosis disease 
consol energy is also responsible under various state statutes for pneumoconiosis benefits 
after our review  our independent actuaries calculate the actuarial present value of the estimated pneumoconiosis obligation based on assumptions regarding disability incidence  medical costs  mortality  death benefits  dependents and discount rates 
the discount rate is determined each year at the measurement date normally three months before the year end date 
the discount rate is an estimate of the current interest rate which the coal workers pneumoconiosis liabilities could be effectively settled at the measurement date 
in estimating this rate  consol energy 
table of contents looks to rates of return on high quality  fixed income investments that receive one of the two highest ratings given by a recognized ratings agency 
for the twelve months ended december  the discount rate was per annum 
the discount rate for the six months ended december  and the twelve months ended june  was per annum 
significant changes to any of these assumptions introduce substantial volatility to our costs 
the estimated liability at december   was million compared to million at december  due to the negative return on plan assets  the difference in the accumulated benefit obligation and the plan assets at december  of approximately million was recognized as a minimum pension liability 
at december  the minimum pension liability was approximately million 
workers compensation workers compensation is a system by which individuals who sustain employment related physical or mental injuries are compensated for their disabilities  medical costs  and on some occasions  for the costs of their rehabilitation 
workers compensation will also compensate the survivors of workers who suffer employment related deaths 
the workers compensation laws are administered by state agencies with each state having its own set of rules and regulations regarding compensation that is owed to an employee that is injured in the course of employment 
consol energy accrues for this type of liability by recognizing cost when the event occurs that gives rise to the obligation  ie  when it is probable that the liability has been incurred and the cost can be reasonably estimated 
to assist in the determination of this estimated liability consol energy utilizes the services of third party administrators in various states in which we do business to determine the liability that exists for workers compensation 
these third parties provide information that facilitates the estimation of the liability based on their knowledge and experience concerning similar past events 
the estimated liability recognized in the financial statements at december   including the current portion  was approximately million compared to million at december  reclamation and mine closure obligations the surface mining control and reclamation act establishes operational  reclamation and closure standards for all aspects of surface mining as well as most aspects of deep mining 
consol energy accrues for the costs of current mine disturbance and final mine closure  including the cost of treating mine water discharge where necessary 
estimates of our total reclamation and mine closing liabilities  which are based upon permit requirements and consol energy engineering expertise related to these requirements  including the current portion  were approximately million at december  this liability is reviewed annually by consol energy management and engineers 
the estimated liability can significantly change if actual costs vary from assumptions or if governmental regulations change significantly 

table of contents we have reviewed the impacts of statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for asset retirement obligations sfas no 
on the accounting treatment of reclamation  mine closing and gas well closing 
this statement requires that the fair value of an asset retirement obligation be recognized in the period in which it is incurred if a reasonable estimate of fair value can be made 
the present value of the estimated asset retirement costs are capitalized as part of the carrying amount of the long lived asset 
asset retirement obligations primarily relate to the closure of mines and gas wells and the reclamation of land upon exhaustion of coal and gas reserves 
under previous accounting standards  such obligations were recognized ratably over the life of the producing assets  primarily on a units of production basis 
effective january   consol energy will adopt sfas no 
consol energy is anticipating the effect to be a gain of approximately million  net of a tax cost of million 
at the time of adoption  total assets  net of accumulated depreciation  will increase approximately million  and total liabilities will increase approximately million 
the amounts recorded upon adoption are dependent upon a number of variables  including the estimated future retirement costs  estimated proved reserves  assumptions involving profit margins  inflation rates  and the assumed credit adjusted risk free interest rate 
previous accounting standards generally used the units of production method to match estimated retirement costs with the revenues generated by the producing assets 
in contrast  sfas no 
requires depreciation of the capitalized asset retirement cost and accretion of the asset retirement obligation over time 
the depreciation will generally be determined on a units of production basis  whereas the accretion to be recognized will escalate over the life of the producing assets  typically as production declines 
because of the long lives of the underlying assets  the impact on net income in the near term is not expected to be material 
contingencies consol energy is currently involved in certain legal proceedings 
we have accrued our estimate of the probable costs for the resolution of these claims 
this estimate has been developed in consultation with legal counsel involved in the defense of these matters and is based upon an analysis of potential results  assuming a combination of litigation and settlement strategies 
we do not believe these proceedings will have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position 
it is possible  however  that future results of operations for any particular quarterly or annual period could be materially affected by changes in our assumptions or the effectiveness of our strategies related to these proceedings 
deferred taxes consol energy accounts for income taxes in accordance with statement of financial accounting standard no 
 accounting for income taxes sfas no 
which requires that deferred tax assets and liabilities be recognized using enacted tax rates for the effect of temporary differences between the book and tax basis of recorded assets and liabilities 
sfas no 
also requires that deferred tax assets be reduced by a valuation allowance if it is more likely than not that some portion of the deferred tax asset will not be realized 
at december   consol energy has deferred tax assets in excess of deferred tax liabilities of approximately million 
the deferred tax assets are evaluated annually to determine if a valuation allowance is necessary 
to date  no valuation allowance has been recognized because consol energy has determined that it is more likely than not that these deferred tax assets will be realized 
the purchase price allocation for the acquisition of windsor coal company  southern ohio coal company and central ohio coal company was completed in the twelve months ended december  as a result  the million of deferred tax assets initially recorded in the preliminary purchase price allocation was reversed 
the change in the purchase price allocation is reflected in the balance sheet 
see note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
realization of our deferred tax assets is principally dependent upon our achievement of projected future non coal mining taxable income 
our judgments regarding future profitability may change due to future market conditions  our ability to continue to successfully execute our business strategy and other factors 
these changes  if any  may require possible valuation allowances to be recognized 
these allowances could materially impact net income 
coal and gas reserve values there are numerous uncertainties inherent in estimating quantities and values of economically recoverable coal and gas reserves  including many factors beyond our control 
as a result  estimates of economically recoverable coal and gas reserves are by their nature uncertain 
information about our reserves consists of estimates based on engineering  economic and geological data assembled and analyzed by our staff 
the majority of our gas reserves have been reviewed by independent experts 
none of our coal reserves have been reviewed by independent experts 
some of the factors and assumptions which impact economically recoverable reserve estimates include geological conditions  historical production from the area compared with production from other producing areas  
table of contents the assumed effects of regulations and taxes by governmental agencies  assumptions governing future prices  and future operating costs 
each of these factors may in fact vary considerably from the assumptions used in estimating reserves 
for these reasons  estimates of the economically recoverable quantities of coal and gas attributable to a particular group of properties  and classifications of these reserves based on risk of recovery and estimates of future net cash flows  may vary substantially 
actual production  revenues and expenditures with respect to our reserves will likely vary from estimates  and these variances may be material 
certain trends and uncertainties in addition to the trends and uncertainties described in item i of this annual report on form k under coal operations competition  gas operations competition and regulations and in critical accounting policies and elsewhere in this management s discussion and analysis of results of operations and financial condition  consol energy is subject to the trends and uncertainties set forth below 
we have a significant amount of debt compared to our stockholders equity  which limits our flexibility  imposes restrictions on us and could hinder our ability to compete and meet future capital and liquidity needs 
we are highly leveraged 
at december   we had outstanding approximately million in aggregate principal amount of indebtedness  including capital leases  and total stockholders equity of million 
the degree to which we are leveraged could have important consequences to us  including the following a substantial portion of our cash flow must be used to pay interest on our indebtedness and therefore is not available for use in our business  our high degree of indebtedness increases our vulnerability to changes in general economic and industry conditions  our ability to obtain additional financing for working capital  capital expenditures  general corporate purposes or other purposes could be impaired  because some of our borrowings are short term or at variable rates of interest  we are vulnerable to interest rate fluctuations  which could result in our incurring higher interest expenses if interest rates increase  our failure to comply with covenants and restrictions contained in the terms of our borrowings could lead to a default which could cause all or a significant portion of our debt to become immediately payable  and stockholders equity was reduced by comprehensive losses of approximately million in and million in these losses relate primarily to minimum pension liability as a result of the negative return on plan assets for non contributory defined benefit retirement plans covering substantially all employees not covered by multi employer retirement plans 
comprehensive losses are calculated annually and reflect a number of factors including conditions in the stock markets and interest rates 
we cannot predict whether we will be required to recognize such losses in the future 
further comprehensive losses would erode our stockholders equity and possibly preclude our paying dividends  which likely would adversely affect our stock price 
in recent periods our operating results have deteriorated and we may incur losses in future periods 
although we reported net income for each of the twelve months ended december   the six months ended december  and the twelve months ended june   net income was attributable to income tax benefits in the periods ended december  and and benefited substantially from export sales excise tax resolution in the twelve months ended june  for the twelve months ended december  and the six months ended december   we incurred losses before income tax benefits of million and million 
our recent results reflect a number of factors  including the continued sluggish us economy and the lingering effects of higher than usual customer inventory levels 
these and other conditions beyond our control could continue to affect our business and we may incur losses in the future 

table of contents we may be unable to comply with restrictions imposed by our credit facilities and other debt agreements  which could result in a default under these agreements 
our credit facility imposes a number of restrictions on us 
for example  it contains financial and other covenants that create limitations on our ability to  among other things  borrow the full amount under our credit facilities  incur additional debt  and require us to maintain various financial ratios and comply with various other financial covenants 
these financial covenants include a funded debt ratio that requires that we maintain a ratio of total indebtedness for borrowed money as of the last day of each quarter to total earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization and excluding any extraordinary gains or losses for the four quarters ended on that date of not more than to and a ratio for the last four consecutive quarters of total earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization and excluding any extraordinary gains or losses to total interest payable including amortization of debt discount on indebtedness for borrowed money of not less than to our ability to comply with these restrictions depends upon our operating results  which recently have deteriorated from earlier periods and which continue to be affected by the sluggish economy and other events beyond our control 
as a result  we may be unable to comply with these covenants and other restrictions in our credit facility 
a failure to comply with these restrictions could adversely affect our ability to borrow under our credit facilities or result in an event of default under these agreements 
in the event of a default  our lenders could terminate their commitments to us and declare all amounts borrowed  together with accrued interest and fees  immediately due and payable 
if this were to occur  we might not be able to pay these amounts  or we might be forced to seek an amendment to our debt agreements which could make the terms of these agreements more onerous for us 
failure to comply with these restrictions  even if waived by our bank lenders  also could adversely affect our credit ratings  which could increase the costs of debt financings to us and impair our ability to obtain additional debt financing 
we cannot be certain that we will maintain our competitive position because coal and gas markets are highly competitive and are affected by factors beyond our control 
we compete with coal producers in various regions of the united states for domestic sales  and we compete both with domestic and foreign coal producers for sales in international markets 
demand for our coal by our principal customers is affected by the price of competing coal and alternative fuel supplies  including nuclear  natural gas  oil and renewable energy sources  such as hydroelectric power 
we sell coal to foreign electricity generators and to the more specialized metallurgical coal market  both of which are significantly affected by international demand and competition 
a significant decline in the prices we receive for our coal and gas could adversely affect our operating results and cash flows 
our results of operations are highly dependent upon the prices we receive for our coal and gas  which are closely linked to consumption patterns of the electric generation industry and certain industrial and residential patterns where gas is the principal fuel 
for example  in calendar years and  demand for coal decreased because of the warm winters in the northeastern united states 
this resulted in increased inventories that caused pricing decreases in substantially all of our natural gas production is sold at market sensitive prices 
prices for natural gas are subject to volatile trading patterns 
extended or substantial price declines for coal or gas would adversely affect our operating results for future periods and our ability to generate cash flows necessary to improve productivity and expand operations 
we may not be able to produce sufficient amounts of coal to fulfill our customers requirements  which could harm our customer relationships 
we may not be able to produce sufficient amounts of coal to meet customer demand  including amounts that we are required to deliver under long term contracts 
our inability to satisfy our contractual obligations could result in our customers initiating claims against us 
our inability to satisfy demand could otherwise harm our relationships with our customers 
if the coal or gas industry experiences overcapacity in the future  our profitability could be impaired 
during the mid s and early s  a growing coal market and increased demand for coal attracted new investors to the coal industry  spurred the development of new mines and resulted in added production capacity throughout the industry  all of which led to increased competition and lower coal prices 
increases in coal prices similarly could encourage the development of expanded capacity by new or existing coal producers 
any overcapacity could reduce coal prices in the future 
increased prices for gas typically stimulate additional exploration and often result in additional supplies brought to market 
increased gas supply could reduce gas prices in the future 
if customers do not extend existing contracts or enter into new long term contracts for coal  the stability and profitability of our operations could be affected 
during the twelve months ended december   approximately of the coal we produced was sold under contracts with terms of one year or more 
the profitability of our long term coal supply contracts depends on a variety of factors  which vary from contract to contract and fluctuate during the contract term  and includes our production costs and other factors 
price changes  if any  provided in long term supply contracts are not intended to reflect our cost increases  and therefore increases in our 
table of contents costs may reduce our profit margins 
in addition  in periods of declining market prices  provisions for adjustment or renegotiation of prices and other provisions may increase our exposure to short term coal price volatility 
if a substantial portion of our long term contracts are modified or terminated  we would be adversely affected to the extent that we are unable to find other customers at the same level of profitability 
as a result  we cannot assure you that we will be able to obtain long term agreements at favorable prices compared to either market conditions  as they may change from time to time  or our cost structure or that they will contribute to our profitability 
we depend on two customers for a significant portion of our revenues and the loss of one or both of these customers could adversely affect us 
during the twelve months ended december   allegheny energy accounted for approximately of our total revenue and american electric power accounted for approximately of our total revenue 
our business and operating results could be adversely affected if either one of these customers does not continue to purchase the same amount of coal or gas as it has purchased from us in the past or on terms  including pricing  it has under existing agreements 
some of our long term contracts require us to supply all of our customers coal needs 
if these customers coal requirements decline  our operating results may be adversely affected 
we have requirements contracts with certain customers which require us to supply all of those customers coal needs but allow the customers to defer or vary the amount of coal that they accept 
during  the reduction in the amount required by certain of these customers contributed to the reduction in our earnings when we could not find alternative customers at the same price and volume levels 
if these or other customers with requirements contracts need less coal in the future  it could adversely affect our operating results 

table of contents the creditworthiness of our customer base has declined 
our ability to receive payment for coal or gas sold depends on the creditworthiness of our customers 
in general  the creditworthiness of our customers has declined 
if this trend were to continue  the number of customers with acceptable credit profiles could decline 
we may not be able to accomplish acquisitions effectively  which requires us to outbid competitors  obtain financing on acceptable terms and integrate acquired operations the energy industry is a rapidly consolidating industry  with many companies seeking to consummate acquisitions and increase their market share 
in this environment  we compete and will continue to compete with many other buyers for acquisitions 
some of those competitors may be able to outbid us for acquisitions because they have greater financial resources 
as a result of these and other factors  future acquisitions may not be available to us on attractive terms 
our ability to consummate any acquisition will be subject to various conditions  including the negotiation of satisfactory agreements and obtaining necessary regulatory approvals and financing 
once any acquisition is completed  we may not be able to achieve expected operating benefits through cost reductions  increased efficiency and integration with our existing operations 
as a result  our operating results may be adversely affected 
disputes with our customers concerning contracts can result in litigation  which could result in our paying substantial damages 
from time to time  we have disputes with our customers over the provisions of long term contracts relating to  among other things  coal quality  pricing and quantity 
we may not be able to resolve any future disputes in a satisfactory manner  which could result in our paying substantial damages 
coal mining is subject to conditions or events beyond our control  which could cause our quarterly or annual results to deteriorate 
our coal mining operations are predominantly underground mines 
these mines are subject to conditions or events beyond our control that could disrupt operations  affect production and the cost of mining at particular mines for varying lengths of time and have a significant impact on our operating results 
these conditions or events have included variations in thickness of the layer  or seam  of coal  amounts of rock and other natural materials and other geological conditions  equipment failures or repair  fires and other accidents  and weather conditions 
we face numerous uncertainties in estimating our economically recoverable coal and gas reserves  and inaccuracies in our estimates could result in lower than expected revenues  higher than expected costs and decreased profitability 
there are numerous uncertainties inherent in estimating quantities and values of economically recoverable coal and gas reserves  including many factors beyond our control 
as a result  estimates of economically recoverable coal and gas reserves are by their nature uncertain 
information about our reserves consists of estimates based on engineering  economic and geological data assembled and analyzed by our staff

for these reasons  estimates of the economically recoverable quantities of coal and gas attributable to a particular group of properties  and classifications of these reserves based on risk of recovery and estimates of future net cash flows  may vary substantially 
actual production  revenues and expenditures with respect to our reserves will likely vary from estimates  and these variances may be material 
as a result  our estimates may not accurately reflect our actual reserves 
the exploration for  and production of  gas is an uncertain process with many risks 
the exploration for and production of gas involves numerous risks 
the cost of drilling  completing and operating wells for coalbed methane or other gas is often uncertain  and a number of factors can delay or prevent drilling operations or production  including unexpected drilling conditions  pressure or irregularities in formations  equipment failures or repairs  fires or other accidents  adverse weather conditions  pipeline ruptures or spills  compliance with governmental requirements  and shortages or delays in the availability of drilling rigs and the delivery of equipment 
our future drilling activities may not be successful  and we cannot be sure that our drilling success rates will not decline 
unsuccessful drilling activities could result in higher costs without any corresponding revenues 
also  we may not be able to obtain any options or lease rights in potential drilling locations that we identify which  among other things  could prevent us from producing gas at potential drilling locations 
disruption of rail  barge and other systems which deliver our coal  or of pipeline systems which deliver our gas  or increase in transportation costs could make our coal or gas less competitive 
coal producers depend upon rail  barge  trucking  overland conveyor and other systems to provide access to markets 
disruption of transportation services because of weather related problems  strikes  lock outs or other events could temporarily impair our ability to supply coal to customers and adversely affect our profitability 
transportation costs represent a significant portion of the delivered cost of coal and  as a result  the cost of delivery is a critical factor in a customer s purchasing decision 
increases in transportation costs could make our coal less competitive 
the marketability of our gas production partly depends on the availability  proximity and capacity of pipeline systems owned by third parties 
unexpected changes in access to pipelines could adversely affect our operations 
government laws  regulations and other legal requirements relating to protection of the environment and health and safety matters increase our costs of doing business and may restrict our operations 
we are subject to laws  regulations and other legal requirements enacted or adopted by federal  state and local  as well as foreign  authorities relating to protection of the environment and health and safety matters  including those legal requirements that govern discharges of substances into the air and water  the management and disposal of hazardous substances and wastes  the cleanup of contaminated sites  groundwater quality and availability  plant and wildlife protection  reclamation and restoration of mining properties after mining is completed and control of surface subsidence from underground mining 
complying with these requirements  including the terms of our permits  has had  and will continue to have  a significant effect on our costs of operations and competitive position 
in addition  we could incur substantial costs  including clean up costs  fines and civil or criminal sanctions and third party damage claims for personal injury  property damage  wrongful death  or exposure to hazardous substances  as a result of violations of or liabilities under environmental laws 
for example  we incur and will continue to incur significant costs associated with the investigation and remediation of environmental contamination under the federal comprehensive environmental response  compensation  and liability act superfund and similar state statutes and have been named as a potentially responsible party at superfund sites in the past 
our costs for these matters  which currently relate predominantly to one site  could exceed our current accruals  which were million at december  the discovery of additional contaminants or the imposition of additional clean up obligations or other liabilities could result in substantially greater costs than we have estimated 

table of contents we must obtain governmental permits and approvals for mining operations  which can be a costly and time consuming process and result in restrictions on our operations 
regulatory authorities exercise considerable discretion in the timing and scope of permit issuance 
requirements imposed by these authorities may be costly and time consuming and may result in delays in the commencement or continuation of exploration or production operations 
for example  we often are required to prepare and present to federal  state and local authorities data pertaining to the effect or impact that proposed exploration for or production of coal may have on the environment 
further  private individuals and the public at large possess rights to comment on and otherwise engage in the permitting process  including through intervention in the courts 
accordingly  the permits we need may not be issued  or if issued  may not be issued in a timely fashion  or may involve requirements which restrict our ability to conduct our mining operations or to do so profitably 
the characteristics of coal may make it difficult for coal users to comply with various environmental standards related to coal combustion 
as a result  they may switch to other fuels  which would affect the volume of our sales 
coal contains impurities  including sulfur  mercury  chlorine and other regulated elements or compounds  many of which are released into the air when coal is burned 
stricter environmental regulations of emissions from coal fired electric generating plants could increase the costs of using coal thereby  reducing demand for coal as a fuel source and the volume of our coal sales 
stricter regulations could make coal a less attractive fuel alternative in the planning and building of utility power plants in the future 
for example  in order to meet the federal clean air act limits for sulfur dioxide emissions from electric power plants  coal users may need to install scrubbers  use sulfur dioxide emission allowances some of which they may purchase  blend high sulfur coal with low sulfur coal or switch to other fuels 
each option has limitations 
lower sulfur coal may be more costly to purchase on an energy basis than higher sulfur coal depending on mining and transportation costs 
the cost of installing scrubbers is significant and emission allowances may become more expensive as their availability declines 
switching to other fuels may require expensive modification of existing plants 
because higher sulfur coal currently accounts for a significant portion of our sales  the extent to which power generators switch to low sulfur fuel could materially affect us if we cannot offset the cost of sulfur removal by lowering the costs of delivery of our higher sulfur coals on an energy equivalent basis 
other new and proposed reductions in emissions of mercury  nitrogen oxides  particulate matter or greenhouse gases may require the installation of additional costly control technology or the implementation of other measures  including switching to other fuels 
these new and proposed reductions will make it more costly to operate coal fired plants and could make coal a less attractive fuel alternative to the planning and building of utility power plants in the future 
for example  the environmental protection agency would require reduction of nitrogen oxide emissions in eastern states and the district of columbia and of particulate matter emissions over the next several years 
in addition  congress and several states are now considering legislation to further control air emissions of multiple pollutants from electric generating facilities and other large emitters 
to the extent that any new requirements affect our customers  this could adversely affect our operations and results 
we have significant reclamation and mine closure obligations 
if the assumptions underlying our accruals are materially inaccurate  we could be required to expend greater amounts than anticipated 
the surface mining control and reclamation act establishes operational  reclamation and closure standards for all aspects of surface mining as well as most aspects of deep mining 
we accrue for the costs of current mine disturbance and of final mine closure  including the cost of treating mine water discharge where necessary 
estimates of our total reclamation and mine closing liabilities  which are based upon permit requirements and our experience  were million at december  these obligations are unfunded 
if these accruals are insufficient or our liability in a particular year is greater than currently anticipated  our future operating results could be adversely affected 
a recent court decision which extends prohibitions previously applicable only to surface mines to underground mines as well  could limit or even preclude our use of longwall mining and restrict the operations or require the closing of several of our underground mines 
the united states district court for the district of columbia in citizens coal council v 
norton and the national mining association held that the surface mining control and reclamation act s prohibitions on surface coal mining within or nearby certain designated areas listed in section e of the act apply to underground mining beneath those areas as well 
the court s ruling overturned the office of surface mining rule interpreting the surface mining control and reclamation act  which confirmed that certain prohibitions on surface mining do not apply to underground mining 
these prohibitions would affect a number of our underground mines and particularly mines employing longwall mining 
future longwall mining of some of our coal reserves may no longer be economically feasible because the large  contiguous coal reserves needed to perform longwall mining would be continually interrupted by the blocks of coal required to be left in place to protect designated areas 
the national mining association  the department of interior and office of surface mining have filed a motion to stay the decision 

table of contents federal  state and local authorities extensively regulate our gas production activities 
the gas industry is subject to extensive legislation and regulation  which is under constant review for amendment or expansion 
any changes may affect  among other things  the pricing or marketing of gas production 
state and local authorities regulate various aspects of gas drilling and production activities  including the drilling of wells through permit and bonding requirements  the spacing of wells  the unitization or pooling  of gas properties  environmental matters  safety standards  market sharing and well site restoration 
if we fail to comply with statutes and regulations  we may be subject to substantial penalties  which would decrease our profitability 
deregulation of the electric utility industry could have unanticipated effects on our industry 
deregulation of the electric utility industry will enable purchasers of electricity to shop for the lowest cost suppliers 
if our electric power generator customers become more sensitive to long term price or quantity commitments in a more competitive environment  it may be more difficult for us to enter into long term contracts and could subject our revenue stream to increased volatility which may adversely affect our profitability 
deregulation of the power industry may have other consequences for our industry  such as efforts to reduce coal prices  which may have a negative effect on our operating results 
the passage of legislation responsive to the framework convention on global climate change or similar governmental initiatives could result in restrictions on coal use 
the united states and more than other nations are signatories to the framework convention on global climate change which is intended to limit or capture emissions of greenhouse gases  such as carbon dioxide 
in december  in kyoto  japan  the signatories to the convention established a binding set of emissions targets for developed nations 
although the specific emissions targets vary from country to country  the united states would be required to reduce emissions to of levels over a five year budget period from through the united states senate is not expected to ratify the emissions targets 
president bush has stated that he does not support the kyoto protocol and has proposed an alternative to reduce united states emissions of greenhouse gases 
if the kyoto protocol or other comprehensive legislation focusing on greenhouse gas emissions is enacted by the united states  it could have the effect of restricting the use of coal 
other efforts to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases and federal initiatives to encourage the use of natural gas also may affect the use of coal as an energy source 
we are subject to the federal clean water act and similar state laws which impose treatment  monitoring and reporting obligations 
the federal clean water act and corresponding state laws affect coal mining operations by imposing restrictions on discharges into regulated waters 
permits requiring regular monitoring and compliance with effluent limitations and reporting requirements govern the discharge of pollutants into regulated waters 
we believe that we have obtained all permits required under the clean water act and corresponding state laws and are in substantial compliance with such permits 
however  there can be no assurance that new requirements under the clean water act and corresponding state laws will not cause us to incur significant additional costs that adversely affect our operating results 
we have significant obligations for long term employee benefits for which we accrue based upon assumptions which  if inaccurate  could result in our being required to expend greater amounts than anticipated 
we provide various long term employee benefits to inactive and retired employees 
we accrue amounts for these obligations 
at december   the current and non current portions of these obligations included post retirement medical and life insurance billion  coal workers black lung benefits million  and workers compensation million these obligations have been estimated based on assumptions  which are described in the notes to our consolidated financial statements 
however  if our assumptions are inaccurate  we could be required to expend greater amounts than anticipated 
these obligations are unfunded  except for coal workers black lung  which is under funded 
in addition  several states in which we operate consider changes in workers compensation laws from time to time 
such changes  if enacted  could adversely affect us 
new regulations have expanded the definition of black lung disease and generally made it easier for claimants to assert and prosecute claims  which could increase our exposure to black lung benefit liabilities 
in january  the united states department of labor amended the regulations implementing the federal black lung laws to give greater weight to the opinion of a claimant s treating physician  expand the definition of black lung disease and limit the amount of medical evidence that can be submitted by claimants and respondents 
the amendments also alter administrative procedures for the adjudication of claims  which  according to the department of labor  results in streamlined procedures that are less formal  less 
table of contents adversarial and easier for participants to understand 
these and other changes to the federal black lung regulations could significantly increase our exposure to black lung benefits liabilities 
in recent years  legislation on black lung reform has been introduced but not enacted in congress 
it is possible that this legislation will be reintroduced for consideration by congress 
if any of the proposals included in this or similar legislation is passed  the number of claimants who are awarded benefits could significantly increase 
any such changes in black lung legislation  if approved  may adversely effect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
fairmont supply company  our subsidiary  is a co defendant in various asbestos litigation cases which allege that fairmont distributed industrial supply products containing asbestos 
to date  payments by fairmont with respect to asbestos cases have not been material 
however  there cannot be any assurance that payments in the future with respect to asbestos cases will not be material 
one of our subsidiaries  fairmont supply company  which distributes industrial supplies  currently is defending against approximately  asbestos claims in state courts in pennsylvania  ohio  west virginia and mississippi 
because a very small percentage of products manufactured by third parties and supplied by fairmont in the past may have contained asbestos and many of the pending claims are part of mass complaints filed by hundreds of plaintiffs against a hundred or more defendants  it has been difficult for fairmont to determine how many of the cases actually involve valid claims or plaintiffs who were actually exposed to asbestos containing products supplied by fairmont 
in addition  while fairmont may be entitled to indemnity or contribution in certain jurisdictions from manufacturers of identified products  the availability of such indemnity or contribution is unclear at this time and  in recent years  some of the manufacturers named as defendants in these actions have sought protection from these claims under bankruptcy laws 
fairmont has no insurance coverage with respect to these asbestos cases 
to date  payments by fairmont with respect to asbestos cases have not been material 
however  there cannot be any assurance that payments in the future with respect to pending or future asbestos cases will not be material to the financial position  results of operations or cash flows of consol energy 
we have been informed by insurance companies that  unless provided with collateral  they no longer will issue surety bonds that we and other coal mining companies are required by law to obtain 
various federal or state laws and regulations require us to obtain surety bonds or to provide other assurance of payment for certain of our long term liabilities including mine closure or reclamation costs  workers compensation and other post employment benefits 
we  along with other participants in the coal industry  have been informed by the insurance companies that they no longer will provide surety bonds for workers compensation and other post employment benefits without collateral 
although it may be possible to satisfy our obligations under these statutes and regulations  or it may be possible to satisfy the insurance companies requests for collateral  by providing letters of credit or other assurances of payment  we cannot be certain that we can obtain these or that they would not be significantly more costly than surety bonds have been or otherwise impose restrictions on us 
liquidity and capital resources consol energy generally has satisfied its working capital requirements and funded its capital expenditures and debt service obligations from cash generated from operations and proceeds from borrowings 
a principal source of borrowing is the issuance of commercial paper 
at december   consol energy had an aggregate principal amount outstanding of million of commercial paper 
in september  consol energy entered into a new senior credit facility that provides for an aggregate of million that may be used to pay commercial paper  for issuing letters of credit and for other borrowings 
this facility replaces a million credit facility  which expired in september the current agreement consists of a day million credit facility which expires in september  and a three year million credit facility which expires in september interest is based at our option  upon the prime base rate or london interbank offered rates libor plus a spread  which is dependent on our credit rating 
the agreement has various covenants  including covenants that limit our ability to dispose of assets and merge with another corporation 
we are also required to maintain a ratio of total consolidated indebtedness to twelve month trailing earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation  depletion and amortization ebitda of not more than to measured quarterly to for quarters after december  
this ratio was to at december  in addition  we are required to maintain a ratio of twelve month trailing ebitda to interest expense and amortization of debt of no less than to measured quarterly 
this ratio was to at december  at december   this facility had million of additional capacity 
at february   this facility had million of additional capacity 
consol energy believes that cash generated from operations and its borrowing capacity will be sufficient to meet its working capital requirements  anticipated capital expenditures other than major acquisitions  scheduled debt payments and anticipated dividend payments in nevertheless  the ability of consol energy to satisfy its debt service obligations  to fund planned capital expenditures or pay dividends will depend upon its future operating performance  which will be affected by prevailing economic conditions in the coal and gas industries and other financial and business factors  some of which are beyond consol energy s control 

table of contents on march   consol energy issued million principal amount of notes due in the notes were issued at of the principal amount and consol energy received approximately million of net proceeds 
interest on the notes is payable march and september of each year 
payment of the principal and premium  if any  and interest on the notes are guaranteed by several consol energy subsidiaries that incur or guarantee certain indebtedness 
the notes are senior unsecured obligations and rank equally with all other unsecured and unsubordinated indebtedness of the guarantors 
consol energy paid approximately million for debt issuance costs related to these notes 
the debt issuance costs are being amortized using the straight line method and are included in the interest expense line on the income statement 
in connection with the issuance of these notes  consol energy entered into a financial derivative contract that essentially fixed the underlying treasury rate the rate upon which the interest rate for the notes was based at per annum 
this contract resulted in a net payment of million to consol energy 
this receipt was treated as a cash flow hedge and therefore  resulted in other comprehensive income of million net of million deferred tax  which will be amortized to interest income over the life of the notes 
on july   one of consol energy s subsidiaries  consol energy australia pty limited cea  along with maitland main collieries mmc  entered into a syndicated multi option facility agreement with australia and new zealand banking group limited to provide project finance for development and operation of the glennies creek mine located in new south wales  australia 
cea and mmc have equal ownership in the glennies creek mine 
under the agreement  three borrowing facilities were created 
in total  these facilities allow cea to borrow up to million in stages through the facilities have various payment dates through under these agreements  cea was required to enter into interest rate hedge contracts and foreign currency swap agreements 
the libor and australian bank bill rate exposure was hedged by entering into interest rate swap contracts to provide the required hedge protection of of the forecasted principal outstanding until march  thereafter  hedge protection of of the forecasted principal outstanding is required 
the market value of these contracts was a million liability as of december  these contracts were treated as cash flow hedges and  therefore  resulted in other comprehensive loss of million net of million deferred tax 
foreign currency swap contracts were executed on july  to permit cea to purchase australian dollars at a fixed exchange rate 
cea entered into these swaps in order to minimize exposure to foreign exchange rate fluctuations 
future swap contracts will be made in order to satisfy the requirement to provide protection of the forecasted currency exposure for a rolling two year period 
for accounting purposes  these contracts did not qualify as hedges 
as a result  million and million of income was recorded in consol energy s consolidated financial statements for the quarter and year ended december   respectively 
in order to manage the market risk exposure of volatile natural gas prices in the future  consol energy enters into various physical gas supply transactions with our gas marketers selling gas under short term multi month contract nominations generally not exceeding one year 
consol energy has also entered into a single float for fixed swap transaction that qualifies as a financial cash flow hedge which exists parallel to the underlying physical transactions 
this transaction resulted in other comprehensive loss of million net of million of deferred tax 
consol energy frequently evaluates potential acquisitions 
consol energy has funded acquisitions primarily with cash generated from operations and a variety of other sources  depending on the size of the transaction  including debt financing 
there can be no assurance that such additional capital resources will be available to consol energy on terms which consol energy finds acceptable  or at all 
cash flows net cash provided by operating activities was million in the twelve months ended december  compared to million in the twelve months ended december  the change in net cash provided by operating activities was primarily due to decreases in net income  as previously discussed  increases in coal inventory  and a one time workers compensation payment made to the state of west virginia 
these decreases to operating cash flow were offset  in part  by reduced tax payments related to the refunds received in the period due to changes in filing positions and the recognition of amounts in the period attributable to anticipated refunds for excise tax funds previously paid 
approximately million of these receivables have been collected in the period and million in the period 
net cash used in investing activities was million in the period compared to million in the period 
the change in net cash used in investing activities primarily reflects the million received in the acquisition during of windsor coal company  southern ohio coal company and central ohio coal company  reduced by the million cash expenditures for the acquisition of line creek mine joint venture  glennies creek mine joint venture  the remaining of pocahontas gas partnership and the remaining of cardinal states gathering company in the period 
cash used in investing activities was also increased due to million of additional capital expenditures in the period compared to the period 
capital expenditures were million in the period compared to million in the period 
capital expenditures increased due mainly to the expansion of the mcelroy preparation plant and the addition of a longwall at this mining complex 
these additions were being completed in preparation of increased shipments under the sales contract with american electric power signed july mines of the companies which we acquired from american electric power have been closed 
the mines these companies control have been closed and the contract will be satisfied by coal mined from mcelroy and other consol energy mines 
the change in net cash 
table of contents used in investing activities was also due to a use of cash for investments in equity affiliates of million in the period compared to million in the period 
this was primarily due to the million in payments made to a joint venture with allegheny energy supply company  llc  an affiliate of one of our largest coal customers  to build an megawatt  gas fired electric generating facility and million for the development of our joint venture in glennies creek mine in australia 
cash used in investing activities also changed due to cash generated by of pocahontas gas partnership and of cardinal states gathering company through august  when these entities were accounted for on the equity method 
the remaining of pocahontas gas partnership and the remaining of cardinal states gathering company were purchased on this date and these entities became fully consolidated 
net cash provided by financing activities was million in the period 
net cash used in financing activities was million in the period 
the change in net cash provided by or used in financing activities primarily reflects the net proceeds of approximately million from the march  issuance of notes due net cash provided also increased million due to the reduction of quarterly dividend payments to per share beginning with the quarter ended june  from per share dividend paid for each previous quarter 
net cash provided also increased due to million of additional payments being made from the proceeds of the notes issued to reduce the outstanding principal balance of commercial paper in the period than were made in the period 
these sources of cash were offset  in part  by scheduled payments of million made on unsecured notes that matured in the following is a summary of our significant contractual obligations at december  in thousands payments due by year within year years years after years total short term notes payable long term debt capital lease obligations operating lease obligations total contractual obligations additionally  we have long term liabilities relating to other post employment benefits  work related injuries and illnesses  defined benefit pension plans  mine reclamation and closure  and other long term liability costs 
we estimate the payments  net of any applicable trust reimbursements  related to these items at december  in thousands to be payments due by year within year years years total as discussed in critical accounting policies and in the notes to our consolidated financial statements  our determination of these long term liabilities is calculated annually and is based on several assumptions  including then prevailing conditions  which may change from year to year 
in any year  if our assumptions are inaccurate  we could be required to expend greater amounts than anticipated 
moreover  in particular  for periods after our estimates may change from the amounts included in the table  and may change significantly  if our assumptions change to reflect changing conditions 
for example  the payments due in years include an estimate of approximately million related to a final payout under a long term coal contract which was entered into in under this agreement  consol energy was reimbursed for estimated post closure reclamation costs plus a contingency over coal shipments made to the customer 
upon final bond release of the affected areas  reclamation costs versus monies received for reclamation over the life of the contract would be actualized 
capital expenditures were million in the period compared to million in the period 
we currently anticipate capital expenditures for the year ending december  to be million 
we also currently anticipate capital expenditures related to investment in affiliates for the year ending december  to be million 
however  we may choose to defer certain capital projects in light of operating results 
capital expenditures for pollution abatement and reclamation are projected to be million for the year ending december  our capital expenditures have been and will be primarily used for replacement of mining and gas equipment  the expansion of mining and gas capacity and projects to improve the efficiency of the mining and gas operations 
the projected capital expenditures for are not committed and are expected to be funded with cash generated by operations 
in addition  cash requirements to fund employee related  mine closure and other long term liabilities included above  along with obligations related to long term debt  capital and operating leases  are expected to be funded with cash generated by operations 
if cash flow from operations is not sufficient to cover expenditures in the future  we expect to rely on the issuance of commercial paper 
our commercial paper program currently provides for borrowings  including the issuance of letters of credit and other borrowings  of up to million through september  at which time the facility

table of contents consol energy paid ordinary cash dividends of million during the twelve months ended december   million during the six months ended december  and million during the twelve months ended june  the board of directors declared a dividend on january  of per share of common stock for shareholders of record on february   payable on february  the board of directors currently intends to pay quarterly dividends on the common stock 
the declaration and payment of dividends by consol energy is subject to the discretion of the board of directors  and no assurance can be given that consol energy will pay such dividends or any additional dividends in the future 
the determination as to the payment of dividends will depend upon  among other things  general business conditions  consol energy s financial results  contractual and legal restrictions regarding the payment of dividends by consol energy  the credit ratings of consol energy  planned investments by consol energy and such other factors as the board of directors deems relevant 
current outstanding indebtedness of consol energy does not restrict consol energy s ability to pay cash dividends  except that the credit facility would not permit dividends in the event of a default 
inflation inflation in the united states has been relatively low in recent years and did not have a material impact on consol energy s results of operations for the twelve months ended december   six months ended december  or the twelve months ended june  recent accounting pronouncements we have reviewed the impacts of statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for asset retirement obligations on the accounting treatment of reclamation  mine closing and gas well closing 
this statement requires the fair value of an asset retirement obligation be recognized in the period in which it is incurred if a reasonable estimate of fair value can be made 
the present value of the estimated asset retirement costs are capitalized as part of the carrying amount of the long lived asset 
asset retirement obligations primarily relate to the closure of mines and gas wells and the reclamation of land upon exhaustion of coal and gas reserves 
under previous accounting standards  such obligations were recognized ratably over the life of the producing assets  primarily on a units of production basis 
effective january   consol energy will adopt sfas no 
 as required 
the cumulative effect on net income of adopting sfas no 
is expected to be minimal 
consol energy is anticipating the effect to be a gain of approximately million  net of a tax cost of million 
at the time of adoption  total assets  net of accumulated depreciation  will increase approximately million  and total liabilities will increase approximately million 
the amounts recorded upon adoption are dependent upon a number of variables  including the estimated future retirement costs  estimated proved reserves  assumptions involving profit margins  inflation rates  and the assumed credit adjusted risk free interest rate 
previous accounting standards generally used the units of production method to match estimated retirement costs with the revenues generated by the producing assets 
in contrast  sfas no 
requires depreciation of the capitalized asset retirement cost and accretion of the asset retirement obligation over time 
the depreciation will generally be determined on a units of production basis  whereas the accretion to be recognized will escalate over the life of the producing assets  typically as production declines 
because of the long lives of the underlying producing assets  the impact on net income in the near term is not expected to be material 
in july  statement of financial accounting standards no

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk in addition to the risks inherent in operations  consol energy is exposed to financial  market  political and economic risks 
the following discussion provides additional detail regarding consol energy s exposure to the risks of changing natural gas prices  interest rates and foreign exchange rates 
consol energy is exposed to market price risk in the normal course of selling natural gas production and to a lesser extent in the sale of coal 
consol sells coal under both short term and long term contracts with fixed price and or indexed price contracts that reflect market value 
consol energy uses fixed price contracts  collar price contracts and derivative commodity instruments that qualify as cash flow hedges under statement of financial accounting standards no 
to minimize exposure to market price volatility in the sale of natural gas 
our risk management policy strictly prohibits the use of derivatives for speculative positions 
consol energy has established risk management policies and procedures to strengthen the internal control environment of the marketing of commodities produced from its asset base 
all of the derivative instruments are held for purposes other than trading 
they are used primarily to mitigate uncertainty and volatility and cover underlying exposures 
consol energy s market risk strategy incorporates fundamental risk management tools to assess market price risk and establish a framework in which management can maintain a portfolio of transactions within pre defined risk parameters 
consol energy believes that the use of derivative instruments along with the risk assessment procedures and internal controls does not expose consol energy to material risk 
the use of derivative instruments could materially affect consol energy s results of operations depending on interest rates  exchange rates or market prices 
however  we believe that use of these instruments will not have a material adverse effect on our financial position or liquidity 
for a summary of accounting policies related to derivative instruments  see note to the consolidated financial statements 
sensitivity analyses of the incremental effects on pre tax income for the twelve months ended december  of a hypothetical percent and percent changes in natural gas prices  foreign exchange and interest rates for open derivative instruments as of december  are provided in the following table incremental decrease in pre tax income assuming a hypothetical price  exchange rate or interest rate change of in millions natural gas a foreign currency b interest rates c a consol energy remains at risk for possible changes in the market value of this derivative instrument  however  such risk should be mitigated by price changes in the underlying hedged item 
the effect of this offset is not reflected in the sensitivity analyses 
consol energy entered into derivative instruments to convert the market prices related to anticipated sales of natural gas to fixed prices 
the fair value of these contracts was a loss of million net of million deferred tax 
we continually evaluate the portfolio of derivative commodity instruments and adjust their strategy to anticipated market conditions and risks accordingly 
b consol energy uses foreign currency contracts to fix the costs of anticipated australian dollar capital expenditures 
the us dollar notional amount of all foreign currency contracts was million as of december  the fair value of these contracts resulted in million of income in the period 

table of contents c consol energy uses interest rate swaps to hedge the interest rate risk exposure of forecasted interest payments on consol energy australia pty ltd s  one of consol energy subsidiaries  outstanding variable rate debt 
these agreements effectively convert variable rate debt into fixed rate debt 
the fair value of these contracts was a loss of million net of million deferred tax 
the use of these contracts are monitored by consol energy s executive management and treasury group 
consol energy is exposed to credit risk in the event of nonperformance by counterparties 
the credit worthiness of counterparties is subject to continuing review 
consol energy s interest expense is sensitive to changes in the general level of interest rates in the united states 
at december   consol energy had outstanding million aggregate principal amount of debt under fixed rate instruments and million aggregate principal amount of debt under variable rate instruments 
consol energy s primary exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates to its commercial paper program 
at december   consol energy had an aggregate of million in commercial paper outstanding 
consol energy s commercial paper bore interest at an average rate of during the twelve months ended december  at december   consol energy had an aggregate of million in commercial paper outstanding prior to reclassification of notes 
consol energy s commercial paper bore interest at an average rate of during the six months ended december  a point increase in the average rate for consol energy s commercial paper would have decreased the six months ended december  net income by approximately million 
a basis point increase in the average rate for consol energy s commercial paper would have decreased consol energy s twelve months ended december  net income by approximately million 
the fair value of consol energy s financial instruments is set forth in note and note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
almost all of consol energy s transactions are denominated in us dollars  and  as a result  it does not have material exposure to currency exchange rate risks
