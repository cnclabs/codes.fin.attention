item management s discussion and analysis of results of operations and financial condition introduction since its inception in april  when the company was formed to acquire rj tower corporation  the company s revenues have grown rapidly through internal growth and acquisitions 
since  the company has successfully completed acquisitions and established six joint ventures in china  mexico  korea  japan and the united states 
as a result of these acquisitions and internal growth  the company s revenues have increased from approximately million in to approximately billion in initially  the company s growth came primarily from acquisitions of north american based automotive suppliers  some of which had international operations 
the company succeeded in consolidating a portion of the north american automotive supplier base for structural components and assemblies and established itself as a key supplier of those products 
the company s more recent acquisitions have been intended to strengthen its ability to supply products on a global basis  grow its technology and manufacturing capabilities  and diversify its customer base 
see recent transactions below 
the company s rapid growth through acquisitions coincided with an extended period of increased automotive production that resulted in high levels of utilization of the company s acquired resources and capacity and contributed to periods of strong operating results 
beginning in late  automotive production declined relative to prior periods  leading the company to focus its efforts on reducing the capacity of the enterprise and improving the efficiency of its continuing operations 
these efforts resulted in three significant restructurings  described in more detail below  that reduced excess capacity  eliminated redundant overhead costs  and reorganized the management structure of the company s us and canadian operations 
these efforts also involved the divestiture of certain non core functions  including the sale of the company s heavy truck business  in december  to its joint venture partner  metalsa 
prior to these restructurings  the company did not undertake any significant reductions in the scope of its operations or any capacity rationalizations as a result of or following any of its prior acquisitions 
the company s most recent objective during and has been to reduce indebtedness by maximizing cash flow 
several cash management initiatives  such as extending its accounts payable terms to coincide with prevailing industry practices and accelerating collections from customers have resulted in significant negative working capital levels for the company of million and million as of december  and  respectively 
as a result of these actions  a sale leaseback transaction in april and an equity offering in may  as described in more detail below under liquidity and capital resources  the company was able to reduce its indebtedness in by making net repayments of million 
this debt reduction by the company is incremental to the significant reduction of indebtedness in in which net repayments were million 
the automotive market continues to be highly cyclical and dependent upon consumer spending 
due to the relatively long lead times required to produce many of the company s complex structural components  it may be difficult  in the short term  for the company to obtain new sales to replace any decline in the sales of existing products 
as a result  the company has implemented and continues to pursue the actions necessary to mitigate the effects of any production downturn  focusing on reducing costs  maximizing its cash return on invested capital  reducing debt balances and matching capital expenditures with operating cash flow 
the company s recent growth in europe and asia and with foreign transplant operations in the us has reduced its reliance on ford and daimlerchrysler  increased penetration into certain existing customers and added new customers such as fiat  bmw  volkswagen  nissan  and hyundai kia 
the company expects this trend to continue as a result of its anticipated organic growth outside the us and from recent awards to supply foreign transplant operations in the us recent transactions the company has extended the geographic scope of its manufacturing base through both acquisitions and joint ventures

a rollforward of these reserves is as follows in millions facility payroll shutdown costs related costs loss contracts balance at december  utilization balance at december  utilization revision of estimate balance at december  the timing of facility shutdown and consolidation activities was adjusted from the company s original plans to reflect customer concerns over supply interruption 
as of december   all of the identified facilities have been shutdown  but the company continues to incur ongoing costs related to maintenance  taxes and other items related to buildings that are held for sale 
the company s acquisition reserves have been utilized as originally intended  and management believes the liabilities recorded for shutdown and consolidation activities are adequate  but not excessive as of december  in  the company revised its accrual for estimated loss contracts to reflect the discontinuance of certain contracts that the company was fulfilling at a loss  and the reduction of costs associated with remaining loss contracts which were transferred to lower cost locations as part of the company s restructuring activities 
effects of inflation inflation generally affects the company by increasing the interest expense of floating rate indebtedness and by increasing the cost of labor  equipment and raw materials 
however  because selling prices generally cannot be increased until a model changeover  the effects of inflation must be offset by productivity improvements and volume from new business awards 
market risk the company is exposed to various market risks  including changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates 
market risk is the potential loss arising from adverse changes in market rates and prices  such as foreign currency exchange and interest rates 
the company s policy is to not enter into derivatives or other financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes 
the company periodically enters into financial instruments to manage and reduce the impact of changes in interest rates 
interest rate swaps are entered into as a hedge of underlying debt instruments to change the characteristics of the interest rate from variable to fixed without actually changing the debt instrument 
therefore  these interest rate swap agreements convert outstanding floating rate debt to fixed rate debt for a period of time 
for fixed rate debt  interest rate changes affect the fair market value  but do not impact earnings or cash flows 
conversely for floating rate debt  interest rate changes generally do not affect the fair market value  but do impact future earnings and cash flows  assuming other factors are held constant 
at december   tower automotive had total debt and obligations under capital leases of million 
this debt comprises fixed rate debt of million and floating rate debt of million 
the pre tax earnings and cash flow impact in resulting from a one percentage point increase in interest rates on the company s variable rate debt would be approximately million  holding other variables constant 
a one percentage point increase in interest rates would not materially impact the fair value of the fixed rate debt 
a portion of tower automotive s revenues were derived from manufacturing operations in europe  asia and south america 
the results of operations and financial position of the company s foreign operations are principally measured in its respective currency and translated into us dollars 
the effects of foreign currency fluctuations in europe  asia and south america are somewhat mitigated by the fact that expenses are generally incurred in the same currency in which revenues are generated 
the reported income of these subsidiaries will be higher or lower depending on a weakening or strengthening of the us dollar against the respective foreign currency 
a portion of tower automotive s assets are based in its foreign operations and are translated into us dollars at foreign currency exchange rates in effect as of the end of each period  with the effect of such translation reflected as a separate component of stockholders investment 
accordingly  the company s consolidated stockholders investment will fluctuate depending upon the weakening or strengthening of the us dollar against the respective foreign currency 
the company s strategy for management of currency risk relies primarily upon conducting its operations in a country s respective currency and may  from time to time  also involve hedging programs intended to reduce the company s exposure to currency fluctuations 
management believes the effect of a basis point movement in foreign currency rates versus the dollar would not have materially affected the company s financial position or results of operations for the periods presented 
critical accounting policies the company believes the following represent its critical accounting policies goodwill and impairment of long lived assets during  the company adopted the new rules on accounting for goodwill and other intangible assets under sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
during the second quarter of  the company completed its formal valuation procedures under sfas no 
 utilizing a combination of valuation techniques  including the discounted cash flow approach and the market multiple approach 
as a result of this valuation process as well as the application of the remaining provisions of sfas no 
 the company recorded a transitional impairment loss of million  representing the write off of all of the company s existing goodwill in the reporting units of asia million and south america mexico million 
the company utilized projections of future cash flows for each of its reporting units in determining their fair value for purposes of this analysis 
such amounts are estimates made by management using the best information available at that time 
during  the company recorded goodwill and long lived asset impairment writedown provisions of million  pursuant to restructuring of the company s operations and revised cash flow expectations for the related business units 
other loss reserves the company has other loss reserves such as purchase accounting reserves  restructuring reserves  and loss contract reserves that require the use of estimates and judgment regarding profitability  risk exposure  and ultimate liability 
reserves for loss contracts are estimated by determining which parts are being sold pursuant to loss contracts  their profitability per unit and expected sales volumes over the life of each contract 
other losses are estimated using consistent and appropriate methods  however  changes to the assumptions could materially affect the recorded liabilities for loss 
during  favorable adjustments to the company s loss contract reserves of approximately million were recorded to reflect the discontinuance of certain contracts that the company was fulfilling at a loss  and the reduction of costs associated with remaining loss contracts which were transferred to lower cost locations as part of the company s restructuring activities 
customer tooling and other design costs as indicated in note to the consolidated financial statements  the company incurs costs related to tooling for specific customer programs  which in some instances is owned by the company s customers 
because the company has the contractual right to use such tooling over the life of the supply arrangement with its customers  these tooling costs are capitalized and amortized over the life of the related product 
pension and other post retirement benefits the determination of the obligation and expense for pension and other postretirement benefits is dependent on the selection of certain assumptions used by actuaries in calculating such amounts 
those assumptions are described in note to the consolidated financial statements and include  among others  the discount rate  expected long term rate of return on plan assets  as well as expected increases in compensation and healthcare costs 
in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles  actual results that differ from these assumptions are accumulated and amortized over future periods and  therefore  generally affect the recognized expense and recorded obligation in such future periods 
while the company believes that its current assumptions are appropriate based on available information  significant differences in the actual experience or significant changes in the assumptions may materially affect the pension and other postretirement obligations and the future expense 
the company recorded pension expense excluding special termination benefit costs and curtailment loss of million and million for and  respectively 
the company recorded other post retirement benefit costs of million and million for and  respectively 
these amounts are calculated based on a number of actuarial assumptions  most notably the discount rates used in the calculation of the company s benefit obligations of percent and percent as of the company s september measurement date in and  respectively 
the discount rate used by the company is developed based on consultation with the company s actuary and is predominately based on the moody s aa corporate bond rate as of the last business day of the actual measurement dates 
the company feels that the basis point decrease in its discount rate is warranted based on the expectation that discount rates should move with general economic trends 
the company has used consistent discount rates for its post retirement benefit obligation calculation under sfas with those used for the measurement of its pension benefit liability under sfas the expected rates of return on pension plan assets under sfas of percent and percent as of december  and  respectively  utilized by the company are based on consultation with the company s actuary and represent the company s expected long term rate of return on plan assets 
the rate of return assumptions selected by the company reflect the company s estimate of the average rate of earnings expected on the funds invested or to be invested in order to provide for future participant benefits to be paid out over time 
as part of this estimate of the company s rate of return assumption  the company s actuary contemplated the composition of the company plans actual investment policies  as well as  the expected long term rates of return for the various categories of investment vehicles within the plans 
the company feels that the basis point decrease in its expected return on plan assets is warranted based on the overall downward economic trend in investment returns experienced within the us equity market during the last months and reduced future expectations 
the company expects its pension benefit expense net of any special termination benefit costs or curtailment cost to be approximately million and its other post retirement benefit expense net of any curtailment cost to approximate million 
if the assumption of the discount rate for were basis points lower  the pension benefit expense and other post retirement benefit expense would be increased by million and million  respectively 
if the assumption of the expected rate of return on pension plan assets for were basis points lower  the pension benefit expense would be increased by million

risk factors the company is subject to the following risks relating to its operations and the nature of the industry in which it competes the loss of ford  daimlerchrysler or any other significant customer could have a material adverse effect on existing and future revenues and net income loss revenues from ford and daimlerchrysler represented approximately percent and percent  respectively  of the company s revenues in the contracts with many customers  including ford and daimlerchrysler  provide for supplying the customer s requirements for a particular model  rather than for manufacturing a specific quantity of products 
these contracts range from one year to the life of the model  usually three to ten years  and do not require the purchase by the customer of any minimum number of parts 
therefore  the loss of any one of these customers or a significant reduction in demand for certain key models or a group of related models sold by any major customer could have a material adverse effect on the company s existing and future revenues and net income loss 
during december  the company announced its intention not to pursue the follow on program of the next generation ford explorer frame 
the current ford explorer frame program  expected to run through  is produced at the company s corydon  in facility 
the company s decision was based on the fact that the expected returns at targeted pricing levels did not meet the company s requirements 
the company has mitigated the loss of revenue anticipated when the current explorer program ceases by winning approximately billion in new business  which is expected to launch over the next three years and be in full production by the end of gross margin and profitability will be adversely affected by the inability to reduce costs or increase prices there is substantial continuing pressure from the major oems to reduce costs  including the cost of products purchased from outside suppliers 
in addition  the company s profitability is dependent  in part  on its ability to spread fixed production costs over increasing product sales 
if the company is unable to generate sufficient production cost savings in the future to offset price reductions and any reduction in consumer demand for automobiles resulting in decreased sales  the company s gross margin and profitability would be adversely affected 
in addition  the company s customers often times require engineering  design or production changes 
in some circumstances  the company may not be able to achieve price increases sufficient in amounts to cover the costs of these changes 
cyclicality and seasonality in the automotive market could adversely affect revenues and net income loss the automotive market is highly cyclical and is dependent on consumer spending 
for example  during the third and fourth quarters of  the automotive market began experiencing a decline in production levels 
this decline continued throughout  but production levels increased slightly in economic factors adversely affecting automotive production and consumer spending could adversely impact the company s revenues and net income 
the automotive market is also somewhat seasonal 
the company typically experiences decreased revenue and operating income during the third calendar quarter of each year due to the impact of scheduled oem plant shutdowns in july and august for vacations and new model changeovers 
the company is subject to certain risks associated with foreign operations that could harm revenues and profitability the company has significant international operations  specifically in europe  asia and south america 
certain risks are inherent in international operations  including difficulty in enforcing agreements and collecting receivables through certain foreign legal systems  foreign customers may have longer payment cycles than customers in the united states  tax rates in certain foreign countries may exceed those in the united states  and foreign earnings may be subject to withholding requirements or the imposition of tariffs  exchange controls or other restrictions  general economic and political conditions in countries where the company operates may have an adverse effect on operations in those countries  the company may find it difficult to manage a large organization spread throughout various countries  and required compliance with a variety of foreign laws and regulations 
as the company continues to expand its business globally  its success will depend  in part  on the ability to anticipate and effectively manage these and other risks 
the occurrence of any of the foregoing risks could have a significant effect on the company s international operations and  as a result  its revenues and profitability 
currency exchange rate fluctuations could have an adverse effect on revenues and financial results the company generates a significant portion of its revenues and incurs a significant portion of its expenses in currencies other than us dollars 
to the extent that the company is unable to match revenues received in foreign currencies with costs paid in the same currency  exchange rate fluctuations in any such currency could have an adverse effect on revenues and financial results 
the company s business may be disrupted significantly by work stoppages and other labor matters many oems and their suppliers have unionized work forces 
work stoppages or slow downs experienced by oems or their suppliers could result in slow downs or closures of assembly plants where the company s products are included in assembled vehicles 
for example  strikes by the united auto workers led to the shutdown of most of gm s north american assembly plants in june and july of the company estimates that this work stoppage at gm s facilities had an unfavorable impact of approximately million on its revenues 
in the event that one or more of its customers experiences a material work stoppage  such a work stoppage could have a material adverse effect on the company s business 
in addition  approximately  of the company s colleagues are unionized representing approximately percent of its colleagues as of december  
the company may encounter strikes  further unionization efforts or other types of conflicts with labor unions or the company s colleagues  any of which could have an adverse effect on the company s ability to produce structural components and assemblies or may limit its flexibility in dealing with its workforce 
operating results may be adversely affected by the impact of environmental and safety regulations the company is subject to foreign  federal  state and local laws and regulations governing the protection of the environment and occupational health and safety  including laws regulating the generation  storage  handling  use and transportation of hazardous materials  the emission and discharge of hazardous materials into the soil  ground or air  and the health and safety of its colleagues 
the company is also required to obtain permits from governmental authorities for certain operations 
although the company will make every effort to do so  it cannot assure that it has been or will be at all times in complete compliance with such laws  regulations and permits 
if it violates or fails to comply with these laws  regulations or permits  it could be fined or otherwise sanctioned by regulators 
in some instances  such a fine or sanction could be material 
the company is also subject to laws imposing liability for the cleanup of contaminated property 
under these laws  it could be held liable for costs and damages relating to contamination at its past or present facilities and at third party sites to which these facilities sent wastes containing hazardous substances 
the amount of such liability could be material 
the inability to compete effectively in the highly competitive automotive supply industry could result in the loss of customers  which could have an adverse effect on the company s revenues and operating results the automotive component supply industry is highly competitive 
some of the company s competitors are companies  or divisions or subsidiaries of companies  that are larger than the company and have greater financial and other resources 
in addition  with respect to certain of the company s products  it competes with divisions of its oem customers 
the company s products may not be able to compete successfully with the products of these other companies  which could result in the loss of customers and  as a result  decreased revenues and profitability 
in addition  the company s competitive position in the automotive component supply industry could be adversely affected in the event that it is unsuccessful in making strategic acquisitions or establishing joint ventures that would enable it to expand globally 
the company principally competes for new business both at the beginning of the development of new models and upon the redesign of existing models by its major customers 
new model development generally begins two to five years prior to the marketing of such models to the public 
the failure to obtain new business on new models or to retain or increase business on redesigned existing models could adversely affect the company s business and financial results 
in addition  as a result of the relatively long lead times required for many of its complex structural components  it may be difficult in the short term for the company to obtain new sales to replace any unexpected decline in the sale of existing products 
the company may incur significant expense in preparing to meet anticipated customer requirements which may not be recovered 
actual program volumes and pricing may be less than planned the company incurs costs and makes capital expenditures for new program awards based upon certain estimates of production volumes for certain vehicles 
while the company attempts to establish the price of its products for variances in production volumes  if the actual production of certain vehicle models is significantly less than planned  the company s revenues and net income may be adversely affected 
the company cannot predict its customers demands for the products it supplies either in the aggregate or for particular reporting periods 
for example  the company cannot predict whether or to what extent the expected billion in annual new program revenue  anticipated to be fully realized by  will actually result in firm orders from customers
