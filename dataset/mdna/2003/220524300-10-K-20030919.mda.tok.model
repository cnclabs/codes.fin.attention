item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the audited financial statements and notes related thereto appearing elsewhere herein 
critical accounting policies and management estimates the securities and exchange commission defines critical accounting policies as those that are  in management s view  most important to the portrayal of the company s financial condition and results of operations and most demanding of their judgment 
our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
this process forms the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
revenue recognition our revenue recognition policies are in accordance with the securities and exchange commission s staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition sab 
sab provides guidance in applying accounting principles generally accepted in the united states to revenue recognition issues  and specifically addresses revenue recognition for up front  nonrefundable fees received in connection with research collaboration arrangements 
in accordance with sab  revenues from up front fees from our collaborators are deferred and recorded over the term that we provide ongoing services 
similarly  research support payments are recorded as revenue as we perform the research under the related agreements 
we record grant revenues as we incur expenses related to the grant projects 
all amounts received under collaborative research agreements or research grants are nonrefundable  regardless of the success of the underlying research 
revenues from milestone payments are recognized when earned  as evidenced by written acknowledgment from our collaborator  provided that i the milestone event is substantive and its achievement was not reasonably assured at the inception of the agreement  and ii our performance obligations after the milestone achievement will continue to be funded by our collaborator at a comparable level to that before the milestone achievement 
if both of these criteria are not met  the milestone payment is recognized over the remaining minimum period of our performance obligations under the agreement 
in november  the emerging issues task force eitf of the financial accounting standards board reached consensus on issue eitf issue addresses the accounting for arrangements that may involve the delivery or performance of multiple products  services and or rights to use assets 
specifically  issue requires the recognition of revenue from milestone payments over the remaining minimum period of performance obligations 
as required  we will apply the principles of issue to multiple element agreements that we may enter into after july  the above listing is not intended to be a comprehensive list of all of our accounting policies 
in many cases  the accounting treatment of a particular transaction is specifically dictated by accounting principles generally accepted in the united states  with no need for management s judgment in their application 
there are also areas in which management s judgment in selecting any available alternative would not

results of operations general in october  the company entered into a research collaboration and an exclusive license agreement with les laboratoires servier servier 
the agreement will allow servier to develop and commercialize the company s ampakine technology for the treatment of declines in cognitive performance associated with aging and neurodegenerative diseases 
the indications covered include  but are not limited to  alzheimer s disease  mild cognitive impairment  sexual dysfunction  and the dementia associated with multiple sclerosis and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis 
the agreement with servier includes a nonrefundable up front fee of  and research support payments of  per year for three years subject to cortex providing agreed upon levels of research personnel 
the amount of research support is subject to annual adjustment based upon the increase in the us department of labor s consumer price index 
currently  cortex receives research support of approximately  per year 
the agreement also includes potential milestone payments  plus royalty payments on sales in licensed territories 
in october  servier agreed to provide cortex with  of additional research support  in exchange for rights to our ampakine compounds for the potential treatment of anxiety disorders  in servier s licensed territories 
the  will be paid in quarterly installments of  over a two year period  beginning in october in january  the company entered into a research collaboration and exclusive worldwide license agreement with nv organon organon  a pharmaceutical business unit of akzo nobel 
the agreement will allow organon to develop and commercialize the company s proprietary ampakine technology for the treatment of schizophrenia and depression 
in connection with the agreement  the company received a  up front licensing payment and research support payments of approximately  per year for two years 
the agreement with organon also includes milestone payments based upon clinical development  plus royalty payments on worldwide sales 
cortex achieved its first milestone under the agreement in may  when organon selected a candidate compound to pursue in phase i clinical testing as a treatment for schizophrenia 
achieving this milestone triggered a  payment from organon  which cortex recorded as revenue upon achievement 
cortex achieved its second milestone under the agreement in september  when organon elected to continue development of the selected compound in phase ii clinical testing 
achieving the second milestone triggered another  payment from organon  with the related revenue recorded upon achievement of the milestone 
from inception february  through june   the company sustained losses aggregating  due to projected fluctuations in funding  continuing losses are likely over the next several years  as the company s ongoing operating expenses will only be offset  if at all  by research support payments and possible milestone payments from its research collaborations with servier and organon  or under planned strategic alliances that the company is seeking with other pharmaceutical companies for the clinical development  manufacturing and marketing of its products 
the nature and timing of payments to cortex under the servier and organon agreements or other planned strategic alliances  if and when entered into  are likely to significantly affect the company s operations and financing activities and 
table of contents to produce substantial period to period fluctuations in reported financial results 
over the longer term  the company will require successful commercial development of its products by servier  organon  or its other prospective partners to attain sustained profitable operations from royalties or other product based revenues 
the company believes that inflation and changing prices have not had a material impact on its ongoing operations to date 
fiscal years ended june  and for the year ended june   the company s net loss of  compared to a net loss of  for the prior year  with the increased net loss primarily attributable to the timing of revenues from the company s collaborative agreements 
revenues for the year ended june  decreased from  to  or by compared to the prior year  with a net increase in research and licensing revenue from the agreement with servier of  but a decrease in revenues from the agreement with organon of  for the year ended june   revenues included  related to the amendment to the servier agreement signed in october that amendment granted servier rights to the company s ampakine technology in the field of anxiety disorders  in servier s licensed territories 
in exchange for those rights  cortex will receive  of research funding from servier  paid as  per quarter over a two year period 
with the amendment to the agreement  cortex extended the period that it amortizes revenues from servier s earlier up front fee 
under the original october agreement  cortex received a  licensing fee from servier  which cortex was recording as revenue over that agreement s three year collaborative research phase 
after amending the agreement in october  cortex began amortizing the remaining unearned licensing revenues over the two year period of the extended research support 
compared to the prior year  licensing revenues for the year ended june  decreased by  as a result of this change 
revenues for fiscal year included a  milestone payment from the agreement with organon  the company s other collaborative partner 
organon triggered this milestone in september when it elected to continue its development of an ampakine compound by entering phase ii studies for schizophrenia 
cortex recorded the revenue from this milestone upon achievement as the company has no ongoing obligations under the related agreement 
research and development expenses for the year ended june  decreased to  or by compared to the prior fiscal year 
the decrease resulted from charges incurred in the prior year for the phase ii clinical study in mci being conducted with servier 
in connection with the mci study  in january the company sponsored a meeting of the clinical investigators participating in the trial 
nearly all other costs for this study were borne by servier 
the decrease for the current year also reflected decreased personnel related expenses of  from comparatively lower staffing levels and a resultant decrease of  in spending for animals and laboratory supplies 
in addition  prior year research and development expenses included technology access payments related to the organon milestone 
cortex licenses the ampakine technology from the university of california 
under the related agreement  cortex is required to remit a portion of certain remuneration received in connection with sublicensing agreements 
in september  when cortex achieved its milestone under its agreement with organon  a technology access payment to the university of california became due 
general and administrative expenses for the year ended june  increased to  or by compared to the prior year  primarily due to severance costs to the company s former president and chief executive officer 

table of contents net interest income for the year ended june  decreased to  or by compared to the prior year  due to a decrease in cash available for investing 
fiscal years ended june  and for the year ended june   the company s net loss of  compared to a net loss of  for the prior year 
the difference primarily represented increased research and licensing revenues 
revenues for the year ended june  increased from  to  or by compared to the prior year and included a full year of research and licensing revenues from the october agreement with servier 
under the related agreement  cortex receives approximately  of research support per year for a minimum of three years subject to cortex providing agreed upon levels of research  beginning in december in addition  cortex received an up front payment of  from servier  which it is recording as revenue ratably over the agreement s collaborative research phase

research and development expenses increased to  or by  during the year ended june  compared to the prior year 
the increase included expenses for a meeting of principal investigators for the phase ii clinical study of the ampakine cx in patients with mild cognitive impairment 
the cross national study  conducted in collaboration with servier  commenced enrollment in march servier has agreed to support the bulk of the costs for this study 
research and development expenses for the year ended june  also included technology access payments related to the organon milestone achieved in september  as explained more fully in the comparison of the fiscal years ending june  and june   above 
general and administrative expenses of  for the year ended june  were materially consistent with those from the prior year 
for the year ended june   the company recorded a charge of  to reflect the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle related to the required adoption of sab issued by the securities and exchange commission  sab required the company to change its accounting method for the up front payment received from the agreement with organon in instead of recording the revenue from the organon up front payment when it was received  under sab the company restated the revenue ratably over the agreement s two year contract period 
with the recorded cumulative effect of the change in accounting principle of  restating revenues by  had no impact on the net loss or net loss per share for the year ended june  results for years prior to the year ended june  were not restated 
liquidity and capital resources under the agreement signed with servier in october and amended in october  to date cortex has received research and licensing payments of  of this amount  cortex received  during the year ended june  the october agreement provides research support of approximately  per year for three years ending in early december  subject to annual 
table of contents adjustment based on the us department of labor s consumer price index 
beginning in october  servier has agreed to provide an additional  of research support to cortex  to be paid in quarterly installments of  over a two year period 
the agreement also includes milestone payments based upon successful clinical development and royalties on sales in licensed territories 
research and licensing payments received in connection with the agreement with organon totaled  through june  of this amount  cortex received  during the year ended june   representing the second milestone from the organon agreement 
the milestone was triggered in september  when organon elected to continue development of an ampakine compound by entering phase ii clinical testing 
under the terms of the agreement  cortex may receive additional milestone payments based on clinical development of the licensed technology and ultimately  royalties on worldwide sales 
in october  cortex received notice of a phase ii small business innovative research sbir award from the national institutes of health 
the award  as extended  will provide up to  over a four year period and will partially offset the company s expenses in researching its ampakine compounds as a potential new therapy for stroke 
as of june   cortex had received approximately  related to this grant award 
in september  the company received notice of a second phase ii sbir award from the national institutes of health 
this award  as extended  will provide up to  over a three year period  which will allow cortex to follow up on previously reported studies of the ampakine cx as a combination therapy for schizophrenia 
earlier tests were encouraging  with ampakine treated patients showing improvement in a number of clinical and neurocognitive scores 
as of june   cortex had received approximately  from this grant award 
in august  the company completed a private placement to accredited investors of an aggregate of  shares of its common stock at per share and five year warrants to purchase up to an additional aggregate of  shares at an exercise price of per share 
the company received approximately  in net proceeds from the private placement 
the warrants are subject to a call right in favor of the company to the extent that the closing price of the company s common stock exceeds per share for any thirteen consecutive trading day period following the second anniversary of the date that the registration statement to be filed pursuant to the terms of the private placement is first declared effective by the securities and exchange commission 
if the warrants are fully exercised  of which there can be no assurance  these warrants would provide approximately  of additional capital 
cash proceeds prior to the company s private placement of its common stock  as of june  the company had cash and cash equivalents totaling  and a working capital deficit of  as of june   the company had cash and cash equivalents of  and a working capital deficit of  the decrease in cash as of june  reflected amounts required to fund operations 
for both periods  working capital included unearned revenue relating to the company s  nonrefundable  up front payment from the october agreement with servier 
in accordance with sab  the company is recording the revenue related to the up front payment ratably over the agreement s collaborative research phase that ends  as extended in october current liabilities as of june  and included  and  respectively  of unearned revenues from the non refundable servier up front fee 
in addition  as of june  and  unearned revenues included  and  respectively  for quarterly research support from servier  paid in advance 
the increase in these unearned 
table of contents revenues as of june  reflects  of additional research support under the amendment to the servier agreement in october current liabilities as of june  and june  also included approximately  for the advance from the institute for the study of aging the institute 
this advance is being utilized to offset the company s limited expenses related to the cross national phase ii study in mci being conducted with servier 
according to the agreed upon terms  repayment of the advance shall be forgiven unless the company enters phase iii clinical testing for alzheimer s disease 
in the event that the company enters such clinical trials with one of its ampakine compounds  the company believes that sufficient resources would become available under its partnering agreements to permit repayment of the advance 
commitments the company leases approximately  square feet of research laboratory  office and expansion space under an operating lease that expires may  the commitments under the lease agreement for the years ending june  are  the company is evaluating whether to seek to renew its current lease agreement or to pursue other leasing opportunities 
from inception february  through june   expenditures for furniture  equipment and leasehold improvements aggregated  the company is committed to  for sponsored research and other remuneration to academic institutions  all of which is payable over the next months 
as of june   the company was committed to severance payments to its former chief executive officer in the aggregate amount of  which payments were made in semi monthly installments through mid august together with its corporate partner  servier  the company is conducting a cross national clinical study with the ampakine cx in patients with mild cognitive impairment mci 
enrollment in the trial began in march and concluded in june preliminary results are expected in the fall of servier has agreed to incur the bulk of the related costs for the study 
remaining cortex commitments for phase i iia clinical studies on the ampakine compounds are not significant 
in june  the company received  from the institute  which will partially offset the company s costs for the testing in patients with mci 
given that cortex must use the funding from the institute solely for clinical trials  the company has recorded the amounts received as restricted cash in its balance sheet 
provided that cortex complies with the conditions of the funding agreement  including the restricted use of the amounts received  repayment of the advance shall not be required unless cortex enters an ampakine compound into phase iii clinical trials for alzheimer s disease 
upon such potential clinical trials  repayment would include interest computed at a rate equal to one half of the prime lending rate 
in lieu of cash  in the event of repayment the institute may elect to receive the balance of outstanding principal and accrued interest as shares of cortex common stock 
the conversion price for such form of repayment shall initially equal per share  subject to adjustment under certain circumstances 
staffing as of june   cortex had employees 
neither significant investments in plant or equipment nor increases to staffing levels are contemplated under current spending plans for the upcoming fiscal year 
outlook cortex anticipates that its cash and cash equivalents  scheduled research support payments from its agreements with servier and the approximately  net proceeds from the august private placement of the company s common stock will be sufficient to satisfy the company s capital requirements into fiscal year additional funds will be required to continue operations beyond that time 
cortex may receive additional milestone payments from the organon and servier agreements  but 
table of contents there is no assurance that the company will receive such milestone payments within the desired timeframe  or at all 
see risk factors if we cannot raise capital on acceptable terms  we may need to significantly curtail our operations 
in order to provide for both its immediate and longer term spending requirements  the company is presently seeking collaborative or other arrangements with larger pharmaceutical companies 
under these agreements  it is intended that such companies would provide additional capital to the company in exchange for exclusive or non exclusive license or other rights to certain of the technologies and products the company is developing 
competition for such arrangements is intense  however  with a large number of biopharmaceutical companies attempting to secure alliances with more established pharmaceutical companies 
although the company has been engaged in discussions with candidate companies  there is no assurance that an agreement or agreements will arise from these discussions in a timely manner  or at all  or that revenues that may be generated thereby will offset operating expenses sufficiently to reduce the company s short and longer term funding requirements 
because there is no assurance that the company will secure additional corporate partnerships  the company may raise additional capital through the sale of debt or equity securities 
there is no assurance that funds will be available on favorable terms  or at all 
if equity securities are issued to raise additional funds  dilution to existing stockholders may result 
the company s proposed products are in the preclinical or early clinical stage of development and will require significant further research  development  clinical testing and regulatory clearances 
they are subject to the risks of failure inherent in the development of products based on innovative technologies 
these risks include the possibilities that any or all of the proposed products will be found to be ineffective or unsafe  or otherwise fail to receive necessary regulatory clearances  that the proposed products  although effective  will be uneconomical to market  that third parties may now or in the future hold proprietary rights that preclude the company from marketing them  or that third parties will market superior or equivalent products 
accordingly  the company is unable to predict whether its research and development activities will result in any commercially viable products or applications 
further  due to the extended testing and regulatory review process required before marketing clearance can be obtained  the company does not expect to be able to commercialize any therapeutic drug for at least five years  either directly or through its prospective corporate partners or licensees 
there can be no assurance that the company s proposed products will prove to be safe or effective or receive regulatory approvals that are required for commercial sale

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company is exposed to certain market risks associated with interest rate fluctuations on its marketable securities and borrowing arrangement 
all investments in marketable securities are entered into for purposes other than trading 
the company is not subject to risks from currency rate fluctuations as it does not typically conduct transactions in foreign currencies 
in addition  the company does not utilize hedging contracts or similar instruments 
the company s exposure to interest rate risk arises from financial instruments entered into in the normal course of business 
certain of the company s financial instruments are fixed rate  short term investments in government and corporate notes and bonds  which are available for sale and have been marked to market in the accompanying financial statements 
changes in interest rates generally affect the fair value of the investments  however  because these financial instruments are considered available for sale  all such changes are reflected in the financial statements in the period affected 
the company manages interest rate risk on its investment portfolio by matching scheduled investment maturities with its cash requirements 
due to the timing of these maturities  as of june   the company s investment portfolio did not include any short term investments 

table of contents the company s borrowing consists solely of its advance from the institute  which is subject to potential repayment in the event that cortex enters an ampakine compound into phase iii clinical testing as a potential treatment for alzheimer s disease 
potential repayment would include interest accruing at a discount to the prime lending rate 
changes in interest rates generally affect the fair value of such debt  but  based upon historical activity  such changes are not expected to have a material impact on earnings or cash flows 
as of june   the principal and accrued interest of the advance amounted to
