item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the financial statements of the company and the notes thereto appearing elsewhere in this annual report 
set forth below is summary consolidated information of the company for the years ended december   and year ended december  millions of dollars income statement data net sales   cost of products sold   cost of products sold write down of inventories gross profit selling  general and administrative expenses restructuring and other unusual charges income loss from operations other expense net income loss from continuing operations income loss from discontinued operations extraordinary item net income loss results of operations overview during  the markets served by the company  and the price of certain key metals used by the company  weakened in comparison to prior year levels  reflecting the overall softness in the global economy 
several key markets served by the base metal chemistry segment were particularly weak  which has also depressed the price of cobalt for an extended period of time 
accordingly  at september   the company recorded a charge to adjust its inventories to the lower of cost or market  based primarily upon management s revised expectation that the price of cobalt would remain depressed throughout and the strategic decision to begin liquidating on hand inventories during the fourth quarter 
further  during the fourth quarter of  the company recorded restructuring and other unusual charges related to its continuing operations of million 
the primary objectives of the restructuring plan are to de leverage the balance sheet  focus on cash generation and create efficiencies within the organization as a result of deterioration in certain of the company s businesses  primarily due to the sustained decline in the market price of cobalt and its impact on profitability 
specific actions taken to date to accomplish these objectives include development of plans to sell certain non core businesses  closure of certain non core facilities  headcount reductions of approximately positions worldwide  review and renegotiation of certain raw material and other contracts to reduce costs in light of changing metal prices and business conditions  liquidation of certain inventories in the fourth quarter to generate cash  reduction of base metal inventory levels and production  and a re alignment of the management team 
the company will incur additional charges related to this program in the first quarter of as these actions are completed 
in connection with the restructuring plan  certain businesses previously associated with the base metal chemistry segment were identified as discontinued operations 
the company plans on selling the copper powders business scm located in research triangle park  north carolina and johnstown  pennsylvania 
the sale of this business is expected to be completed by june  in addition  manufacturing facilities in st 
george  utah tungsten reclamation cobalt recycling  midland  michigan tungsten carbide fine powders and newark  new jersey electroless nickel have been closed or discontinued 
these operations have been presented as discontinued operations for all periods presented 
the results for discontinued operations include a charge of million associated with the planned disposal of these assets 
compared to continuing operations net sales for were billion compared to billion in primarily due to the acquisition of dmc in august  higher physical volumes in the base metal chemistry segment and an increase in the company s nickel product sales prices due to higher nickel market prices  all partially offset by a decline in the company s cobalt product sales prices due to lower cobalt market prices 
during  the company recorded restructuring charges related to inventories of million as a result of decisions made in the fourth quarter to exit certain product lines  decrease production throughput at several base metal facilities  and the sale of a higher percentage of certain commodity products to generate cash 
these charges are included in cost of products sold in the statement of consolidated operations 
at september   the company recorded a non cash charge of million to write down inventories to the lower of cost or market in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles 
the charge was taken due to the following factors based upon the sustained low level of cobalt market pricing  the company s outlook for the market price of cobalt changed from a range of per pound by the end of  to a range of per pound through  the decision to reduce cobalt production in the fourth quarter of  which was driven in part by a major supplier s announcement in late october that they would shut down their cobalt mine indefinitely  and the company s corresponding decision to start liquidating cobalt inventories to generate cash 
before the inventory charges  gross profit increased to million in  a increase from the increase in gross profit was primarily the result of the full year impact of the results of dmc in compared to five months in  and a million reduction in raw material costs in the base metal segment due to price concessions from a supplier and settlement of issues related to the purchase of outokumpu nickel oy in these positive factors were partially offset by the negative impact of the low cobalt market price  and a related shift in product mix to a higher percentage of commodity cobalt products with lower profitability 
during  the sale of certain commodity cobalt products generated losses 
cost of products sold increased to of net sales for the year ended from of net sales in as a result of the acquisition of dmc with its high cost of precious metals relative to revenues  as well as the deterioration in profitability of the cobalt business due to lower market prices and shift in product mix 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased to million in from million in  resulting primarily from the dmc acquisition and general increases in administrative costs due to the company s growth 
however  during  selling  general and administrative expenses decreased to of net sales compared to in due to the impact of the precious metals business with its proportionately lower expenses compared to revenues 
during  the company recorded restructuring and other unusual charges of million 
these charges primarily related to headcount reductions  costs associated with plant closings and asset write downs  including goodwill impairment 
other expense net was million in compared to million in due primarily to increased interest expense associated with the additional debt to finance the dmc acquisition 
before total unusual charges of million million after tax  or per diluted share  income taxes as a percentage of income before income taxes increased to in from in the higher effective tax rate was due primarily to losses in the united states with no corresponding tax benefit 
the company s overall tax rate reflects the relatively low statutory tax rate in finland  and the benefit of tax holidays in malaysia  brazil and south africa 
the extraordinary item of million in is the after tax write off of fees due to the retirement in december of the bridge loan used to finance the acquisition of dmc net loss for was million compared to net income of million in  primarily due to the aforementioned factors 
base metal chemistry segment the base metal chemistry segment includes the cobalt  nickel and other base metal chemistry manufacturing businesses  which comprised the historical businesses of the company prior to the acquisition of dmc  excluding the copper powders and other businesses now classified as discontinued operations 
the following information summarizes market prices of the primary raw materials used by the base metal chemistry segment market price ranges per pound year ended december  cobalt grade to to nickel to to copper to to the following information summarizes the physical volumes of products sold by continuing operations of the base metal chemistry segment percentage change products sold millions of pounds organics inorganics powders metals total before restructuring and other unusual charges of million  operating profit for the year ended december  was million compared to million in the decline was primarily the result of the negative impact of the low cobalt market price  which principally impacts the refining aspects of the base metal business  and a related shift in product mix to a higher percentage of commodity cobalt products with low profitability 
the decline was also due to higher costs related to the company s nickel operations 
in addition  sales of certain commodity products in resulted in operating losses at the then current market price 
this negative impact was partially offset by a million reduction in raw material costs due to price concessions from a supplier and settlement of issues related to the purchase of outokumpu nickel oy in net sales were million  an increase of 
this increase resulted principally from the overall increase in physical sales volumes of and higher selling prices for nickel products due to the increase in the nickel market price compared to this increase was partially offset by lower selling prices for cobalt products due to the decline in the cobalt market price compared to the same period in precious metal chemistry segment the precious metal chemistry segment includes the platinum group and other precious metals manufacturing businesses that were acquired in the dmc acquisition in august this segment develops  produces and markets a variety of products  predominantly from platinum group metals such as platinum  palladium  rhodium  and other precious metals such as gold and silver 
this segment also offers a variety of refining and processing services to users of precious metals 
the primary contributor to the profitability of this segment is the company s automotive catalyst business 
before restructuring charges of million  operating profit for the year ended december  was million  compared to million in the increase is due to a full year contribution of this segment in compared to five months in  increased profitability in the autocatalyst business and the impact of the strengthening euro against the us dollar 
net sales were billion in compared to million in  due to a full year contribution of this segment in compared to five months in metal management segment the metal management segment also was acquired in the dmc acquisition 
this segment serves as a metal sourcing operation for the company s other segments and non affiliated customers  primarily procuring platinum group metals  and other precious metals such as gold and silver 
metal management centrally manages metal purchases and sales by providing the necessary precious metal liquidity  financing and hedging for the company s other businesses 
operating profit for the year ended december  was million  compared to million for the five month period in on a comparative basis considering the august acquisition  the decline in operating profit is due primarily to the decision to allocate less capital to this unit for trading activities  increased general and administrative costs and generally lower volatility of precious metal prices during compared to the period 
net sales were billion in compared to billion in  due primarily to a full year contribution of this segment in compared to five months in compared to continuing operations the year was a transition year for the company given that in august it acquired dmc  a company substantially larger than itself in terms of sales  facilities  and personnel 
the strong performance of dmc s auto catalyst and metal management businesses  particularly in europe  offset weakness in the company s base metal business compared to in the second half of the year 
net sales for were billion compared to million in primarily due to the acquisition of dmc  partially offset by a decline in the company s base metal chemistry segment due to weak global economic conditions and lower metal prices 
gross profit increased to million in  a increase from the increase in gross profit was primarily the result of the acquisition of dmc  partially offset by a decline in the company s base metal chemistry segment due to weak global economic conditions and lower metal prices 
cost of products sold increased to of net sales for the year ended from of net sales in as a result of the acquisition of dmc with its high cost of precious metals relative to revenues 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased by million in to million  resulting primarily from the dmc acquisition and general increases in administrative costs due to the company s growth 
selling  general and administrative expenses also includes million of expense for closure costs of the ezanville  france carboxylate plant 
other expense net was million in compared to million in due primarily to increased interest expense on higher outstanding borrowings  primarily as a result of the dmc acquisition 
income taxes as a percentage of income before income taxes decreased to in from in the lower effective tax rate was due primarily to a tax holiday in brazil and south africa  related to businesses purchased as part of the dmc acquisition 
the extraordinary item of million in is the after tax write off of fees due to the retirement in december of the bridge loan used to finance the acquisition of dmc net income for was million  an increase of million from  primarily due to the aforementioned factors 
base metal chemistry segment the base metal chemistry segment includes the cobalt  nickel and other base metal chemistry manufacturing businesses  which comprised the historical businesses of the company prior to the acquisition of dmc  excluding the copper powders and other businesses now classified as discontinued operations 
the following information summarizes market prices of the primary raw materials used by the base metal chemistry segment market price ranges per pound year ended december  cobalt grade to to nickel to to copper to to the following information summarizes the physical volumes of products sold by continuing operations of the base metal chemistry segment percentage change products sold millions of pounds organics inorganics powders metals total operating profit for the year ended december  was million compared to million in the negative effects of global economic weakness across many industries and lower metal prices resulting in lower cobalt refinery profits were partially offset by the full impact in of the results of the harjavalta nickel refinery  which was acquired in april net sales were million  a decline of  resulting principally from lower prices  as cobalt  nickel and copper raw material market prices decreased compared to the same period in physical sales volumes were up overall by due to the full year impact of the harjavalta nickel refinery operations 
precious metal chemistry segment the precious metal chemistry segment includes the platinum group and other precious metals manufacturing businesses that were acquired in the dmc acquisition the results of operations exclude the businesses divested in september 
this segment develops  produces and markets a variety of products  predominantly from platinum group metals such as platinum  palladium  rhodium  and other precious metals such as gold and silver 
the primary contributor to the profitability of this segment is the company s automotive catalyst business 
net sales  subsequent to the date of the acquisition  were million and were positively impacted by strong sales of auto catalysts in europe 
operating profit for that period was million 
metal management segment the metal management segment also was acquired in the dmc acquisition 
this segment serves as a metal sourcing operation for both the company s other segments and nonaffiliated customers  primarily procuring platinum group metals such as platinum  palladium  rhodium  and other precious metals such as gold and silver 
metal management centrally manages metal purchases and sales by providing the necessary precious metal liquidity  financing and hedging for the company s other businesses 
net sales  subsequent to the date of the acquisition  were billion 
operating profit was million for that period and was positively affected by the higher volatility of precious metal pricing at certain times during that period 
liquidity and capital resources during december  in connection with its restructuring program  the company amended its senior credit facilities  which were previously amended in june the amended facilities consist of a million senior secured revolving facility including a million letter of credit sublimit and million of term loans 
utilization of the last million of the revolving facility requires approval of two thirds of the lending group 
the revolving facility and the term loans bear interest at a rate of libor plus and mature on april   with a libor floor of 
unless net proceeds from asset sales are greater than million  the applicable interest rate margin will increase by an additional basis points at june   and by an additional basis points each subsequent quarter thereafter through and including december  in addition  the interest rate margin will increase an incremental basis points if  by march   the company has not entered into a letter of intent for asset sales which would yield net proceeds of at least million 
the amendment requires the company to generate a minimum amount of gross proceeds from assets sales or additional equity offerings of million by june  and additional net proceeds of million by december  the amendment prohibits payment of dividends and acquisitions of businesses  and modifies certain financial covenants in the prior agreement to make them less restrictive 
during the fourth quarter of  the company recorded restructuring charges of million pertaining to continuing and discontinued operations and other unusual charges of million to improve cash flow and profitability  and strengthen the balance sheet primarily through reducing operating costs  closing unprofitable operations  selling non core assets  reducing capital expenditures  and re aligning the management team 
these charges principally related to workforce reductions  plant closings  and asset write downs  including goodwill 
the cash portion of the restructuring charges is estimated to be approximately million  with approximately million paid out in  million to be paid in and million thereafter 
the company expects that additional charges of million related to this program will be taken in the first quarter of as these actions are completed 
during april  the company completed the registration of a million offering of senior subordinated notes due  originally issued on december  pursuant to rule a of the securities act of the company s credit facilities include covenants that require the company to reduce its debt in relation to total capital  and its debt in relation to earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization 
the company is in compliance with its debt covenants at december  and believes that it will have sufficient cash generated by operations and from divestitures to meet future covenant requirements through december  if the company is unable to generate sufficient cash from operations and divestitures during  the company may be in default of its credit facilities  and the bank group may choose not to provide additional funding to the company under the credit facilities 
if that were the case  the company might not have sufficient capital to meet the needs of the business 
under the existing credit agreements  certain financial covenants become more stringent each quarter  with the most stringent covenants applicable in the first quarter of unless the company s results of operations substantially improve during the next twelve months compared to the second half of  the company may need to renegotiate these covenants prior to march  cash provided by operations and through its credit facilities should also be sufficient to provide for future working capital and capital expenditure requirements 
subject to several limitations in its credit facilities  the company may incur additional borrowings to finance working capital and certain capital expenditures  including  without limitation  the purchase of additional raw materials 
in november  the company s board of directors voted to suspend the quarterly cash dividend indefinitely 
the company enters into precious metal leases primarily gold and silver that are consignment inventory arrangements under which banks provide the company with precious metals for a specified period for which the company pays a lease fee 
during the fourth quarter of  certain metal lease lines were cancelled  in january  a portion of these lease lines were restored 
the company also leases out metals under similar arrangements to customers 
the amounts of metal leases in and metal leases out at december were million and million for and million and million for  respectively 
balance sheet review during  net working capital decreased due primarily to a reduction in inventory values associated with lower of cost or market and restructuring charges 
excluding the impact of these unusual charges  the company s net working capital increased by approximately million during this increase was primarily the result of the following an increase in precious metal inventories of approximately million due principally to the following factors increases in on hand precious metal quantities  an increase in the market price of gold and platinum  which more than offset decreased prices for palladium and rhodium  cancellation of certain precious metal lease lines by financial institutions  which necessitated the purchase of additional metals to operate the business  and the impact of the strengthening euro against the us dollar during the increases for the precious metals business more than offset declining inventories at the company s base metal chemistry facilities  as a result of the company s stated objectives to decrease cobalt and nickel inventories during the fourth quarter of to raise cash and improve working capital 
actual reductions achieved in were approximately  tons of cobalt and  tons of nickel inventory 
an increase in accounts receivable of approximately million  due principally to increased sales in the fourth quarter of compared to the fourth quarter of a decrease from the sale of marketable securities of million during  the proceeds of which were used to repay outstanding long term indebtedness 
capital expenditures were million in compared to million in expenditures were primarily related to the construction of a nickel salts plant in finland and capacity expansions at various precious metal chemistry locations 
these capital expenditures were funded primarily through borrowings under the company s revolving credit facility 
property  plant and equipment remained flat at million during  due primarily to capital expenditures and the impact of the strengthening euro against the us dollar during  offset by decreases due to depreciation expense and the finalization of the dmc purchase price  which resulted in negative goodwill and a corresponding reduction in long term assets primarily property  plant and equipment 
the company anticipates that capital spending will approximate million in long term debt excluding current portion decreased to billion in compared to billion in  due primarily to the company s secondary equity offering of million shares of common stock in january  the net proceeds million of which were used to repay outstanding indebtedness under the company s credit facilities 
this repayment was partially offset by additional borrowing to fund certain needs of the business during  primarily related to capital expenditures and the purchase of raw materials 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company  as a result of its global operating and financial activities  is exposed to changes in metal prices  interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates which may adversely affect its results of operations and financial position 
in seeking to minimize the risks and or costs associated with such activities  the company manages exposures to changes in metal prices  interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates through its regular operating and financing activities  which include the use of derivative instruments 
the primary raw materials used by the company in manufacturing its products are cobalt  nickel  copper  platinum  palladium  rhodium  gold and silver 
the company s supply of cobalt historically has been sourced primarily from the democratic republic of congo drc  australia  finland and zambia 
although the company has never experienced a significant shortage of cobalt raw material  production problems and political and civil instability in certain supplier countries may in the future affect their supply and market price 
nickel historically has been sourced primarily from australia and brazil 
the company currently has supply arrangements in place for approximately of its projected nickel raw material needs for and platinum group metals historically have been sourced from south africa and  to a lesser extent  from russia and canada 
copper  gold and silver are worldwide commodities with diverse supply sources 
the company does not anticipate any substantial interruption in its raw materials supply that would have a material adverse effect on the company s operations 
if a substantial interruption should occur in supply from a primary source  there is no assurance that the company would be able to obtain as much from other sources as would be necessary to satisfy the company s requirements or at prices comparable to its current arrangements 
the company is exposed to risks of metal price fluctuations with respect to its metal inventory and with respect to metal trading activities 
the company s metal inventories are partially protected from metal price fluctuations by pricing agreements with customers or  if necessary  by economically hedging this exposure through derivative financial instruments  such as forward and futures contracts 
all of the company s metal trading activities are carried out pursuant to defined exposure limits set by management 
the company also attempts to mitigate changes in prices and availability by maintaining adequate inventories and long term supply relationships with a variety of producers 
the cost of raw materials fluctuates due to both actual and perceived changes in supply and demand 
generally  the company is able to pass through to its customer s increases and decreases in raw material prices by increasing or decreasing  respectively  the prices of its products 
the degree of profitability of the company principally depends on the company s ability to maintain the differential between its product prices and product costs  which principally impacts the refining aspects of the base metal business 
substantial  sustained reductions in the price of raw materials could also result in the company s inventory carrying value being written down to a lower market value 
the company is exposed to interest rate risk primarily through its borrowing activities 
the company predominantly utilizes us dollar denominated borrowings to fund its working capital and investment needs 
the majority of the company s borrowings are in variable rate instruments 
the company enters into interest rate swap agreements to convert a portion of the variable rate instruments to fixed rate contracts over typically a three year period 
there is an inherent rollover risk for borrowings as they mature and are renewed at current market rates 
the extent of this risk is not quantifiable or predictable because of the variability of future interest rates and business financing requirements see note g 
the following table presents principal cash flows and related weighted average interest rates by expected maturity dates of the company s long term debt 
expected maturity date december  there fair after total value thousands of dollars long term debt  including current portion fixed rate    average interest rate variable rate       average interest rate expected maturity date december  there fair after total value thousands of dollars long term debt  including current portion fixed rate    average interest rate variable rate         average interest rate in addition to the united states  the company has manufacturing and other facilities in africa  canada  europe and asia pacific  and markets its products worldwide 
although most of the company s raw material purchases and product sales are based on the us dollar  prices of certain raw materials  liabilities for non us operating expenses and income taxes are denominated in local currencies 
as such  in periods when certain currencies particularly the euro strengthen against the us dollar  the company s results of operations are negatively impacted 
in addition  fluctuations in exchange rates may affect product demand and may adversely affect the profitability in us dollars of products and services provided by the company in foreign markets where payments for our products and services are made in the local currency 
accordingly  fluctuations in currency prices may affect the company s operating results and net income 
the acquisition of the operations of dmc increased our exposure to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates  primarily the euro 
in order to partially hedge the company s balance sheet and transaction exposure to fluctuating rates  the company enters into forward contracts to purchase and sell various currencies 
such transactions cannot  however  eliminate all of the risks associated with currency fluctuations 
critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires the company s management to make estimates and assumptions in certain circumstances that affect amounts reported in the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
in preparing these financial statements  management has made their best estimates and judgments of certain amounts included in the financial statements related to the critical accounting policies described below 
the application of these critical accounting policies involves the exercise of judgment and use of assumptions as to future uncertainties and  as a result  actual results could differ from these estimates 
revenue recognition revenues are recognized when unaffiliated customers take title and assume ownership of products specified in their purchase agreements with the company 
within the base metal and precious metal chemistry segments  revenue recognition generally occurs upon shipment of product or usage of consignment inventories 
metal management segment revenues are recognized upon shipment of product or usage of consignment inventory in the case of sales contracts  upon transfer of title under brokerage account transactions  and as earned over the lives of the respective contracts in the case of leasing arrangements 
sales and cost of products sold include the metal content of the product sold to customers if the metal has been supplied by the company 
also included are purchases and sales of metal to third parties by the metal management segment whether or not the metal has been processed into a product 
if a customer supplies the metal for processing  the metal content is not included in sales or cost of products sold 
in october  the emerging issues task force of the financial accounting standards board finalized issue no 
 which requires all gains and losses realized and unrealized on all derivative contracts for trading purposes to be presented on a net basis in the income statement 
the company has recorded certain metal trading activities on a gross basis  as is currently acceptable under generally accepted accounting principles 
this consensus  which will be effective for the company beginning january   will have no impact on gross profit or income from operations 
inventories the company s inventories are principally stated at the lower of cost or market and valued using the last in  first out lifo method except for precious metals trading inventory  which is carried at the current monetary value 
the company uses the lifo method to better match the price it currently pays for its metal raw material with the selling prices it currently charges for its products 
the balance sheet amounts of inventory reflect the quantities of metal in inventory  valued at purchased metal prices in the year lifo was adopted and any subsequent year in which there was an incremental increase in quantities 
in periods of sustained and significant raw material metal price declines  the calculated lifo inventory value may exceed the amount the company could realize on sale 
in this case  the company would record a lower of cost or market adjustment 
during  the company recorded a non cash charge of million to write down inventories to the lower of cost or market in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles 
the charge was taken due to the following factors based upon the sustained low level of cobalt market pricing  the company s outlook for the market price of cobalt changed from a range of per pound by the end of  to a range of per pound through  the decision to reduce cobalt production in the fourth quarter of  which was driven in part by a major supplier s announcement in late october that they would shut down their cobalt mine indefinitely  and the company s corresponding decision to start liquidating cobalt inventories to generate cash 
long lived assets as a result of the adoption of sfas no 
in  goodwill must be reviewed at least annually for impairment  in accordance with the specified methodology 
further  goodwill  intangible and other long lived assets are assessed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
the company generally invests in long lived assets to secure raw material feedstocks  produce new products  or increase production capacity or capability 
because market conditions may change  future operating profits may be difficult to forecast 
furthermore  the assets and related businesses may be in different stages of development 
if the company determined that the future operating profits from these investments were not expected to exceed the carrying value of the investments  the company would record an impairment charge 
during  in connection with the deterioration of the profitability of the company s base metals business and the related restructuring actions  the company determined that goodwill was impaired by million 
this charge  with no tax benefit  was recorded in the fourth quarter 
in addition  at december   goodwill of approximately million has been allocated to discontinued operations in accordance with sfas no 
income taxes deferred income taxes are provided to recognize the effect of temporary differences between financial and tax reporting 
deferred income taxes are not provided for undistributed earnings of foreign consolidated subsidiaries  to the extent such earnings are reinvested for an indefinite period of time 
the company has significant operations outside the united states  where most of its pre tax earnings are derived  and in jurisdictions where the statutory tax rate is lower than in the united states 
the company also has significant cash requirements in the united states to pay interest and principal on borrowings 
as a result  significant tax and treasury planning and analysis of future operations are necessary to determine the proper amounts of tax assets  liabilities  and tax expense 
the company s tax assets  liabilities  and tax expense are supported by its best estimates and assumptions of its global cash requirements  planned dividend repatriations  and expectations of future earnings 
where the company has determined that it is more likely than not that deferred tax assets will not be realized  a valuation allowance has been established 
the valuation allowance pertains to the deferred tax assets resulting principally from the net operating loss carryforwards of certain subsidiaries in the united states 
stock options granted to employees in december  sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure  was issued 
sfas no 
amends sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  to provide alternative transition methods when a company voluntarily changes to the fair value based method of recognizing expense in the income statement for stock based employee compensation  including stock options granted to employees 
as provided for by sfas no 
 the company has adopted the disclosure only provisions of the standard and does not recognize expense for stock options granted to employees 
pension and opeb the measurement of liabilities related to pension plans and other postretirement benefit plans is based on management s assumptions related to future events including interest rates  return on pension plan assets  rate of compensation increases  and health care cost trend rates 
actual pension plan asset performance will either reduce or increase unamortized pension losses  which ultimately affects net income loss 
see note j for information related to key assumptions used to recognize expense for pension and other postretirement benefit plans 
for  certain key assumptions used to calculate pension and other postretirement benefit expense have been modified  including the lowering of both the assumed return on pension plan assets from to and the discount rate related to pension plans in the united states from to and outside the united states from to 
the impact of these changes on the results for is expected to be an increase in pension and postretirement benefit expense of approximately per diluted share
