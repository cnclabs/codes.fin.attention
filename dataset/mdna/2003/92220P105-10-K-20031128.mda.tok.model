item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview we  varian medical systems  inc  a delaware corporation originally incorporated in as varian associates  inc in  we transferred our instruments business to varian  inc  or vi  a wholly owned subsidiary  and transferred our semiconductor equipment business to varian semiconductor equipment associates  inc  or vsea  a wholly owned subsidiary 
we retained the medical systems business  principally the sales and service of oncology systems and the sales of x ray tubes and imaging subsystems 
on april   we spun off vi and vsea to our common stockholders  which we refer to as the spin offs in this form k 
immediately after the spin offs  we changed our name to varian medical systems  inc we have been engaged in aspects of the medical systems business since an amended and restated distribution agreement dated as of january  and other agreements govern our ongoing relationships with vi and vsea 
we are a world leader in the design and production of integrated systems of equipment and software for treating cancer with radiation therapy  as well as high quality  cost effective x ray tubes for oems  replacement x ray tubes and imaging subsystems 
our oncology systems business produces and sells a fully integrated system of products for treating cancer with radiation  including not only linear accelerators and treatment simulation and verification products but also information management and treatment planning software and other sophisticated ancillary products and services 
our linear accelerators and treatment simulation and verification products are sold and are in service around the world 
our x ray products business manufactures and sells x ray tubes that cover a range of applications including computed tomography  or ct  scanning  radioscopic fluoroscopic imaging  special procedures and mammography 
our x ray tubes are sold to most major diagnostic equipment manufacturers and directly to end users for replacement purposes 
through the ginzton technology center  or gtc  we are also pursuing other potential new business areas  including next generation digital x ray imaging technology  digital x ray fluoroscopic imagers  the potential of combining advances in focused energy and imaging technology with the latest breakthroughs in biotechnology and a joint research project with the palo alto research center  a subsidiary of xerox corporation  to develop technology for cargo screening under a grant from the united stated department of commerce 
in addition  we are pursuing technologies and products that promise to improve disease management by employing targeted energy to enhance the effectiveness of molecular medicine 
our brachytherapy operations manufacture and sell advanced brachytherapy products 
the operations of gtc and brachytherapy are reported as part of the other category of our industry segments  see note industry segments of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
on november   our board of directors declared a two for one stock split in the form of a stock dividend 
the distribution of the shares was made on january  to stockholders of record as of december  unless otherwise stated  all references to the number of shares and per share amounts of our common stock have been retroactively restated to reflect the increased number of shares resulting from the split 
in december  the securities and exchange commission  or sec  issued staff accounting bulletin no 
 or sab  revenue recognition in financial statements 
we implemented the provisions of sab in the fourth quarter of fiscal year  retroactive to the beginning of fiscal year as a result of sab and the associated sec guidance  we changed our revenue recognition accounting policy for our linear accelerators and related hardware products in the oncology systems business and three brachytherapy hardware products 
sales of these products generally include the provision for installation and related obligations 
prior to the adoption of sab  we recognized revenue for these products upon transfer of risk of loss for products to customers  which typically coincided with shipment of products and preceded installation and customer acceptance because acceptance was deemed probable 
subsequent to the adoption of sab  our accounting policy is to defer revenue recognition on these products on the greater of the fair value of the installation services or the amount of payment that is contractually linked to the installation or acceptance clause 
in conjunction with this change in accounting policy  we recognized an after tax charge in the first quarter of fiscal year of million net of income taxes of million  or per diluted share  representing the cumulative effect on prior years of the application of sab we adopted statement of financial accounting standards no 
 business combinations  or sfas and statement of financial accounting standards no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  or sfas effective september  sfas requires that the purchase method of accounting be used for all business combinations initiated after june  sfas also specifies criteria that intangible assets acquired in a purchase method business combination must meet to be recognized and reported apart from goodwill 
under sfas  goodwill is no longer amortized but reviewed for impairment annually or more frequently if certain indicators arise 
we completed the required annual impairment test and determined that there is no impairment to our recorded goodwill balances 
had we been accounting for goodwill under sfas for all fiscal years presented  our earnings before cumulative effect of changes in accounting principles and net earnings would have been million more than reported for fiscal year  or and per share on a basic and diluted basis  respectively 
in  we acquired the hdr  or high dose rate  brachytherapy business of mds nordion  a division of mds canada  inc  for approximately million in cash and argus software for million in cash 
on october   we acquired zmed  inc for approximately million in cash 
we also signed a letter of intent to form a three year joint venture in japan with mitsubishi electric corp 
under the letter of intent  the joint venture will sell our full line of radiotherapy products and  for the first two years of the joint venture  mitsubishi electric corp 
s medical linear accelerators and will also service and support all of these products 
we are to be the majority owner of the venture  and we will acquire mitsubishi electric corp 
s share of the joint venture at the end three years 
this discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based upon and should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and the notes included elsewhere in this report  as well as the information contained under factors affecting our business below 
we discuss our results of continuing operations below 
all figures given in this annual report on form k are based on actual reported results  unless otherwise stated as being on a pro forma basis assuming that sab was applied retroactively to prior years 
critical accounting policies this discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation is based on our financial statements which we prepare in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of our financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses 
these estimates and assumptions are based on historical experience and on various other factors that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
these estimates and assumptions also require the application of certain accounting policies  many of which require us to make estimates and assumptions about future events and their impact on amounts reported in our financial statements and related notes 
we periodically review our accounting policies and estimates and make adjustments when facts and circumstances dictate 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
any differences may have a material impact on our financial condition and results of operations 
for a discussion of how these and other factors may affect our business  see factors affecting our business included below 
in addition to the accounting policies which are more fully described in the notes to the consolidated financial statements included in this report  we have identified the following critical accounting policies used in the preparation of our financial statements revenue recognition we recognize revenue for product sales in accordance with sab when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred or services have been rendered  the price is fixed or determinable and collectibility is reasonably assured 
for arrangements with multiple deliverables  we recognize product revenue by allocating the revenue to each deliverable based on fair value in accordance with emerging issues task force  or eitf  issue no 
 revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables 
our adoption of the provisions of eitf during the fourth quarter of fiscal year did not have a material impact on our consolidated position or results of operations 
in general  for hardware products that include obligations for installation  our policy is to recognize the amount earned upon transfer of risk of loss and defer revenue recognition on the greater of the fair value of the installation services or the amount of payment that is contractually linked to the installation or acceptance clause 
for amounts deferred  revenue is recognized upon completion or satisfaction of remaining obligations 
revenue for product sales in the x ray products business is generally recognized when risk of loss transfers to the customer because these products do not include any installation obligations 
revenue related to spare part sales in the oncology systems service business is generally recognized when risk of loss transfers to the customer 
revenue related to services performed on a time and materials basis is recognized when it is earned and billable 
revenue related to service contracts is recognized ratably over the period of the related contract 
revenue for software product sales is recognized under the provisions of statement of position  software revenue recognition  or sop  as amended  generally at the time of customer acceptance 
revenue earned on software arrangements involving multiple elements is allocated to each element based on vendor specific objective evidence  which is based on the average price charged when the same element is sold separately 
in instances when evidence of fair value of all undelivered elements exists but evidence does not exist for one or more delivered elements  revenue is recognized using the residual method 
under the residual method  the fair value of the undelivered elements is deferred and the remaining portion of the arrangement fee is recognized as revenue 
revenue allocated to maintenance and support is recognized ratably over the maintenance term typically one year 
revenue recognition depends on the timing of shipment and is subject to customer acceptance and readiness 
if shipments are not made on scheduled timelines or the products are not accepted by the customer  our reported revenues may differ materially from expectations 
allowance for doubtful accounts credit evaluations are undertaken for all major sale transactions before shipment is authorized 
normal payment terms require payment of a small portion upon signing of the purchase order contract  a significant amount upon transfer of risk of loss and the remaining amount upon completion of the installation 
on a quarterly basis  we evaluate aged items in the accounts receivable aging and provide reserves in an amount we deem adequate for doubtful accounts 
customer financial conditions may change and increase the risk of collectibility  which may require additional provisions and would negatively impact our operating results 
as of september   our provisions for doubtful accounts represented approximately of total accounts receivable 
inventories we regularly review inventory quantities on hand and adjust for excess and obsolete inventory based primarily on historical usage rates and our estimates of product demand and production 
actual demand may differ from our estimates  in which case we may have understated or overstated the provision required for obsolete and excess inventory  which would have an impact on our operating results 
warranty obligations we generally warrant our products for a specific period of time  usually one year  against material defects 
we provide for the estimated future costs of warranty obligations in costs of goods sold when the related revenue is recognized 
the accrued warranty costs represent our best estimate at the time of sale of the total costs that we will incur to repair or replace product parts  which fail while still under warranty 
the amount of accrued estimated warranty costs is primarily based on historical experience as to product failures as well as current information on repair costs 
actual warranty costs could differ from the estimate amounts 
on a quarterly basis  we review the accrued balances and update the historical warranty cost trends 
if we were required to accrue additional warranty cost in the future  it would negatively affect operating results 
impairment of goodwill we adopted sfas during the first quarter of fiscal year sfas requires us to make an initial assessment within the first six months of adoption and then annual assessments thereafter as to the carrying value of the goodwill 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal year  we determined that the fair value of the reporting units  which are the industry segments as described in note industry segments of the notes to the consolidated financial statements  exceeded the carrying value and thus we did not need to record an impairment charge 
we will continue to make assessments of impairment on an annual basis in the fourth quarter of our fiscal years or more frequently if certain indicators arise 
in assessing the value of goodwill  we must make assumptions regarding estimated future cash flows and other factors to determine the fair value of the reporting units 
if these estimates or their related assumptions change in the future  we may be required to record impairment charges which would negatively impact operating results 
as of september   the carrying value of goodwill was million 
environmental matters we are subject to a variety of environmental laws around the world regulating the handling  storage  transport and disposal of hazardous materials that do or may create increased costs for some of our operations 
environmental remediation liabilities are recorded when environmental assessments and or remedial efforts are probable  and the costs of these assessments or remedial efforts can be reasonably estimated  in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for contingencies  and the american institute of certified public accountants  or aicpa  statement of position  environmental remediation liabilities 
the accrued environmental costs represent our best estimate as to the total costs of remediation and the time period over which these costs will be incurred 
on a quarterly basis  we review these accrued balances 
if we were required to accrue additional environmental remediation costs in the future  it would negatively impact our operating results 
results of operations fiscal year our fiscal year is the or week period ending on the friday nearest september fiscal year was the week period ended september  fiscal year was the week period ended september  fiscal year was the week period ended september  fiscal year compared to fiscal year sales our sales of  million in fiscal year were higher than our sales of million in fiscal year the increase in total sales during fiscal year compared to fiscal year was primarily due to strength in our oncology systems business and recovery of our x ray products business from an unusually weak fiscal year international sales which we consider to be sales outside of north america were million representing of total sales in fiscal year  compared to million representing of total sales in fiscal year product sales were million representing of total sales in fiscal year  compared to million representing of total sales in fiscal year service and other sales were million representing of total sales in fiscal year  compared to million representing of total sales in fiscal year fiscal year sales by segment and revenue classification dollars in millions oncology systems product service contracts and other total oncology systems x ray products product service contracts and other total x ray products gtc product service contracts and other total gtc oncology systems north america europe asia rest of the world total oncology systems x ray products north america europe asia rest of the world total x ray products gtc oncology systems sales oncology systems sales increased to million representing of total sales in fiscal year compared to million representing of total sales in fiscal year oncology systems product sales increased to million representing of oncology systems sales in fiscal year  compared to million representing of oncology systems sales in fiscal year service and other sales  which include service contracts and service to customers billed on a time and materials basis  increased to million representing of oncology systems sales in fiscal year  compared to million representing of oncology systems sales in fiscal year for fiscal year  oncology systems international sales representing of oncology systems sales increased over fiscal year levels due in part to the strength of foreign currencies against the us dollar  that effectively make our pricing more competitive with our foreign competitors 
for fiscal year north american sales representing of oncology systems sales increased by over fiscal year levels primarily due to the continued increase in demand for new technology  including intensity modulated radiation therapy  or imrt  and imrt related products  which resulted in higher overall sales volume 
x ray products sales total x ray products sales increased to million representing of total sales in fiscal year compared to million representing of total sales for fiscal year the increase in sales during fiscal year is primarily attributable to unusually weak sales for the first half of fiscal year compared to historical levels because of excess inventory levels at our largest oem customer as well as a general weakness in the x ray tube market 
our business began to recover in the second half of fiscal year and continued to recover through the first half of fiscal year as this oem customer replenished its inventory 
during fiscal year  we also experienced an increase in the volume of sales of our ct scanning tube products and replacement tubes for third party service organizations 
other sales combined sales for gtc and our brachytherapy operations were million in fiscal year compared to million in fiscal year product sales were million in fiscal year  compared to million in fiscal year service and other sales  which include service contracts  service to customers billed on a time and materials basis and research contracts  were million for both fiscal years and  respectively 
the net increase in combined sales stemmed primarily from the addition of the gammamed product line for high dose rate brachytherapy 
the gammamed product line was acquired in the fourth quarter of fiscal year gross profit we recorded gross profit of million in fiscal year and million in fiscal year as a percentage of total sales  gross profit was in fiscal year and in fiscal year product gross profit as a percentage of sales was in fiscal year  compared to in fiscal year gross profit as a percentage of sales for service contracts and other sales was in fiscal year  compared to in fiscal year gross profit as a percentage of oncology systems sales increased to in fiscal year from for fiscal year due principally increased sales volume and the mix of products 
gross profit as a percentage x ray products sales increased to in fiscal year from in fiscal year due primarily from higher sales volume and improved manufacturing productivity 
research and development research and development expenses were million in fiscal year compared to million in fiscal year  representing of sales in both years 
the increase in absolute dollars in research and development expenses occurred primarily in oncology systems 
some of our current development efforts are in the areas of system simplification and imaging and treatment technology that will allow clinicians to more precisely treat small  moving and changing tumors with greater dose intensity and accuracy while preserving more of the surrounding healthy tissue 
selling  general and administrative selling  general and administrative expenses were million of sales in fiscal year compared to million of sales in fiscal year the increase in absolute dollars in selling  general and administrative expenses was attributable primarily to the increase in business activity and personnel in oncology systems  increases in expenses related to the higher sales volume and the inclusion of expenses related to the operations of the gammamed line of brachytherapy products  which we acquired from mds nordion inc during the fourth quarter of fiscal year in addition  we also experienced increases in insurance costs  professional advisory fees which includes legal  tax and accounting fees  information technology costs and our allowance for doubtful accounts 
these increases were partially offset by hedging gains related to hedges of our foreign currency denominated assets and liabilities 
reorganization income  net the million of net reorganization income in fiscal year resulted from the release of an excess reorganization accrual for foreign taxes excluding income taxes established as part of the spin offs  partially offset by reorganization charges primarily attributable to legal fees incurred in excess of the amounts previously accrued 
there were no such amounts in fiscal year interest income expense  net net interest income was million in fiscal year compared to million of net interest income in fiscal year the increase is attributable to interest income of million associated with a tax refund received during the third quarter of fiscal year  as well as increased cash and marketable securities levels 
taxes on earnings our effective tax rate was in fiscal year compared to in fiscal year this decline is primarily due to the settlement of a state tax audit  as well as tax exemptions available on interest earned on our investments in municipal bonds 
in general  our effective income tax rate differs from the statutory rates largely as a function of benefits realized from foreign taxes  tax exempt interest and the extraterritorial income exclusion 
earnings per diluted share earnings per diluted share was for fiscal year  compared to for fiscal year the increase can be attributed to the increase in total sales  improvements in gross margins and slower growth in selling and general and administrative expenses 
orders and backlog our orders of  million in fiscal year were higher than our orders of million in fiscal year the increase in orders in fiscal year was primarily due to the increase in oncology systems orders  which increased by compared to fiscal year international oncology systems orders increased by due in part to the strength of foreign currencies against the us dollar  while north american oncology systems orders increased by due to the continued increase in demand for new technology  including imrt  and imrt related products 
x ray products orders increased by compared to fiscal year  while orders in the other segment increased to million in fiscal year  compared to million in fiscal year at september   we had a backlog of million  an increase of compared to fiscal year end fiscal year orders by segment and region dollars in millions oncology systems north america europe asia rest of the world total oncology systems x ray products north america europe asia rest of the world total x ray products other fiscal year outlook total sales for fiscal year  our early expectation is that with our healthy backlog  successful completion of our recently announced acquisition and joint venture and a return to more normal growth rates for our x ray products business  sales for the total company will increase by a percentage in the low teens over the fiscal year totals 
oncology systems sales we believe that sales for fiscal year will increase in the mid teens over fiscal year totals  consistent with our long term growth expectations of to for this business 
x ray products sales for fiscal year  we expect a return to long term growth rates of between to 
taxes on earnings we expect to maintain an estimated effective tax rate for fiscal year our future effective income tax rate depends on various factors  such as tax legislation  the geographic composition of our pre tax earnings  research and development credits and the effectiveness of our tax planning strategies 
earnings per diluted share for fiscal year  we anticipate that earnings per diluted share will increase by a percentage in the high teens over the fiscal year amount assuming anticipated sales volume  as well as product and geographic mix 
the foregoing are forward looking statements and projections that are subject to the factors  risks and uncertainties set forth or referred to under the factors affecting our business included below 
actual results and the outcome or timing of certain events may differ significantly 
fiscal year compared to fiscal year sales our sales of million in fiscal year were higher than our sales of million in fiscal year growth in north american sales accounted for all of our sales growth in fiscal year international sales were million representing of total sales in fiscal year  compared to million representing of total sales in fiscal year product sales were million representing of total sales in fiscal year  compared to million representing of total sales in fiscal year service and other sales were million representing of total sales in fiscal year  compared to million representing of total sales in fiscal year fiscal year sales by segment and revenue classification dollars in millions oncology systems product service contracts and other total oncology systems x ray products product service contracts and other total x ray products gtc product service contracts and other total gtc fiscal year sales by segment and region dollars in millions oncology systems north america europe asia rest of the world total oncology systems x ray products north america europe asia rest of the world total x ray products gtc oncology systems sales total sales for the oncology systems business increased to million representing of total sales in fiscal year compared to million representing of total sales in fiscal year oncology systems product sales increased to million representing of oncology systems sales in fiscal year  compared to million representing of oncology systems sales in fiscal year service and other sales  which include service contracts and service to customers billed on a time and materials basis  increased to million representing of oncology systems sales in fiscal year  compared to million representing of oncology systems sales in fiscal year international sales for fiscal year were slightly below fiscal year sales due primarily to an usually large shipment to brazil completed during the fourth quarter of fiscal year as well as the timing of shipments as a result of customer requested delivery schedules and treatment room completion 
north american sales in fiscal year increased over fiscal year levels by primarily due to the continued increase in demand for imrt  and imrt related products 
x ray products sales total x ray products sales decreased to million representing of total sales in fiscal year compared to million representing of total sales in fiscal year however  sales rose slightly in the second half of fiscal year when compared to the same period in fiscal year the decline in sales in the first half of fiscal year was the result of excess inventory levels at our largest oem customer and a decline in the core oem medical x ray tube business in fiscal years and we believe that there is a continuing consolidation in the oem markets  including the acquisition of previous customers by companies that also manufacture competing x ray tube products 
other sales combined sales for gtc and our brachytherapy operations  were million in fiscal year compared to million in fiscal year product sales were million in fiscal year  compared to million in fiscal year service and other sales  which include service contracts  service to customers billed on a time and materials basis and research contracts  were million in fiscal year compared to million in fiscal year the net increase in total gtc sales stemmed primarily from higher payments under research contracts and growth in our brachytherapy treatment planning software business  as well as the addition of sales in the gammamed product line  which we acquired in july gross profit we recorded gross profit of million in fiscal year and million in fiscal year as a percentage of total sales  gross profit was in fiscal year and in fiscal year product gross profit as a percentage of sales was in fiscal year  compared to in fiscal year the gross profit increase in product sales in fiscal year resulted primarily from proportionately greater north american sales and increased sales of ancillary products  both of which have higher margins than international sales and sales of linear accelerators  respectively 
gross profit as a percentage of sales for service contracts and other sales was in fiscal year  compared to in fiscal year the gross profit increase in service contracts and other sales resulted primarily from increased sales volume 
gross profit as a percentage of sales of oncology systems increased to in fiscal year from for fiscal year due principally to the proportionately greater north american sales and increased sales of ancillary products 
however  gross profit as a percentage of sales in our x ray products business decreased to in fiscal year from in fiscal year the gross profit decrease in x ray products stemmed primarily from the decline in sales volume 
research and development research and development expenses were million in fiscal year compared to million in fiscal year  representing of sales in both years 
the increase in absolute dollars in research and development expenses in fiscal year occurred in all businesses 
selling  general and administrative selling  general and administrative expenses were million of sales in fiscal year compared to million of sales in fiscal year the increase in absolute dollars in selling  general and administrative expenses can be attributed to expenses related to the higher volume of sales  as well as  higher corporate costs for insurance  inclusions of expenses from our acquisition of the brachytherapy business of mds nordion inc in the fourth quarter of fiscal year and hedging losses related to hedges of our foreign currency denominated assets and liabilities 
these increases were partially offset by the elimination of goodwill amortization in compliance with sfas reorganization income  net the million of net reorganization income in fiscal year resulted from the release of an excess reorganization accrual for foreign taxes excluding income taxes established as part of the spin offs  partially offset by reorganization charges primarily attributable to legal fees incurred in excess of the amounts previously accrued 
interest income expense  net net interest income was million in fiscal year compared to million of net interest income in fiscal year the decrease was primarily a result of lower interest rates and our investing in tax exempt municipal securities to lower our effective tax rate partially offset by increased levels of cash and marketable securities 
other non operating expense we wrote off our million investment in dpix llc  or dpix  which supplies us with amorphous silicon based thin film transistor arrays  or flat panels  for our digital imaging subsystems and portalvision imaging systems  in the fourth quarter of fiscal year based on the belief that this investment is other than temporarily impaired 
although we recorded this accounting impairment charge in fiscal year  we will continue to participate in the dpix consortium and dpix continues to supply us with flat panels 
taxes on earnings our effective tax rate was in fiscal year compared to in fiscal year this decline is primarily due to tax exemptions available for interest earned our investments in municipal securities 
in general  our effective income tax rate differed from the statutory rates largely as a function of benefits realized from our extraterritorial income exclusion  research and development tax credits  tax exempt interest and foreign taxes 
cumulative effect of changes in accounting principles net of taxes we recorded a net charge of million net of income taxes of million  or per diluted share  to reflect the cumulative effect of the changes in accounting principles resulting from the adoption of sab and statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  or sfas  in fiscal year the cumulative effect of accounting change applicable to sab amounted to million net of income taxes of million  or per diluted share 
this amount is primarily comprised of the portion of revenue  the payment of which was contractually linked to the acceptance clause  and related profits associated with equipment that was shipped and previously recorded as revenue but for which installation and or acceptance did not occur until after fiscal year approximately million of the million of revenue deferred as of the beginning of fiscal year was recognized in upon installation and or acceptance 
approximately million of fiscal year and prior years equipment shipments was deferred as of september   of which approximately million was recognized as revenue in fiscal year the million charge related to sab was partially offset by a million credit to earnings resulting from the adoption of sfas  in the first quarter of fiscal year for a discussion of sab and sfas  see note adoption of sab and note derivatives instruments and hedging activities of the notes to the consolidated financial statements  respectively 
earnings per diluted share earnings per diluted share was for fiscal year  compared to for fiscal year the increase in earnings per diluted share was due in part to increased total sales and improved gross margins and also partially attributable to the fact that the earnings per diluted share for fiscal year included the cumulative effect of changes in accounting principles resulting from the adoption of sab and sfas  as well as the write off of our investment in dpix 
liquidity and capital resources liquidity is the measurement of our ability to meet potential cash requirements  including ongoing commitments to repay borrowings  purchases of business assets and funding of continuing operations 
our sources of cash include sales  net interest income and borrowings 
our liquidity is actively managed on a daily basis to ensure the maintenance of sufficient funds to meet our needs 
at september   we had million of long term loans 
the fixed interest rates on the outstanding long term loans on this date ranged from to with a weighted average interest rate of 
the long term loans currently contain covenants that limit future borrowings and cash dividend payments 
the covenants also require us to maintain specified levels of working capital and operating results 
at september   we had million in cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities approximately of which was held abroad and could be subject to additional taxation if it was repatriated to the us cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities increased by million from million at september  our primary cash inflows and outflows for fiscal years  and were as follows we generated net cash from operating activities of million in fiscal year  compared to million and million in fiscal years and  respectively 
increases in net earnings of million  an increase in tax benefit from employee stock options of million and reduction in working capital and non cash items  net  or million contributed to the increase in fiscal year as compared to fiscal year increases in net earnings of million  a decrease in the tax benefit from employee stock options of million and reduction in working capital and non cash items  net  of million contributed to the increase in fiscal year as compared to fiscal year investing activities used million of net cash in fiscal year  compared to million and million of net cash in fiscal years and  respectively 
our net purchases of marketable securities during fiscal year were million less compared to fiscal year our purchases of marketable securities during fiscal year were million more compared to fiscal year financing activities used net cash of million and million in fiscal years and  respectively  compared to providing net cash of million in fiscal year during fiscal year  we received million in proceeds from employee stock option exercises and used million for the purchase of common stock 
in fiscal year  we received proceeds of million from employee stock option exercises and used million for purchases of common stock 
in fiscal year  we received million in proceeds from employee stock option exercises and used million for purchases of common stock 
total debt as a percentage of total capital decreased to at fiscal year end compared to at fiscal year end largely due to the increase of our stockholders equity during fiscal year the ratio of current assets to current liabilities increased to to at fiscal year end from to at fiscal year end we expect our capital expenditures to be between to of sales in fiscal year our liquidity is affected by many factors  some of which are based on the normal ongoing operations of our business and some of which arise from uncertainties and conditions in the us and global economies 
although our cash requirements will fluctuate positively and negatively as a result of the shifting influences of these factors  we believe that existing cash and cash equivalents  cash to be generated from operations and our borrowing capability will be sufficient to satisfy anticipated commitments for capital expenditures and other cash requirements through fiscal year the following summarizes certain of our contractual obligations as of september  and the effect such obligations are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flows in future periods in millions payments due by period total less than year years years more than years contractual obligations long term debt operating leases total stock repurchase program on august   we announced that our board of directors had authorized the repurchase by us of up to one million shares on a pre january  stock split basis of our common stock over the following twelve month period 
the time period for the repurchase was extended by the board of directors until february  on february   our board of directors authorized an additional repurchase of up to two million shares of our common stock through the end of february during fiscal years  and  we paid million  million and million  respectively  to repurchase  shares   shares and  shares  respectively  of our common stock 
all shares that have been repurchased have been retired 
as of september   we could still purchase up to  shares 
on november   we announced that our board of directors had authorized the repurchase by us of up to an additional three million shares of our common stock over the period through august  this authorization  which is effective immediately  adds to the existing two million share repurchase authorization 
environmental matters we are subject to a variety of environmental laws around the world regulating the handling  storage  transport and disposal of hazardous materials and imposing liability for the cleanup of contamination from these materials that do or may create increased costs for some of our operations 
in addition  we may be required to incur significant additional costs to comply with future changes in existing environmental laws and regulations or new laws and regulations 
for example  several countries are implementing regulations to require manufacturers to take back  recycle and dispose of products at the end of the equipment s useful life 
the eu has adopted directives that when fully implemented by member states will require medical equipment manufacturers to bear some or all of the cost of product disposal at the end of the products useful life and will impose restrictions on the use of some hazardous substances in certain of our products sold in the eu 
in addition  we will be required to identify the locations of dangerous substances in certain of our products so we  or if the product is sent to a recovery facility  that facility  can remove these components  such as mercury switches  batteries  printed circuit boards  before product recycling or disposal 
we may also be required to provide up front financial guarantees when placing products on the market 
each member of the eu must set its own regulations to implement the directives  which may vary 
these directives will create increased costs for our operations 
from the time we began operating  we handled and disposed of hazardous materials and wastes following procedures that were considered appropriate under regulations  if any  existing at the time 
we also hired companies to dispose of wastes generated by our operations 
under various laws such as the federal superfund law and under our obligations concerning operations before the spin offs  we are overseeing environmental cleanup projects from our pre spun off operations and as applicable reimbursing third parties such as the us environmental protection agency or other responsible parties  for cleanup activities 
under the terms of the agreement governing the distribution  vi and vsea are each obligated to indemnify us for one third of these environmental cleanup costs  after adjusting for any insurance proceeds realized or tax benefits recognized by us 
the cleanup projects we are overseeing are being conducted under the direction of or in consultation with relevant regulatory agencies 
we estimate these cleanup projects will take up to years to complete 
as described below  we have accrued a total of million at september  to cover our liabilities for these cleanup projects our estimate of future costs to complete certain cleanup activities including three cleanup projects  reimbursements to third parties  project management costs and legal costs ranges from million to million 
for these estimates  we have not discounted the costs to present dollars because of the uncertainties that make it difficult to develop a best estimate and have accrued million  which is the amount at the low end of the range 
for eight cleanup projects  we have sufficient knowledge to develop better estimates of our future costs 
while our estimate of future costs to complete these cleanup projects  including third party claims  ranges from million to million  our best estimate within that range is million 
for these projects we have accrued million  which of the million discounted to present dollars at  net of inflation 
at september   our reserve for environmental liabilities  based upon future environmental related costs estimated as of that date  was calculated as follows dollars in millions recurring costs non recurring costs total anticipated future costs fiscal year thereafter total costs less imputed interest reserve amount when we developed the estimates above  we considered the financial strength of other potentially responsible parties 
these amounts are  however  only estimates and may be revised in the future as we get more information on these projects 
we may also spend more or less than these estimates 
based on current information  we believe that our reserves are adequate 
at this time  management believes that it is remote that any single environmental event would have a materially adverse impact on our cash flows in any single fiscal year 
we spent million  million and million  net of amounts borne by vi and vsea  during fiscal years  and  respectively 
we received cash payments in the form of settlements and judgments from various insurance companies  defendants and other third parties from time to time 
in addition  we have an agreement with an insurance company to pay a portion of our past and future expenditures 
as a result of this agreement  we have a million receivable included in other current assets and other assets as of september  we believe that this receivable is collectible because it is based on a binding  written settlement agreement with a financially viable insurance company 
our present and past facilities have been in operation for many years  and over that time in the course of those operations  these facilities have used substances which are or might be considered hazardous  and we have generated and disposed of wastes which are or might be considered hazardous 
therefore  it is possible that additional environmental issues may arise in the future that we cannot now predict 
recent accounting pronouncements in november  the financial accounting standards board  or fasb  issued fasb interpretation no 
or fin  guarantor s accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees  including indirect guarantees of indebtedness of others  and interpretation of fasb statements no 
 and and rescission of fasb interpretation no 
 or fin fin clarifies the requirements of sfas relating to the guarantor accounting for  and disclosure of  the issuance of certain types of guarantees  including a reconciliation of change s in the entity s product warranty liability 
the initial recognition and measurement provisions of fin are applicable on a prospective basis to guarantees issued or modified after december   irrespective of the guarantor s fiscal year end 
we adopted fin  as required  on january   with no material impact to our consolidated financial position or results of operations 
factors affecting our business the following factors  in conjunction with the other information included in this form k  should be carefully considered 
if we are unable to anticipate or keep pace with changes in the marketplace and the direction of technological innovation and customer demands  our products may become less useful or obsolete and our operating results will suffer the marketplace for our products is characterized by rapid change and technological innovation 
because our products often have long development and government approval cycles  we must anticipate changes in the marketplace and the direction of technological innovation and customer demands 
for example  most of our recent product introductions in our oncology systems business have related to a relatively new technologies of imrt  image guided radiation therapy  or igrt  and enhancements of existing products through greater systems integration and simplification 
imrt is a form of three dimensional conformal radiation therapy that links treatment planning  information management and driver software to the actual treatment delivery device  the linear accelerator 
while we believe that the radiation oncology market are beginning to widely adopt imrt and imrt products  if future studies fail to confirm the effectiveness of imrt or our products or show negative side effects  if other more effective technologies are introduced  or if for other reasons this does not occur  our sales could fail to increase or could decrease 
our success will depend upon the continued growth in awareness  acceptance and success of imrt in general and acceptance of our products utilizing this technology in particular 
there may be a point  however  as more institutions purchase imrt equipped linear accelerators or upgrade their existing accelerators with imrt technology  that the market for imrt related products may eventually become saturated  and our future success will depend on our ability to accurately anticipate and capitalize on future technological changes 
igrt  is a very new cancer treatment methodology that allows for dynamic  real time visualization and precise treatment of small  moving and changing tumors with greater dose intensity and accuracy while preserving healthy surrounding tissue 
we are currently investing in product development to design new classes of imaging products for igrt treatment and enhancements to existing products to enable igrt treatment capabilities 
we believe igrt is the next generation in radiotherapy treatment of cancers  combining imrt treatment with sophisticated real time imaging and visualization systems  and that it be a driver of growth in our oncology systems business over the next decade 
igrt  however  is a nascent technology that is not yet widely recognized 
our future success is dependent upon the wide spread awareness  acceptance and adoption by the radiation oncology market of igrt and our igrt products as the evolutionary technology and methodology for radiotherapy treatment of cancers 
if our assumptions regarding the future importance of igrt are incorrect or if igrt fails to be effective as a treatment methodology  then our sales could fail to increase or could decrease 
as radiation oncology treatment becomes more complex  our customers are increasingly concerned about the integration and simplicity of use of our various products for treating patients 
for example  our linear accelerators  treatment simulators  treatment verification products and treatment planning and information management software products are highly sophisticated and require a high level of training and education in order to competently and safely use such products 
the complexity and training requirements are further increased since our products are designed to operate together as integrated treatment systems 
we have engaged in a substantial effort and product development investment to more tightly integrate our products so that may operate more seamlessly as a system and to simplify the usability of our products through enhancement such as more intuitive user interfaces and greater software intelligence 
we anticipate that these integration and simplicity of use efforts will increase the acceptance and adoption of imrt and igrt and will foster greater demand for our products from new customers and upgrades from existing customers 
if we are unsuccessful in these integration and simplicity of use efforts or if our assumptions about the importance of these feature to customers are inaccurate  our sales could fail to increase or could decrease 
we may be unable to accurately anticipate changes in our markets and the direction of technological innovation and demands of our customers  our competitors may develop improved products or processes  or the marketplace may conclude that the task our product was designed to do is no longer an element of a generally accepted diagnostic or treatment regimen 
if this occurs  the market for our products may be adversely affected and they may become less useful or obsolete 
any development adversely affecting the market for our equipment would force us to reduce production volumes or to discontinue manufacturing one or more of our oncology systems products or product lines and would reduce our sales and earnings 
if we are unable to develop new generations of products and enhancements to existing products  we may be unable to attract or retain customers our success depends upon the successful development  introduction and commercialization of new generations of products  treatment systems and enhancements to and simplification of existing products 
our products are technologically complex and must keep pace with rapid and significant technological change  comply with rapidly evolving industry standards and compete effectively with new product introductions of our competitors 
accordingly  many of our products require significant planning  design  development and testing at the technological  product and manufacturing process levels 
these activities require significant capital commitments and investments on our part  which we may be unable to recover 
in addition  some of our research and development projects are funded by government contracts 
changes in government priorities and our ability to attract such funding may affect our overall research effort and ultimately  our ability to develop successful new products and product enhancements 
our ability to successfully develop and introduce new products  treatment systems and product enhancements and simplifications  and the costs associated with these efforts  are affected by our ability to properly identify customer needs  prove feasibility of new products  limit the time required from proof of feasibility to routine production  limit the timing and cost of regulatory approvals  accurately predict and control costs associated with inventory overruns caused by phase in of new products and phase out of old products  price our products competitively  manufacture and deliver our products in sufficient volumes on time  and accurately predict and control costs associated with manufacturing  installation  warranty and maintenance of the products  manage customer acceptance and payment for products  limit customer demands for retrofits of both new and old products  and anticipate and compete successfully with competitors efforts 
we cannot be sure that we will be able to successfully develop  manufacture and phase in new products  treatment systems or product enhancements 
without the successful introduction of new products and product enhancements  we may be unable to attract and retain customers and our revenue and operating results will suffer 
in addition  even if customers accept new products or product enhancements  the revenues from such products may not be sufficient to offset the significant costs associated with making such products available to customers 
we face significant costs in order to comply with laws and regulations applicable to the manufacture and distribution of our products  and if we fail or are delayed in obtaining regulatory approvals or fail to comply with applicable regulations  we may be unable to distribute our products or may be subject to civil or criminal penalties we and some of our suppliers and distributors are subject to extensive and rigorous government regulation of the manufacture and distribution of our products  both in the united states and in foreign countries 
compliance with these laws and regulations is expensive and time consuming  and changes to or failure to comply with these laws and regulations  or adoption of new laws and regulations  could adversely affect our business 
in the united states  as a manufacturer and seller of medical devices and devices utilizing radioactive by product material  we and some of our suppliers and distributors are subject to extensive regulation by federal governmental authorities  such as the united states food and drug administration  or the fda  and state and local regulatory agencies  such as the state of california  to ensure such devices are safe and effective 
such regulations  which include the us food  drug and cosmetic act  or the fdc act  and regulations promulgated by the fda  govern the design  development  testing  manufacturing  packaging  labeling  distribution  import export  possession  marketing  disposal  clinical investigations involving humans  sale and marketing of medical devices  post market surveillance  repairs  replacements  recalls and other matters relating to medical devices  radiation producing devices and devices utilizing radioactive by product material 
state regulations are extensive and vary from state to state 
our oncology systems equipment and software  with the exception of industrial products  and our flat panel imaging products  constitute medical devices subject to these regulations 
in general  our x ray tubes are not considered medical devices  but are indirectly subject to this regulation when they are included in medical devices 
future products in any of our business segments may constitute medical devices and be subject to regulation as such 
these laws require that manufacturers adhere to certain standards designed to ensure that the medical devices are safe and effective 
under the fdc act  each medical device manufacturer must comply with requirements applicable to manufacturing practices 
the fda  generally requires that medical devices receive fda k pre market notification clearance or an approved pre market approval application  or pma  before we  as a manufacturer of such devices  can take orders or distribute those products in the united states 
in addition  modifications or enhancements to these products that could significantly affect safety or effectiveness  or constitute a major change in intended use  require further fda clearance or approval 
obtaining fda market clearances or approvals can be time consuming  expensive and uncertain 
we may fail to obtain the necessary clearances or approvals or may be unduly delayed in doing so 
furthermore  even if we are granted regulatory clearances  the clearances may include significant limitations on the indicated uses of the product  which may limit the market for those products 
the fda review process typically requires extended proceedings pertaining to the safety and efficacy of new products  which may delay or hinder a product s timely entry into the marketplace 
if we were unable to achieve required fda approval or clearance for a product  or were limited or unduly delayed in doing so  our business would suffer 
in addition  we have generally been able to use the k pre market notification clearance for our products  which is less time consuming  expensive and uncertain than the pma approval process 
if we were required to use the pma approval process for future products or product modifications  it could delay or prevent release of the proposed products or modifications  and could cause our business to suffer 
in addition to fda required market clearances and approvals  our manufacturing operations are required to comply with the fda s quality system regulation  or qsr  which addresses the quality program requirements  such as a company s management responsibility for the company s quality systems  and good manufacturing practices  product design  controls  methods  facilities and quality assurance controls used in manufacturing  assembly  packing  storing and installing medical devices 
compliance with the qsr is necessary to receive fda clearance or approval to market new products and is necessary for us to be able to continue to market cleared or approved product offerings 
the fda makes announced and unannounced inspections to determine compliance with the qsr s and may issue us reports listing instances where we have failed to comply with applicable regulations and or procedures or warning letters which  if not adequately responded to  could lead to enforcement actions against us  including fines  the total shutdown of our production facilities and criminal prosecution 
the fda and the federal trade commission  or ftc  also regulate the promotion and advertising of our products that are medical devices to ensure that the claims that are made are not off label from the intended use stated in the k clearance for the products and also there is scientific data to substantiate such claim 
the fda and ftc determinations on these matters can be subjective  and we cannot assure you that the fda or ftc would agree that all or our promotional claims are permissible 
if the fda or ftc determined that any of our promotional claims were not permissible  we may be required to revise our promotional claims or may be subject to enforcement actions 
as a manufacturer of medical devices utilizing radioactive byproduct material  we are subject to numerous federal  state and local laws and regulations relating to their manufacture  distribution  transportation  import export  possession  use and disposal 
our medical devices utilizing radioactive byproduct material are subject to the nuclear regulatory commission  or nrc  clearance and approval requirements  and the manufacture and sale of these products are subject to state regulation that is extensive and varies from state to state 
our manufacture and distribution of medical devices utilizing byproduct material also requires us to obtain a number of license and certifications for these devices and materials 
service of these products must also be in accordance with a specific radioactive materials license 
we are also subject to a variety of additional environmental laws regulating our manufacturing operations and the handling  storage  transport and disposal of hazardous materials  and imposing liability for the cleanup of contamination from these materials 
as a participant in the healthcare industry  we are also subject to extensive laws and regulations in addition to fda regulation on a broad array of additional subjects at the federal  state and local levels 
these include laws and regulations protecting the privacy and integrity of patient medical information  including the health insurance portability and accountability act of  fraud and abuse laws and regulations such as physician self referral prohibitions  anti kickback laws  and false claims laws 
we also must comply with numerous federal  state and local laws of more general applicability relating to such matters as safe working conditions  manufacturing practices and fire hazard control 
if we or any of our suppliers or distributors fail to comply with fda and other applicable regulatory requirements  it can result in a wide variety of actions  such as investigations  reports of non compliance or warning letters  fines  injunctions  and civil penalties  partial suspensions or total shutdown of production  or the imposition of operating restrictions  losses of clearances or approvals already granted  or the refusal of future requests for clearance or approval  seizures or recalls of our products  the inability to sell our products in the applicable jurisdiction  and criminal prosecutions 
government regulation also may delay for a considerable period of time or prevent the marketing and full commercialization of future products or services that we may develop  and or impose costly requirements on our business 
in addition  changes in existing regulations or adoption of new regulations could affect the timing of  or prevent us from obtaining  future regulatory approvals  or could otherwise adversely affect our business 
our operations and sales of our products outside the united states are subject to regulatory requirements that vary from country to country  and may differ significantly from those in the united states 
in general  our products are regulated outside the united states as medical devices by foreign governmental agencies similar to the fda and the ftc 
we are also subject to laws and regulations applicable to manufacturers of medical devices  radiation producing devices and products utilizing radioactive materials  and laws and regulations of general applicability relating to matters such as environmental protection  safe working conditions  manufacturing practices and other matters  in each case that are often comparable  if not more stringent  than regulation in the united states 
our sales of products in foreign countries are also subject to regulation of matters such as product standards  packaging requirements  labeling requirements  environmental and product recycling requirements  import restrictions  tariff regulations  duties and tax requirements 
we rely in some countries on our foreign distributors to assist us in complying with foreign regulatory requirements 
we may be required to incur significant time and expense in obtaining and maintaining non us regulatory approvals and in complying with non us laws and regulations 
delays in receipt of or failure to receive such approvals  the loss of previously obtained approvals or failure to comply with existing of future regulatory requirements could restrict or prevent us from doing business in the applicable country or subject us to a variety of enforcement actions  which would adversely affect our business 
it is also important that our products comply with electrical safety and environmental standards  such as those of underwriters laboratories  the canadian standards association  and the international electrotechnical commision 
if one or more of our products fail to comply with these standards  we may be unable to obtain or maintain registrations to sell our products  demand for our products may diminish  or we may be subject to other enforcement actions 
the laws and regulations applicable to us and our business and their enforcement are constantly undergoing change  and we cannot predict what effect  if any  changes may have on our business 
in addition  new laws and regulations may be adopted which adversely affect our business 
there has been a trend in recent years  both in the united states and abroad  toward more stringent regulation and enforcement of requirements applicable to medical device manufacturers 
the continuing trend of more stringent regulatory oversight in product clearance and enforcement activities may cause medical device manufacturers to experience more uncertainty  greater risk and higher expenses 
there is a continuing trend for governments around the world  including the us and canada  to start charging fees for the review of premarket notification clearances 
a further discussion of government regulation of our industry and our products  see business government regulation 
health care reforms  changes in health care policies and changes to third party reimbursements for radiation oncology services may affect demand for our products the us government has in the past  and may in the future  consider and state and local as well as a number of foreign governments are considering or have adopted health care policies intended to curb rising health care costs 
these policies include rationing of government funded reimbursement for health care services and imposing price controls on medical products and services providers 
future significant changes in the health care systems in the united states or elsewhere could have a negative impact on the demand for our products and services and the way we conduct business 
we are unable to predict what health care reform legislation or regulation  if any  will be enacted in the united states or elsewhere  whether other health care legislation or regulation affecting our business may be proposed or enacted in the future  or what effect any such legislation or regulation would have on our business 
in addition  sales of some of our products indirectly depend on whether adequate reimbursement is available to our customers for the treatment provided by those products from third party health care payors  such as government health care insurance programs  including the medicare and medicaid programs  private insurance plans  health maintenance organizations and preferred provider organizations 
once medicare has made a decision to provide reimbursement for a given treatment  these reimbursement rates are generally reviewed and adjusted by medicare annually 
private third party payors often adopt medicare reimbursement policies and payment amounts 
as a result  decisions by the centers for medicare and medicaid services to reimburse for a treatment  or changes to medicare s reimbursement policies or reductions in payment amounts with respect to a treatment would likely extend to third party payor reimbursement policies and amounts for that treatment as well 
the availability of such reimbursement for treatments using our products and the relevant reimbursement rates can affect our customers decisions to purchase our products 
for example  currently medicare reimbursement rates for imrt treatments are substantially higher than the reimbursement rates for standard radiotherapy treatments  and recent growth in our business has been driven in part by growth in sales of imrt and imrt related products 
any material adverse change in medicare s reimbursement policies regarding imrt treatments or other procedures using our products  or material reduction in reimbursement rates for such procedures  could reduce demand for our products and have a material adverse effect on our revenue 
in addition  the executive branch of the federal government and the congress from time to time consider various medicare and other health care reform proposals that could significantly affect both private and public reimbursement for health care services 
if a proposal that significantly reduced reimbursement rates for our products or procedures using our products were enacted into law  it could adversely affect the demand for these products and our business would suffer 
as a general matter  third party payors are increasingly challenging the pricing of medical procedures or limiting or prohibiting reimbursement for specific services or devices or through other means  and we cannot be sure that they will reimburse our customers at levels sufficient to enable us to achieve or maintain sales and price levels for our products 
without adequate support from third party payors  the market for our products may be limited 
there is no uniform policy on reimbursement among third party payors  nor can we be sure that procedures using our products will qualify for reimbursement from third party payors 
for example  we have been informed that some third party payors regard imrt as investigational or experimental and do not provide reimbursement for these services at this time 
foreign countries also have their own health care reimbursement systems  and we cannot be sure that third party reimbursement will be made available with respect to our products under any foreign reimbursement system 
a further discussion of health care reforms and government funded reimbursement for health care products and services such as ours may be found in business government regulation 
because our products involve the delivery of radiation and diagnostic imaging of the human body and are subject to extensive regulation  product defects may result in material product liability claims  investigation by regulatory authorities or product recalls that could harm future sales and require us to pay material uninsured claims our business exposes us to potential product liability claims that are inherent in the manufacture and sale of medical devices 
because our products involve the delivery of radiation to the human body or are involved in diagnostic imaging of the human body  the possibility for significant injury and or death exists 
the tolerance for error in the design  manufacture  or use of our products may be small or nonexistent 
as such  we may face substantial liability to patients for damages resulting from the faulty design  manufacture and servicing of our products 
we may also be subject to claims for property damages related to any errors or defects in our products 
in any accident case  we could be subject to legal costs whether or not our products or services were a factor 
in addition  if a product we designed or manufactured is defective  whether due to design or manufacturing defects  improper use of the product or other reasons  we may be required to notify regulatory authorities and or to recall the product  possibly at our expense 
a required notification to a regulatory authority or recall could result in an investigation by regulatory authorities of our products  which could in turn result in required recalls  restrictions on the sale of the products or other civil or criminal penalties 
the adverse publicity resulting from any of these actions could cause customers to review and potentially terminate their relationships with us 
these investigations or recalls  especially if accompanied by unfavorable publicity or termination of customer contracts  could result in our incurring substantial costs  losing revenues and loss of reputation  each of which would harm our business 
we have historically maintained limited product liability insurance coverage in an amount we deem sufficient for each of our businesses 
these product liability insurance policies are expensive and have deductible amounts and self insured retentions 
in the future  these policies may not be available on acceptable terms or in sufficient amounts  if at all 
in addition  the insurance coverage we have obtained may not be adequate 
a successful claim brought against us in excess of our insurance coverage or any material claim for which insurance coverage is denied or limited and for which indemnification is not available would require us to pay such uncovered amounts  which could be substantial 
the markets in which we compete are highly competitive  and we may lose market share to companies with greater resources or who are able to develop more effective technologies  or we could be forced to reduce our prices the radiation therapy equipment and software markets in which we compete are characterized by rapidly evolving technology  intense competition and pricing pressure 
our products and services compete with those of a substantial number of foreign and domestic companies 
some of these companies have greater financial  marketing and other resources than we have 
also  we expect that the rapid technological changes occurring in our markets will lead to the entry of new competitors 
our ability to compete successfully depends in part on our ability to commercialize new products ahead of our competitors 
in our sales of linear accelerators and treatment simulation and verification products  we compete primarily with siemens  elekta and nucletron 
we compete with a variety of companies  such as impac medical systems  inc  philips  computerized medical systems  inc  nomos  nucletron and elekta  in our software systems and accessories business and in our brachytherapy business  we compete primarily with nucletron 
for the service and maintenance business for our products  we compete with independent service organizations and our customers internal service organizations 
the market place for x ray tube products is extremely competitive 
all of the major diagnostic imaging systems companies  which are the primary customers of our x ray products business  also manufacture x ray tubes for use in their own products 
we must compete with these in house x ray tube manufacturing operations that are naturally favored by their parent companies 
as a result  we must have a competitive advantage in one or more significant areas  which may include lower product cost  better product quality or superior technology 
we sell a significant volume of our x ray tube products to companies such as toshiba corporation  hitachi medical corporation  shimadzu corporation  philips medical systems and ge medical systems  all of which have in house x ray tube production capability 
in addition  we compete against other stand alone x ray tube manufacturers such as comet ag and iae industria applicazioni elettroniche spa 
in each of our market segments  existing competitors actions and new entrants may have an adverse impact on our sales and profitability 
these competitors could develop technologies and products that are more effective than those we currently use or produce or that could render our products obsolete or noncompetitive 
in addition  the timing of competitors introduction of products into the market could affect the market acceptance and market share of our products 
if we are unable to develop competitive products  gain regulatory approval and supply commercial quantities of such products to the market as quickly and effectively as our competitors  market acceptance of our products may be limited and our sales reduced 
in addition  some of our smaller competitors could be acquired by larger companies that have greater financial strength  which could enable them to compete more aggressively 
some of our suppliers or distributors could also be acquired by competitors  which could disrupt these supply or distribution arrangements 
a further discussion of competition in our markets may be found in business competition 
we may incur substantial costs in protecting our intellectual property  and if we are not able to do so  our competitive position would be harmed we file applications as appropriate for patents covering new products and manufacturing processes 
we cannot be sure  however  that our patents  patents that will issue from any of our pending or future patent applications or patents for technologies licensed to us  or that the claims allowed under any issued patents  will be sufficiently broad to protect our technology position against competitors 
issued patents owned by  or licensed to  us may be challenged  invalidated or circumvented  or the rights granted under the patent may not provide us with competitive advantages 
we could incur substantial costs and diversion of management resources if we have to assert our patent rights against others 
an unfavorable outcome to any such litigation could harm us 
in addition  we may not be able to detect infringement or may lose competitive position in the market before we do so 
we also rely on a combination of copyright  trade secret and other laws  and contractual restrictions on disclosure  copying and transferring title  including confidentiality agreements with vendors  strategic partners  co developers  employees  consultants and other third parties  to protect our proprietary rights 
we cannot assure you that such protections will prove adequate and that contractual agreements will not be breached  that we will have adequate remedies for any such breaches  or that our trade secrets will not otherwise become known to or independently developed by others 
we have trademarks  both registered and unregistered  that are maintained and enforced to provide customer recognition for our products in the marketplace 
we cannot assure you that our trademarks will not be used by unauthorized third parties 
we also have agreements with third parties that provide for licensing of patented or proprietary technology 
these agreements include royalty bearing licenses and technology cross licenses 
if we were to lose the rights to license this technology  or our costs to license the technology were to materially increase  our business would suffer 
third parties may claim we are infringing their intellectual property  and we could suffer significant litigation or licensing expenses or be prevented from selling our products the industries in which we compete are characterized by a substantial amount of litigation over patent and other intellectual property rights 
our competitors  like companies in many high technology businesses  continually review other companies products for possible conflicts with their own intellectual property rights 
determining whether a product infringes a third party s intellectual property rights involves complex legal and factual issues  and the outcome of this type of litigation is often uncertain 
third parties may claim that we are infringing their intellectual property rights  and we may be found to infringe those intellectual property rights 
while we do not believe that any of our products infringe the valid intellectual property rights of third parties  we may not be aware of intellectual property rights of others that relate to our products  services or technologies 
from time to time  we have received notices from third parties alleging infringement of patent or other intellectual property rights relating to their products 
such claims are often  but not always  settled by mutual agreement satisfactorily without litigation 
any contest regarding patents or other intellectual property could by costly and time consuming  and could divert our management and key personnel from our business operations 
we cannot assure you that we will prevail in any such contest 
if we are unsuccessful  we may be subject to significant damages or injunctions against development and sale of our products  or may be required to enter into costly royalty or license agreements 
we cannot assure you that any licenses required would be made available on acceptable terms or at all 
since we depend upon a limited group of suppliers  and in some cases sole source suppliers  for some product components  the loss of a supplier could reduce our ability to manufacture products  cause material delays in our ability to deliver products  or significantly increase our costs we obtain some of the components included in our products from a limited group of suppliers  or in some cases a single source supplier  for example  the source wires for high dose afterloaders  klystrons for linear accelerators  imaging panels  non coated array sensors and coating for array sensors for the flat panels  specialized integrated circuits for imaging subassemblies  and some targets  housings and glass bulbs for x ray tubes 
if we lose any of these suppliers  we would be required to obtain one or more replacement suppliers and may be required to conduct a significant level of product development to incorporate new parts into our products 
we believe that we may be able to obtain alternative sources for such components when necessary  although the need to change suppliers or to alternate between suppliers might cause material delays in delivery or significantly increase costs 
although we have obtained limited insurance to protect against business interruption loss  there can be no assurance that such coverage will be adequate or that such coverage will continue to remain available on acceptable terms  if at all 
disruptions or loss of any of our limited or sole source components or subassemblies  including the ones referenced above  could adversely affect our business and financial results and could result in damage to customer relationships 
if we are unable to provide the significant education and training required for the health care market to accept our products  our business will suffer in order to achieve market acceptance for our products  we are often required to educate physicians about the use of a new procedure  overcome physician objections to some of the effects of the product or its related treatment regimen  convince health care payors that the benefits of the product and its related treatment regimen outweigh its costs and help train qualified physicists in the skilled use of our products 
for example  the complexity and dynamic nature of imrt requires significant education of hospitals and physicians regarding the benefits of imrt and the required departures from customary practices 
we have expended and will continue to expend significant resources on marketing and educational efforts to create awareness of imrt generally and to encourage acceptance and adoption of our imrt related products 
we expect that igrt will also require similar substantial education and training efforts to gain awareness  knowledge of benefits versus costs and widespread acceptance and use of igrt and our products 
the timing of our competitors introduction of products and the market acceptance of their products may also make this educational process more difficult 
we cannot be sure that any products we develop will gain any significant market acceptance and market share among physicians  patients and health care payors  even if required regulatory approvals are obtained 
the nature of our business exposes us to environmental claims or cleanup expenses  which could cause us to pay significant amounts we are subject to a variety of environmental laws around the world regulating the handling  storage  transport and disposal of hazardous materials and imposing liability for the cleanup of contamination from these materials that do or may create increased costs for some of our operations 
for example  several countries  including those in the european union  are implementing regulations that would require manufacturers to take back  recycle and dispose of products  or bear the cost of such disposal  at the end of the equipment s useful life and to restrict the use of some hazardous substances sold in those countries 
these types of regulations impose additional costs for us to do business in such countries as compared to the costs we have today 
in addition  we may be required to incur significant additional costs to comply with future changes in environmental laws and regulations or new laws or regulations 
although we follow procedures that we consider appropriate under existing regulations  these procedures can be costly and we cannot completely eliminate the risk of contamination or injury from these materials  and  in the event of such an incident  we could be held liable for any damages that result 
in addition  we could be assessed fines or penalties for failure to comply with environmental laws and regulations 
these costs  and any future violations or liability under environmental laws or regulations  could have a material adverse effect on our business 
for a further discussion of environmental matters relating to our business  see environmental matters 
we may not be able to maintain or expand our business if we are not able to retain  hire and integrate sufficient qualified personnel our future success depends to a significant extent on the continued service of members of our key executive  technical  sales  marketing and engineering staff 
it also depends on our ability to attract  expand  integrate train and retain our management team  qualified engineering personnel and technical personnel 
the loss of services of key employees could adversely affect our business 
competition for such personnel can be intense 
we compete for key personnel with other medical equipment and software manufacturers and technology companies  as well as universities and research institutions 
because the competition for qualified personnel is intense  costs related to compensation could increase significantly if supply decreases or demand increases 
if we are unable to hire  train or retain qualified personnel  we will not be able to maintain and expand our business 
a high percentage of our sales are international  and economic  political and other risks associated with international sales and operations could adversely affect our sales or make them less predictable we conduct business globally 
international sales accounted for approximately  and of sales in fiscal years  and  respectively 
as a result  we must provide significant service and support on a worldwide basis  and we have sales and service offices located throughout europe  asia  latin america and australia 
in addition  we have manufacturing and research operations in england  germany  switzerland and finland 
we have invested substantial financial and management resources to develop an international infrastructure to meet the needs of our customers 
we intend to continue to expand our presence in international markets  although we cannot be sure we will able to compete successfully in the international market or meet the service and support needs of such customers 
accordingly  our future results could be harmed by a variety of factors  including the difficulties in enforcing agreements and collecting receivables through many foreign country s legal systems  the longer payment cycles associated with many foreign customers  the possibility that foreign countries may impose additional withholding taxes or otherwise tax our foreign income  impose tariffs or adopt other restrictions on foreign trade  fluctuations in exchange rates  which may affect product demand and adversely affect the profitability in us dollars of products and services provided by us in foreign markets where payment for our products and services is made in the local currency  our ability to obtain us export licenses and other required export or import licenses or approvals  changes in the political  regulatory  safety or economic conditions in a country or region  and the protection of intellectual property in foreign countries may be more difficult to enforce 
also  historically our sales into the international regions have had lower average selling prices and margins 
so  to the extent the geographic distribution of our sales shifts more towards our international regions or we are unable to predict the overall geographic distribution of sales  our overall sales and gross margins may be negatively affected 
our results may be adversely affected by changes in exhange rates we sell our products internationally and are subject to market risk due to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates 
we manage this risk through established policies and procedures that include the use of derivative financial instruments 
we have historically entered into foreign currency forward exchange contracts to mitigate the effects of operational sales orders and balance sheet exposures to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates 
our forward exchange contracts generally range from one to twelve months in original maturity 
although we engage in hedging strategies that may offset the effect of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates  the protection these strategies provide will be affected by the timing of transactions  the effectiveness of the hedges measured by how closely the changes in fair value of the hedging instrument offset the changes in fair value of the hedged item  forecast volatility and the extent of movement of exchange rates 
if our hedging strategies are not effective in offsetting the effect of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates  our operating results may be harmed 
in addition  long term movements in currency rates could affect the competitiveness of our products 
even though sales of our products internationally occurs predominantly in local currencies  our cost structure is largely us dollar based  and some of our competitors may have cost structures based in other currencies  so our overall margins and pricing competitiveness may be adversely affected 
if we are not able to match our manufacturing capacity with demand for our products  our financial results may suffer as a manufacturer of medical devices with a long production cycle  we need to anticipate demand for our products in order to ensure adequate manufacturing capacity 
we cannot assure you that we will be successfully able to do so 
if our manufacturing capacity does not keep pace with product demand  we will not be able to fulfill orders in a timely manner which in turn may have a negative effect on our financial results and overall business 
conversely  if demand for our products decrease  the fixed costs associated with excess manufacturing capacity may adversely affect our financial results 
we sell our x ray tubes to a limited number of oem customers  many of whom are also our competitors  for some of our x ray tubes  and the loss or reduction in purchasing volume by one or more of these customers or the continued consolidation among oems in the x ray tube products market could reduce our sales of x ray tube products we sell our x ray computed tomography tubes to a limited number of oem customers  many of whom are also our competitors 
the loss of  or reduction in purchasing volume by one or more of these customers would have a material adverse affect on our x ray tubes business 
the core oem medical x ray tube business declined in fiscal years and we also have noticed a trend toward consolidation in the oem markets of our x ray tubes business over the past few years 
the ongoing consolidation of customers  who purchase our x ray tube products  including the consolidation of these customers into companies that already manufacture x ray tubes  could result in less predictable and reduced sales of our x ray tubes products 
in addition  our oem customer s products  which use our tubes  could lose market share to competitive products or technologies 
we may attempt to acquire new businesses  products or technologies and  if we are unable successfully to complete these acquisitions  or to integrate acquired businesses  products  technology or employees  we may fail to realize expected benefits or harm our existing business our success will depend  in part  on our ability to expand our product offerings and grow our core business in response to changing technologies  customer demands and competitive pressures 
in some circumstances  we may determine to do so through the acquisition of complementary businesses  products or technologies rather than internal development 
for example  in fiscal year we acquired argus software  a quality assurance software company  and the hdr or high dose rate  brachytherapy business of mds nordion  a manufacturer of hdr brachytherapy afterloaders 
in october  we acquired zmed  inc  a provider of radiation oncology software and accessories for ultrasound based  image guided radiotherapy  stereotactic radiation treatments and image management to our suite of products 
we also signed a letter of intent to form a three year joint venture in japan with mitsubishi electric corp 
under the letter of intent  the joint venture will sell our full line of radiotherapy products and  for the first two years of the joint venture  mitsubishi electric corp 
s medical linear accelerators and will also service and support all of these products 
we are to be the majority owner of the venture  and we will acquire mitsubishi electric corp 
s share of the joint venture at the end of three years 
the identification of suitable acquisition candidates can be difficult  time consuming and costly  and we may not be able to successfully complete identified acquisitions 
for example  in fiscal year we were unable to complete a proposed acquisition of impac medical systems  and recorded charge for acquisition expenses 
we may not be able to successfully integrate newly acquired organizations  products or technologies  and the process could be expensive  time consuming and may strain our resources 
in addition  we may be unable to retain employees of acquired companies  or their customers  suppliers  distributors or other partners who are our competitors or who have relationships with our competitors 
consequently  we may not achieve anticipated benefits and could harm our existing business 
in addition  future acquisitions could result in potentially dilutive issuances of equity securities or the incurrence of debt  contingent liabilities or expenses  any of which could harm our business 
we utilize distributors for a portion of our sales  the loss of which could harm our sales in the territory serviced by these distributors we have strategic relationships with a number of key distributors for sales and service of our products  principally in foreign countries 
if these strategic relationships are terminated and not replaced  our sales and or ability to service our products in the territories serviced by these distributors could be adversely affected 
interoperability of our products with one another and their compatibility of our products with third party products is becoming increasingly important  and if we are unable to make our products interoperate with one another or compatible with widely used third party products  sales of our products could decrease as radiation oncology treatment becomes more and more complex  our customers are increasingly concerned about the interoperability and compatibility of the various products they use in providing treatment to patients 
for example  our linear accelerators  treatment simulators  treatment verification products and treatment planning and information management software products are designed to interoperate with one another  and to be compatible with other widely used third party radiation oncology products 
obtaining and maintaining this interoperability and compatibility is costly and time consuming  and when third parties modify the design or functionality of their products  it can require us to modify our products to ensure compatibility 
in addition  our ability to obtain compatibility with third party products can be dependent on the third parties providing us with adequate information regarding their products 
these third parties are in many cases our competitors and accordingly the timing of their product changes  and of sharing relevant information with us  may be made to place us at a competitive disadvantage 
we could further be required to obtain additional regulatory clearances for any modification of our products 
it is also possible that  despite our best efforts  we might be unable to make our products interoperable or compatible with widely used third party products or might only be able to do so at a prohibitive expense  making our products more costly or less attractive to our customers 
fluctuations in our operating results may cause our stock price to be volatile  which could cause losses to our stockholders we have and expect in the future to experience fluctuations in our operating results 
the timing and amount of revenues are subject to a number of factors that make it difficult to estimate revenues and operational results prior to the end of any quarter 
many of our products require significant capital expenditures 
accordingly  some of our sales are quite large in dollar amounts  and the timing of these sales could affect our quarterly earnings 
factors that may affect timing of these sales and adversely affect our quarterly operating results include delay in shipment due  for example  to unanticipated construction delays  cancellations by customers  natural disasters  port strikes or unexpected manufacturing difficulties  delay in the installation and or acceptance of a product  or an unexpected change in a customer s financial condition or ability to obtain financing 
furthermore  our quarterly operating results may also be affected by a number of other factors  including changes in our or our competitors pricing or discount levels  changes or anticipated changes in third party reimbursement amounts or policies applicable to treatments using our products  seasonality of revenue  changes in foreign currency exchange rates  changes in the relative portion of our revenue represented by our various products  timing of the announcement  introduction and delivery of new products or product enhancements by us and by our competitors  disruptions in the supply or changes in the costs of raw materials  labor  product components or transportation services  and changes in the general economic conditions in the regions in which we do business 
the possibility that unexpected levels of cancellations of orders or backlog may affect certain assumptions upon which we base our forecasts and predictions of future performance  and the impact of changing levels of sales to sole purchasers of certain of our x ray products 
because many of our operating expenses are based on anticipated capacity levels and a high percentage of such expenses are fixed for the short term  a small variation in the timing of revenue recognition can cause significant variations in operating results from quarter to quarter 
in addition  our orders and backlog cannot necessarily be relied upon as accurate predictors of future revenues as the timing of such revenues is dependent upon completion of customer site preparation and construction  installation scheduling  customer capital budgeting and financing  appropriate regulatory authorizations and other factors 
accordingly  we cannot be sure if or when the orders will mature into revenue 
our operating results in one or more future periods may fall below the expectations of securities analysts and investors 
in that event  the trading price of our common stock would almost certainly decline 
we prepare our financial statements to conform with generally accepted accounting principles  or gaap 
these principles are subject to interpretation by the aicpa  the sec and various other bodies 
a change in interpretations of  or our application of  these principles can have a significant effect on our reported results and may even affect our reporting of transactions completed before a change is announced 
a recurrence of severe respiratory syndrome sars or an occurrence of similar epidemic diseases may negatively affect sales and hinder our operations during the third quarter of fiscal year  our sales and business operations in asia were negatively affected by the outbreak of sars in asia 
a recurrence of a sars outbreak or an occurrence of similar epidemic disease outbreak  especially if such were to occur in our major markets of north america and europe  could likely have adverse consequences on our sales results and business operations 
our operations are vulnerable to interruption or loss due to natural disasters  power loss  strikes and other events beyond our control  which would adversely affect our business we conduct a significant portion of our activities including manufacturing  administration and data processing at facilities located in the state of california and other seismically active areas that have experienced major earthquakes in the past  as well as other natural disasters 
we carry limited earthquake insurance for inventory only 
such coverage may not be adequate or continue to be available at commercially reasonable rates and terms 
in the event of a major earthquake or other disaster affecting our facilities  it could significantly disrupt our operations  delay or prevent product manufacture and shipment for the time required to repair  rebuild or replace our manufacturing facilities  which could be lengthy  and result in large expenses to repair or replace the facilities 
in addition  our facilities  particularly in the state of california may be subject to a shortage of available electrical power and other energy supplies 
such shortages may increase our costs for power and energy supplies or could result in blackouts  which could disrupt the operations of our affected facilities and harm our business 
in addition  our products are typically shipped from a limited number of ports  and any natural disaster  strike or other event blocking shipment from such ports could delay or prevent shipments and harm our business 
our stockholder rights plan and provisions of our certificate of incorporation may discourage a take over and therefore limit the price of our common stock we have a stockholder rights plan that  under specific circumstances  would significantly dilute the equity interest in our company of a person or persons seeking to acquire control of our company without the prior approval of our board of directors 
our certificate of incorporation also includes provisions that may make an acquisition of control of our company without the approval of our board of directors more difficult 
such stockholder rights plan and provisions in our certificate of incorporation may discourage take over attempts and limit the price of our common stock 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk we are exposed to two primary types of market risks foreign currency exchange rate risk and interest rate risk 
foreign currency exchange as a global entity  we are exposed to adverse movements in foreign currency exchange rates 
these exposures may change over time and could have a material adverse impact on our financial results 
our primary exposures for currency exchange rates relate to the significant number of international sales and purchase transactions in europe  asia and australia denominated in non us currencies 
we manage financial exposures through a controlled program of risk management and establish policies and procedures that includes the use of derivative financial instruments 
we sell products throughout the world  often in the currency of the customer s economy  and adhere to a policy of hedging firmly committed sales orders 
these firmly committed foreign currency sales orders due for shipment in the next months are hedged with forward exchange contracts 
we primarily enter into foreign currency forward exchange contracts to reduce the effects of fluctuating foreign currency exchange rates 
we do not enter into forward exchange contracts for trading purposes 
our forward exchange contracts generally range from one to twelve months in original maturity 
as of september   we did not have any forward exchange contracts with an original maturity greater than one year 
we also hedge the balance sheet exposures from our various foreign subsidiaries and business units having us dollar functional currencies 
we enter into these foreign exchange forward contracts monthly to minimize the short term impact of foreign currency fluctuations on assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the us dollar functional currency 
the notional value of sold forward exchange contracts outstanding as of september  totaled million 
the notional value of purchased forward exchange contracts outstanding as of september  totaled million 
the notional amounts of forward exchange contracts are not a measure of our exposure 
an adverse move in currency exchange rates would decrease the fair value of the contracts 
however  if this occurred  the fair value of the underlying exposures hedged by the contracts would increase by a similar manner 
accordingly  we believe that our hedging strategy should yield no material net impact to our results of operations or cash flows 
fiscal year end dollars in millions notional value sold notional value purchased unrealized loss fair value australian dollar british pound canadian dollar danish krone 
euro japanese yen new zealand dollar norwegian krone swedish krona swiss franc thailand baht totals the fair value of forward exchange contracts generally reflects the estimated amounts that we would receive or pay to terminate the contracts at the reporting date  thereby taking into account and approximating the current unrealized and realized gains or losses of the open contracts 
interest rate risk our market risk exposure to changes in interest rates relates primarily to our investment portfolio 
our investment portfolio includes highly liquid instruments in short term investments as well as a portion in long term investments 
we would consider additional debt obligations to support general corporate purposes  including working capital requirements  capital expenditures and acquisitions 
to date  we have not used derivative financial instruments such as interest rate swaps to hedge the interest rate risk in our investment portfolio or long term debt  but may consider the use of derivative instruments in the future 
the principal amount of cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities at september  totaled million with a related weighted average interest rate of 
our long term debt of million at september  carries a weighted average fixed interest rate of per annum with principal payments due in various installments over a ten year period  beginning in the table below presents principal amounts and related weighted average interest rates by year for our cash and cash equivalents  marketable securities and debt obligations 
fiscal year dollars in millions thereafter total assets cash and cash equivalents average interest rate marketable securities average interest rate liabilities long term debt average interest rate the estimated fair value of our cash and cash equivalents of which was held abroad at september  and could be subject to additional taxation if it was repatriated in the us and marketable securities approximates the principal amounts reflected above based on the maturities of these financial instruments 
the fair value of our long term debt is estimated based on the current rates available to us for debt of similar terms and remaining maturities 
under this method  the fair value of our long term debt is estimated to be million at september  we determined the estimated fair value amount by using available market information and commonly accepted valuation methodologies 
however  it requires considerable judgment in interpreting market data to develop estimates of fair value 
accordingly  the fair value estimate presented is not necessarily indicative of the amount that we or holders of the instrument could realize in a current market exchange 
the use of different assumptions and or estimation methodologies may have a material effect on the estimated fair value 
although payments under certain of our operating leases for our facilities are tied to market indices  we are not exposed to material interest rate risk associated with our operating leases
