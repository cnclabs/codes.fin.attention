ffo does not represent cash generated from operations as defined by accounting principles generally accepted in the united states gaap and is not indicative of cash available to fund all cash needs  including distributions 
it should not be considered as an alternative to net income for the purpose of evaluating the company s performance or to cash flows as a measure of liquidity 
nareit defines ffo as net income computed in accordance with gaap  excluding gains or losses from sales of property  plus depreciation and amortization  and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures 
effective january   nareit clarified the definition of ffo to include non recurring events except those that are defined as extraordinary items under gaap 
the reconciliations of net income to ffo for the years ended december     and are as follows reconciliation of net income loss to funds from operations for the years ended december  net income loss depreciation of real estate and amortization of leasing costs wholly owned and consolidated partnerships unconsolidated partnerships income loss attributable to minority interest gain loss on sale of properties impairment of real estate extraordinary item loss on extinguishment of debt cumulative effect of change in accounting principle funds from operations notes effective january   nareit clarified the definition of ffo to include non recurring events except those that are defined as extraordinary items under gaap

historical cash flow the following discussion of historical cash flow compares the company s cash flow for the year ended december  with the company s cash flow for the year ended december  
cash and cash equivalents were million and million at december  and  respectively 
the increase of million was a result of the following increases and decreases in cash flows amounts in millions years ended december  variance net cash provided by operating activities net cash provided by used in investing activities net cash used in financing activities net cash provided by discontinued operations the variance in net cash provided by operating activities resulted from an increase of million in operating income before non cash expenses in  which was primarily due to million of lease termination income received in and lower interest expense due to lower average interest rates on the portfolio mortgage debt 
this increase was partially offset by a net decrease in cash provided by changes in operating assets and liabilities of million  primarily rents receivable 
the variance in net cash provided by used in investing activities was primarily the result of an increase of million received in from the collection of purchase money notes from the sale of properties  offset by an increase of million in expenditures for real estate acquisitions  development and tenant installation costs in and an additional million investment in an unconsolidated partnership in 
back to contents the increase in net cash used in financing activities resulted primarily from million of cash used in for the company s tender offer and a decrease of million of cash provided by additional borrowings in this was partially offset by million of additional cash used in for the repayment of debt and million used in for the redemption of common op units 
the increase in net cash provided by discontinued operations resulted from additional cash used in for the repayment of debt 
this increase was offset by a decrease in operating income before non cash expenses in  a decrease in net sales proceeds received in and a decrease in cash provided by additional borrowings in critical accounting policies management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based upon the company s consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with gaap 
the preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses 
the company bases its estimates on historical experience and assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
the company believes the following critical accounting policies affect the significant judgments and estimates used by the company in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements 
valuation of property held for use and sale on a quarterly basis  the company reviews the carrying value of both properties held for use and for sale 
the company records impairment losses and reduces the carrying value of properties when indicators of impairment are present and the expected undiscounted cash flows related to those properties are less than their carrying amounts 
in cases where the company does not expect to recover its carrying costs on properties held for use  the company reduces its carrying cost to fair value  and for properties held for sale  the company reduces its carrying value to the fair value less costs to sell 
for the years ended december  and  impairment losses of  and million were recognized related to sold properties 
management does not believe that the value of the remaining properties held for sale or properties in use are impaired as of december bad debts the company maintains an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of tenants to make payments on arrearages in billed rents  as well as the likelihood that tenants will not have the ability to make payment on unbilled rents including estimated expense recoveries and straight line rent 
as of december   the company had recorded an allowance for doubtful accounts of million 
if the financial condition of the company s tenants were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
inflation the company s long term leases contain provisions designed to mitigate the adverse impact of inflation on the company s net income 
such provisions include clauses enabling the company to receive percentage rents based on tenants gross sales  which generally increase as prices rise  and or  in certain cases  escalation clauses  which generally increase rental rates during the terms of the leases 
such escalation clauses are often related to increases in the consumer price index or similar inflation indexes 
in addition  many of the company s leases are for terms of less than ten years  which permits the company to seek to increase rents upon re rental at market rates if current rents are below the then existing market rates 
most of the company s leases require the tenants to pay their share of operating expenses  including common area maintenance  real estate taxes  insurance and utilities  thereby reducing the company s exposure to increases in costs and operating expenses resulting from inflation
