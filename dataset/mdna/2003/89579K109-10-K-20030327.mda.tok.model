ebitda is used by management to evaluate financial performance and resource allocation for each facility and for triad as a whole 
ebitda is commonly used as an analytical indicator within the health care industry  and also serves as a measure of leverage capacity and debt service ability 
ebitda should not be considered as a measure of financial performance under generally accepted accounting principles  and the items excluded from ebitda are significant components in understanding and assessing financial performance 
ebitda should not be considered in isolation or as an alternative to net income  cash flows generated by operating  investing or financing activities or other financial statement data presented in the consolidated financial statements as an indicator of financial performance or liquidity 
because ebitda is not a measurement determined in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and is thus susceptible to varying calculations  ebitda as presented may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other companies

item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview on april   triad completed the merger of quorum with and into triad with triad being the surviving corporation 
the purchase price was approximately billion 
the merger was accounted for under the purchase method of accounting and the results of operations for quorum are included in triad s results of operations beginning may  on may   triad sold two of the acute care hospitals acquired in the merger with quorum for million plus million for working capital 
additionally  one hospital acquired in the merger with quorum was designated as held for sale prior to the completion of the merger 
the purchase price allocation of this hospital was equal to the sales price of the hospital plus the cash flows for its holding period and the interest expense on the incremental debt incurred for the purchase of the hospital 
on august   triad sold this hospital 
the results of operations of this entity are not included in triad s results of operations 
in  subsequent to the merger  triad recorded charges of approximately million associated with coordinating quorum s accounting policies  practices and estimation processes with those of triad 
these charges included an million pre tax reduction to revenue  million pre tax increase in provision for doubtful accounts and million additional income tax provision 
during  triad opened one new hospital and acquired all of the assets comprising  and a interest in the operations of  one hospital 
during  triad acquired the remaining interest in one of its joint ventures and sold one hospital 
during  triad sold one hospital  ceased operations of two hospitals and purchased two hospitals 
triad sold its partnership interest in a rehabilitation hospital on march  the above described events significantly affect the comparability of the results of operations for the years ended december    and forward looking statements this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations contains disclosures which are forward looking statements 
forward looking statements include all statements that do not relate solely to historical or current facts  and can be identified by the use of words such as may  believe  will  expect  project  estimate  anticipate  plan or continue 
these forward looking statements are based on the current plans and expectations of triad and are subject to a number of uncertainties and risks that could significantly affect current plans and expectations and the future financial condition and results of triad 
these factors include  but are not limited to  the highly competitive nature of the health care business  the efforts of insurers  health care providers and others to contain health care costs  possible changes in medicare  medicaid and other government programs that may limit reimbursements to health care providers and insurers  changes in federal  state or local regulation affecting the health care industry  the possible enactment of federal or state health care reform  the ability to attract and retain qualified management and personnel  including physicians and nurses  the departure of key executive officers from triad  claims and legal actions relating to professional liabilities and other matters  fluctuations in the market value of triad common stock  changes in accounting standards  changes in general economic conditions or geo political events  future acquisitions or divestitures which may result in additional charges  the ability to enter into managed care provider arrangements on acceptable terms  the availability and terms of capital to fund the expansion of triad s business  changes in business strategy or development plans  the ability to obtain adequate levels of general and professional liability insurance  potential adverse impact of known and unknown government investigations  timeliness of reimbursement payments received under government programs  and other risk factors described herein 
as a consequence  current plans  anticipated actions and future financial condition and results may differ from those expressed in any forward looking statements made by or on behalf of triad 
you are cautioned not to unduly rely on such forward looking statements when evaluating the information presented in this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
critical accounting policies and estimates triad s discussion and analysis of its financial condition and results of operations are based upon triad s consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires triad to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an ongoing basis  triad evaluates its estimates  including those related to third party payer discounts  bad debts  property and equipment  intangible assets  goodwill  income taxes  general and professional liability risks and contingencies and litigation 
triad bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
triad believes the following critical accounting policies affect its more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition triad s health care facilities have entered into agreements with third party payers  including government programs and managed care health plans  under which the facilities are paid based upon several methodologies including established charges  the cost of providing services  predetermined rates per diagnosis  fixed per diem rates or discounts from established charges 
revenues are recorded at estimated net amounts due from patients  third party payers and others for health care services provided 
settlements under reimbursement agreements with third party payers are estimated and recorded in the period the related services are rendered and are adjusted in future periods as adjustments become known or as the service years are no longer subject to audit  review or investigation 
laws and regulations governing the medicare and medicaid programs are extremely complex  subject to interpretation and are routinely modified for provider reimbursement 
all hospitals participating in the medicare and medicaid programs are required to meet certain financial reporting requirements 
federal regulations require submission of annual cost reports covering medical costs and expenses associated with the services provided by each hospital to program beneficiaries 
annual cost reports required under the medicare and medicaid programs are subject to routine audits  which may result in adjustments to the amounts ultimately determined to be due to triad under these reimbursement programs 
these audits often require several years to reach the final determination of amounts earned under the programs 
as a result  there is at least a reasonable possibility that recorded estimates will change by a material amount in the near term 
bad debt triad maintains allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from payers inability to make payments on accounts 
triad estimates these allowances based on historical net write offs of uncollectible accounts 
triad s policy is to write off accounts after all collection efforts have failed  typically no longer than one year after date of discharge 
if payers ability to pay deteriorates  additional allowances may be required 
property  equipment and amortizable intangible assets triad evaluates the carrying value of long lived assets  long lived assets to be disposed of and amortizable intangible assets and recognizes impairment losses when the fair value is less than the carrying value 
the fair value of assets to be held and used is determined using discounted future cash flows 
the fair value of assets held for sale is determined using estimated selling values 
when events  circumstances and operating results indicate that the carrying values of certain long lived assets and amortizable intangible assets might be impaired  triad prepares projections of the undiscounted future cash flows expected to result from the use of the assets and their eventual disposition 
if the projections indicate that the recorded amounts are not expected to be recoverable  such amounts are reduced to estimated fair value 
indicators of potential impairment are typically beyond the control of management 
if market conditions become less favorable than those projected by management  impairments may be required 
goodwill triad reviews goodwill for impairment annually or more frequently if certain indicators arise 
goodwill is reviewed at the reporting unit level  which is defined as one level below an operating segment 
triad estimates fair values of the reporting units using discounted future cash flows 
impairment is recognized if the fair value of the reporting unit is less than the carrying value of the reporting unit 
if market conditions become less favorable than those projected by management  then impairments may be required 
income taxes triad records a valuation allowance to reduce its deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
while triad has considered several items including ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for the valuation allowance  in the event triad were to determine that the realization of its deferred tax asset in the future is different than its net recorded amount  an adjustment to income would be necessary 
general and professional liability risks triad self insures portions of its workers compensation  health insurance and general and professional liability insurance coverage and maintains excess loss policies 
the liabilities estimated for these self insured portions are based on actuarially determined estimates 
there are many factors that are used in determining the estimates  including amount and timing of historical payments  severity of individual cases and anticipated volume of services provided 
the amounts of any ultimate actual payments for workers compensation and general and professional liability risks may not become known for several years after incurrence 
any factors changing the underlying data used in determining these estimates would result in revisions to the liabilities which could result in an adjustment to income 
contingencies triad is subject to claims and suits arising from governmental investigations and other matters in the ordinary course of business 
in certain of these actions the claimants may seek punitive damages against triad  which are usually not covered by insurance 
triad is required to assess the likelihood of any adverse judgments or outcomes to these matters as well as potential ranges of probable losses 
a determination of the amount of recorded liability  if any  for these contingencies is made after careful analysis of each individual issue 
the recorded liability may change in the future due to new developments in each matter or changes in approach  such as a change in settlement strategy in dealing with these matters  which could result in an adjustment to income 
results of operations revenue volume trends as discussed previously  triad completed the merger with quorum on april  the effective date of the transaction for accounting purposes was may  the facilities acquired in the merger increased revenues by million for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  triad has entered into agreements with third party payers  including government programs and managed care health plans  under which triad s facilities are paid based upon established charges  the cost of providing services  predetermined rates per diagnosis  fixed per diem rates or discounts from established charges 
triad s facilities have experienced revenue growth due to increases in same facility volume growth  changes in patient mix  closure of unprofitable services  favorable pricing trends and contract structure 
there can be no assurances that triad will continue to receive these levels of revenue increases in the future 
these increases were the result of renegotiating and renewing certain managed care contracts on more favorable terms to include more stop losses  carve outs and pass throughs and improved reimbursement from the government 
triad s revenues continue to be affected by a large proportion of revenue being derived from fixed payment  higher discount sources  including medicare  medicaid and managed care plans 
in addition  insurance companies  government programs other than medicare  and employers purchasing health care services for their employees are also negotiating discounted amounts that they will pay health care providers rather than pay standard prices 
triad expects patient volumes from medicare and medicaid to continue to increase due to the general aging of the population and expansion of state medicaid programs 
however  under bba  triad s reimbursement from medicare and medicaid programs has been reduced 
certain of the reductions from bba have been mitigated by the refinement act and have been further mitigated by bipa 
triad received additional reimbursement from bipa of approximately million in both and with an increasing proportion of services being reimbursed based upon fixed payment amounts where the payment is based upon the diagnosis  regardless of the cost incurred or level of service provided  revenues  earnings and cash flows are being impacted 
triad anticipates that these shifts in volumes will continue 
patient revenues related to medicare and medicaid patients were  and of total patient revenues for the years ended december    and  respectively 
patient revenues related to managed care plan patients were  and of total patient revenues for the years ended december    and  respectively 
patient revenues from capitation arrangements prepaid health service agreements are less than of net patient revenues 
see item business reimbursement 
management of triad continues its focus on rationalizing its portfolio of facilities 
in august  triad opened a new acute care hospital in las cruces  new mexico 
on july   triad acquired all of the assets comprising  and a interest in the operations of  a hospital in johnson  arkansas 
revenues for these facilities were not significant in the year ended december  triad sold one hospital during the year ended december  revenues for this facility were million for the year ended december  triad sold one hospital and ceased operations of two hospitals during the year ended december  revenues for these facilities and the facility sold in were million in the year ended december  triad s revenues have been affected by the trend toward certain services being performed more frequently on an outpatient basis 
growth in outpatient services is expected to continue in the health care industry as procedures performed on an inpatient basis are converted to outpatient procedures through continuing advances in pharmaceutical and medical technologies 
the redirection of certain procedures to an outpatient basis is also influenced by pressures from payers to perform certain procedures as outpatient care rather than inpatient care 
triad believes this trend toward outpatient care will continue 
outpatient revenues have remained relatively constant as a percentage of patient revenues for the years ended december   and  respectively 
pressures on the rate of increase in medicare and medicaid reimbursement  large percentages of patient volume being related to patients participating in managed care plans and continuing trends toward more services being performed on an outpatient basis are expected to present ongoing challenges 
the challenges presented by these trends are magnified by triad s inability to control these trends and the associated risks 
to maintain and improve its operating margins in future periods  triad must increase patient volumes and improve contracts while controlling the costs of providing services 
if triad is not able to achieve reductions in the cost of providing services through increased operational efficiencies  and the rate of increase in reimbursements and payments decline  results of operations and cash flows will deteriorate 
management believes that the proper response to these challenges includes the delivery of a broad range of quality health care services to physicians and patients with operating decisions being made by the local management teams and local physicians with the strategic support of corporate management 
in connection with the spin off  hca agreed to indemnify triad for any payments which it is required to make in respect of medicare  medicaid and blue cross cost reports relating to periods ending on or prior to the date of the spin off  and triad agreed to indemnify hca for and pay to hca any payments received by it relating to such cost reports 
triad will be responsible for the filing of these cost reports  which are recorded in accounts receivable in the consolidated balance sheet see note accounting policies revenues in the consolidated financial statements 
triad has recorded a receivable from hca relating to the indemnification of million as of december   which is recorded in other current assets in the consolidated balance sheet 
other trends insurance costs across the industry have been increasing substantially 
triad is facing the same pressures in increasing insurance costs 
triad has an extensive insurance program  with the largest component being general and professional liability insurance 
many of the factors contributing to the increasing costs are beyond triad s control 
to help mitigate the increases in premiums  triad may increase deductibles in these programs  which would increase the risk assumed by triad 
triad currently records liabilities for its estimated retentions 
triad s insurance costs increased approximately in the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  if the trend of increasing costs continues  triad s results of operations and cash flows would be affected

years ended december  and income from operations increased to million in the year ended december  from million in the year ended december  the increase in income from operations was attributable primarily to an increase of million in pre tax income in from from the facilities acquired  excluding charges discussed below  in the quorum acquisition 
pre tax income from same facility operations increased million 
also  triad recorded million of pre tax charges associated with coordinating quorum s accounting policies  practices and estimation processes with those of triad during income from operations also increased million due to changes in accounting for goodwill amortization 
triad also had million in income from litigation settlements in discussed below 
during  triad incurred million of non cash stock compensation expense relating to stock option vesting acceleration that was incurred due to the acquisition of quorum and million of non cash stock option expense from options granted to a charitable foundation 
this was partially offset by an increase in interest expense of million primarily related to the additional indebtedness incurred in the acquisition of quorum 
corporate overhead increased million in compared to  due primarily to additional staffing and other costs due to the merger 
revenues increased to  million in the year ended december  from  million in the year ended december  same facility revenues increased million or in compared to this includes million in favorable prior year cost report settlements during compared to million in favorable prior year cost report settlements during the primary reason for the increase in revenues was due primarily to increases of approximately to from renegotiation and renewal of managed care contracts to include pricing increases and more favorable contract structure in triad anticipates that these increases will be approximately to in for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december   same facility admissions increased  adjusted admissions increased  revenue per adjusted admission increased  outpatient visits increased  outpatient revenue per visit increased and surgeries increased 
revenues for facilities acquired increased million in compared to which included million in favorable prior year cost report settlements in revenues for facilities acquired were reduced in by million in charges associated with coordinating quorum s accounting policies  procedures and estimation processes with those of triad s 
for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december   the acquired facilities admissions increased  adjusted admissions increased  outpatient visits increased  and surgeries increased  the increase in revenues was partially offset by the facility that was sold 
in  this facility had revenues of million 
salaries and benefits which included contract nursing  as a percentage of revenues  decreased to in the year ended december  from in the year ended december  same facility salaries and benefits decreased as a percentage of revenue in compared to this was due primarily to million in non cash stock option expense recognized in described above 
in addition  triad had decreases in estimates in its retirement plan contributions of million in compared to million in this was partially offset by million in estimate increases in triad s health and workers compensation expenses and an increase in the number of full time equivalent employees at the corporate office 
salaries and benefits for the acquired facilities  as a percentage of revenue  were in compared to in due primarily to the revenue reductions in discussed above 
in addition  there were million in duplicate overhead costs and stay on bonuses at the former quorum corporate office and approximately million in severance costs for a reduction in force at qhr in there was also a decrease in estimates in retirement plan contributions of million in this was partially offset by million in estimate increases in health and workers compensation expenses 
included in salaries for the acquired facilities are salaries from owned physician practices  which are higher as a percentage of revenue than traditional hospital operations 
salaries and benefits for the facility sold were million in reimbursable expenses were as a percentage of revenue in the year ended december  compared to for the year ended december  due to the quorum acquisition 
reimbursable expenses relate primarily to salaries and benefits of qhr employees that serve as executives at hospitals managed by qhr 
these expenses are also included as a component of revenues 
supplies as a percentage of revenues remained constant at in the years ended december  and december   respectively 
same facility supplies increased as a percentage of revenue to in compared to in this was due primarily to increased acuity levels

other operating expenses for the acquired facilities  as a percentage of revenue  were in compared to in this was due to approximately increase in insurance costs  primarily malpractice insurance  and the revenue reduction in discussed above 
this was partially offset by a million reduction of a pre acquisition liability in the fourth quarter of as additional information became available on expected settlements 
other operating expenses for the facility sold were million in provision for doubtful accounts  as a percentage of revenues  decreased to in the year ended december  compared to in the year ended december  same facility provision for doubtful accounts decreased as a percentage of revenue in compared to this was due  in part  to increased expenses in relating to emergency room visits  primarily to facilities in texas  which typically have a higher incidence of uninsured accounts  and improved collections in this was partially offset by payment delays and account write offs from system issues at one facility and additional expenses on certain non patient accounts in provision for doubtful accounts for the acquired facilities  as a percentage of revenue  was in compared to in as discussed previously  included in the provision for doubtful accounts were million in charges associated with coordinating quorum s accounting policies  practices and estimation process with those of triad s 
provision for doubtful accounts for the facility sold was million in depreciation and amortization decreased as a percentage of revenues to in the year ended december  from in the year ended december   primarily due to changes in accounting for goodwill amortization and increases in revenues 
see recent accounting pronouncements 
interest expense  which was offset by million and million of interest income in the years ended december  and  respectively  increased to million in the year ended december  from million in the year ended december   due to additional debt outstanding  primarily from indebtedness incurred to finance the quorum acquisition 
this was partially offset by decreases in interest rates on triad s variable rate debt and reductions in debt outstanding 
quorum was involved in a malpractice case in which quorum s insurance company issued a reservation of rights  which means that the insurance company was providing a current defense  but was reserving a right ultimately not to pay the claim 
accordingly  the potential exposure was recorded as a liability as part of the quorum purchase price allocation 
during the third quarter of  triad settled the malpractice case and the insurance company ultimately agreed to pay the claim 
triad recorded the settlement  less remaining legal fees  of million in the third quarter of in june  triad received notification that hca had agreed to reimburse triad for a portion of a settlement on a false claims act case  settled by quorum prior to triad s acquisition 
triad received this reimbursement in the amount of million  in july both items were recorded in litigation settlements in the consolidated statements of operations in the year ended december  gain on sale of assets was million during the year ended december   due primarily to the sale of one hospital facility in the fourth quarter of gain on sale of assets was million during the year ended december  impairments on long lived assets were million in the year ended december  the impairments during were primarily due to the carrying value of the long lived assets related to one hospital being reduced to fair value  based on estimated future cash flows 
minority interests increased to million in the year ended december  from million in the year ended december  due primarily to the quorum acquisition 
equity in earnings of affiliates was million in the year ended december  compared to million in the year ended december  this was primarily due to the joint ventures acquired in the quorum acquisition 
this was partially offset by a loss on the sale of a hospital in one of the non consolidating joint ventures  of which triad s share was million 
income tax provision was million in the year ended december  compared to million in the year ended december  during  triad s effective tax rate was significantly increased by the effect of nondeductible goodwill amortization and esop expense 
as discussed previously  included in the income tax provision in was million in charges associated with coordinating quorum s accounting policies  practices and estimation processes 
triad s effective tax rate was reduced significantly in primarily due to changes in accounting for goodwill amortization 
years ended december  and income from operations increased to million in the year ended december  from million in the year ended december  the change was attributable primarily to million of pre tax income from acquisitions  excluding the charges associated with coordinating quorum s accounting policies  practices  and estimation processes with those of triad 
pre tax income from same facility operations increased million  which included million of unfavorable adjustments in the year ended december  at one facility from write offs of certain expenditures that were previously capitalized 
same facility equity in earnings increased million due primarily to million of unfavorable adjustments from various changes of estimates and other adjustments during the year ended december  another factor contributing to the increase was decreased losses on facilities that were sold or closed of million 
additionally  triad recognized a million gain on the sale of one hospital during the year ended december  compared to a million gain on sale during the year ended december  the decreased losses were offset by million of charges associated with coordinating quorum s accounting policies  practices and estimation processes with those of triad and an increase in interest expense of million primarily related to the additional indebtedness incurred in the acquisition of quorum 
triad had impairments of long lived assets of million in the year ended december  compared to million in the year ended december  triad incurred million of non cash stock compensation expense relating to stock option vesting acceleration that was incurred due to the acquisition of quorum and million of non cash stock compensation from options granted to a charitable foundation established by triad

another factor in the increase in revenues was million in favorable prior year cost report settlements during revenues for the year ended december  included million in favorable prior year cost report settlements and contractual estimate adjustments and million in unfavorable changes of estimate for contractual discounts at one facility 
revenues for facilities acquired were  million in the year ended december   which included million in favorable prior year cost report settlements 
revenues for facilities acquired were reduced by million associated with coordinating quorum s accounting policies  practices and estimation processes with those of triad as discussed previously 
the acquired facilities had admissions of  adjusted admissions of  outpatient visits of  and surgeries of  the increase in revenues was partially offset by the facilities that were sold or closed

salaries and benefits for the acquired facilities  as a percentage of revenue  were in the year ended december  this includes approximately million in duplicate overhead costs and stay on bonuses at the former quorum corporate office and approximately million in severance cost for a reduction in force at qhr 
also included in salaries and benefits for the acquired facilities are salaries from owned physician practices  which are higher as a percentage of revenue than traditional hospital operations

reimbursable expenses were as a percentage of revenue in the year ended december  reimbursable expenses relate primarily to salaries and benefits of qhr employees that serve as executives at hospitals managed by qhr 
these expenses are also included as a component of revenues 
supplies increased as a percentage of revenues to in the year ended december  from in the year ended december  same facility supplies increased as a percentage of revenue in the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  this was due primarily to higher patient acuity and supply cost increases 
additionally  triad had unfavorable adjustments of million in the year ended december  at one facility from the write off of certain expenditures that were previously capitalized 
supplies for the acquired facilities  as a percentage of revenue  were in the year ended december  supplies for the facilities sold or closed were million in the year ended december  compared to million in the year ended december  other operating expenses primarily consisting of contract services  professional fees  repairs and maintenance  rents and leases  utilities  insurance and non income taxes decreased as a percentage of revenues to in the year ended december  compared to in the year ended december  same facility other operating expenses decreased as a percentage of revenue in the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  this decrease was due primarily to the increase in revenues 
this was partially offset by an increase in professional fees at the corporate office

triad also refined the estimation process of the allowance for doubtful accounts resulting in a million reduction in the provision in provision for doubtful accounts for the acquired facilities  as a percentage of revenue  was in the year ended december  as discussed previously  included in the provision for doubtful accounts were million in charges associated with coordinating quorum s accounting policies  practices and estimation process with those of triad 
provision for doubtful accounts for the facilities sold or closed was million in the year ended december  compared to million in the year ended december  depreciation and amortization  as a percentage of revenues  decreased to in the year ended december  compared to in the year ended december  this was due primarily to the increase in revenues 
interest expense  which was offset by million and million of interest income in the year ended december  and  respectively  increased to million in the year ended december  from million in the year ended december   due to additional debt outstanding primarily from indebtedness incurred to finance the quorum acquisition and a decrease in interest income 
gain on sale of assets was million during the year ended december   due primarily to the sale of one hospital facility in the fourth quarter of gain on sale of assets was million during the year ended december   due primarily to the sale of one hospital facility and triad s partnership interest in a rehabilitation hospital 
impairments on long lived assets were million in the year ended december  and million in the year ended december  the impairments during were primarily due to the carrying value of the long lived assets related to one hospital being reduced to fair value  based on estimated future cash flows 
the impairments during were primarily due to the carrying value of the long lived assets related to one hospital closed being reduced to fair value  based on estimated disposal value 
minority interests decreased to million in the year ended december  compared to million in the year ended december  this was due primarily to the operations of one hospital joint venture acquired in the quorum acquisition 
equity in earnings loss of affiliates increased to million in the year ended december  from million in the year ended december   primarily due to the quorum acquisition and million of unfavorable adjustments from various changes of estimates and other adjustments during the year ended december  income tax provision was million in the year ended december  compared to million in the year ended december  as discussed previously  included in the income tax provision for the year ended december  was million in charges associated with coordinating quorum s accounting policies  practices and estimation processes

liquidity and capital resources cash provided by operating activities was million in the year ended december  compared to million in the year ended december  the increase was due to the acquisition of quorum and improved same facility operations in compared to this was offset by an increase in accounts receivable and inventories and other assets in compared to in addition  the increase in accounts payable and other liabilities was less in than in  due primarily to timing of payments in cash used in investing activities was million in the year ended december  compared to  million in the year ended december  this was due to  million  net of cash acquired  paid during the year ended december  for the merger with quorum and acquisition of southcrest hospital  compared to million paid for the acquisition of one hospital in distributions received from non consolidating joint ventures increased million in compared to this was partially offset by million in proceeds on the sale of five hospitals  one of which was closed during  in the year ended december  compared to million in proceeds on miscellaneous asset sales during the year ended december  in addition  capital expenditures increased to million in compared to million in triad anticipates expending approximately million approximately million for expansion and development in capital expenditures in cash used in financing activities was million in the year ended december  compared to cash provided by financing activities of  million in the year ended december  this was due to the financing activity as part of the quorum merger in triad filed a shelf registration statement with the sec  which became effective on october  the registration statement provides for the potential issuance of up to million of a variety of securities  including common stock  preferred stock  debt  and warrants 
triad believes that a shelf registration will put it in a position to periodically take advantage of potential strategic or capital markets opportunities 
the registration statement provides that triad intends to use the net proceeds from the sale of any securities for general corporate purposes  including refinancing of indebtedness  working capital  capital expenditures  acquisitions  and repurchases and redemptions of securities 
triad s indebtedness consists of a tranche a term loan of million bearing interest at libor plus at december  with principal amounts due through  a tranche b term loan of million bearing interest at libor plus at december  with principal amounts due through  million of senior notes bearing interest at with principal amounts due in and million of senior subordinated notes  which has unamortized discount of million  bearing interest at with principal amounts due in the senior subordinated notes are callable  at triad s option  in may and the senior notes are callable  at triad s option  in may at december  triad had a million line of credit which bears interest at libor plus 
no amounts were outstanding under the line of credit at december  the revolving credit line reduces to million in  million in and matures in as of december   triad had million in letters of credit outstanding which reduce the amount available under the revolving credit line 
the libor spread on the revolving credit line and the tranche a term loan are subject to reduction depending upon the total leverage of triad 
triad s term loans and revolving lines of credit are collateralized by a pledge of substantially all of its assets other than real estate associated with the quorum facilities 
the debt agreements require that triad comply with various financial ratios and tests and have restrictions  including but not limited to  new indebtedness  asset sales and use of proceeds therefrom  capital expenditures and dividends 
in june  triad completed an amendment to its bank credit facility which favorably modified restrictions on new indebtedness  use of proceeds from debt and equity transactions  capital expenditures and various other restrictions 
triad currently is in compliance with all debt agreement covenants and restrictions 
if an event of default occurs with respect to the debt agreements  then the balances of the term loans and revolving line of credit could become due and payable which could result in other debt obligations of triad also becoming due and payable 
triad has entered into interest rate swap agreements which are designated as cash flow hedges 
in january  triad entered into an interest rate swap agreement  which effectively converts a notional amount of million of floating rate borrowings to fixed rate borrowings

triad is exposed to credit losses in the event of nonperformance by the counterparty

sfas supercedes accounting principles board opinion no 
intangible assets which changes the accounting for goodwill 
the adoption of sfas eliminates the periodic amortization of goodwill and institutes an annual review of the fair value of goodwill 
the elimination of goodwill amortization would have increased net income by million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
impairment of goodwill would be recorded if the fair value of the goodwill is less than the book value 
goodwill is reviewed at the reporting unit level  which is defined in sfas as an operating segment or one level below an operating segment 
triad has determined that the reporting unit for its owned operations segment will be at the division level  which is one level below the segment 
sfas required the completion of the initial step of a transitional impairment test within six months of adoption 
any impairment loss resulting from the transitional impairment test would have been recorded as a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle 
subsequent impairment losses would be reflected in operating income 
triad has determined that the change in impairment testing did not have an impact on triad s results of operations or financial position

the adoption of sfas would impact the results of operations and the financial position of triad if a component of triad s business is designated as held for sale after adoption of sfas components designated as held for sale would be reported separately as discontinued operations with prior periods restated 
currently  triad has not designated any components as held for sale under sfas  but could do so in the future

quorum accrued the estimated liability on these items prior to the merger 
one such matter remains under seal 
with respect to the matter involving the two managed hospitals  the government has requested that quorum conduct a self audit with respect to one medicare cost report for one managed hospital and three other specific issues and that matter remains under seal 
the government has stated that it intends to investigate certain other allegations 
with respect to the complaint involving the owned hospital  triad has settled this matter through the payment to the government of  plus interest to the date of actual payment  and payment of certain attorneys fees to the relators under the complaint 
payment was made on january   and the case has been dismissed with prejudice 
at this time triad cannot predict the final effect or outcome of the ongoing investigations or qui tam action 
if violations of federal or state laws relating to medicare  medicaid or other government programs are found  then triad may be required to pay substantial fines and civil and criminal damages and also may be excluded from participation in the medicare and medicaid programs and other government programs 
similarly  the amount of damages sought in the qui tam actions or in the future may be substantial 
triad could be subject to substantial costs resulting from defending  or from an adverse outcome in  any current or future investigations  administrative proceedings or litigation 
in an effort to resolve one or more of these matters  triad may choose to negotiate a settlement 
amounts paid to settle any of these matters may be material 
agreements entered into as a part of any settlement could also materially adversely affect triad 
any current or future investigations or actions could have a material adverse effect on triad s results of operations or financial position 
from time to time  triad may be the subject of additional investigations or a party to additional litigation which alleges violations of law 
triad may not know about those investigations or about qui tam actions filed against it unless and to the extent such are unsealed 
if any of those matters were successfully asserted against triad  there could be a material adverse effect on triad s business  financial position  results of operations or prospects 
stockholder class action regarding the securities exchange act of quorum was a defendant in a lawsuit filed by certain of its stockholders alleging that quorum violated federal securities laws by materially inflating its net revenues through inclusion of amounts received from the settlement of cost reports allegedly filed in violation of applicable medicare regulations 
the parties agreed to submit the lawsuit to non binding mediation 
quorum had accrued an estimated liability on this item prior to the merger 
during the second quarter of  the parties agreed to a settlement and made payment on the settlement in june income taxes the irs is in the process of conducting an examination of the federal income tax returns of triad for the calendar years ended december  and  and the federal income tax returns of quorum for the fiscal years ended june  and to date the irs has not proposed any adjustments 
the irs has proposed adjustments with respect to partnership returns of income for certain joint ventures in which quorum owned a majority interest for the fiscal years ended june  and the most significant adjustments involve the tax accounting methods adopted for computing bad debt expense  the valuation of purchased hospital property and equipment and related depreciable lives  income recognition related to cost reports and the loss calculation on a taxable liquidation of a subsidiary 
triad has filed protests on behalf of the joint ventures with the appeals division of the irs contesting substantially all of the proposed adjustments 
in the opinion of management  the ultimate outcome of the irs examinations will not have a material effect on triad s results of operations or financial position 
hca litigation and investigations hca is the subject of federal investigations and litigation relating to its business practices 
given the breadth of the ongoing investigations  hca expects continued investigative activity in the future 
the investigations  actions and claims relate to hca and its subsidiaries  including subsidiaries that  prior to the spin off from hca  owned facilities now owned by triad 
hca is also the subject of a formal order of investigation by the sec 
hca understands that the sec s investigation includes the anti fraud  insider trading  periodic reporting and internal accounting control provisions of the federal securities laws 
hca is a defendant in qui tam actions on behalf of the united states of america alleging  in general  submission of improper claims to the government for reimbursement 
the lawsuits seek three times the amount of damages caused to the united states by the submission of any medicare or medicaid false claims presented by the defendants to the federal government  civil damages of not less than  nor more than  for each such medicare or medicaid claim  attorneys fees and costs 
hca has disclosed that of the original qui tam actions  the department of justice remains active in and has elected to intervene in eight actions 
hca also has disclosed that it is aware of additional qui tam actions that remain under seal and believes that there may be other sealed qui tam cases of which it is unaware 
on may   triad was advised that one of the qui tam cases referenced above  which occurred prior to the spin off listed three of triad s hospitals as defendants 
this qui tam action alleges various violations arising out of the relationship between curative health services and the other defendants  including allegations of false claims relating to contracts with curative health services for the management of certain wound care centers and excessive and unreasonable management fees paid to curative health services and submitted for reimbursement 
two of the three triad hospitals named as defendants terminated their relationship with curative health services prior to the spin off and the third hospital terminated its contract thereafter 
hca is also a defendant in a number of other suits  which allege  in general  improper and fraudulent billing  overcharging  coding and physician referrals  as well as other violations of law 
certain of the suits have been conditionally certified as class actions 
since april  numerous securities class action and derivative lawsuits have been filed against hca and a number of its current and former directors  officers and or employees alleging breach of fiduciary duty  and failure to take reasonable steps to ensure that hca did not engage in illegal practices thereby exposing it to significant damages 
in december  hca entered into an agreement with the criminal division of the department of justice and various us attorney s offices and a civil and administrative settlement agreement with the civil division of the department of justice 
these agreements resolve only the specific federal criminal issues outstanding against hca and certain issues involving federal civil claims by or on behalf of the government involving drg coding  outpatient laboratory billing and home health issues 
civil issues that are not covered and remain outstanding include claims related to cost reports and physician relations issues 
these agreements do not resolve any of the qui tam actions or any pending state actions 
in addition  of triad s current and former hospitals received notices in early from cms that it was re opening for examination cost reports for medicare and medicaid reimbursement filed by these hospitals for periods between and  which pre dates triad s spin off from hca 
furthermore  two of triad s hospitals formerly owned by quorum have received such notices 
hca or its predecessors owned these hospitals during the period covered by the notices 
hca is obligated to indemnify triad for liabilities arising out of cost reports filed during these periods 
on march   hca announced that it had reached an understanding with cms to resolve all medicare cost report appeal issues between hca and cms on more than  cost reports for reporting periods from through july  the understanding  which is subject to approval of the department of justice and execution of a mutually satisfactory definitive written agreement  would require hca to pay cms the sum of million 
the understanding does not include resolution of outstanding civil issues with the department of justice and relators under hca s various qui tam cases with respect to cost reports and physician relations 
in december  hca reached an understanding with the civil division of the department of justice to recommend an agreement to settle  subject to certain conditions  the litigation brought by the division against hca  including the remaining outstanding issues of cost reports and physician relations  in exchange for a payment by hca of million  plus interest 
hca has stated that this understanding  which is subject to approvals by senior department of justice officials and execution of definitive documents  would effectively end the division s investigation of hca 
hca also agreed in principle with representatives of states that may have similar claims against hca to pay million to resolve these claims 
hca will also pay the legal fees of certain whistleblowers attorneys 
triad is unable to predict the effect or outcome of any of the ongoing investigations or qui tam and other actions  or whether any additional investigations or litigation will be commenced 
in connection with the spin off from hca  triad entered into a distribution agreement with hca 
the terms of the distribution agreement provide that hca will indemnify triad for any losses other than consequential damages which it may incur as a result of the proceedings described above 
hca has also agreed to indemnify triad for any losses other than consequential damages which it may incur as a result of proceedings which may be commenced by government authorities or by private parties in the future that arise from acts  practices or omissions engaged in prior to the date of the spin off and that relate to the proceedings described above 
hca has also agreed that  in the event that any hospital owned by triad at the time of the spin off is permanently excluded from participation in the medicare and medicaid programs as a result of the proceedings described above  then hca will make a cash payment to triad  in an amount if positive equal to five times the excluded hospital s income from continuing operations before depreciation and amortization  interest expense  management fees  impairment of long lived assets  minority interests and income taxes  as set forth on a schedule to the distribution agreement  less the net proceeds of the sale or other disposition of the excluded hospital 
hca will not indemnify triad under the distribution agreement for losses relating to any acts  practices and omissions engaged in by triad after the spin off date  whether or not triad is indemnified for similar acts  practices and omissions occurring prior to the spin off 
hca also will not indemnify triad under the distribution agreement for similar qui tam litigation  governmental investigations and other actions to which quorum was subject  some of which are described above 
if indemnified matters were asserted successfully against triad or any of its facilities  and hca failed to meet its indemnification obligations  then this event could have a material adverse effect on triad s business  financial condition  results of operations or prospects 
the extent to which triad may or may not continue to be affected by the ongoing investigations of hca and the initiation of additional investigations  if any  cannot be predicted 
these matters could have a material adverse effect on triad s business  financial condition  results of operations or prospects 
general liability claims triad is subject to claims and suits arising in the ordinary course of business  including claims for personal injuries or wrongful restriction of  or interference with  physicians staff privileges 
in certain of these actions the claimants may seek punitive damages against triad  which are usually not covered by insurance 
it is management s opinion that the ultimate resolution of these pending claims and legal proceedings will not have a material adverse effect on triad s results of operations or financial position 
effects of inflation and changing prices various federal  state and local laws have been enacted that  in certain cases  limit triad s ability to increase prices 
revenues for acute care hospital services rendered to medicare patients are established under the federal government s prospective payment system 
medicare revenues were approximately in  in  and in management believes that hospital industry operating margins have been  and may continue to be  under significant pressure because of deterioration in pricing flexibility and payer mix  and growth in operating expenses in excess of the increase in prospective payments under the medicare program 
although medicare prospective payments increased in and  management anticipates that the average rate of increase in medicare prospective payments will decline slightly in in addition  as a result of increasing regulatory and competitive pressures  triad s ability to maintain operating margins through price increases to non medicare patients is limited 
health care reform in recent years  an increasing number of legislative proposals have been introduced in or proposed by congress and some state legislatures that would significantly affect health care systems in triad s markets 
the cost of certain proposals would be funded  in significant part  by a reduction in payments by government programs  including medicare and medicaid  to health care providers similar to the reductions incurred as part of bba as previously discussed 
while triad is unable to predict whether any proposals for health care reform will be adopted  there can be no assurance that proposals adverse to the business of triad will not be adopted 
in december  cms acting under hipaa released final regulations  which would require compliance by april relating to adoption of standards to protect the security and privacy of health related information 
these regulations would require healthcare providers to implement organizational and technical practices to protect the security of electronically maintained or transmitted health related information 
the privacy regulations will extensively regulate the use and disclosure of individually identifiable health related information 
the security regulations and the privacy regulations could impose significant costs on triad in order to comply with these standards 
violations of the regulations could result in civil penalties of up to  per type of violation in each calendar year and criminal penalties of up to  per violation 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk triad is exposed to market risk related to changes in interest rates 
to mitigate the impact of fluctuations in interest rates  triad has entered into interest rate swaps 
interest rate swaps are contracts which allow the parties to exchange fixed and floating rate interest rate payments periodically over the life of the agreements 
floating rate payments are based on libor and fixed rate payments are dependent upon market levels at the time the interest rate swap was consummated 
the interest rate swaps were entered into as cash flow hedges  which effectively converts a notional amount of floating rate borrowings to fixed rate borrowings 
triad s policy is to not hold or issue derivatives for trading purposes and to avoid derivatives with leverage features 
both of triad s interest rate swaps are with the same counterparty 
triad is exposed to credit losses in the event of nonperformance by the counterparty 
the counterparty is a creditworthy financial institution and it is anticipated that the counterparty will be able to fully satisfy its obligation under the contracts 
in january  triad entered into an interest rate swap which effectively converts a notional amount of million of floating rate borrowings to fixed rate borrowings 
the term of the interest rate swap expires in january triad will pay a rate of and receive libor  which was set at at december  subsequent to december   the libor rate was reset at 
in june  triad entered into another interest rate swap agreement  which effectively converts an additional notional amount of million of floating rate borrowings to fixed rate borrowings 
the term of the interest rate swap expires in june triad will pay a rate of and will receive libor  which was set at at december  with respect to triad s interest bearing liabilities  approximately million of long term debt at december  was subject to variable rates of interest  while the remaining balance in long term debt of million at december  was subject to fixed rates of interest 
as discussed previously  million of the long term debt subject to variable rates of interest is protected by interest rate swaps expiring in january and june the estimated fair value of triad s total long term debt was  million at december  the estimates of fair value are based upon the quoted market prices for the same or similar issues of long term debt with the same maturities  when available  or discounted cash flows 
based on a hypothetical increase in interest rates  the potential annualized losses in future pretax earnings would be approximately million 
the impact of such a change in interest rates on the carrying value of long term debt would not be significant 
the estimated changes to interest expense and the fair value of long term debt are determined considering the impact of hypothetical interest rates on triad s borrowing costs and long term debt balances 
these analyses do not consider the effects  if any  of the potential changes in triad s credit ratings or the overall level of economic activity 
further  in the event of a change of significant magnitude  management would expect to take actions intended to further mitigate its exposure to such change
