information presented above for the quarters ended march   june  and september  have been restated to reflect the retroactive application of the impairment loss recognized in accordance with the adoption of sfas no 
 effective january  item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
results of operations year ended december  as compared to net sales for decreased primarily as a result of declines in the revenues from the company s professional and manufacturing business segments 
the decline in net sales for the professional segment was approximately  over the past several years  there has been a consolidation in the distribution network for professional products and this has had an adverse impact on net sales 
the manufacturing segment experienced a decline in sales as a result of a decline in private label production 
management is negotiating with potential customers in order to enhance the private label business and is also encouraged by prospects generated in the first quarter of the retail segment showed a small sales increase  largely on the strength of an increase in sales of talc products 
in the retail environment  the company continues to experience demands for considerable up front concessions  such as slotting allowances  from major retailers in order to carry retail products from suppliers like stephan 
gross profit decreased  to  in when compared to levels 
this decrease was due to an overall decline in net sales and a continuing change in the overall mix of business 
the morris flamingo stephan and williamsport subsidiaries professional business segment accounted for approximately of consolidated net sales  an increase of over levels 
these two subsidiaries have traditionally had lower gross margins than other entities comprising the professional group 
the company continues to devote efforts to improving the gross profit margins of these two divisions  though they have improved slightly over the retail personal care products operating segment experienced a moderate increase in net sales  with a increase in net sales of the brands acquired from colgate offsetting decreased net sales of other retail brands 
net retail sales in were  as compared to  in by offering quantity discounts  the company was successful in acquiring new customers  but experienced a lower gross margin due to discounts and promotional pricing 
in addition  due to the continued consolidation in the chain drug store industry  the amount of discounting and promotional allowances large retailers demand of their suppliers has increased  which reduces the gross profit margins on brands supplied to those retailers 
the company responded to these discounting pressures in an effort to maintain market share without materially sacrificing our profitability by selectively participating in promotional programs that would benefit both the company and the customer 
management of the company was able to substantially reduce expenses  with selling  general and administrative expenses sg a decreasing in excess of  from  in to  in the company significantly reduced payroll and related costs as well as professional fees 
in addition  the decline in sales resulted in reduced freight and delivery expenses 
the implementation of sfas no 
 with respect to goodwill and trademark amortization  reduced amortization expense which is included in sg a by  in interest expense decreased over  in as a result of a decrease in outstanding debt and lower interest rates  interest income also declined over  due to significantly lower interest rates 
interest income for the year ended december  was  compared to  earned in other income included royalty payments from color me beautiful of  in connection with the marketing of frances denney products  and a royalty fee of  for the temporary licensing of new era products 
income before income taxes and cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle was  an increase over the corresponding period in  as a result of the reasons indicated above  however income before the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle as a result of the application of sfas no 
was  for the year ended december   compared to  for the year ended december  this decrease was due to an abnormally high provision for income taxes as a result of a reduction in the realizable value of the company s charitable contribution carryforward 
this valuation allowance caused the effective tax rate for the year ended december  to increase to  as compared to for the prior year  and was taken because it is anticipated that the time limit on the deductibility of the charitable contribution carryforward will expire before it can be utilized 
should taxable income increase in the near future  some of this write down may be recoverable 
net income for the year ended december  was adversely impacted by the write down of goodwill and other intangible assets  an aggregate of approximately million was written off  with a net after tax effect of reducing income by approximately million 
the net loss for the year ended december   after taking into consideration the goodwill and other intangible assets charge  was  basic earnings per share for the year ended december   before the effect of the goodwill and other intangible assets charge was  compared to 
for the year ended december  after giving effect to the adjustment for the impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets  the net loss per share was 
the average number of shares outstanding   was the same in and year ended december  as compared to net sales for decreased as a result of an overall decline in revenues from the company s professional and retail business segments 
while the sales and distribution of hard goods remained relatively unchanged  there was a decline in the net sales of wet goods which comprise a significant portion of the retail segment  of approximately gross profit decreased  to  in when compared to levels 
this decrease was primarily due to an overall decline in net sales 
the overall gross profit percentage increased from in to for the year ended december  this increase was largely attributable to sales to new customers and more effective manu facturing operations 
net retail sales in were  as compared to  for the decline in such net sales was primarily due to an almost across the board decline in the net sales of the company s retail lines  however  the modern and frances denney lines showed increases in the continuing consolidation in the chain drug store industry continues to increase the amount of discounting and promotional allowances that must be extended to large retailers which often has an inhibiting effect on the number of sku s stock keeping units that a retailer may carry 
selling  general and administrative sg a expenses decreased  from  in to  in the overall decline in sg a expenses was due to a company wide decrease in payroll and general office expenses partially offset by the anticipated increases in consulting  marketing and legal and professional fees 
interest expense decreased  from levels as the result of a decrease in outstanding debt and the refinancing of a long term note payable in august other income in includes a royalty payment of  from color me beautiful in connection with the marketing of frances denney products 
income taxes decreased  from  for the year ended december  to  for the year ended december   due to a combination of a decline in income before income taxes and a decrease in the overall amount of deferred income taxes 
earnings per share for the year ended december  was  equal to the amount for the average number of shares outstanding decreased in  from  to  as a result of the repurchase  by the company  of  shares during liquidity and capital resources working capital was approximately  at december   an increase of over  from december  cash and cash equivalents increased to  compared to  as of december  total cash  including certificates of deposit cds  increased from  at december  to  at december  the company has continued to secure its outstanding long term debt with wachovia bank with all of the cds 
while the cds periodically mature  they are classified as non current and not included in working capital or cash and cash equivalents 
the company does not anticipate any significant capital expenditures in the near term and management believes that there is sufficient cash on hand and working capital to satisfy upcoming requirements  including any funds that may be needed in connection with the going private transaction 
the company does not have any off balance sheet financing or similar arrangements 
inventory levels continued to decline as management continued to engage its efforts to reduce the overall amount of inventory on hand  both through the use of more effective inventory control techniques  as well as a more thorough phasing out of old  obsolete or slow moving items 
overall  accounts payable and accrued expenses had decreased  as of december   when compared to the end of  which decrease was largely the result of a decrease in accounts payable to vendors as well as a decline in accrued payroll due to the timing of year end payments 
the company has not experienced any material adverse impact from the effects of inflation in the last several years 
management maintains some flexibility to increase prices and does not have any binding contract pricing with either customers or vendors 
many of the company s products  as well as the components used  are petroleum based products  and as a result  the prices for raw materials are and will continue to be subject to oil prices which  in turn  are subject to various political or economic pressures 
the company does not presently foresee any material increase in the costs of raw materials or component costs  and believes it has the flexibility of calling upon multiple vendors and the ability to increase prices to offset any price changes

a separate payment fund  in an amount equal to of the aggregate principal and interest amount due under the debt instrument  will be established by the management group to fund its payment obligations thereunder

in late and during the special committee received from curtis rudolph  a shareholder of the company  an indication of his interest in acquiring the company  however  no offer was forthcoming 
in november  mr 
rudolph initiated an action in florida state court broward county  florida seeking to obtain a review of certain books and records of the company to which he claimed he was entitled as a shareholder of the company see item legal proceedings 
the company had previously denied him access to those books and records due to his unwillingness to sign a non disclosure agreement relating to the company s non public information in the standard form required of other potential bidders for the company

rudolph agreed to execute the non disclosure agreement 
by letter dated january   mr 
rudolph reiterated his interest in making a proposal to acquire the company 
on or about february   mr 
rudolph submitted an unexecuted proposal to acquire substantially all of the assets and assume certain liabilities of the company 
the special committee rejected this proposal as it was unexecuted  contained certain unacceptable terms  was subject to unacceptable conditions  and was structured as an asset purchase rather than a stock purchase 
in particular  the asset purchase structure presented substantial negative tax consequences to the company and its shareholders and was deemed impractical 
under the circumstances  the special committee determined mr 
rudolph s proposal to not be in the best interests of the company s shareholders 
the board of directors  through its special committee  has continued to negotiate with mr 
rudolph  but no further offer has been forthcoming

quinsana is experiencing a significant increase in net sales and as a result  net sales for this brand in the first quarter of were in excess of total net sales for this product for the entire prior year 
net sales is anticipated to be over higher than the corresponding first quarter of there can be no assurances  however  that this trend will continue  nor that continuing market pricing pressures will not arise with respect to these sales 
discussion of critical accounting policies the preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
actual results could differ significantly from those estimates if different assumptions were used or different events ultimately transpire 
we believe that the following are the most critical accounting policies that requires management to make difficult  subjective and or complex judgments  often due to a need to make estimates about matters that are inherently uncertain valuation of accounts receivable the ultimate amount of collections received against outstanding accounts receivable must take into account returns  allowances and deductions that may be made by our customers 
many retailers to whom we sell products take deductions for various forms of marketing expenses  as well as participating in nationwide reclamation cooperatives for processing damaged goods 
other expenses to which we are subject to  in addition to those experienced in the retail environment but also with professional products sold to distributors include deductions for freight if the invoice is paid within specified terms  co op advertising allowances  new store warehouse allowances and  from time to time  limited rebate programs 
we attempt to estimate these costs  as well as providing for anticipated bad debts  by recording allowances based upon our experience  economic conditions  normal customer inventory levels and or competitive conditions 
actual returns  credits or allowances  as well as the condition of any product actually returned  may differ significantly from the estimates used by the company 
inventories inventories are stated at the lower of cost  determined by the first in  first out fifo method  or market 
we periodically evaluate inventory levels  giving consideration to factors such as the physical condition of the goods  the sales patterns of finished goods and the useful life of particular packaging  componentry and finished goods and estimates a reasonable amount to be provided for slow moving  obsolete or damaged inventory 
these estimates could vary significantly  either favorably or unfavorably  from actual requirements based upon future economic conditions  customer inventory levels or competitive factors that were not foreseen or did not exist when the valuation allowances were established 
impairment of long lived assets and goodwill the company periodically evaluates whether events or circumstances have occurred that would indicate that long lived assets may not be recoverable or that the remaining useful life may be impaired 
when such events or circumstances are present  the company assesses the recoverability of long lived assets by determining whether the carrying value will be recovered through the expected future cash flows resulting from the use of the asset 
if the results of this testing indicates an impairment of the carrying value of the asset  an impairment loss equal to the excess of the asset s carrying value over its fair value is recorded 
the long term nature of these assets requires the estimation of its cash inflows and outflows several years into the future and only takes into consideration circumstances known at the time of the impairment test 
in accordance with sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  goodwill and other intangible assets are to be evaluated for impairment on an annual basis  and between annual tests  whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset may exceed its fair value 
the use of various acceptable and appropriate methods of valuation requires the use of long term planning forecasts and assumptions regarding industry specific economic conditions that are outside the control of the company 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk the company does not own or maintain an interest in derivative or other financial instruments for which fair value disclosure would be required under statement of financial accounting standards no 
in addition  the company does not invest in securities that would require disclosure of market risk  nor does it have floating rate loans or foreign currency exchange rate risks
