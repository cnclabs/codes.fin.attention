item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements appearing elsewhere in this report 
historical results and percentage relationships set forth in the consolidated statements of operations  including trends which might appear  are not necessarily indicative of future operations 
unless the context indicates otherwise  the term company refers to tanger factory outlet centers  inc and subsidiaries and the term operating partnership refers to tanger properties limited partnership 
the terms we  our and us refer to the company or the company and the operating partnership together  as the text requires 
the discussion of our results of operations reported in the consolidated statements of operations compares the years ended december  and  as well as december  and certain comparisons between the periods are made on a percentage basis as well as on a weighted average gross leasable area gla basis  a technique which adjusts for certain increases or decreases in the number of centers and corresponding square feet related to the development  acquisition  expansion or disposition of rental properties 
the computation of weighted average gla  however  does not adjust for fluctuations in occupancy that may occur subsequent to the original opening date

general overview at december   we had ownership interests in or management responsibilities for centers in states totaling million square feet compared to centers in states totaling million square feet at december  the increase is due to the following events o disposition of our wholly owned property in fort lauderdale  florida  totaling  square feet o development  through a ownership joint venture  of our property in myrtle beach  south carolina totaling  square feet o acquisition of our wholly owned property in howell  michigan totaling  square feet o obtained management responsibilities of a property in vero beach  florida totaling  square feet o disposition of our wholly owned property in bourne  massachusetts  totaling  square feet for which we retain limited management responsibilities results of operations in accordance with sfas accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after december   results of operations and gain loss on sales of real estate that have separable  identifiable cash flows for properties sold subsequent to december  are reflected in the consolidated statements of operations as discontinued operations for all periods presented 
a summary of the operating results for the years ended december   and is presented in the following table  expressed in amounts calculated on a weighted average gla basis

represents gla of wholly owned operating properties weighted by months of operation 
gla is not adjusted for fluctuations in occupancy that may occur subsequent to the original opening date 
excludes gla of properties for which their results are included in discontinued operations 
compared to base rentals increased million  or  in the period when compared to the same period in the increase is primarily due to the full nine months effect of an expansion at our san marcos  tx center which we completed during the fourth quarter of and the acquisition of our howell  michigan center in september base rent per weighted average gla increased by 
per square foot from per square foot in the period compared to per square foot in the period 
the increase is the result of the addition of the san marcos expansion to the portfolio which had a higher average base rent per square foot compared to the portfolio average and an increase of in average base rent per square foot on approximately million square feet renewed or re tenanted during while the overall portfolio occupancy at december  increased from to compared with the prior year end  two centers experienced negative occupancy trends which were offset by positive occupancy gains in other centers 
percentage rentals  which represent revenues based on a percentage of tenants sales volume above predetermined levels the breakpoint  increased  or  and on a weighted average gla basis  increased 
per square foot in compared to reported same space sales per square foot for the twelve months ended december  were per square foot  a increase over the prior year ended december  same space sales is defined as the weighted average sales per square foot reported in space open for the full duration of each comparison period 
our ability to attract high volume tenants to many of our outlet centers continues to improve the average sales per square foot throughout our portfolio 
reported tenant sales for for all tanger outlet centers reached a record level of billion 
reported same store sales for the year ended  defined as the weighted average sales per square foot reported by tenants for stores open since january  were down compared to expense reimbursements  which represent the contractual recovery from tenants of certain common area maintenance  insurance  property tax  promotional  advertising and management expenses generally fluctuates consistently with the reimbursable property operating expenses to which it relates 
expense reimbursements  expressed as a percentage of property operating expenses  decreased to in from in primarily as a result of higher real estate taxes due to revaluations  increases in property insurance premiums and increases in other non reimbursable expenses 
other income increased  or  in compared to primarily due to gains on sales of outparcels of land in included in other income  increases in vending and other miscellaneous income and the recognition of management  leasing and development fee revenue from our twmb associates  llc twmb joint venture 
property operating expenses increased by million  or  in the period as compared to the period and  on a weighted average gla basis  increased 
per square foot from to 
the increase is the result of increased costs in marketing  common area maintenance  real estate taxes  property insurance  and other non reimbursable expenses 
general and administrative expenses increased million  or  in the period as compared to the period 
the increase is primarily due to increases in performance based bonus accruals  travel  legal and other professional fees 
also  as a percentage of total revenues  general and administrative expenses were in both the and periods and  on a weighted average gla basis increased 
per square foot from per square foot in the period to per square foot in the period 
interest expense decreased million during as compared to due primarily to lower average interest rates during and a decrease in the overall debt level due to the use of a portion of the proceeds from our equity offering during the year to reduce outstanding debt 
also  beginning in the fourth quarter of and continuing through  we purchased  primarily at par  approximately million of our outstanding senior  unsecured public notes that mature in october the purchases were funded by amounts available under our unsecured lines of credit 
the replacement of the bonds with funding through lines of credit provided us with a significant interest expense reduction as the lines of credit had a lower interest rate 
depreciation and amortization per weighted average gla decreased slightly from per square foot in the period to per square foot in the period due to a lower mix of tenant finishing allowances included in buildings and improvements which are depreciated over shorter lives ie over lives generally ranging from to years as opposed to other construction costs which are depreciated over lives ranging from to years 
income from unconsolidated joint ventures increased  in the period compared to the period due to the opening of the myrtle beach  south carolina outlet center by twmb in june of the increase in discontinued operations is due to the gains on sales of our ft 
lauderdale  florida and bourne  massachusetts centers and the leased outparcels of land in seymour  indiana and casa grande  arizona  all of which were sold in the period 
compared to base rentals increased million  or  in the period when compared to the same period in the increase is primarily due to the effect of the expansion completed in at our san marcos  texas center and the full year effect of expansions completed in the fourth quarter of  offset by the loss of rent from the sales of the centers in lawrence  kansas and mcminnville  oregon in june as noted above  fas applies only to properties sold subsequent to december  therefore  the results of operations and resulting loss on sale of real estate from the lawrence  kansas and mcminnville  oregon properties are not included in discontinued operations 
the loss from these property sales is included in loss on sale or disposal of real estate in the consolidated statement of operations 
base rent per weighted average gla increased by 
per square foot  or  as a result of the expansions which had a higher average base rent per square foot compared to the portfolio average and the sales of the centers in lawrence  kansas and mcminnville  oregon which had a lower average base rent per square foot compared to the portfolio average 
percentage rentals  which represent revenues based on a percentage of tenants sales volume above predetermined levels  decreased by  or  and on a weighted average gla basis  decreased 
per square foot in compared to same space sales for the year ended december   defined as the weighted average sales per square foot reported in space open for the full duration of each comparison period  increased to per square foot due to our efforts to re merchandise selected centers by replacing low volume tenants with high volume tenants 
however  for the year ended december   reported same store sales  defined as the weighted average sales per square foot reported by tenants for stores open since january   decreased by compared with the previous year 
expense reimbursements  which represent the contractual recovery from tenants of certain common area maintenance  insurance  property tax  promotional  advertising and management expenses generally fluctuates consistently with the reimbursable property operating expenses to which it relates 
expense reimbursements  expressed as a percentage of property operating expenses  decreased to in from in primarily as a result of higher real estate taxes due to revaluations  increases in property insurance premiums and increases in other non reimbursable expenses 
other income decreased million in as compared to the period included gains on sales of land outparcels totaling  and the recognition of business interruption insurance proceeds relating to the stroud  oklahoma center  which was destroyed by a tornado in may  totaling  these items were offset in part by increases in vending and interest income in the period 
property operating expenses increased by million  or  in as compared to on a weighted average gla basis  property operating expenses decreased from to per square foot 
the decrease per square foot is the result of a company wide effort to improve operating efficiencies and reduce costs in common area maintenance and marketing partially offset by increases in real estate taxes  property insurance and other non reimbursable expenses 
general and administrative expenses increased  or  in as compared to primarily due to increases in professional fees and provisions for bad debts 
as a percentage of revenues  general and administrative expenses were approximately of revenues in and in on a weighted average gla basis  general and administrative expenses increased 
per square foot from in to in interest expense increased million during as compared to due primarily to our increased debt levels attributable to development completed in and the full year effect of expansions completed in the fourth quarter of our strategy to replace short term  variable rate debt with long term  fixed rate debt and extend our average debt maturities has resulted in an overall higher interest rate on outstanding debt 
also   paid to terminate certain interest rate swap agreements during the first quarter of contributed to the increase in interest expense 
depreciation and amortization per weighted average gla increased from per square foot in the period to per square foot in the period due to a higher mix of tenant finishing allowances included in buildings and improvements which are depreciated over shorter lives ie over lives generally ranging from to years as opposed to other construction costs which are depreciated over lives ranging from to years 
the asset write down recognized in represents the write off of all development costs associated with our site in ft 
lauderdale  florida  as well as additional costs associated with various other non recurring development activities at other sites  which were discontinued 
the costs associated with the ft 
lauderdale site were written off because we terminated our contract to purchase twelve acres of land in dania beach ft 
lauderdale  florida 
the loss on sale of real estate during represents the loss recognized on the sale of our centers in lawrence  kansas and mcminnville  oregon and the land and the remaining site improvements in stroud  oklahoma 
net proceeds received from the sale of the centers totaled million 
the combined net operating income of these two centers represented approximately of the total portfolio s operating income 
we sold the stroud land and site improvements in december and received net proceeds of approximately  in january as noted above  fas applies only to properties sold subsequent to december  therefore  the results of operations and resulting losses on sales of real estate from the properties which were sold in are not included in discontinued operations 
the losses from these property sales  totaling million  net of minority interest of million  are included in loss on sale or disposal of real estate in the consolidated statements of operations 
the extraordinary losses recognized in represent the write off of unamortized deferred financing costs related to debt that was extinguished prior to its scheduled maturity 
liquidity and capital resources net cash provided by operating activities was  and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the decreases and increases in cash provided by operating activities in compared to and compared to are primarily due to changes in other assets and accounts payable and accrued expenses for those respective years 
net cash used in investing activities amounted to  and million during  and  respectively  and reflects the acquisitions  expansions and dispositions of real estate during each year 
cash used in financing activities of  and in  and  respectively  has fluctuated consistently with the capital needed to fund the current development and acquisition activity and reflects increases in dividends paid during  and the decrease in cash used in financing activities in compared to also reflects the net proceeds of million from the issuance of one million common shares and million from the exercise of share and unit options in acquisitions and dispositions in september  we completed the acquisition of kensington valley factory shops  a factory outlet center in howell  michigan containing approximately  square feet  for an aggregate purchase price of million 
the acquisition was funded with million of net proceeds from the sale of our non core property in fort lauderdale  florida in june and a portion of the proceeds from the common share offering in september in november  we completed the disposition of our non core center in bourne  massachusetts which totaled approximately  square feet 
the net proceeds from this sale were million 
during we also sold five outparcels of land at various centers barstow  california  gonzales  louisiana  north branch  minnesota  seymour  indiana and casa grande  arizona  the last two of which had associated leases with identifiable cash flows 
these five outparcel sales generated approximately million in net proceeds 
joint ventures in  we formed a joint venture with c 
randy warren jr  former senior vice president of leasing of the company 
the new entity  tanger warren development  llc tanger warren  was formed to identify  acquire and develop sites exclusively for us 
we agreed to be co managers of tanger warren  each with ownership interest in the joint venture and any entities formed with respect to a specific project 
our investment in tanger warren amounted to approximately  and  as of december  and  respectively  and the impact of this joint venture on our results of operations has been insignificant 
in september  we established the twmb joint venture with respect to our myrtle beach  south carolina project with rosen warren myrtle beach llc rosen warren 
we and rosen warren  each as owners  contributed million in cash for a total initial equity in twmb of million 
in september of  twmb began construction on its first phase of a new  square foot tanger outlet center in myrtle beach  south carolina 
the first phase opened leased on june  at a cost of approximately million with approximately  square feet and brand name outlet tenants 
in november  we began construction on a  square foot second phase which is estimated to cost million 
we and rosen warren have each contributed approximately million toward this second phase  with the majority of the contribution being made in the first quarter of in conjunction with the construction of the center  twmb closed on a variable rate  construction loan in the amount of million with bank of america  na agent and southtrust bank 
as of december  the construction loan had a balance of million 
in august of  twmb entered into an interest rate swap agreement with bank of america  na effective through august with a notional amount of million 
under this agreement  twmb receives a floating interest rate based on the day libor index and pays a fixed interest rate of 
this swap effectively changes the payment of interest on million of variable rate debt to fixed rate debt for the contract period at a rate of 
all debt incurred by this unconsolidated joint venture is collateralized by its property as well as joint and several guarantees by rosen warren and us 
either partner in twmb has the right to initiate the sale or purchase of the other party s interest 
if such action is initiated  one partner would determine the fair market value purchase price of the venture and the other would determine whether they would take the role of seller or purchaser 
the partners roles in this transaction would be determined by the tossing of a coin  commonly known as a russian roulette provision 
if either rosen warren or we enact this provision and depending on our role in the transaction as either seller or purchaser  we can potentially incur a cash outflow for the purchase of rosen warren s interest 
however  we do not expect this event to occur in the near future based on the positive results and expectations of developing and operating an outlet center in the myrtle beach area 
other developments on july   our option to purchase the retail portion of a site at the bourne bridge rotary in cape cod  massachusetts was terminated due to the seller s inability to obtain the proper approvals for the bourne project from the local authorities by such date 
as a result of the termination  the net carrying amount of assets remaining on this project includes a  note receivable at annual interest that becomes due from the seller and is payable with accrued interest on july  at this time we believe that this note receivable is fully collectible 
any developments or expansions that we  or a joint venture that we are involved in  have planned or anticipated may not be started or completed as scheduled  or may not result in accretive net income or funds from operations 
in addition  we regularly evaluate acquisition or disposition proposals and engage from time to time in negotiations for acquisitions or dispositions of properties 
we may also enter into letters of intent for the purchase or sale of properties 
any prospective acquisition or disposition that is being evaluated or which is subject to a letter of intent may not be consummated  or if consummated  may not result in an increase in net income or funds from operations 
financing arrangements during  we purchased primarily at par  million of our outstanding senior  unsecured public notes that mature in october the purchases were funded by amounts available under our unsecured lines of credit 
during  we purchased million of these notes at par 
in total  million of the october notes were purchased in and we currently have authority from our board of directors to purchase an additional million of our outstanding senior  unsecured public notes and may  from time to time  do so at management s discretion 
at december   approximately of our outstanding long term debt represented unsecured borrowings and approximately of the gross book value of our real estate portfolio was unencumbered 
the average interest rate  including loan cost amortization  on average debt outstanding for the years ended december  and was and  respectively 
we intend to retain the ability to raise additional capital  including public debt or equity  to pursue attractive investment opportunities that may arise and to otherwise act in a manner that we believe to be in our shareholders best interests 
during the second quarter of  we amended our shelf registration for the ability to issue up to million  million in debt and million in equity securities 
in july  we again amended the shelf registration to allow us to issue the million in either all debt or all equity or any combination thereof up to million 
on september   we completed a public offering of  common shares at a price of per share  receiving net proceeds of approximately million 
we used the net proceeds  together with other available funds  to acquire one outlet center in howell  michigan  to reduce the outstanding balance on our lines of credit and for general corporate purposes 
to generate capital to reinvest into other attractive investment opportunities  we may also consider the use of operational and developmental joint ventures  selling certain properties that do not meet our long term investment criteria as well as outparcels on existing properties 
we maintain unsecured  revolving lines of credit that provided for unsecured borrowings up to million at december   an increase of million in capacity from december  during  we extended the maturity of all lines of credit to june  based on cash provided by operations  existing credit facilities  ongoing negotiations with certain financial institutions and our ability to sell debt or equity subject to market conditions  we believe that we have access to the necessary financing to fund the planned capital expenditures during we anticipate that adequate cash will be available to fund our operating and administrative expenses  regular debt service obligations  and the payment of dividends in accordance with real estate investment trust reit requirements in both the short and long term 
although we receive most of our rental payments on a monthly basis  distributions to shareholders are made quarterly and interest payments on the senior  unsecured notes are made semi annually 
amounts accumulated for such payments will be used in the interim to reduce the outstanding borrowings under the existing lines of credit or invested in short term money market or other suitable instruments 
contractual obligations and commercial commitments the following table details our contractual obligations over the next five years and thereafter as of december  in thousands contractual obligations thereafter debt       operating leases       our debt agreements require the maintenance of certain ratios  including debt service coverage and leverage  and limit the payment of dividends such that dividends and distributions will not exceed funds from operations  as defined in the agreements  for the prior fiscal year on an annual basis or of funds from operations on a cumulative basis 
we have historically been and currently are in compliance with all of our debt covenants 
we expect to remain in compliance with all our existing debt covenants  however  should circumstances arise that would cause us to be in default  the various lenders would have the ability to accelerate the maturity on our outstanding debt 
we operate in a manner intended to enable us to qualify as a reit under the internal revenue code the code 
a reit which distributes at least of its taxable income to its shareholders each year and which meets certain other conditions is not taxed on that portion of its taxable income which is distributed to its shareholders 
based on our taxable income to shareholders  we were required to distribute approximately  in order to maintain our reit status as described above 
we distributed approximately  to common shareholders based on our current dividend level  which significantly exceeds our required distributions 
if events were to occur that would cause our dividend to be reduced  we believe we still have an adequate margin regarding required dividend payments based on our historic dividend and taxable income levels to maintain our reit status 
the following table details our commercial commitments as of december  in thousands commercial commitments lines of credit  joint venture guarantees  we currently maintain four unsecured  revolving credit facilities with major national banking institutions  totaling million 
as of december  amounts outstanding under these credit facilities totaled million 
all four credit facilities expire in june we are party to a joint and several guarantee with respect to the million construction loan obtained by twmb 
see joint ventures section above for further discussion of the guarantee 
related party transactions during  stanley k 
tanger  our chairman of the board and chief executive officer  completed the early repayment of a million demand note receivable to the company through accelerated payments 
in  also through accelerated payments  steven b 
tanger  our president and chief operating officer  completed the early repayment of a  demand note receivable to the company 
as noted above in joint ventures  we are a owner of the twmb joint venture 
twmb pays us management  leasing and development fees for services provided to the joint venture 
during  we recognized approximately  in management fees   in leasing fees and  in development fees in other income 
market risk we are exposed to various market risks  including changes in interest rates 
market risk is the potential loss arising from adverse changes in market rates and prices  such as interest rates 
we do not enter into derivatives or other financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes 
we negotiate long term fixed rate debt instruments and enter into interest rate swap agreements to manage our exposure to interest rate changes 
the swaps involve the exchange of fixed and variable interest rate payments based on a contractual principal amount and time period 
payments or receipts on the agreements are recorded as adjustments to interest expense 
at december   we had an interest rate swap agreement effective through january with a notional amount of million 
under this agreement  we receive a floating interest rate based on the day libor index and pay a fixed interest rate of 
this swap effectively changes our payment of interest on million of variable rate debt to fixed rate debt for the contract period at a rate of the fair value of the interest rate swap agreement represents the estimated receipts or payments that would be made to terminate the agreement 
at december   we would have paid approximately  to terminate the agreement 
the fair value is based on dealer quotes  considering current interest rates and remaining term to maturity 
the fair market value of long term fixed interest rate debt is subject to interest rate risk 
generally  the fair market value of fixed interest rate debt will increase as interest rates fall and decrease as interest rates rise 
the estimated fair value of our total long term debt at december  was million while the recorded value was million  respectively 
a increase from prevailing interest rates at december  would result in a decrease in fair value of total long term debt by approximately million 
fair values were determined from quoted market prices  where available  using current interest rates considering credit ratings and the remaining terms to maturity 
critical accounting policies we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
cost capitalization we capitalize all fees and costs incurred to initiate operating leases  including certain general and overhead costs  as deferred charges 
the amount of general and overhead costs we capitalized is based on our estimate of the amount of costs directly related to executing these leases 
we amortize these costs to expense over the average minimum lease term 
we capitalize all costs incurred for the construction and development of properties  including certain general and overhead costs 
the amount of general and overhead costs we capitalize is based on our estimate of the amount of costs directly related to the construction or development of these assets 
direct costs to acquire assets are capitalized once the acquisition becomes probable 
impairment of long lived assets rental property held and used by us is reviewed for impairment in the event that facts and circumstances indicate the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
in such an event  we compare the estimated future undiscounted cash flows associated with the asset to the asset s carrying amount  and if less  recognize an impairment loss in an amount by which the carrying amount exceeds its fair value 
we believe that no impairment existed at december  revenue recognition base rentals are recognized on a straight line basis over the term of the lease 
substantially all leases contain provisions which provide additional rents based on tenants sales volume percentage rentals and reimbursement of the tenants share of advertising and promotion  common area maintenance  insurance and real estate tax expenses 
percentage rentals are recognized when specified targets that trigger the contingent rent are met 
expense reimbursements are recognized in the period the applicable expenses are incurred 
payments received from the early termination of leases are recognized when the applicable space is released  or  otherwise are amortized over the remaining lease term 
funds from operations we believe that for a clear understanding of our consolidated historical operating results  ffo should be considered along with net income as presented in the audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report 
ffo is presented because it is a widely accepted financial indicator used by certain investors and analysts to analyze and compare one equity reit with another on the basis of operating performance 
ffo is generally defined as net income loss  computed in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles  before extraordinary items and gains losses on sale or disposal of depreciable operating properties  plus depreciation and amortization uniquely significant to real estate and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures 
we caution that the calculation of ffo may vary from entity to entity and as such the presentation of ffo by us may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other reporting companies 
ffo does not represent net income or cash flow from operations as defined by generally accepted accounting principles and should not be considered an alternative to net income as an indication of operating performance or to cash flows from operations as a measure of liquidity 
ffo is not necessarily indicative of cash flows available to fund dividends to shareholders and other cash needs 
below is a calculation of ffo for the years ended december   and as well as actual cash flow and other data for those respective periods in thousands funds from operations net income    adjusted for extraordinary item loss on early extinguishment of debt minority interest    minority interest  depreciation and amortization attributable to discontinued operations  depreciation and amortization uniquely significant to real estate wholly owned    depreciation and amortization uniquely significant to real estate unconsolidated joint ventures gain loss on sale or disposal of real estate   funds from operations before minority interest    cash flow provided by used in operating activities    investing activities    financing activities    weighted average shares outstanding    for the years ended december  and  includes and in gains on sales of outparcels of land

generally  fas is effective for transactions occurring after december  we adopted this statement effective january   the effects of which will be the reclassification of a loss on early extinguishments of debt for the year ended  thereby decreasing income from continuing operations for the year ended december  by  in october  the fasb issued sfas no

the provisions of this statement are effective for exit or disposal activities that are initiated after december  the adoption of this pronouncement will not have a material impact on our results of operations or financial position

 accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure  an amendment of fasb statement no 
 which is effective for fiscal years ending after december  this statement amends sfas accounting for stock based compensation  to provide alternative methods of transition for a voluntary change to the fair value based method of accounting for stock based employee compensation 
in addition  this statement amends the disclosure requirements of statement to require prominent disclosures in both annual and interim financial statements about the method of accounting for stock based employee compensation and the effect of the method used on reported results 
we are currently evaluating the effects of this statement and at this time do not believe that it will have a material effect on our results of operations or financial position 
in january of  the fasb issued interpretation no 
 consolidation of variable interest entities fin 
fin clarifies the application of existing accounting pronouncements to certain entities in which equity investors do not have the characteristics of a controlling financial interest or do not have sufficient equity at risk for the entity to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support from other parties 
the provisions of fin will be immediately effective for all variable interests in variable interest entities created after january   and the company will need to apply its provisions to any existing variable interests in variable interest entities by no later than june  we are currently evaluating the effects of this statement and at this time do not believe that it will have a material effect on our results of operations or financial position 
economic conditions and outlook the majority of our leases contain provisions designed to mitigate the impact of inflation 
such provisions include clauses for the escalation of base rent and clauses enabling us to receive percentage rentals based on tenants gross sales above predetermined levels  which we believe often are lower than traditional retail industry standards which generally increase as prices rise 
most of the leases require the tenant to pay their share of property operating expenses  including common area maintenance  real estate taxes  insurance and advertising and promotion  thereby reducing exposure to increases in costs and operating expenses resulting from inflation 
while factory outlet stores continue to be a profitable and fundamental distribution channel for brand name manufacturers  some retail formats are more successful than others 
as typical in the retail industry  certain tenants have closed  or will close  certain stores by terminating their lease prior to its natural expiration or as a result of filing for protection under bankruptcy laws 
during  we have approximately  square feet or of our portfolio coming up for renewal 
if we were unable to successfully renew or release a significant amount of this space on favorable economic terms  the loss in rent could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 
we renewed of the  square feet that came up for renewal in with the existing tenants at an average base rental rate approximately higher than the expiring rate 
we also re tenanted  square feet during at a increase in the average base rental rate 
existing tenants sales have remained stable and renewals by existing tenants have remained strong 
the existing tenants have already renewed approximately  or  of the square feet scheduled to expire in as of march  in addition  we continue to attract and retain additional tenants 
our factory outlet centers typically include well known  national  brand name companies 
by maintaining a broad base of creditworthy tenants and a geographically diverse portfolio of properties located across the united states  we reduce our operating and leasing risks 
no one tenant including affiliates accounts for more than of our combined base and percentage rental revenues 
accordingly  we do not expect any material adverse impact on our results of operation and financial condition as a result of leases to be renewed or stores to be released 
as of december  and  our centers were and occupied  respectively 
consistent with our long term strategy of re merchandising centers  we will continue to hold space off the market until an appropriate tenant is identified 
while we believe this strategy will add value to our centers in the long term  it may reduce our average occupancy rates in the near term
