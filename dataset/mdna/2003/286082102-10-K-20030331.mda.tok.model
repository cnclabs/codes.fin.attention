item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations factors that could adversely affect performance we rely on sales to a relatively small number of oem partners  and the loss of any of these customers could substantially decrease our revenues 
the company customarily enters into development and distribution agreements with its oem partners 
these agreements can be terminated under a range of circumstances  and often upon relatively short notice 
the circumstances under which an agreement can be terminated vary from agreement to agreement and there can be no assurance that the company s oem partners will continue to purchase products from the company in the future  despite such agreements 
the company recognizes the importance of  and works hard to maintain  its relationships with its customers 
however  the company s relationships with its customers are affected by a number of factors including  among others competition from other suppliers  competition from internal development efforts by the customers themselves including the oems  and changes in general economic  competitive or market conditions such as changes in demand for the company s or the oem s products  or fluctuations in currency exchange rates 
there can be no assurance that the company will continue to maintain or build the relationships it has developed to date 
see item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations factors that could adversely affect performance we face competition from other suppliers as well as our own oem customers  and if we are not able to compete successfully then our business may be harmed 
in addition to its development and sales relationships with the oem partners  in order to increase the distribution and presence of efi color servers connected to both color and black and white copiers and wide format printing devices  the company has developed strategic relationships with well known print for pay companies  including kinko s  alphagraphics  the copymax operations of office products superstore officemax  the american speedy group of franchised printing centers including allegra print and imaging  american speedy  speedy printer  zippy print and quik print  multicopy  inc and the sampa corporation  franchiser of signal graphics printing centers 
several of these print for pay companies  including  american speedy  officemax  multicopy  inc and sampa corporation  have entered into worldwide strategic alliances with the company whereby they have agreed to continue standardization efforts on efi s fiery color servers with respect to their printing services 
the company also has a continuing relationship pursuant to a license agreement with adobe and licenses postscript software from adobe for use in many fiery products 
this relationship is important because each fiery product requires page description language software such as that provided by adobe in order to operate 
adobe s postscript software is widely used to manage the geometry  shape and typography of hard copy documents and adobe is a leader in providing page description software 
see item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations factors that could adversely affect performance we license software used in most of our products from adobe systems incorporated  and the loss of this license would prevent us from shipping these products 
distribution and marketing the company s primary distribution method for its fiery and splash servers is to sell the fiery and splash servers to its oems 
the company s oems in turn sell these products to distributors and end users for 
table of contents use with the oems copiers or printers as part of an integrated printing system 
for fiery controllers  the company s primary distribution method has been to sell the products to the oems that embed the products into their copiers and printers 
the company s primary distribution method for its edox servers is to sell the edox servers directly to its distributors 
there can be no assurance that the company will continue to successfully distribute its products through these channels 
any interruption of the distribution methods could negatively impact the company in the future 
see item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations factors that could adversely affect performance we rely on sales to a relatively small number of oem partners  and the loss of any of these customers could substantially decrease our revenues 
the company promotes all of its products through public relations  direct mail  advertising  promotional material  trade shows and ongoing customer communication programs 
research and development research and development costs for  and were million  million and million  respectively 
as of december   of the company s full time employees were involved in research and development 
the company believes that development of new products and enhancement of existing products are essential to its continued success  and management intends to continue to devote substantial resources to research and new product development 
the company expects to make significant expenditures to support its research and development programs for the foreseeable future 
the company is developing products to support additional color and black and white printing devices including desktop printers  high end color copiers  digital black and white copiers and multi function devices 
this ongoing development work includes a multiprocessor architecture for high end systems and lower cost designs for desktop color laser printers 
the company is also developing internet printing solutions  new software applications designed to maximize workflow efficiencies and to meet the needs of the graphics arts and commercial print professional 
the company also expects to continue to enhance functionality of its other product lines  including ebeam  printme and unimobile 
see growth and expansion strategies proliferate and expand product lines 
substantial additional work and expense will be required to complete and bring to market each of the products currently being developed by the company see item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations factors that could adversely affect performance if we are unable to develop new products  or execute product introductions on a timely basis  our future revenue may be harmed 
manufacturing the company utilizes subcontractors to manufacture its products 
these subcontractors work closely with the company to ensure low costs and high quality in the manufacture of the company s products 
subcontractors purchase components needed for the company s products from third parties 
the company is totally reliant on the ability of its subcontractors to produce products sold by the company  and although the company supervises its subcontractors  there can be no assurance that such subcontractors will continue to perform for the company as well as they have in the past 
see item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations factors that could adversely affect performance we are dependent on subcontractors to manufacture and deliver products to our customers 
certain components necessary for the manufacture of the company s products  including asics and certain other semiconductor components  are obtained from a sole supplier or a limited group of suppliers 
the purchase of certain of these key components may involve significant lead times 
accordingly  in the event of interruptions in the supply of these key components or unanticipated increases in demand for the company s products  the company could be unable to manufacture certain of its products in a quantity sufficient to meet customer demand 
there can be no assurance that such supply or manufacturing problems would not adversely affect the company s results of operations or financial condition 
in an attempt to mitigate these supply issues  the company purchases certain components for later resale to the company s subcontractors 
table of contents thus increasing the company s inventory balances and the risk associated with inventory obsolescence 
see item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations factors that could adversely affect performance we depend upon a limited group of suppliers for key components in our products 
human resources as of december   the company employed full time individuals 
of the total employees  approximately were in sales and marketing  were in management and administration  were in manufacturing  and were in research and development 
of the total number of employees  the company had approximately employees located in us and canadian offices  and employees located in international offices including employees based in the united kingdom  the netherlands  germany  japan  france  italy  finland  spain  australia  singapore  brazil  mexico  sweden  india and hong kong 
the company s employees are not represented by any collective bargaining organization and the company has never experienced a work stoppage 
however  there can be no assurance that collective bargaining  work stoppage or other employment related issues will not arise 
competition competition in the company s markets is intense and involves rapidly changing technologies and frequent new product introductions 
to maintain and improve its competitive position  the company must continue to develop and introduce  on a timely and cost effective basis  new products and features that keep pace with the evolving needs of its customers 
the principal competitive factors affecting the markets for the company s fiery  edox and splash products include  among others  customer service and support  product reputation  quality  performance  price and product features such as functionality  scalability  ability to interface with oem products and ease of use 
the company believes it has generally competed effectively in the past against product offerings of its competitors on the basis of such factors 
however  there can be no assurance that the company will continue to be able to compete effectively in the future based on these or any other competitive factors 
the company also faces competition from its oem partners and other copier and printer manufacturers that offer internally developed server products or that incorporate internally developed embedded solutions or server features into their copiers and printers  thereby eliminating the need for the company s products and limiting future opportunities for the company 
in addition  the company competes directly with other independent manufacturers of color servers  independent manufacturers of embedded solutions  copier manufacturers  printer manufacturers and others 
the company also faces competition from wide format printer manufacturers that develop their own controllers and other companies that develop controllers for wide format printers and manufacturers of desktop color laser printers which do not utilize a controller relying instead on host based processing of data and which offer increasing speed and color capability 
the company believes that it competes effectively due to  among other things  its efforts to continually advance its technology  name recognition  end user loyalty  sizable installed base  number of products supported and price 
the company expects that competition in its markets will increase due to  among other factors  market demand for higher performance products at lower prices  rapidly changing technology and product offerings from competitors and customers 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to continue to advance its technology and products or to compete effectively against other companies product offerings  and any failure to do so could have a material adverse effect upon the company s business  operating results and financial condition 
intellectual property rights the company relies on a combination of patent  copyright  trademark and trade secret laws  non disclosure agreements and other contractual provisions to establish  maintain and protect its intellectual property rights  all of which afford only limited protection 
as of december   the company had issued us patents  pending us patent applications and various foreign counterpart patents and applications 
there can be no assurance that patents will issue from these pending applications or from any 
table of contents future applications or that  if issued  any claims allowed will be sufficiently broad to protect the company s technology 
the company s issued us patents expire between january  and march  failure of the company to obtain or maintain patent protection may make it easier for the company s competitors to offer equivalent or superior technology 
in addition  third parties may independently develop similar technology without misappropriation of the company s trade secrets or breach of other proprietary rights 
any failure by the company to take all necessary steps to protect its trade secrets or other intellectual property rights and failure to enforce these rights may have a material adverse effect on the company s ability to compete in its markets 
the company has registered certain trademarks  which include  among others  its efi  fiery  fiery and design  fiery driven  fiery driven and design  colorwise  edox  splash and rip while print trademarks  and has applied for registration of certain additional trademarks 
the company will continue to evaluate the registration of additional trademarks as appropriate 
any failure by the company to properly register or maintain its trademarks or to otherwise take all necessary steps to protect its trademarks may diminish the value associated with the company s trademarks 
the company s products include software sold pursuant to shrink wrap licenses that are not signed by the end user and  therefore  may be unenforceable under the laws of certain jurisdictions 
in addition  the laws of some foreign countries  including several in which the company operates or sells its products  do not protect intellectual property and proprietary rights to as great an extent as do the laws of the united states 
from time to time  litigation may be necessary to defend and enforce the company s proprietary rights 
such litigation  whether or not concluded successfully for the company  could involve significant expense and the diversion of management s attention and other company resources 
see item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations factors that could adversely affect performance we may be unable to adequately protect our proprietary information and may incur expenses to defend our proprietary information

from the beginning  the company viewed these lawsuits as having absolutely no merit 
however  efi determined that a proposed settlement of the suit was in the best interests of the company and its shareholders and on september  the company announced its decision to settle all pending claims in this action

item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements and related notes thereto included in this annual report on form k 
all assumptions  anticipations  expectations and forecasts contained herein are forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
the company s actual results could differ materially from those discussed here 
for a discussion of the factors that could impact the company s results  readers are referred to the section below entitled factors that could adversely affect performance 
the preparation of the consolidated financial statements which are the basis of the following discussion and analysis requires the company to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
the company evaluates its estimates  including those related to bad debts  inventories  intangible assets  income taxes  warranty obligations  purchase commitments and contingencies 
the estimates are based upon historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances at the time of the estimate  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
the following are believed to be the critical accounting policies of the company revenue recognition  estimating allowance for doubtful accounts  inventory reserves and other allowances  accounting for income taxes  valuation of long lived and intangible assets and goodwill  and determining functional currencies for the purposes of consolidating our international operations 
revenue recognition 
we derive our revenue from primarily two sources i product revenue  which primarily includes servers  controllers  chipsets and royalties  and ii services and support revenue which includes consulting and development fees 
as described below  significant management judgments and estimates must be made and used in connection with the revenue recognized in any accounting period 
material differences could result in the amount and timing of our revenue for any period if our management made different judgments or utilized different estimates 

table of contents we recognize revenue from the sale of servers  controllers and chipsets when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  the product has been delivered  the fee is fixed or determinable and collection of the resulting receivable is reasonably assured 
delivery generally occurs when product is delivered to the customer s common carrier 
at the time of the transaction  we assess whether the fee associated with our revenue transactions is fixed or determinable and whether or not collection is reasonably assured 
we assess whether the fee is fixed or determinable based on the terms of the contract 
we assess collection based on a number of factors  including past transaction history with the customer and the credit worthiness of the customer 
we do not request collateral from our customers 
if we determine that collection of a fee is not reasonably assured  we defer the fee and recognize revenue at the time collection becomes reasonably assured  which is generally upon receipt of cash 
for all sales  we use either a binding purchase order or signed contract as evidence of an arrangement 
sales through some of our oems are evidenced by a master agreement governing the relationship together with binding purchase orders on a transaction by transaction basis 
our arrangements do not generally include acceptance clauses 
we license software in multiple element arrangements in which a customer purchases a combination of software  post contract customer support pcs  and or professional services 
pcs  or maintenance  includes rights to upgrades  when and if available  telephone support  updates  and enhancements 
professional services relate to consulting services and training 
when vendor specific objective evidence vsoe of fair value exists for all elements in a multiple element arrangement  revenue is allocated to each element based on the relative fair value of each of the elements 
vsoe of fair value is established by the price charged when the same element is sold separately 
the vsoe of fair value of pcs is based on renewal rates for the same term pcs 
revenue allocated to pcs is recognized ratably over the contractual term typically one to two years 
at december   revenue from software sales represented less than of total revenue 
we recognize revenue for consulting and development services ratably over the contract term 
our consulting and development fees are based on time and materials  and we recognize revenue as these services are performed 
if these services are related to product development  we recognize the entire fee using the percentage of completion method 
we estimate the percentage of completion based on our estimate of the total costs estimated to complete the project as a percentage of the costs incurred to date and the estimated costs to complete 
allowance for doubtful accounts  inventory reserves and other allowances 
the preparation of financial statements requires our management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amount of assets and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reported period 
specifically  management must make estimates of the collectibility of our accounts receivables 
management specifically analyzes accounts receivable and analyzes historical bad debts  customer concentrations  customer credit worthiness  current economic trends and changes in our customer payment terms when evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts 
our accounts receivable balance was million  net of allowance for doubtful accounts and sales returns of million as of december  similarly  management must make estimates of potential future inventory obsolescence and purchase commitments 
management analyzes current economic trends  changes in customer demand and acceptance of our products when evaluating the adequacy of such allowances 
significant management judgments and estimates must be made and used in connection with establishing the allowances in any accounting period 
material differences may result in the amount and timing of our income for any period if management made different judgments or utilized different estimates 
accounting for income taxes 
in preparing our consolidated financial statements we are required to estimate our income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate 
we estimate our actual current tax exposure and the temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items  such as deferred revenue  for tax and book accounting purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are 
table of contents included within our consolidated balance sheet 
we must then assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income 
if we believe that recovery of these deferred assets is not likely  we must establish a valuation allowance 
to the extent we either establish or increase a valuation allowance in a period  we must include an expense within the tax provision in the consolidated statement of income 
significant management judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes  our deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowance recorded against our net deferred tax assets 
we have not recorded a valuation allowance as of december  if actual results differ from these estimates or we adjust these estimates in future periods we may need to establish a valuation allowance that could materially impact our financial position and results of operations 
net deferred tax assets as of december  were million 
we provide us taxes on earnings of our non us subsidiaries  to the extent such earnings are not permanently reinvested 
significant management judgement is needed in estimating the extent to which earnings are considered permanently reinvested 
as of december   the non us earnings considered permanently reinvested were not material 
valuation of long lived and intangible assets and goodwill 
in we adopted statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
in lieu of amortization  we are required to perform an initial impairment review of our goodwill and an annual impairment review of goodwill thereafter 
we completed our initial review in june with no impairment of goodwill indicated as a result of the review 
we assess the impairment of identifiable intangibles and long lived assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable or that the life of the asset may need to be revised 
factors we consider important which could trigger an impairment review include the following significant underperformance relative to expected historical or projected future operating results  significant changes in the manner of our use of the acquired assets or the strategy for our overall business  significant negative industry or economic trends  significant decline in our stock price for a sustained period  and our market capitalization relative to net book value 
when we determine that the carrying value of intangibles or long lived assets may not be recoverable based upon the existence of one or more of the above indicators of impairment  we measure any impairment based on a projected discounted cash flow method using a discount rate determined by our management to be commensurate with the risk inherent in our current business model 
net intangible assets and long lived assets amounted to million as of december  we ceased to amortize approximately million of goodwill  and reclassified approximately million of other net intangible assets and related deferred taxes to goodwill upon adoption of sfas no 
no adjustments to the lives of the other intangible assets were made during determining functional currencies for the purpose of consolidating our international operations 
we have several foreign subsidiaries which together account for approximately of our net revenues  of our assets and of our total liabilities as of december  in preparing our consolidated financial statements  we are required to translate the financial statements of the foreign subsidiaries from the currency in which they keep their accounting records  generally the local currency  into united states dollars 
this process results in exchange gains and losses which  under the relevant accounting guidance are either included within the statement of income or as a separate component of stockholders equity under the caption accumulated other comprehensive income 

table of contents under the relevant accounting guidance the treatment of these translation gains or losses is dependent upon our management s determination of the functional currency of each subsidiary 
the functional currency is determined based on management judgment and involves consideration of all relevant economic facts and circumstances affecting the subsidiary 
generally  the currency in which the subsidiary transacts a majority of its transactions  including billings  financing  payroll and other expenditures would be considered the functional currency but any dependency upon the parent company and the nature of the subsidiary s operations must also be considered 
if any subsidiary s functional currency is deemed to be the local currency  then any gain or loss associated with the translation of that subsidiary s financial statements is included in stockholders equity 
however  if the functional currency is deemed to be the united states dollar then any gain or loss associated with the translation of the subsidiary s financial statements would be included within our consolidated statement of income 
if we dispose of any of our subsidiaries  any cumulative translation gains or losses would be realized in our consolidated statement of income 
if we determine that there has been a change in the functional currency of a subsidiary to the united states dollar  any translation gains or losses arising after the date of change would be included within our consolidated statement of income 
based on our assessment of the factors discussed above  we consider the united states to be the functional currency for each of our international subsidiaries except for our japanese subsidiary  where we consider the japanese yen to be the subsidiary s functional currency 
in january we acquired best gmbh  a german software company 
the functional currency for best has been determined to be the euro

table of contents revenue the company s revenue in was principally derived from three major categories 
the first category was made up of stand alone servers which connect digital color copiers with computer networks 
this category includes the fiery x  z and q series  the splash g series  and edox products and accounted for a majority of the company s revenue prior to the second category consisted of embedded desktop controllers  bundled color solutions  chipset solutions and software rips primarily for the office market 
the third category consists of controllers for digital black and white products 
other revenue consisted of spares  licensing of certain products  ebeam  software solutions and unimobile  which individually are an insignificant part of the total revenue 
the following is a break down of revenue in dollars and volumes as a percentage of total units shipped by category 
change over over revenue in thousands stand alone color servers embedded design licensed color solutions digital black and white solutions spares  licensing other misc 
sources total revenue volume stand alone color servers embedded design licensed color solutions digital black and white solutions spares  licensing other misc 
sources total volume revenue was million in  compared to million in and million in  which resulted in a decrease in versus and a decrease of in compared to the corresponding unit volume decreased by in over and decreased by in over the decrease in revenue in from was primarily from a decrease in the volume of product shipped  a reflection of the continued decline in general economic conditions 
the decrease in revenue in from was primarily from a decline in average selling prices due to changes in product mix  as businesses looked to contain costs in a weakened economy 
throughout all categories  the number of units shipped declined in as compared to in the embedded and design licensed color solution category there was a change in the product mix toward the higher end products evidenced by a higher average selling price 
in all of the other categories  the product mix resulted in a lower average selling price  which combined with lower shipping volumes  accounted for the decrease in revenue 
during  a shift in the revenue mix away from the higher priced stand alone color servers to the embedded and design licensed color solution category led to the decline in revenues in the stand alone category and the increase in the embedded category from the move reflected the poor economic climate of  as companies strove to maximize their results and minimize capital expenditures 

table of contents the embedded category includes embedded boards  chipsets and design licensed color solution products 
embedded boards are generally characterized by higher unit volumes but lower unit prices and associated margins than the company has experienced in its more traditional stand alone server line of products 
the chipset and design licensed solutions can be characterized by lower unit prices but significantly higher per unit margins compared to the traditional stand alone server line of products 
the black and white product category can be characterized by much higher unit volumes and lower unit prices and associated margins than the company has experienced in its more traditional stand alone server line of products 
to the extent these categories do not grow over time in absolute terms  or if the company is not able to meet demand for higher unit volumes  it could have a material adverse effect on the company s operating results 
there can be no assurance that the new products for will be qualified by all the oems  or that they will successfully compete  or be accepted by the market  or otherwise be able to effectively replace the volume of revenue and or income from the older products 
the company also believes that in addition to the factors described above  price reductions for all of its products may affect revenues in the future 
the company has made and may in the future make price reductions for its products in order to drive demand and remain competitive 
depending upon the price elasticity of demand for the company s products  the pricing and quality of competitive products  and other economic and competitive conditions  such price reductions may have an adverse impact on the company s revenues and profits 
if the company is not able to compensate for lower gross margins that may result from price reductions with an increased volume of sales  its results of operations could be adversely affected 
in addition  if the company s revenue in the future depends more upon sales of products with relatively lower gross margins than the company obtained in such as embedded controllers for printers  embedded controllers for color and black and white copiers  and stand alone controllers for black and white copiers  results of operations may be adversely affected 
shipments by geographic area for the years ended december   and were as follows change years ended december  over over in thousands north america europe japan rest of world total the decrease in revenue between and stems from decreased sales of all products in all regions except the rest of world 
the rest of world region includes the asia pacific market  where penetration of new markets has kept revenues at the same level during and the decline in revenues during from was a reflection of the difficult economic times across all regions 
deteriorating worldwide economic conditions may continue to have an adverse impact on the company s results of operations in the future 
as shipments to some of the company s oem partners are made to centralized purchasing and manufacturing locations which in turn sell through to other locations  the company believes that non us sales of its products into each region may differ from what is reported  though accurate data is difficult to obtain 
the company expects that non us sales will continue to represent a significant portion of its total revenue 
substantially all of the revenue for the last three years was attributable to sales of products through the company s oem channels with such partners as canon  epson  fuji xerox  ibm  hewlett packard  kodak danka business systems  konica  minolta  oc  ricoh  sharp  toshiba  xerox and others 
during  the company continued to work on both increasing the number of oem partners  and expanding the size of 
table of contents existing relationships with oem partners 
the company relied on four oem partners  canon  xerox  minolta and ricoh in aggregate for   and of its revenue for  and  respectively 
in the event that any of these oem relationships are scaled back or discontinued  the company may experience a significant adverse impact on its financial condition and results of operations 
in addition  no assurance can be given that the company s relationships with these oem partners will continue 
the company continues to work on the development of products utilizing the fiery  splash and edox architecture and other products and intends to continue to introduce new generations of server and controller products and other new product lines with current and new oem s in and beyond 
no assurance can be given that the introduction or market acceptance of new  current or future products will be successful 
gross margins the company s gross margin was  and for  and respectively 
the increase in gross margin from to from to resulted principally from the migration to a design license model on certain of our products  enhancements of our software suite  the utilization of fewer contract manufacturers for cost savings and favorable component pricing 
the decrease in gross margin from to from to was primarily due to a higher mix of low end products with relatively lower margins and the volatile components market 
the company s color servers as well as embedded desktop controllers and digital black and white products are manufactured by third party manufacturers who purchase most of the necessary components 
the company does purchase certain parts directly  including processors  memory  certain asics  and software licensed from various sources  including postscript interpreter software  which the company licenses from adobe systems  inc in general  the company believes that gross margins will continue to be impacted by a variety of factors 
these factors include the market prices that can be achieved on the company s current and future products  the availability and pricing of key components including dram  processors and postscript interpreter software  third party manufacturing costs  product  channel and geographic mix  the success of the company s product transitions and new products  competition  and general economic conditions in the united states and abroad 
consequently  the company anticipates gross margins will fluctuate from period to period 
in addition to the factors affecting revenue described above  the company expects to be subject to pressures to reduce prices  and as a result  gross margins for all of its products may be lower and therefore the company s current gross margins may not be maintained

consolidation of variable interest entities fin 
the primary objectives of fin are to provide guidance on the identification of entities for which control is achieved through means other than through voting rights variable interest entities or vies and how to determine when and which business enterprise should consolidate the vie the primary beneficiary 
this new model for consolidation applies to an entity in which either the equity investors if any do not have a controlling financial interest or the equity investment at risk is sufficient to finance that entity s activities without receiving additional subordinated financial support from other parties 
in addition  fin requires that both the primary beneficiary and all other enterprises with a significant variable interest in a vie make additional disclosures regarding the nature  purpose  size and activities of the vie and the enterprise s maximum exposure to loss as a result of its involvement with the vie 
the company is required to adopt this interpretation no later than july  for any vies in which it holds a variable interest that it acquired before february  the interpretation is effective immediately for any vies created after january  and for vies in which an enterprise obtains an interest after that date 
the company continues to evaluate the impact of this interpretation on its financial condition and results of operations

in addition  the company has pledged certain marketable securities or interest bearing accounts  which are in proportion to the amount drawn under each lease 
under the lease  the pledged collateral approximately million at december  may be withdrawn at any time  but withdrawal results in an increase to the lease rate and the imposition of additional financial covenant restrictions

in january the fasb issued fin as noted under recent accounting pronouncements  the primary objectives of fin are to provide guidance on the identification of entities for which control is achieved through means other than voting rights variable interest entities and how to determine when and which business enterprise should consolidate the variable interest entity primary beneficiary 
we continue to evaluate the impact of this interpretation on our financial condition and results of operations

the first loss guarantee requires payment upon the end of the lease 
the company had a valuation of the building related to the lease performed in december to determine if the company had exposure related to the residual value guarantee  which would require the payment of the first loss guarantee at the end of the lease in july a valuation of million was indicated by the analysis  so the company has not recorded a reserve for potential impairment 
the company will continue to assess the real estate market conditions to evaluate whether it needs to record any reserves under its first loss guarantee obligations 
derivatives we conduct our operations globally  however  our transactions are primarily conducted using the united states dollar

financial risk management the following discussion about our risk management activities includes forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
actual results could differ materially from those projected in the forward looking statements 
as a global concern  we face exposure to adverse movements in foreign currency exchange rates 
these exposures may change over time as business practices evolve and could have a material adverse impact on our financial results 
our primary exposures are related to non us dollar denominated sales in japan and operating expenses in japan and the netherlands 
our exposure to movements in foreign currency exchange rates will increase in after our acquisition of best gmbh  which has sales and expenses in the euro 
at the present time  we do not hedge against these currency exposures  but as these exposures grow we may consider hedging against currency movements

the company s inventory consists primarily of memory subsystems  processors and asics  which are sold to third party contract manufacturers responsible for manufacturing the company s products 
should the company decide to purchase components and do its own manufacturing  or should it become necessary for the company to purchase and sell components other than the processors  asics or memory subsystems for its contract manufacturers  inventory balances and potentially fixed assets would increase significantly  thereby reducing the company s available cash resources 
further  the inventory the company carries could become obsolete  thereby negatively impacting the company s consolidated financial position and results of operations 
the company is also reliant on several sole source suppliers for certain key components and could experience a further significant negative impact on its financial condition and results of operations if such supply were reduced or not available 
the company may be required to compensate its sub contract manufacturers for components purchased for orders subsequently cancelled by the company 
the company periodically reviews the potential liability and the adequacy of the related reserve 
the company s financial condition and results of operations could be negatively impacted if the company were required to compensate the sub contract manufacturers in amounts in excess of the accrued liability

in addition  our sales revenue and results of operations may be adversely affected if we cannot meet our oem s product needs for their specific copiers and printers  as well as successfully manage the additional engineering and support effort and other risks associated with such a wide range of products 
we are pursuing  and will continue to pursue  the business of additional copier and printer oems 
however  because there are a limited number of oems producing copiers and printers in sufficient volume to be attractive customers for us  we expect that customer concentration will continue to be a risk 
we establish expenditure levels for operating expenses based on projected sales levels and margins  and expenses are relatively fixed in the short term 
accordingly  if sales to our oem customers are below expectations in any given quarter  the adverse impact of the shortfall in revenues on operating results may be increased by our inability to adjust spending in the short term to compensate for this shortfall 
if we are unable to develop new products  or execute product introductions on a timely basis  our future revenue and operating results may be harmed our operating results depend to a significant extent on our continual improvement of existing technologies and rapid innovation of new products and technologies by us 
our success depends not only on our ability to predict future requirements  but also to develop and introduce new products that successfully address customer needs 
any delays in the launch or availability of new products we are planning could harm our financial results 
during transitions from existing products to new products  customers may delay or cancel orders for existing products 
our results of operations may be adversely affected if we cannot successfully manage product transitions or provide adequate availability of products after they have been introduced 
we must continue to make significant investments in research and development in order to enhance performance and functionality of our products  including product lines different than our fiery  splash and edox servers and embedded controllers 
we cannot assure you that we will successfully identify new product opportunities  develop and introduce new products to market in a timely manner  or achieve market acceptance of our products 
also  when we decide to develop new products  our research and development expenses generally increase in the short term without a corresponding increase in revenue 
finally  we cannot assure you that products and technologies developed by our own customers and others will not render our products or technologies obsolete or noncompetitive 
we license software used in most of our products from adobe systems incorporated  and the loss of this license would prevent us from shipping these products under our license agreements with adobe  we are required to obtain a separate license for each type of copier or printer used with a fiery server or controller from adobe for the right to use adobe postscript tm software in our products 
to date  we have successfully obtained licenses to use adobe s postscript tm software for our products  where required 
we cannot assure you that adobe will continue to grant future licenses to adobe postscript tm software on reasonable terms  in a timely manner  or at all 
in addition  we cannot assure you that adobe will continue to give us the quality assurance approvals we are required to obtain from adobe for the adobe licenses 
if adobe does not grant us such licenses or approvals  if the adobe license agreements are terminated  or if our relationship with adobe is otherwise materially impaired  we would be unable to sell products that incorporate adobe postscript tm software  and our financial condition and results of operations 
table of contents would be materially and adversely affected 
in some products we have introduced substitute software developed internally that does not require any license from adobe 
while we plan on expanding the number of products using internally developed software  there can be no guarantee that these products will meet market acceptance 
if the demand for products that enable color printing of digital data continues to decrease  our sales revenue will likely decrease our products are primarily targeted at enabling the printing of digital data 
demand for networked printers and copiers containing our technology decreased in both and due to the global economic downturn 
we cannot assure you that demand will level off or increase in the future  nor can we assure you that the demand will level off or increase for the specific oem printers and copiers that utilize our products 
if demand for digital printing products and services containing our technology continues to decline  or if the demand for our oems specific printers or copiers for which our products are designed should continue to decline  our sales revenue will be adversely affected 
we sell products that are large capital expenditures as well as discretionary purchase items for our customers 
in difficult economic times such as we are now experiencing  spending on information technology typically decreases 
as our products are of a more discretionary nature than many other technology products  we may be more adversely impacted by deteriorating general economic conditions than other technology firms 
we are subject to economic sensitivity that has harmed and could  in the future  harm our results of operations 
we believe that demand for our products may also be affected by a variety of economic conditions and considerations  and we cannot assure you that demand for our products or our customers products will continue or improve from current levels 
if we enter new markets or distribution channels this could result in higher operating expenses that may not be offset by increased revenues we continue to explore opportunities to develop product lines different from our current servers and embedded controllers  such as our graphics arts software package  velocity software products  ebeam  printme networks and unimobile  among others 
we expect to continue to invest funds to develop new distribution and marketing channels for these and additional new products and services  which will increase our operating expenses 
we do not know if we will be successful in developing these channels or whether the market will accept any of our new products or services or if we will generate sufficient revenues from these activities to offset the additional operating expenses we incur 
in addition  even if we are able to introduce new products or services  the lack of marketplace acceptability of these new products or services may adversely impact the company s operating results 
we face competition from other suppliers as well as our own oem customers  and if we are not able to compete successfully our business may be harmed our industry is highly competitive and is characterized by rapid technological changes 
we compete against a number of other suppliers of imaging products 
we cannot assure you that products or technologies developed by competing suppliers will not render our products or technologies obsolete or noncompetitive 
while many of our oems sell our products on an exclusive basis  we do not have any formal agreements that prevent the oems from offering alternative products 
if an oem offers products from alternative suppliers our market share could decrease  which could reduce our revenue and adversely affect our financial results 
many of our oem partners themselves internally develop and sell products that compete directly with our current products 
these oems may be able to develop more quickly than we can products similar to ours that are compatible with their own products 
these oems have chosen and may continue to chose to market their own products in addition to our products  even when their products are technologically inferior  have lower performance or cost more than our products 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to successfully compete against similar products developed internally by our oems or against their financial and other 
table of contents resources  particularly in the black and white product market 
if we cannot compete successfully against our oems internally developed products  our business may be harmed 
if we are not able to hire and retain skilled employees  we may not be able to develop products or meet demand for our products in a timely fashion we depend upon skilled employees  such as software and hardware engineers  quality assurance engineers and other technical professionals with specialized skills 
we are headquartered in the silicon valley where competition among companies to hire engineering and technical professionals has historically been intense 
in times of professional labor imbalances  it may be difficult for us to locate and hire qualified engineers and technical professionals and for us to retain these people 
there are many technology companies located near our corporate offices in the silicon valley that may try to hire our employees 
the movement of our stock price may also impact our ability to hire and retain employees 
if we do not offer competitive compensation  we may not be able to recruit or retain employees 
we offer a broad based equity compensation plan based on granting options from stockholder approved plans in order to be competitive in the labor market 
if stockholders do not approve additional shares for these plans for future grants  it may be difficult for us to hire and retain skilled employees 
if we cannot successfully hire and retain employees  we may not be able to develop products or to meet demand for our products in a timely fashion and our results of operations may be adversely impacted 
our operating results may fluctuate based upon many factors  which could adversely affect our stock price we expect our stock price to vary with our operating results and  consequently  fluctuations in our results could adversely affect our stock price 
operating results may fluctuate due to varying demand for our products  success and timing of new product introductions  changes in interest rates and availability of bank or financing credit to consumers of digital copiers and printers  price reductions by us and our competitors  delay  cancellation or rescheduling of orders or projects  product performance  availability of key components  including possible delays in deliveries from suppliers  the status of our relationships with our oem partners  the performance of third party manufacturers  the status of our relationships with our key suppliers  the financial and operational condition of oem partners and key suppliers  potential excess or shortage of employees  competition from oems  changes in product mix  costs associated with complying with any applicable governmental regulations volatility in foreign exchange rates and general economic conditions 
many of our products  and the related oem copiers and printers  are purchased utilizing lease contracts or bank financing 
if prospective purchasers of digital copiers and printers are unable to obtain credit  or 
table of contents interest rate changes make credit terms undesirable  then demand for digital copiers and printers may be significantly reduced  which may adversely impact our revenues and operating results 
typically we do not have long term volume purchase contracts with our customers  and a substantial portion of our backlog is scheduled for delivery within days or less 
our customers may cancel orders and change volume levels or delivery times for product they have ordered from us without penalty 
however  a significant portion of our operating expenses are fixed in advance  and we plan these expenditures based on the sales forecasts from our oem customers and product development programs 
if we were unable to adjust our operating expenses in response to a shortfall in our sales  it could harm our quarterly financial results 
we attempt to hire additional employees to match growth in projected demand for our products 
if actual demand is lower than our projections as has occurred in the recent past  we likely will have hired too many employees and will therefore incur expenses that need not have been incurred and our financial results may be harmed 
if demand exceeds our projections  we likely will have hired too few employees and may not be able to meet demand for our products and our sales revenue may be adversely impacted 
projecting demand is difficult in our business and no assurances can be provided that we will accurately project demand 
if we cannot successfully manage our growth  our results of operations may be harmed 
the value of our investment portfolio will decrease if interest rates increase we have an investment portfolio of mainly fixed income securities classified as available for sale securities 
as a result  our investment portfolio is subject to interest rate risk and will fall in value if market interest rates increase 
we attempt to limit this exposure to interest rate risk by investing in securities with maturities of less than years  however  we may be unable to successfully limit our risk to interest rate fluctuations and this may cause our investment portfolio to decrease in value 
our stock price has been and may continue to be volatile our common stock  and the stock market generally  have from time to time experienced significant price and volume fluctuations 
the market prices for securities of technology companies have been especially volatile  and fluctuations in the stock market are often unrelated to the operating performance of particular companies 
these broad market fluctuations may adversely affect the market price of our common stock 
our common stock price may also be affected by the factors discussed in this section as well as fluctuations in our results of operations  revenues or earnings or those of our competitors and oems  failure of results of operations  revenues or earnings to meet the expectations of stock market analysts and investors  changes in stock market analysts recommendations regarding us  real or perceived technological advances by our competitors  political or economic instability in regions where our products are sold or used  general market and economic conditions  and changes in accounting standards 
we face risks from our international operations and from currency fluctuations approximately and of our revenue from the sale of products for the twelve month periods ended december  and december   respectively  came from sales outside north america  primarily to europe and japan 
we expect that sales to international destinations will continue to be a significant portion of our total revenue 
we are subject to certain risks because of our international operations 
these risks include the regulatory requirements of foreign governments which may apply to our products  as well as requirements for export licenses which may be required for the export of certain technologies 
the necessary export licenses may be delayed or difficult to obtain  which could cause a delay in our international sales and 
table of contents hurt our product revenue 
other risks include trade protection measures  natural disasters  and political or economic conditions in a specific country or region 
given the significance of our non us sales to our total product revenue  we face a continuing risk from the fluctuation of the us dollar versus the japanese yen  the euro and other major european currencies  and numerous southeast asian currencies 
although we typically invoice our customers in us dollars  when we do invoice our customers in local currencies  our cash flows and earnings are exposed to fluctuations in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates between the currency of the invoice and the us dollar 
our products may become expensive in the local currency of our customers  thereby reducing our ability to sell our product 
we attempt to limit or hedge these exposures through operational strategies and financial market instruments where we consider it appropriate 
to date we have mostly used forward contracts to reduce our risk from interest rate and currency fluctuations 
however  our efforts to reduce the risk from our international operations and from fluctuations in foreign currencies or interest rates may not be successful  which could harm our financial condition and operating results 
we may be unable to adequately protect our proprietary information and may incur expenses to defend our proprietary information we rely on a combination of copyright  patent  trademark and trade secret protection  nondisclosure agreements  and licensing and cross licensing arrangements to establish  maintain and protect our intellectual property rights  all of which afford only limited protection 
we have patent applications pending in the united states and in various foreign countries 
there can be no assurance that patents will be issued from these pending applications or from any future applications  or that  if issued  any claims allowed will be sufficiently broad to protect our technology 
any failure to adequately protect our proprietary information could harm our financial condition and operating results 
we cannot be certain that any patents that may be issued to us  or which we license from third parties  or any other of our proprietary rights will not be challenged  invalidated or circumvented 
in addition  we cannot be certain that any rights granted to us under any patents  licenses or other proprietary rights will provide adequate protection of our proprietary information 
from time to time  litigation may be necessary to defend and enforce our proprietary rights 
such litigation  whether or not concluded successfully for us  could involve significant expense and the diversion of our attention and other resources  which could harm our financial condition and operating results 
we face risks from third party claims of infringement and potential litigation third parties have claimed in the past and may claim in the future that our products infringe  or may infringe  their proprietary rights 
such claims could result in lengthy and expensive litigation 
such claims and any related litigation  whether or not we are successful in the litigation  could result in substantial costs and diversion of our resources  which could harm our financial condition and operating results 
although we may seek licenses from third parties covering intellectual property that we are allegedly infringing  we cannot assure you that any such licenses could be obtained on acceptable terms  if at all 
see legal proceedings 
our products may contain defects which are not discovered until after shipping our products consist of hardware and software developed by ourselves and others 
our products may contain undetected errors when first introduced or when new versions are released  and we have in the past discovered software and hardware errors in certain of our new products after their introduction 
there can be no assurance that errors would not be found in new versions of our products after commencement of commercial shipments  or that any such errors would not result in a loss or delay in market acceptance and thus harm our reputation and revenues 
in addition  errors in our products including errors in licensed third party software detected prior to new product releases could result in delays in the introduction of new products and incurring of additional expense  which could harm our operating results 

table of contents seasonal purchasing patterns of our oem customers have historically caused lower fourth quarter revenue  which may negatively impact our results of operations our results of operations have typically followed a seasonal pattern reflecting the buying patterns of our large oem customers 
in the past  our fiscal fourth quarter the quarter ending december results have been adversely affected because some or all of our oem customers wanted to decrease  or otherwise delay  fourth quarter orders with lower channel inventories 
this impact has been increasingly mitigated  as our oem customers have lowered channel inventories throughout the year 
in addition  the first fiscal quarter traditionally has been a weaker quarter because our oem partners focus on training their sales forces and have reduced sell through themselves 
the primary reasons for this seasonal pattern are our oem partners have historically sought to minimize year end inventory investment including the reduction in demand following introductory channel fill purchases  the timing of new product releases and training by our oem partners  and certain of our oem partners typically achieve their yearly sales targets before year end and consequently delay further purchases into the next fiscal year we do not know when our partners reach these sales targets as they generally do not disclose them to us 
as a result of these factors  we believe that period to period comparisons of our operating results are not meaningful  and you should not rely on such comparisons to predict our future performance 
we anticipate that future operating results may fluctuate significantly due to the continuation or changes in this seasonal demand pattern 
we may make acquisitions and acquisitions involve numerous risks we seek to develop new technologies and products from both internal and external sources 
as part of this effort  we have in the past made  and will likely continue to make  acquisitions of other companies or other companies assets 
acquisitions involve numerous risks  including the following difficulties in integration of operations  technologies  or products  risks of entering markets in which we have little or no prior experience  or entering markets where competitors have stronger market positions  possible write downs of impaired assets  potential loss of key employees of the acquired company  possible expense overruns  adverse reaction by customers  suppliers or partners of the acquired company or efi  risk of changes in ratings by stock analysts  potential litigation surrounding transactions and inability to protect or secure technology rights 
mergers and acquisitions of companies are inherently risky  and we cannot assure you that our previous or future acquisitions will be successful and will not harm our business  operating results  financial condition  or stock price 
the location and concentration of our facilities subjects us to the risk of earthquakes  floods or other natural disasters our corporate headquarters  including most of our research and development facilities and manufacturing operations  are located in the san francisco bay area  an area known for seismic activity 
this area has also experienced flooding in the past 
in addition  many of the components necessary to supply our products are purchased from suppliers subject to risk from natural disasters  based in areas including the san francisco bay 
table of contents area  taiwan  and japan 
a significant natural disaster  such as an earthquake or a flood  could harm our business  financial condition  and operating results 
we are dependent on subcontractors to manufacture and deliver products to our customers we subcontract with other companies to manufacture our products 
we rely on the ability of our subcontractors to produce products to be sold to our customers  and while we closely monitor our subcontractors performance we cannot assure you that such subcontractors will continue to manufacture our products in a timely and effective manner 
the weakened economy has led to the dissolution and bankruptcies of some of the subcontractors who are able to manufacture our products and has caused several other such subcontractors to merge  decreasing the available number of subcontractors 
if the available number of subcontractors continues to decrease  it is possible that we will not be able to secure appropriate subcontractors to fulfill our demand in a timely manner or at all  particularly if demand for our products increases  or if we lose one or more of our current subcontractors 
we cannot assure you that difficulties experienced by our subcontractors  including financial problems  and the inability to make or ship our products or fix quality assurance problems  would not harm our business  operating results  or financial condition 
if we decide to change subcontractors  we could experience delays in setting up new subcontractors which would result in delay in delivery of our products 
we have a high concentration of our products manufactured at a single subcontractor location  sanmina sci in colorado 
should sanmina sci experience any inability to manufacture or deliver product from this location our business  financial condition and operations could be harmed 
we depend upon a limited group of suppliers for key components in our products certain components necessary for the manufacture of our products are obtained from a sole supplier or a limited group of suppliers 
these include processors from intel and other related semiconductor components 
we may not maintain long term agreements with any of our suppliers of components 
because the purchase of certain key components involves long lead times  in the event of unanticipated volatility in demand for our products  we could be unable to manufacture certain products in a quantity sufficient to meet end user demand  or we may hold excess quantities of inventory 
we maintain an inventory of components for which we are dependent upon sole or limited source suppliers and components with prices that fluctuate significantly 
as a result  we are subject to a risk of inventory obsolescence  which could adversely affect our operating results and financial condition 
additionally  the market prices and availability of certain components  particularly memory  and intel designed components  which collectively represent a substantial portion of the total manufactured cost of our products  have fluctuated significantly in the past 
such fluctuations in the future could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition including a reduction in gross margins 
we face the risk of decreased revenues in light of ongoing economic uncertainty the revenue growth and profitability of our business depends significantly on the overall demand for information technology products such as ours that enable printing of digital data 
softening demand for these products caused by ongoing economic uncertainty and reduced spending in the united states and other regions where we conduct business has resulted  and may further result  in decreased revenues  earnings levels or growth rates or inventory write downs 
the united states and global economy  and particularly the markets for our products have weakened substantially over the past two years and market conditions continue to be challenging 
this has resulted in individuals and companies delaying or reducing expenditures  including information technology expenditures 
further delays or reductions in information technology spending may have a material adverse effect on demand for our products and services  and consequently on our business  operating results  financial condition  prospects and stock price 

table of contents item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk the company is exposed to various market risks  including changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
market risk is the potential loss arising from adverse changes in market rates and prices  such as foreign currency exchange and interest rates 
the company does not enter into derivatives or other financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes 
the company enters into financial instrument contracts to manage and reduce the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
the counterparties to such contracts are major financial institutions 
foreign exchange contracts in the past the company utilized forward foreign exchange contracts to hedge the currency fluctuations in transactions denominated in foreign currencies  thereby limiting the company s risk that would otherwise result from changes in exchange rates 
the transactions hedged were intercompany accounts receivable and payable between the company and its japanese subsidiary 
the periods of the forward foreign exchange contracts correspond to the reporting periods of the hedged transactions 
foreign exchange gains and losses on intercompany balances and the offsetting losses and gains on forward foreign exchange contracts are reflected in the income statement 
the company had no forward foreign exchange contracts outstanding as of december  interest rate risk we maintain an investment portfolio of various holdings  types and maturities 
these securities are generally classified as available for sale and consequently  are recorded on the balance sheet at fair value with unrealized gains and losses reported as a separate component of accumulated other comprehensive income loss 
at any time  a sharp rise in interest rates could have a material adverse impact on the fair value of our investment portfolio 
conversely  declines in interest rates could have a material impact on interest earnings for our portfolio 
we do not currently hedge these interest rate exposures 
the following table presents the hypothetical change in fair values in the financial instruments held by the company at december  that are sensitive to changes in interest rates 
the modeling technique used measures the change in fair values arising from selected potential changes in interest rates 
market changes reflect immediate hypothetical parallel shifts in the yield curve of plus or minus basis points bps over a twelve month time horizon 
this table estimates the fair value of the portfolio at a twelve month time horizon valuation of securities valuation of securities given an interest rate given an interest rate decrease of no change in increase of basis points interest rates basis points in thousands total fair market value the fair value of the company s long term debt  including current maturities  was estimated to be million as of december   and equaled the carrying value 
the company s long term debt requires interest payments based on a variable rate and therefore its fair value is not subject to interest rate risk
