item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations general the company s results of operations depend primarily on its net interest income  which is the difference between interest income on interest earning assets  which principally consist of loans  mortgage related securities and investment securities  and interest expense on interest bearing liabilities  which consist of deposits and borrowings 
net interest income is determined by the company s interest rate spread ie  the difference between the yields earned on its interest earning assets and the rates paid on its interest bearing liabilities and the relative amounts of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities 
the company s results of operations also are affected by the provision for loan losses resulting from management s assessment of the level of the allowance for loan losses  its non interest income  including service fees and related income  mortgage banking activities and gains and losses from the sales of loans and securities  the level of its non interest expense  including compensation and employee benefits  occupancy expense  data processing services  amortization of intangibles and income tax expense 
the bank is a community oriented bank  which emphasizes customer service and convenience 
as part of this strategy  the bank offers products and services designed to meet the needs of its retail and commercial customers 
the company generally has sought to achieve long term financial strength and stability by increasing the amount and stability of its net interest income and non interest income and by maintaining a high level of asset quality 
in pursuit of these goals  the company has adopted a business strategy of controlled growth  emphasizing commercial real estate and multi family residential lending  commercial business lending  mortgage warehouse lines of credit and retail and commercial deposit products  while maintaining asset quality and stable liquidity 
the company announced in october that it had changed its fiscal year end from march to december  effective december  this change provided internal efficiencies as well as aligned the company s reporting cycle with regulators  taxing authorities and the investor community 
due to the change in the reporting period  the comparison of annual operating performance is based upon the audited month calendar year ended december  compared to the month calendar year ended december  compared to the audited month fiscal year ended march  business strategy controlled growth 
in recent years  the company has sought to increase its assets and expand its operations through internal growth as well as through acquisitions 
during the year ended december   the company opened four de novo branches and opened two de novo branches during the year ended december  the company currently expects to expand its branch network through the opening of approximately twelve additional banking locations during the next twelve to eighteen months 
during the first quarter of  the company opened two locations in manhattan bringing the total to banking offices  of which are full service 
the company has selectively used acquisitions in the past as a means to expand its footprint and operations 
the company completed its acquisition of broad  which had million in assets  effective the close of business on july  and its acquisition of statewide  which had million in assets  effective the close of business on january  the broad and statewide acquisitions enabled the company to expand into contiguous markets in northern new jersey with similar demographics as the company s new york market area 
the acquisitions also enabled the company to further emphasize its broad array of commercial business products  including business lending and lower cost deposits  which helped accelerate the company s strategy of becoming more commercial bank like 
the company also completed several other smaller whole bank and branch acquisitions in earlier periods 
the company s assets increased by million  or  from billion at december  to billion at december  resulting mainly from increases of million in the securities available for sale portfolio  million in the loans available for sale portfolio  million in other assets  and million in bank owned life insurance boli  partially offset by a million decrease in the loan portfolio 
such growth was funded primarily through the use of borrowings and an increase in deposits 
emphasis on commercial real estate  commercial business and multi family lending 
since  the company has focused on expanding its higher yielding loan portfolios as compared to single family mortgage loans including fixed and variable rate portfolios of commercial real estate loans  commercial business loans and mortgage warehouse lines of credit 
given the concentration of multi family housing units in the new york city metropolitan area  as well as the company s commitment to remain a leader in the multi family loan market  the company continues to emphasize the origination both for portfolio and for sale of loans secured by first liens on multi family residential properties  which consist primarily of mortgage loans secured by apartment buildings 
in addition to continuing to generate mortgage loans secured by multi family and commercial real estate  the company also commenced a strategy in the fourth quarter of to originate and sell multi family residential mortgage loans in the secondary market to fannie mae while retaining servicing in order to further the company s ongoing strategic objective of increasing non interest income related to lending and servicing revenue 
during the year ended december   the company originated for sale billion and sold billion of such loans 
see business lending activities loan originations  purchases  sales and servicing 
in addition  to further expand variable yielding portfolios  in april  the company purchased the assets of summit bank s mbfg  a specialized lending group providing mortgage warehouse lines of credit to mortgage bankers in new york  new jersey and connecticut 
the acquisition increased the mortgage warehouse line of credit portfolio by million in lines with approximately million in outstanding advances at the time of acquisition 
in october  in furtherance of its business strategy regarding commercial real estate and multi family loan originations and sales  the company increased its minority investment in meridian  a new york based mortgage brokerage firm 
meridian is primarily engaged in the origination of commercial real estate and multi family mortgage loans 
as consideration for such additional interest  the company paid million in cash and issued  shares of common stock for total consideration of approximately million 
see business lending activities multi family residential lending 
commercial real estate  commercial business  multi family residential loans and mortgage warehouse lines of credit all generally have a higher inherent risk of loss than single family residential mortgage or cooperative apartment loans because repayment of the loans or lines often depends on the successful operation of a business or the underlying property 
accordingly  repayment of these loans is subject to adverse conditions in the real estate market and the local economy 
in addition  the company s commercial real estate and multi family residential loans have significantly larger average loan balances compared to its single family residential mortgage and cooperative apartment loans 
the company s strategy of emphasizing higher yielding and variable rate loan products is reflected in the shifting composition of its loan portfolio 
the company s continued emphasis on commercial lending resulted in commercial real estate  commercial business and advances under mortgage warehouse lines of credit comprising in the aggregate of its total loan portfolio at december  compared to at december  while single family and multi family residential loans comprised in the aggregate of the company s loan portfolio at december  compared to at december  maintain asset quality 
management believes that maintaining high asset quality is key to achieving and sustaining long term financial success 
accordingly  the company has sought to maintain a high level of asset quality and moderate credit risk through its underwriting standards and by generally limiting its origination to loans secured by properties or collateral located in its market area 
non performing assets as a percentage of total assets at december  amounted to and the ratio of its allowance for loan losses to non performing loans amounted to  while at december   the percentages were and  respectively 
non performing assets decreased million or to million at december  compared to million at december  loans days or more past maturity which continued to make payments on a basis consistent with the original repayment schedule decreased by million to million at december  the company s non accrual loans increased million  to million at december  with the increase being primarily related to commercial business and real estate loans 
stable source of liquidity 
the company purchases short to medium term investment securities and mortgage related securities combining what management believes to be appropriate liquidity  yield and credit quality in order to achieve a managed and a reasonably predictable source of liquidity to meet loan demand and  to a lesser extent  a stable source of interest income 
these portfolios  which totaled in the aggregate billion at december  compared to billion at december   are comprised primarily of mortgage related securities totaling billion of which million consists of cmos and million of mortgage backed securities  million of corporate bonds  million of obligations of the us government and federal agencies and million of preferred securities 
in accordance with the company s policy  securities purchased by the company generally must be rated at least investment grade upon purchase 
emphasis on retail deposits and customer service 
the company  as a community based financial institution  is largely dependent upon its growth and retention of competitively priced core deposits non certificate of deposit accounts to provide a stable source of funding 
the company has retained many loyal customers over the years through a combination of quality service  customer convenience  an experienced staff and a commitment to the communities which it serves 
the company has increased the emphasis on expanding commercial and consumer relationships  lower costing core deposits  which do not include certificates of deposits  increased million or  to billion or of the company s total deposits at december   as compared to billion at december  this increase in lower costing core deposits reflects both the continued successful implementation of the company s business strategy of increasing core deposits  as well as the current interest rate environment 
in addition  the company does not accept brokered deposits as a source of funds and presently has no plans to do so in the future 
changes in financial condition total assets increased by million  or  from billion at december  to billion at december  primarily due to increases of million in the securities available for sale portfolio  million in loans available for sale  million in boli  million in other assets partially offset by a million decline in the loan portfolio 
these increases were funded primarily through the use of borrowings and growth in deposits 
cash and cash equivalents 
cash and cash equivalents decreased from million at december  to million at december  the million decrease was principally due to the use of such assets to fund the origination or purchase of higher yielding interest earning assets 
securities available for sale 
the aggregate securities available for sale portfolio which includes investment securities and mortgage related securities increased million  or  from billion at december  to billion at december  the increase in securities available for sale was funded primarily through the use of borrowings 
the company s mortgage related securities portfolio increased million  or to billion at december  compared to million at december  the securities were comprised of million of aaa rated cmos and million of cmos which were issued or guaranteed by fhlmc  the fannie mae or gnma and million of mortgage backed pass through certificates which were also issued or guaranteed by fhlmc  fannie mae or gnma 
the increase in the portfolio was primarily due to purchases of million of aaa rated cmos with an average yield of and million of agency cmos with a weighted average yield of and million of fannie mae pass through certificates at a weighted average yield of 
partially offsetting these increases were proceeds totaling approximately million received from normal and accelerated principal repayments and a million sale of an agency cmo at a loss of million 
the company s investment securities portfolio increased million to million at december  compared to million at december  the increase was primarily due to million of purchases  primarily preferred securities and corporate bonds  which were partially offset by the proceeds received from maturing securities of million and from sales of million of securities  primarily equity securities  at a million gain 
at december   the company had a million net unrealized gain  net of tax  on available for sale investment and mortgage related securities 
loans available for sale 
loans available for sale increased by million to million at december  from million at december  the company commenced a strategy in the december quarter to originate and sell multi family residential mortgage loans in the secondary market to fannie mae while retaining servicing 
as part of these transactions  the company retains a portion of the associated credit risk 
during the year ended december   the company originated billion and sold billion of loans to fannie mae under this program and as a result serviced billion of loans with a maximum potential loss exposure of million 
multi family loans available for sale at december  totaled million 
the increase in multi family loans available for sale at december  compared to december  was a result of significant loan volume at the end of the fourth quarter of due to the current interest rate cycle and the time delay between the date of origination and the date of sale to fannie mae  which usually occurs within seven days 
see lending activities loan originations  purchases  sales and servicing set forth in item and note of the notes to consolidated financial statements set forth in item hereof for additional information 
the company also originates and sells single family residential mortgage loans under a mortgage origination assistance agreement with cendant 
the company funds the loans directly and sells the loans and related servicing to cendant 
the company originated million and sold million of such loans during the year ended december  single family residential mortgage loans available for sale at december  totaled million 
both programs were established in order to further the company s ongoing strategic objective of increasing non interest income related to lending and or servicing revenue 
loans  net 
loans  net  decreased by million  or  to billion at december  from billion at december  the company continued its focus on expanding its higher yielding portfolios of commercial real estate  commercial business and variable rate mortgage warehouse lines of credit as part of its business plan 
the company is also committed to remaining a leader in the multi family residential loan market 
the company originated for its own portfolio during the year ended december  approximately million of mortgage loans compared to million for the nine months ended december  although the company had significant loan originations during  total loans decreased due to the combination of the heavy run off in the single family residential portfolio  the sale to fannie mae of million of multi family residential loans sold from portfolio and the accelerated rate of repayments in the multi family residential portfolio 
as part of the company s continuing enhancement of its credit administration process  during the company redefined its criteria for classifying loans as either commercial real estate or commercial business loans 
as a result of the application of the new criteria and the company s conversion to a new commercial loan servicing system completed during the fourth quarter of  the company reviewed all of its commercial loan relationships and redesignated as of september  approximately million of commercial business loans as commercial real estate or multi family residential loans 
the company has not revised any other current or prior period information related to this redesignation since it did not affect the amount of the company s net loan portfolio  total assets  results of operations or earnings per share 
multi family residential loans decreased million to billion at december  compared to billion at december  the decrease was primarily due to repayments of million and sales of million which were partially offset by million of originations for portfolio retention and million of loans redesignated as discussed above 
during the fourth quarter of  the company sold from portfolio at par million of fully performing multi family residential loans in a securitization transaction in exchange for fannie mae mortgage backed securities representing a interest in these loans 
these loans were sold with full recourse with the company retaining servicing 
this transaction supported the company s efforts to continue to build and strengthen its relationship with fannie mae  had no impact on earnings but had a positive impact on the company s risk based capital ratios since the risk weighting on the mortgage backed securities was lower than on the underlying loans 
as a result of these activities  multi family residential loans comprised of the total loan portfolio at december  compared to at december  commercial real estate loans increased million or to billion at december  compared to billion at december  the increase was primarily due to million of originations  million of loans redesignated as discussed above partially offset by million of loan repayments for the year ended december  as a result of these activities  commercial real estate loans comprised of the total loan portfolio at december  compared to at december  commercial business loans decreased million  or  from million at december  to million at december  the decrease was primarily due to million of loans being redesignated as commercial real estate loans or multi family residential loans as discussed above  and million of repayments partially offset by million of originations and advances during the year ended december  commercial business loans comprised of the total loan portfolio at december  mortgage warehouse lines of credit are secured short term advances extended to mortgage banking companies to fund the origination of one to four family mortgages 
advances under mortgage warehouse lines of credit increased million from million at december  to million at december  at december   there were million of unused lines of credit related to mortgage warehouse lines of credit 
the increase was due to the current interest cycle and resultant refinance market 
mortgage warehouse lines of credit comprised of the total loan portfolio at december  partially offsetting the growth in the commercial real estate and business loan and mortgage warehouse lines of credit portfolios was the run off of the company s residential mortgage portfolio 
single family residential and cooperative apartment loans decreased million from an aggregate of million at december  to an aggregate of million at december  the decline was due to increased repayments as a result of the current interest rate environment combined with the decreased emphasis on originating these loans for portfolio in favor of higher yielding commercial real estate and business loans 
the company originates and sells single family residential mortgage loans to cendant as previously discussed 
non performing assets 
non performing assets as a percentage of total assets at december  amounted to compared to at december  the company s non performing assets  which consist of non accrual loans  loans past due days or more as to interest or principal and accruing and other real estate owned acquired through foreclosure or deed in lieu thereof  decreased by million or to million at december  from million at december  the decrease in non performing assets was primarily due to a million decrease in loans contractually past maturity but which are continuing to pay in accordance with their original repayment schedule partially offset by an million increase to million in non accrual loans  primarily commercial real estate and business loans 
at december   the company s non performing assets consisted of million of non accrual loans including million of commercial business loans  million of commercial real estate loans  million of single family residential loans and million of multi family residential loans  million of loans past due days or more as to principal and accruing  million of loans past due days or more as to interest and accruing and  of other real estate owned 
allowance for loan losses 
the company s allowance for loan losses amounted to million at december   as compared to million at december  at december   the company s allowance amounted to of total loans and of total non performing loans compared to and at december   respectively 
the company s allowance increased million during the year ended december  primarily due to an million provision for loan losses partially offset by million of net charge offs or of average total loans 
the provision recorded reflected the company s increase in non accrual loans  the increase in classified loans  delinquencies and charge offs  the substantial increase in mortgage warehouse advances  the continued emphasis on commercial real estate and business loan originations  which are generally considered to have greater risk of loss  as well as the recognition of the current economic conditions 
in assessing the level of the allowance for loan losses  the company considers the composition of its loan portfolio  the growth of loan balances within various segments of the overall portfolio  the state of the local and to a certain degree  the national economy as it may impact the performance of loans within different segments of the portfolio  the loss experience related to different segments or classes of loans  the type  size and geographic concentration of loans held by the company  the level of past due and non performing loans  the value of collateral securing loans  the level of classified loans and the number of loans requiring heightened management oversight 
the continued shifting of the composition of the loan portfolio to be more commercial bank like by increasing the balance of commercial real estate and business loans and mortgage warehouse lines of credit may increase the level of known and inherent losses in the company s loan portfolio 
the company has identified the evaluation of the allowance for loan losses as a critical accounting estimate where amounts are sensitive to material variation 
critical accounting estimates are significantly affected by management judgment and uncertainties and there is a likelihood that materially different amounts would be reported under different  but reasonably plausible  conditions or assumptions 
the allowance for loan losses is considered a critical accounting estimate because there is a large degree of judgment in i assigning individual loans to specific risk levels pass  special mention  substandard  doubtful and loss  ii valuing the underlying collateral securing the loans  iii determining the appropriate reserve factor to be applied to specific risk levels for criticized and classified loans special mention  substandard  doubtful and loss and iv determining reserve factors to be applied to pass loans based upon loan type 
to the extent that loans change risk levels  collateral values change or reserve factors change  the company may need to adjust its provision for loan losses which would impact earnings 
management has discussed the development and selection of this critical accounting estimate with the audit committee of the board of directors and the audit committee has reviewed the company s disclosure relating to it in this management s discussion and analysis md a 
management believes the allowance for loan losses at december  was at a level to cover the known and inherent losses in the portfolio that were both probable and reasonable to estimate 
in the future  management may adjust the level of its allowance for loan losses as economic and other conditions dictate 
management reviews the allowance for loan losses not less than quarterly 
goodwill and intangible assets 
effective april   the company adopted sfas no 
 which resulted in discontinuing the amortization of goodwill 
under the statement  goodwill is carried at its book value as of april  and any future impairment of goodwill will be recognized as non interest expense in the period of impairment 
however  under the terms of the statement  identifiable intangibles with identifiable lives continue to be amortized 
the company did not recognize an impairment loss as a result of its annual impairment test effective october  the company is required to test the value of its goodwill at least annually 
the company s goodwill  which aggregated million at december   resulted from the acquisitions of broad and statewide as well as the acquisition of bay ridge bancorp  inc in january the company s million of identifiable intangible assets at december  resulted primarily from two branch purchase transactions effected in fiscal the company s intangible assets decreased by million to million at december  from million at december  the decrease was a result of amortization of the intangible assets 
the amortization of identified intangible assets will continue to reduce net income until such intangible assets are fully amortized 
however  most of the remaining identified intangibles as of december  will be amortized by september  the company performs a goodwill impairment test on an annual basis 
the goodwill impairment test compares the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount  including goodwill 
if the fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount  goodwill of the reporting unit is considered not impaired 
if the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value  goodwill is considered impaired and the company must measure the amount of impairment loss  if any 
the fair value of a reporting unit may be determined by a combination of quoted market prices  a present value technique or multiples of earnings or revenue 
quoted market prices in active markets are the best evidence of fair value and shall be used as the basis for the measurement  if available 
however  the market price of an individual equity security and thus the market capitalization of a reporting unit with publicly traded equity securities may not be representative of the fair value of the reporting unit as a whole 
the quoted market price of an individual equity security  therefore  need not be the sole measurement basis of the fair value of a reporting unit 
a present value technique is another method with which to estimate the fair value of a group of net assets 
if a present value technique is used to measure fair value  estimates of future cash flows used in that technique shall be consistent with the objective of measuring fair value 
those cash flow estimates shall incorporate assumptions that marketplace participants would use in their estimates of fair value 
if that information is not available without undue cost and effort  an entity may use its own assumptions 
a third method of estimating the fair value of a reporting unit  is a valuation technique based on multiples of earnings or revenue 
the company currently uses a combination of quoted market prices of its publicly traded stock and multiples of earnings in its goodwill impairment test 
the company has identified the goodwill impairment test as a critical accounting estimate due to the various methods quoted market price  present value technique or multiples of earnings or revenue and judgment involved in determining the fair value of a reporting unit 
a change in judgment could result in goodwill being considered impaired which would result in a charge to non interest expense in the period of impairment 
management has discussed the development and selection of this critical accounting estimate with the audit committee of the board of directors and the audit committee has reviewed the company s disclosure relating to it in this md a 
bank owned life insurance boli 
the company holds boli policies to fund certain future employee benefit costs and to provide attractive tax exempt returns to the company 
the boli is recorded at its cash surrender value and changes in value are recorded in non interest income

the remaining million increase was due to a change in the cash surrender value of the boli 
other assets 
other assets increased million from million at december  to at december  the increase was primarily due to a million increase in net deferred tax assets  a million increase in fhlb stock  a million increase in the company s minority equity investment in meridian and an million increase in prepaid pension obligation 
at the end of the fourth quarter of  the company made a cash contribution of approximately million to restore the company s pension plan to fully funded status

deposits 
deposits increased million or to billion at december  compared to billion at december  the increase was due to deposit inflows totaling million as well as interest credited of million 
complementing the increased emphasis on expanding commercial and consumer relationships  lower costing core deposits consisting of all deposit accounts other than certificates of deposit grew by million  or  to billion at december  compared to billion at december  this increase reflects both the continued successful implementation of the company s business strategy of increasing core deposits as well as the current interest rate environment 
execution of this strategy is evidenced by the increase in core deposits to approximately of total deposits at december  compared to of total deposits at december  the company focuses on the growth of core deposits as a key element of its asset liability management process to lower interest expense and thus increase net interest margin given that these deposits have a lower cost of funds than certificates of deposit and fhlb borrowings 
core deposits also reduce liquidity fluctuations since these accounts generally are considered to be less likely than certificates of deposit to be subject to disintermediation 
in addition  these deposits improve non interest income through increased customer related fees and service charges 
the weighted average interest rate of core deposits was compared to for certificates of deposit and for borrowings for the year ended december  borrowings 
borrowings increased million or to billion at december  compared to billion at december  the increase was principally due to a million increase in fhlb advances  a million increase in fhlb repurchase agreements partially offset by a million decrease in fhlb overnight borrowings 
during the year ended december   the company took advantage of the steepness in the yield curve by securing million of adjustable rate three and four year borrowings from the fhlb of new york 
these borrowings have interest rate caps that prevent the rates from exceeding to 
these borrowings have a weighted average interest rate of and are indexed to libor 
the company also replaced million of borrowings that matured during with fixed rate ten year borrowings  callable in five years  at a weighted average interest rate of and paid off million of borrowings that matured at a weighted average interest rate of 
the million increase was primarily used to fund the growth in the available for sale securities portfolio and to fund loan originations

stockholders equity 
the holding company s stockholders equity totaled million at december   compared to million at december  the million increase was primarily due to net income of million  amortization of the earned portion of restricted stock grants of million  million related to the employee stock ownership plan esop shares committed to be released for the year ended and million related to accelerated vesting of stock options 
in addition  increases were also attributable to million related to the exercise of stock options and the issuance of shares in payment of directors fees and million of consideration paid for the company s increased equity investment in meridian 
these increases were partially offset by a million decrease in the net unrealized gain on securities available for sale  a million valuation adjustment of the deferred tax asset reflecting the fair market value of stock contributed to the foundation at its inception in march  a million reduction in capital resulting from the purchase during the year ended december  of  shares of common stock in connection with the holding company s open market repurchase programs  a million decrease due to dividends declared and a million decrease for the change in fair value of interest rate swaps  net of tax

comparison of results of operations for the twelve months ended december  and the twelve months ended december  general 
for the year ended december   the company reported a increase in diluted earnings per share to compared to for the year ended december  net income for the year ended december  increased to million compared to million for the year ended december  net interest income 
net interest income increased by million or to million for the year ended december  as compared to million for the year ended december  the increase was primarily due to a million decrease in interest expense combined with a million increase in interest income 
the growth in net interest income primarily reflected the million increase in average interest earning assets as well as a basis point increase in the net interest margin during the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  the increase in average interest earning assets was primarily attributable to growth in mortgage related securities  commercial real estate and business loans  and mortgage warehouse lines of credit 
for the year ended december   the company s net interest margin increased basis points to from for the year ended december  the improvement in net interest margin was directly attributable to the company s strategy to reduce the average cost of interest bearing liabilities in order to offset the decline in the average yield earned on interest earning assets resulting from the current interest rate environment 
for the year ended december  as compared to the year ended december   the average rate paid on average interest bearing liabilities decreased basis points  more than offsetting the basis point decline in the average yield earned on interest earning assets 
this decline mirrored the movement in the yield curve with short term interest rates declining more rapidly than longer term rates 
complementing the movement in the yield curve  the company contributed to the improvement in net interest margin by originating higher yielding commercial loan products through its expanded presence in the new york metropolitan market and the continuing evolution of a retail banking sales culture focused on expanding the company s level of core deposits

the bank s ability to pay dividends to the holding company is also subject to certain restrictions 
under the new york banking law  dividends may be declared and paid only out of the net profits of the bank 
the approval of the superintendent of banks of the state of new york is required if the total of all dividends declared in any calendar year will exceed the net profits for that year plus the retained net profits of the preceding two years  less any required transfers 
in addition  the ots regulations govern capital distributions by savings institutions  which include cash dividends  stock repurchases and other transactions charged to the capital account of a savings institution to make capital distributions 
the bank elected to be deemed a savings association for certain purposes 
as a result  it has to comply with the ots capital distribution regulations 
a savings institution must file an application for ots approval of the capital distribution if any of the following occur or would occur as a result of the capital distribution the total capital distributions for the applicable calendar year exceed the sum of the institution s net income for that year to date plus the institution s retained net income for the preceding two years  the institution would not be at least adequately capitalized following the distribution  the distribution would violate any applicable statute  regulation  agreement or ots imposed condition  or the institution is not eligible for expedited treatment of its filings 
if an application is not required to be filed  savings institutions which are a subsidiary of a holding company as well as certain other institu tions must still file a notice with the ots at least days before the board of directors declares a dividend or approves a capital distribution 
in addition  no dividends may be declared  credited or paid if the effect thereof would cause the bank s capital to be reduced below the amount required by the superintendent or the fdic 
during  the bank requested and received approval of the distribution to the company of an aggregate of million  of which million was declared by the bank and was funded during with the remaining million declared and funded in in december  the bank requested and received approval of the distribution to the company of an aggregate of million  of which million had been distributed as of december   with the remainder distributed in the distributions were primarily used by the company to fund the company s open market stock repurchase programs  dividend payments and consideration paid in october to increase the company s minority investment in meridian

impact of inflation and changing prices the consolidated financial statements and related financial data presented herein have been prepared in accordance with gaap  which requires the measurement of financial position and operating results in terms of historical dollars  without considering changes in relative purchasing power over time due to inflation 
unlike most industrial companies  virtually all of the company s assets and liabilities are monetary in nature 
as a result  interest rates generally have a more significant impact on a financial institution s performance than does the effect of inflation

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk general 
market risk is the risk of loss arising from adverse changes in the fair value of financial instruments 
as a financial institution  the company s primary component of market risk is interest rate risk 
interest rate risk is defined as the sensitivity of the company s current and future earnings to changes in the level of market rates of interest 
market risk arises in the ordinary course of the company s business  as the repricing characteristics of its assets do not match those of its liabilities 
based upon the company s nature of operations  the company is not subject to foreign currency exchange or commodity price risk 
the company s various loan portfolios  concentrated primarily within the greater new york city metropolitan area which includes parts of northern new jersey and southern connecticut  are subject to risks associated with the local economy 
the company does not own any trading assets 
net interest margin represents net interest income as a percentage of average interest earning assets 
net interest margin is directly affected by changes in the level of interest rates  the relationship between rates  the impact of interest rate fluctuations on asset prepayments  the level and composition of assets and liabilities and the credit quality of the loan portfolio 
management s asset liability objectives are to maintain a strong  stable net interest margin  to utilize its capital effectively without taking undue risks and to maintain adequate liquidity 
management responsibility for interest rate risk resides with the asset and liability management committee alco 
the committee is chaired by the treasurer  and includes the chief executive officer  chief financial officer  chief credit officer and the company s senior business unit and financial executives 
interest rate risk management strategies are formulated and monitored by alco within policies and limits approved by the board of directors 
these policies and limits set forth the maximum risk which the board of directors deems prudent  govern permissible investment securities and off balance sheet instruments  and identify acceptable counterparties to securities and off balance sheet transactions 
alco risk management strategies allow for the assumption of interest rate risk within the board approved limits 
the strategies are formulated based upon alco s assessments of likely market developments and trends in the company s lending and consumer banking businesses 
strategies are developed with the aim of enhancing the company s net income and capital  while ensuring the risks to income and capital from adverse movements in interest rates are acceptable 
the company s strategies to manage interest rate risk include i increasing the interest sensitivity of its mortgage loan portfolio through the use of adjustable rate loans or relatively short term primarily five years balloon loans  ii originating relatively short term or variable rate consumer and commercial business loans as well as mortgage warehouse lines of credit  iii investing in securities  primarily mortgage related instruments with maturities or estimated average lives of less than five years  iv promoting stable savings  demand and other transaction accounts  v utilizing variable rate borrowings which have imbedded derivatives to cap the cost of borrowings  vi using interest rate swaps to modify the repricing characteristics of certain variable rate borrowings  vii maintaining a strong capital position and viii maintaining a relatively high level of liquidity and or borrowing capacity 
as part of the overall interest rate risk management strategy  management has entered into deriva tive instruments to minimize significant unplanned fluctuations in earnings and cash flows caused by interest rate volatility 
the interest rate risk management strategy at times involves modifying the repricing characteristics of certain borrowings so that changes in interest rates do not have a significant adverse effect on net interest income  the net interest margin and cash flows 
derivative instruments that management periodically uses as part of its interest rate risk management strategy include interest rate swaps 
at december   the company had forward starting interest rate swap agreements outstanding with aggregate notional values of million 
these agreements qualify as cash flow hedges of anticipated interest payments relating to million of variable rate fhlb borrowings that the company intends to draw down during to replace existing fhlb borrowings that will mature in the swaps require the company at a future date to make periodic fixed rate payments to the swap counterparties  while receiving periodic variable rate payments indexed to the three month libor rate from the swap counterparties based on a common notional amount and maturity date 
as a result  the net impact of the swap will be to convert the variable interest payments on the million fhlb borrowings to fixed interest payments the company will make to the swap counterparty 
these swaps have original maturities ranging up to years 
the credit risk associated with these derivative instruments is the risk of non performance by the counterparty to the agreements 
however  management does not anticipate non performance by the counterparties and monitors controls the risk through its asset liability management procedures 
see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements set forth in item hereof 
management uses a variety of analyses to monitor the sensitivity of net interest income  primarily a dynamic simulation model complemented by a traditional gap analysis and  to a lesser degree  a net portfolio value analysis 
net interest income simulation model 
the simulation model measures the sensitivity of net interest income to changes in market interest rates 
the simulation involves a degree of estimation based on certain assumptions that management believes to be reasonable 
factors considered include contractual maturities  prepayments  repricing characteristics  deposit retention and the relative sensitivity of assets and liabilities to changes in market interest rates 
the board has established certain limits for the potential volatility of net interest income as projected by the simulation model 
volatility is measured from a base case where rates are assumed to be flat 
volatility is expressed as the percentage change  from the base case  in net interest income over a month period 
the model is kept static with respect to the composition of the balance sheet and  therefore does not reflect management s ability to proactively manage in changing market conditions 
management may choose to extend or shorten the maturities of the company s funding sources and redirect cash flows into assets with shorter or longer durations 
based on the information and assumptions in effect at december   the model shows that a basis point gradual increase in interest rates over the next twelve months would decrease net interest income by million or  while a basis point gradual decrease in interest rates would decrease net interest income by million or 
gap analysis 
gap analysis complements the income simulation model  primarily focusing on the longer term structure of the balance sheet 
the matching of assets and liabilities may be analyzed by examining the extent to which such assets and liabilities are interest rate sensitive and by monitoring an institution s interest rate sensitivity gap 
an asset or liability is said to be interest rate sensitive within a specific time period if it will mature or reprice within that time period 
the interest rate sensitivity gap is defined as the difference between the amount of interest earning assets maturing or repricing within a specific time period and the amount of interest bearing liabilities maturing or repricing within that same time period 
a gap is considered positive when the amount of interest rate sensitive assets exceeds the amount of interest rate sensitive liabilities 
a gap is considered negative when the amount of interest rate sensitive liabilities exceeds the amount of interest rate sensitive assets 
at december   the company s one year cumulative gap position was a positive 
a positive gap will generally result in the net interest margin increasing in a rising rate environment and decreasing in a falling rate environment 
a negative gap will generally have the opposite results on the net interest margin 
the following gap analysis table sets forth the amounts of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities outstanding at december   that are anticipated by the company  using certain assumptions based on historical experience and other market based data  to reprice or mature in each of the future time periods shown 
the amount of assets and liabilities shown which reprice or mature during a particular period was determined in accordance with the earlier of the term to reprice or the contractual maturity of the asset or liability 
the gap analysis is an incomplete representation of interest rate risk 
the gap analysis sets forth an approximation of the projected repricing of assets and liabilities at december  on the basis of contractual maturities  anticipated prepayments  callable features and scheduled rate adjustments for selected time periods 
the actual duration of mortgage loans and mortgage backed securities can be significantly affected by changes in mortgage prepayment activity 
the major factors affecting mortgage prepayment rates are prevailing interest rates and related mortgage refinancing opportunities 
prepayment rates will also vary due to a number of other factors  including the regional economy in the area where underlying collateral is located  seasonal factors and demographic variables 
in addition  the gap analysis does not account for the effect of general interest rate movements on the company s net interest income because the actual repricing dates of various assets and liabilities will differ from the company s estimates and it does not give consideration to the yields and costs of the assets and liabilities or the projected yields and costs to replace or retain those assets and liabilities 
callable features of certain assets and liabilities  in addition to the foregoing  may also cause actual experience to vary from that indicated 
the uncertainty and volatility of interest rates  economic conditions and other markets which affect the value of these call options  as well as the financial condition and strategies of the holders of the options  increase the difficulty and uncertainty in predicting when they may be exercised 
among the factors considered in our estimates are current trends and historical repricing experience with respect to similar products 
as a result  different assumptions may be used at different points in time 
within the one year time period  money market accounts were assumed to decay at  savings accounts were assumed to decay at and now accounts were assumed to decay at 
deposit decay rates estimated deposit withdrawal activity can have a significant effect on the company s estimated gap 
while the company believes such assumptions are reasonable  there can be no assurance that assumed decay rates will approximate actual future deposit withdrawal activity 
the following table reflects the repricing of the balance sheet  or gap position at december  in thousands days days days years over years total fair value interest earning assets mortgage loans        commercial business and other loans        securities available for sale        other interest earning assets     total interest earning assets        interest bearing liabilities savings  now and money market deposits        certificates of deposit       borrowings        total interest bearing liabilities        interest sensitivity gap      cumulative interest sensitivity gap      cumulative interest sensitivity gap as a percentage of total assets based upon contractual maturity  repricing date  if applicable  and management s estimate of principal prepayments 
includes loans available for sale 
based upon contractual maturity  repricing date  if applicable  and projected repayments of principal based upon experience 
amounts exclude the unrealized gains losses on securities available for sale 
includes interest earning cash and due from banks  overnight deposits and fhlb stock 
npv analysis 
to a lesser degree  the company also utilizes net portfolio value npv analysis to monitor interest rate risk over a range of interest rate scenarios 
npv is defined as the net present value of the expected future cash flows of an entity s assets and liabilities and  therefore  theoretically represents the market value of the company s net worth 
increases in the value of assets will increase the npv whereas decreases in value of assets will decrease the npv 
conversely  increases in the value of liabilities will decrease npv whereas decreases in the value of liabilities will increase the npv 
the changes in value of assets and liabilities due to changes in interest rates reflect the interest rate sensitivity of those assets and liabilities as their values are derived from the characteristics of the asset or liability ie fixed rate  adjustable rate  caps  floors relative to the interest rate environment 
for example  in a rising interest rate environment  the fair value of a fixed rate asset will decline whereas the fair value of an adjustable rate asset  depending on its repricing characteristics  may not decline 
in a declining interest rate environment  the converse may be true 
the npv ratio  under any interest rate scenario  is defined as the npv in that scenario divided by the market value of assets in the same scenario 
the model assumes estimated loan prepayment rates and reinvestment rates similar to the company s historical experience 
the following sets forth the company s npv as of december  npv as of portfolio net portfolio value value of assets change in basis points in interest rates amount change npv change ratio change in npv ratio dollars in thousands as of december   the company s npv was billion  or of the market value of assets 
following a basis point assumed increase in interest rates  the company s post shock npv was estimated to be billion  or of the market value of assets reflecting an increase of in the npv ratio 
as of december   the company s npv was billion  or of the market value of assets 
following a basis point assumed increase in interest rates  the company s post shock npv was estimated to be million  or of the market value of assets reflecting an increase of in the npv ratio 
certain shortcomings are inherent in the methodology used in the above interest rate risk measurements 
modeling changes in npv require the making of certain assumptions which may or may not reflect the manner in which actual yields and costs respond to changes in market interest rates 
in this regard  the npv table presented assumes that the composition of the company s interest sensitive assets and liabilities existing at the beginning of a period remains constant over the period being measured and also assumes that a particular change in interest rates is reflected uniformly across the yield curve regardless of the duration to maturity or repricing of specific assets and liabilities 
accordingly  although the npv table provides an indication of the company s interest rate risk exposure at a particular point in time  such measurements are not intended to and do not provide a precise forecast of the effect of changes in market interest rates on the company s net interest income and will differ from actual results
