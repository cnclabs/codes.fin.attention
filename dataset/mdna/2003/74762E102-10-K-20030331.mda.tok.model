item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion should be read in conjunction with item selected financial data and our consolidated financial statements and related notes thereto included in item introduction we derive our revenues from one reportable segment by providing specialized contracting services and offering comprehensive network solutions 
our customers include electric power  gas  telecommunications and cable television companies  as well as commercial  industrial and governmental entities 
we had consolidated revenues for the year ended december  of billion  of which was attributable to electric power and gas customers  to telecommunications customers  to cable television operators and to ancillary services  such as inside electrical wiring  intelligent traffic networks  cable and control systems for light rail lines  airports and highways  and specialty rock trenching  directional boring and road milling for industrial and commercial customers 
we enter into contracts principally on the basis of competitive unit price or fixed price bids  the final terms and prices of which we frequently negotiate with the customer 
although the terms of our contracts vary considerably  most are made on either a unit price or fixed price basis in which we agree to do the work for a price per unit of work performed unit price or for a fixed amount for the entire project fixed price 
we also perform services on a cost plus or time and materials basis 
we complete most installation projects within one year  while we frequently provide maintenance and repair work under open ended  unit price or cost plus master service agreements that are renewable annually 
we generally recognize revenue when services are performed except when work is being performed under fixed price contracts 
we typically record revenues from fixed price contracts on a percentage of completion basis  using the cost to cost method based on the percentage of total costs incurred to date in proportion to total estimated costs to complete the contract 
some of our customers require us to post performance and payment bonds upon execution of the contract  depending upon the nature of the work to be performed 
our fixed price contracts often include payment provisions pursuant to which the customer withholds a to retainage from each progress payment and remits the retainage to us upon completion and approval of the work 
cost of services consists primarily of salaries  wages and benefits to employees  depreciation  fuel and other vehicle expenses  equipment rentals  subcontracted services  insurance  facilities expenses  materials and parts and supplies 
our gross margin  which is gross profit expressed as a percentage of revenues  is typically higher on projects where labor  rather than materials  constitutes a greater portion of the cost of services 
we can predict materials costs more accurately than labor costs 
therefore  to compensate for the potential variability of labor costs  we seek higher margins on labor intensive projects 
we have a deductible of  per occurrence related to workers compensation  employer s liability  automobile and general liability claims 
on march   we increased the deductible for workers compensation insurance to  per occurrence 
effective january   we consolidated the various non union employee related health care benefits plans that existed at certain of our subsidiaries into one corporate plan that is subject to a deductible of  per claimant per year 
fluctuations in insurance accruals related to these deductibles could have an impact on operating margins in the period in which such adjustments are made 
selling  general and administrative expenses consist primarily of compensation and related benefits to management  administrative salaries and benefits  marketing  office rent and utilities  communications  professional fees and bad debt expense 
selling  general and administrative expenses can be impacted by our customers inability to pay for services performed 
seasonality  fluctuations of quarterly results our results of operations can be subject to seasonal variations 
during the winter months  demand for new projects and new maintenance service arrangements may be lower due to reduced construction activity 
however  demand for repair and maintenance services attributable to damage caused by inclement weather during the winter months may partially offset the loss of revenues from lower demand for new projects and new maintenance service arrangements 
additionally  our industry can be highly cyclical 
as a result  our volume of business may be adversely affected by declines in new projects in various geographic regions in the us typically  we experience lower gross and operating margins during the winter months due to lower demand for our services and more difficult operating conditions 
the financial condition of our customers and their access to capital  variations in the margins of projects performed during any particular quarter  the timing and magnitude of acquisition assimilation costs  regional economic conditions and timing of acquisitions may also materially affect quarterly results 
accordingly  our operating results in any particular quarter may not be indicative of the results that can be expected for any other quarter or for the entire year 
liquidity and capital resources as of december   we had cash and cash equivalents of million  working capital of million and long term debt of million  net of current maturities 
our long term debt balance at that date included borrowings of million of senior secured notes  and million of other debt 
we had million of convertible subordinated notes as of december  in addition  we had million of letters of credit outstanding under the credit facility 
during the year ended december   operating activities provided net cash to us of million 
operating cash flow before changes in working capital and other operating accounts totaled million 
net changes in working capital and other operating accounts generated million of cash flow from operations  in  primarily as a result of management s focus on working capital and a general business slowdown 
cash flow from operations is primarily influenced by demand for our services  operating margins and the type of services we provide 
we used net cash in investing activities of million  including million used for capital expenditures  million used for the purchase of two businesses  net of cash acquired  and million in additional non current notes receivable issued during we used net cash in financing activities of million  resulting primarily from million in net repayments of our credit facility  million in payments of other long term debt obligations and million used for the purchase of treasury stock  partially offset by million in proceeds from the issuance of stock before transaction costs 
on august  and december   we amended our credit facility 
as a result of both amendments  the commitment of the banks under the credit facility was reduced from million to million 
the commitment will remain in effect at million through march   then reduce to million and remain in effect at such amount through december  effective january   the credit facility will reduce to million and remain in effect at such amount through maturity of the credit facility on june  further  the amendment restricts our ability to borrow an additional million under the credit facility until we achieve  for two consecutive fiscal quarters beginning with the fourth quarter of  certain minimum ebitda as defined in the credit facility requirements 
amounts borrowed under the credit facility bear interest at a rate equal to either a libor plus to  as determined by the ratio of our total funded debt to ebitda or b the bank s prime rate plus up to  as determined by the ratio of our total funded debt to ebitda 
commitment fees of to  based on our total funded debt to ebitda  are due on any unused borrowing capacity under the credit facility 
our weighted average borrowing rate under the credit facility for the year ended december  was 
the amended credit facility is less restrictive with respect to certain financial ratios and indebtedness covenants  including the maximum funded debt to ebitda ratio  minimum interest coverage ratios and non cash impairment charges under sfas nos 
and however  the amended credit facility is more restrictive with respect to our maximum senior debt to ebitda ratio  capital expenditures and asset sales  prohibits any stock repurchase programs  and prohibits acquisitions through may  additionally  the amended credit facility prohibits the payment of dividends and requires a mandatory reduction in the banks commitment by a portion of the proceeds from asset sales in excess of million annually or upon the issuance of additional debt in excess of million 
our borrowing availability under the credit facility varies from quarter to quarter depending upon our degree of compliance with certain financial ratios 
as of march   we had approximately million in cash and cash equivalents  no borrowings under the credit facility and million of letters of credit outstanding  which based upon our current senior debt to ebitda ratio  results in a borrowing availability of million under the credit facility 
our current borrowing rate is libor plus 
as of december   we had million of senior secured notes that have maturities ranging from three to eight years with a weighted average interest rate of 
on august  and december   we amended the senior secured notes  and as amended  they have financial covenants and restrictions substantially identical to those under the credit facility 
in addition  the senior secured notes carry a make whole provision customary for this type of debt instrument on prepayment of principal  including  any mandatory prepayments 
pursuant to an intercreditor agreement  the senior secured notes rank equally in right of repayment with indebtedness under our credit facility 
in connection with amendments to both the credit facility and the senior secured notes in  we incurred additional debt issuance costs of approximately million 
we have accounted for these costs in accordance with eitf for the credit facility and eitf for the senior secured notes 
accordingly  a majority of these costs were capitalized and will be amortized over the remaining term of the respective agreement  as amended 
as a result of the amendments  in accordance with eitf  we expensed a portion of the unamortized debt issuance costs as interest expense during the year ended december  as of december   we had million in convertible subordinated notes that bear interest at per year and are convertible into shares of our common stock at a price of per share  subject to adjustment as a result of certain events 
the convertible subordinated notes require semi annual interest payments until the notes mature on july  we have the option to redeem some or all of the convertible subordinated notes beginning july  at specified redemption prices  together with accrued and unpaid interest 
if certain fundamental changes occur  as described in the indenture under which we issued the convertible subordinated notes  holders of the convertible subordinated notes may require us to purchase all or part of their notes at a purchase price equal to of the principal amount  plus accrued and unpaid interest 
in the event of such circumstance  consent to repurchase the convertible subordinated notes would be required under our credit facility and senior secured notes 
we have specifically provided for non cash goodwill impairment charges up to million in our credit facility and senior secured notes resulting from the adoption of sfas nos 
and goodwill impairment charges do not violate any covenants in our convertible subordinated notes 
on october   first reserve committed  subject to certain conditions  to make an investment in us through two transactions 
the first transaction occurred on october   with first reserve purchasing from us approximately million shares of our newly issued common stock at per share  for a total purchase price of million  before transaction costs 
as part of this transaction and in exchange for consideration from us of approximately million  we also obtained from aquila certain waivers of anti dilution rights  preemptive rights and limitations of the number of directors on our board of directors 
after amending certain provisions of our agreements with lenders and senior secured note holders  the second transaction occurred on december   with first reserve purchasing from us approximately million shares of newly issued series e preferred stock at per share  for an additional investment of approximately million 
at a special meeting of stockholders held on december   our stockholders approved the convertibility of such series e preferred stock and the conversion of the shares into common stock 
the shares of series e preferred stock were converted into million shares of common stock on december  as of december  and  dividends of million had been accrued on the series a convertible preferred stock 
in connection with their investment in us  on october   first reserve forgave approximately  in dividends that had accrued on  shares of series a convertible preferred stock that first reserve acquired from aquila 
on december   december   and january    shares   shares and  shares of series a convertible preferred stock  respectively  were converted into shares of common stock and on february   all remaining outstanding shares of series a convertible preferred stock were converted into shares of common stock 
there are currently no outstanding shares of series a convertible preferred stock 
any dividends that had accrued on the respective shares of series a convertible preferred stock were reversed on the date of conversion 
therefore  as of february   there were no accrued dividends 
through february   first reserve had the right to require us to repurchase the shares of common stock issued as a result of the conversion of the shares of series e preferred stock for cash if we had a change in control 
as such  the investment has been reflected in the consolidated balance sheet as redeemable common stock at december  on february   at the expiration of this right  the redeemable common stock was reclassified to stockholders equity 
we anticipate that our cash flow from operations and our credit facility will provide sufficient cash to enable us to meet our working capital needs  debt service requirements and planned capital expenditures for property and equipment for at least the next months 
however  further deterioration in the markets we serve  material changes in our customers revenues or cash flows or adverse weather conditions may negatively impact our revenues and cash flows 
these factors  coupled with the lowered capacity and restrictive covenants of our credit facility  may negatively impact our ability to meet such needs 
other commitments 
as is common in our industry  we have entered into certain off balance sheet arrangements in the ordinary course of business that result in risks not directly reflected in our balance sheets 
our significant off balance sheet transactions include liabilities associated with non cancelable operating leases  letter of credit obligations and surety guarantees 
we have not engaged in any off balance sheet financing arrangements through special purpose entities 
we enter into non cancelable operating leases for many of our facility  vehicle and equipment needs 
these leases allow us to conserve cash by paying a monthly lease rental fee for use of facilities  vehicles and equipment rather than purchasing them 
at the end of the lease  we have no further obligation to the lessor 
we may decide to cancel or terminate a lease before the end of its term  in which case we are typically liable to the lessor for the remaining lease payments under the term of the lease 
we have guaranteed a residual value on certain equipment operating leases 
we guarantee the difference between this residual value and the fair market value of the underlying asset at the date of termination of the leases 
at december   the maximum guaranteed residual value would have been approximately million 
we believe that no significant payments will be made as a result of the difference between the fair market value of the leased equipment and the guaranteed residual value 
however  there can be no assurance that future significant payments will not be required 
some customers require us to post letters of credit to guarantee performance under our contracts and to ensure payment to our subcontractors and vendors under those contracts 
certain of our vendors also require letters of credit to ensure reimbursement for amounts they are disbursing on behalf of us  such as to beneficiaries under our self funded insurance programs 
such letters of credit are generally issued by a bank or similar financial institution 
the letter of credit commits the issuer to pay specified amounts to the holder of the letter of credit if the holder demonstrates that we have failed to perform specified actions 
if this were to occur  we would be required to reimburse the issuer of the letter of credit 
depending on the circumstances of such a reimbursement  we may also have to record a charge to earnings for the reimbursement 
to date we have not had a claim made against a letter of credit that resulted in payments by the issuer of the letter of credit or by us and do not believe that it is likely that any claims will be made under a letter of credit in the foreseeable future 
we had million in letters of credit outstanding under our credit facility primarily to secure obligations under our casualty insurance program at december  while not actual borrowings  letters of credit do reflect potential liabilities under our credit facility and therefore are treated as a use of borrowing capacity under our credit facility 
these are irrevocable stand by letters of credit with maturities expiring at various times throughout and upon maturity  it is expected that the majority of these letters of credit will be renewed for subsequent one year periods 
based upon our senior debt to ebitda ratio  the borrowing availability under our credit facility was million as of december  many customers  particularly in connection with new construction  require us to post performance and payment bonds issued by a financial institution known as a surety 
these bonds provide a guarantee to the customer that we will perform under the terms of a contract and that we will pay subcontractors and vendors 
if we fail to perform under a contract or to pay subcontractors and vendors  the customer may demand that the surety make payments or provide services under the bond 
we must reimburse the surety for any expenses or outlays it incurs 
to date  we have not had any significant reimbursements to our surety for bond related costs 
we believe that it is unlikely that we will have to fund claims under our surety arrangements in the foreseeable future 
as of december   the total amount of outstanding performance bonds was approximately million 
our future contractual obligations  including interest under capital leases  are as follows in thousands total thereafter long term debt obligations including capital leases operating lease obligations concentration of credit risk 
we grant credit  generally without collateral  to our customers  which include electric power and gas companies  telecommunications and cable television system operators  governmental entities  general contractors  and builders  owners and managers of commercial and industrial properties located primarily in the united states 
consequently  we are subject to potential credit risk related to changes in business and economic factors throughout the united states 
however  we generally are entitled to payment for work performed and have certain lien rights on our services provided 
under certain circumstances such as foreclosures or negotiated settlements  we may take title to the underlying assets in lieu of cash in settlement of receivables 
as previously discussed herein  our customers in the telecommunications business have experienced significant financial difficulties and in several instances have filed for bankruptcy 
our utility customers are also experiencing business challenges in the current business climate 
these economic conditions expose us to increased risk related to collectibility of receivables for services we have performed 
no customer accounted for more than of accounts receivable or revenues as of or for the years ended december   or in june  one of our customers  adelphia communications corporation  filed for bankruptcy protection under chapter of the bankruptcy code  as amended 
we have filed liens on various properties to secure substantially all of our pre petition receivables 
our carrying value is based upon our understanding of the current status of the adelphia bankruptcy proceeding and a number of assumptions  including assumptions about the validity  priority and enforceability of our security interests 
we currently believe we will collect a substantial majority of the balances owed 
should any of the factors underlying our estimate change  the amount of our allowance could change significantly 
we are uncertain as to whether such receivables will be collected within one year and therefore have included this amount in non current assets as accounts and notes receivable as of december  also included in accounts and notes receivable are amounts due from another customer relating to the construction of independent power plants 
we have agreed to long term payment terms for this customer 
the notes receivable are partially secured and bear interest at per year 
during  we provided allowances for a significant portion of these notes receivable due to a change in the economic viability of the plants securing them 
the collectibility of these notes may ultimately depend on the value of the collateral securing these notes 
as of december   the total balance due from both of these customers was million  net of an allowance for doubtful accounts of million 
stock employee compensation trust sect 
on march   our board of directors approved the creation of a sect to fund certain of our future employee benefit obligations using our common stock 
the sect was established by selling million shares of our common stock  including  shares we purchased during pursuant to our stock repurchase plan  to the sect in exchange for a promissory note plus an amount equal to the aggregate par value of the shares 
as part of the settlement of the proxy contest with aquila  on may   we terminated the sect and repurchased the  shares of common stock remaining in the sect by canceling the promissory note 
the  shares were transferred into treasury stock on may   and were retired on june  stock repurchase plan 
our board of directors authorized a stock repurchase plan under which up to million of our common stock could be repurchased 
under the stock repurchase plan  we could conduct purchases through open market transactions in accordance with applicable securities laws 
during  we purchased  shares of common stock for approximately million 
on march   the  shares of common stock were sold to our sect  and were no longer considered treasury stock 
these shares were subsequently retired on june   after we terminated the sect 
during  quanta purchased  shares of its common stock for approximately million under the stock repurchase plan 
as of july   the independent committee of our board of directors determined to cease the stock repurchase plan 
as a result of the credit facility and senior secured notes amendments  any further stock repurchases  other than those associated with quanta s stock incentive plans  are prohibited 
litigation 
on november   aquila filed an arbitration demand against us with challenging our amendment to our stockholder rights plan 
as part of the settlement of aquila s proxy contest with us  discussed below  this lawsuit was dismissed with prejudice on may  on november   aquila also filed a complaint in the delaware court of chancery that challenged the adoption of our rights plan amendment 
as part of the settlement of aquila s proxy contest  this lawsuit was dismissed with prejudice on may  on december   a purported stockholder of quanta filed a putative class action and derivative complaint alleging that the named directors breached their fiduciary duties by taking certain actions  including adoption of the rights plan amendment  in response to the announcement by aquila that it intended to acquire control of quanta through open market purchases of our shares 
on october   the case was dismissed at the request of the plaintiffs 
on march   aquila filed a complaint in the delaware court of chancery alleging that the special committee of our board of directors breached its fiduciary duty in connection with the adoption of our sect and new employment agreements entered into with certain of our employees 
as part of the settlement of aquila s proxy contest  this lawsuit was dismissed with prejudice on may  in addition  we are from time to time a party to various other lawsuits  claims and other legal proceedings that arise in the ordinary course of business 
these actions typically seek  among other things  compensation for alleged personal injury  breach of contract  property damage  punitive damages  civil penalties or other losses  or injunctive or declaratory relief 
with respect to all such lawsuits  claims and proceedings  we accrue reserves when it is probable a liability has been incurred and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated 
we do not believe that any of these other proceedings  separately or in the aggregate would be expected to have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial position 
proxy solicitation 
on february   aquila announced its intention to conduct a proxy solicitation to replace members of our board of directors with a slate of its own nominees 
on may   we and aquila announced that we had reached an agreement for aquila to terminate its proxy contest 
under the terms of the settlement  aquila withdrew all pending litigation and arbitration against us 
the companies also agreed to a standstill whereby aquila agreed not to purchase shares of our common stock on the open market and not to wage another proxy fight for control of us and we agreed to terminate the sect 
we recorded approximately million and million in proxy costs for the years ended december  and  respectively  which are included in selling  general and administrative expenses 
change of control 
we entered into new employment agreements with certain employees  as of march   which become effective upon a change of control as defined in the new employment agreements of quanta 
the new employment agreements supplemented existing employment agreements already in effect 
the new employment agreements provide that  following a change of control  if we terminate the employee s employment without cause as defined in the new employment agreements  the employee terminates employment for good reason as defined in the new employment agreements  or the employee s employment terminates due to death or disability  we will pay certain amounts to the employee  which may vary with the level of the employee s responsibility and the terms of the employee s prior employment arrangements 
in addition  in the case of certain senior executives  these payments would also be due if the employee terminates his or her employment within the day window period commencing six months after the change in control 
on june   mr 
colson  our chief executive officer  relinquished his right to receive the payment described above upon a voluntary termination during such day period 
acquisitions 
during  we acquired two companies for an aggregate consideration of  shares of common stock and approximately million in cash  net of cash acquired 
the cash portion of such consideration was provided by proceeds from borrowings under the credit facility 
in connection with the amendment of our credit facility and senior secured notes  we are limited to an aggregate dollar level of cash consideration that we can use to fund acquisitions 
related party transactions 
in the normal course of business  we from time to time enter into transactions with related parties 
these transactions typically take the form of network service work for aquila or facility leases with prior owners 
see additional discussion in note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
inflation due to relatively low levels of inflation experienced during the years ended december   and  inflation did not have a significant effect on our results 
significant balance sheet changes total assets decreased approximately million in compared to this decrease is primarily due to the following goodwill and other intangibles  net decreased million primarily due to impairments of goodwill pursuant to sfas no 
 which requires goodwill to be tested for impairment by comparing the fair value of each subsidiary with its carrying value 
accounts receivable and costs and estimated earnings in excess of billings on uncompleted contracts decreased million primarily due to lower levels of revenues during  collections on accounts that were outstanding at december  and an increase of million in the allowance for doubtful accounts 
in addition  approximately million in balances have been reclassified to non current accounts and notes receivable due to uncertainty related to their collectibility within the next twelve months 
current deferred taxes increased million primarily due to increases in the current and long term allowance for doubtful accounts  which are not currently deductible 
prepaid expenses and other current assets increased million primarily due to the recording of a federal net operating loss which we intend to file as a carryback claim with the internal revenue service 
we expect to file the claim in property and equipment  net decreased million due to depreciation of million recorded during the period and the sale of equipment that was no longer being used by certain of our subsidiaries  offset by increases as a result of capital expenditures of million 
long term accounts and notes receivable  net increased million primarily due to the recording of an additional note receivable of million from one of our customers 
we have agreed to long term payment terms for this customer 
the notes receivable are partially secured and bear interest at per year 
in addition  we reclassified approximately million from accounts receivable due to uncertainty related to their collectibility within the next twelve months  as discussed above 
during the year ended december   we recorded allowances for these accounts and notes receivable of approximately million 
other assets  net increased million due primarily to an accounts receivable balance due from one of our customers being reclassified  as title to the work performed by us has been transferred to us in lieu of payment and an increase in debt issuance costs incurred in connection with amendments to certain debt agreements in in  total liabilities decreased approximately million  redeemable common stock increased million and stockholders equity decreased approximately million 
these changes were primarily due to the following accounts payable and accrued expenses decreased million primarily due to a million decrease in trade accounts payable due to lower levels of revenue during billings in excess of costs and estimated earnings on uncompleted contracts decreased million 
the timing of billings and the willingness of our customers to accept billings in excess of the work performed fluctuate from period to period 
in addition  work performed under fixed price contracts generally allow us to bill larger amounts earlier in the project 
we performed less work under fixed price contracts during the latter portion of versus long term debt  net of current maturities decreased million due to payments against our credit facility during the year ended december  at december   there were no borrowings outstanding under our credit facility 
deferred income taxes and other non current liabilities decreased million 
long term deferred income tax assets and liabilities are presented net in the accompanying balance sheet 
the million decrease was primarily the result of the recording of a deferred tax asset for the tax benefit related to the impairments of goodwill pursuant to sfas no 
 partially offset by increases in deferred tax liabilities due to increased differences between the book and tax basis for certain of our assets 
this decrease was also partially offset by increases in the long term portion of self insurance reserves 
redeemable common stock increased million 
on december   first reserve purchased from us approximately million shares of newly issued series e preferred stock at per share  for an investment of approximately million 
at a special meeting of stockholders held on december   our stockholders approved the convertibility of such series e preferred stock and the conversion of the shares into common stock 
the shares of series e preferred stock were converted into million shares of common stock on december  through february   first reserve had the right to require us to repurchase the shares of common stock issued as a result of the conversion of the shares of series e preferred stock for cash if we had a change in control 
as such  the investment has been reflected in the consolidated balance sheet as redeemable common stock at december  on february   at the expiration of this right  the redeemable common stock was reclassified to stockholders equity 
stockholders equity decreased million during the year ended december  this was primarily the result of a net loss attributable to common stock of million associated with the impairments of goodwill recorded pursuant to sfas no 
and the purchase of approximately million of treasury stock under our stock repurchase plan  partially offset by the initial investment by first reserve of million  before transaction costs  the issuance of approximately million in shares of common stock pursuant to our employee stock purchase plan and the acquisition of two companies which resulted in increased additional paid in capital of million 
results of operations the following table sets forth selected statements of operations data and such data as a percentage of revenues for the years indicated dollars in thousands year ended december  revenues cost of services including depreciation gross profit selling  general and administrative expenses special charges goodwill impairment goodwill amortization income loss from operations interest expense other income expense  net income loss before income tax provision benefit and cumulative effect of change in accounting principle provision benefit for income taxes income loss before cumulative effect of change in accounting principle cumulative effect of change in accounting principle  net of tax net income loss dividends on preferred stock  net of forfeitures non cash beneficial conversion charge net income loss attributable to common stock year ended december  compared to the year ended december  revenues 
revenues decreased million  or  to billion for the year ended december  this decrease was attributable to lower revenues  primarily from telecommunications and cable customers  due in part to the continued decrease in capital spending by our customers  the inability of certain of these customers to raise new capital  bankruptcies of certain customers and the overall downturn in the national economy  which have negatively impacted the award of work to specialty contractors 
this decrease was partially offset by a full year of contributed revenues for those companies acquired during and growth in revenues from our electric power and gas customers 
gross profit 
gross profit decreased million to million for the year ended december  gross margin decreased from for the year ended december  to for the year ended december  the decrease in gross margin resulted primarily from declining volumes due to economic factors noted above  significantly lower margins on work performed due to increased pricing pressures and lower asset utilization 
the decrease also resulted from higher than normal transition costs during the first six months of on one telecommunications outsourcing contract 
selling  general and administrative expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased million  or  to million for the year ended december  during the year ended december   we recorded million in bad debt expense  million in proxy costs and million in expensed loan and equity transaction costs associated with amendments of our existing debt agreements and issuances of stock 
during the year ended december   we recorded million in bad debt expense and million in proxy costs 
excluding the impact of these items  selling  general and administrative expenses for the year ended december  increased approximately million  primarily due to the inclusion of a full year of costs associated with companies acquired during and higher professional fees due to increased collection efforts on troubled accounts  partially offset by reductions in personnel and bonuses 
as a percentage of revenues  selling  general and administrative expenses increased due to the items noted above  as well as the impact of lower revenues 
goodwill impairment 
during the year ended december   we recognized an interim non cash sfas no 
goodwill impairment charge of million 
any interim impairment adjustments recognized after adoption are required to be recognized as operating expenses 
the primary factor contributing to the interim impairment charge was the overall deterioration of the business climate during in the markets we serve 
interest expense 
interest expense decreased million  or  to million for the year ended december   due to lower average levels of debt outstanding during  partially offset by higher weighted average interest rates in and expensed loan costs associated with debt amendments in provision benefit for income taxes 
the benefit for income taxes was million for the year ended december   with an effective tax rate of  compared to a provision of million for the year ended december  and an effective tax rate of 
the lower tax rate in results primarily from the interim goodwill impairment charge  the majority of which is not deductible for tax purposes  thereby reducing the amount of tax benefit recorded 
cumulative effect of change in accounting principle  net of tax 
based on our transitional impairment test performed upon adoption of sfas no 
 we recognized a charge  net of tax  of million to reduce the carrying value of the goodwill of our reporting units to its implied fair value for the year ended december  under sfas no 
 the impairment adjustment recognized at adoption of the new rule was reflected as a cumulative effect of change in accounting principle in the year ended december  net income loss 
net income decreased million to a net loss of million for the year ended december   compared to net income of million for the year ended december   primarily due to impairments of goodwill recorded pursuant to sfas no 
and decreased gross profit as described above 
dividends on preferred stock 
for the year ended december   we recorded approximately  in negative dividends on preferred stock 
in connection with their investment in us  on october   first reserve acquired approximately million shares of our series a convertible preferred stock 
on october   first reserve forgave approximately  in dividends that had accrued on those shares 
on december   and december    shares and  shares of series a convertible preferred stock  respectively  were converted into shares of common stock 
any dividends that had accrued on the shares of series a convertible preferred stock were reversed on the date of conversion 
non cash beneficial conversion charge 
the original as converted share price negotiated with first reserve for the series e preferred stock on october  was per share which was an above market price 
on december   the date first reserve purchased the series e preferred stock  our stock closed at per share 
accordingly  we recorded a non cash beneficial conversion charge of million based on the per share differential 
the non cash beneficial conversion charge is recognized as a deemed dividend to the series e preferred stockholder and is recorded as a decrease to net income attributable to common stock and an increase in additional paid in capital 
the non cash beneficial conversion charge had no effect on our operating income  cash flows or stockholders equity at december  year ended december  compared to the year ended december  revenues 
revenues increased million  or  to billion for the year ended december  this increase was attributable to strong growth in electric power and gas revenues as a result of increased outsourcing and deregulation  a full year of contributed revenues in for those companies acquired in and revenues of million from platform companies acquired in that continued to exist as separate reporting subsidiaries 
the increase was partially offset by decreased revenues from telecommunications customers due in part to the continued inability of certain of the customers to raise new capital and the overall downturn in the national economy 
gross profit 
gross profit decreased million to million for the year ended december  gross margin decreased from for the year ended december  to for the year ended december  the decrease in gross margin resulted from lower margins on work performed for telecommunications customers due to increased pricing pressures  lower asset utilization and the economic factors noted above  partially offset by higher margins received on work performed for the electric power and gas customers 
selling  general and administrative expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased million  or  to million for the year ended december  selling  general and administrative expenses for the year ended december  include million in increased bad debt expense and million in proxy costs 
in addition  million of the increase was attributable to the platform companies we acquired subsequent to december  selling  general and administrative expenses also included a full period of costs in associated with those companies acquired during the remainder of the increase was attributable to tuck in acquisitions and the continued establishment of infrastructure to facilitate our growth and to integrate our acquired businesses 
as a percentage of revenues  selling  general and administrative expenses increased due to the items noted above 
merger and special charges 
in december  we agreed to conclude our obligations under the management services agreement with aquila in exchange for a one time payment to aquila of approximately million 
interest expense

in these consolidated financial statements 
critical accounting policies the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities known to exist at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
we evaluate our estimates on an ongoing basis  based on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
there can be no assurance that actual results will not differ from those estimates 
management has reviewed its development and selection of critical accounting estimates with the audit committee of our board of directors 
we believe the following accounting policies  which are also described in note of notes to consolidated financial statements  affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements current and long term accounts and notes receivable and provision for doubtful accounts 
we provide an allowance for doubtful accounts when collection of an account or note receivable is considered doubtful 
inherent in the assessment of the allowance for doubtful accounts are certain judgments and estimates including  among others  our customer s access to capital  our customer s willingness or ability to pay  general economic conditions and the ongoing relationship with the customer 
for example  certain of our customers  primarily large public telecommunications carriers  have filed for bankruptcy in the year ended december   or have been experiencing financial difficulties  and as a result we increased our allowance for doubtful accounts to reflect that certain customers may be unable to meet their obligations to us in the future 
should additional customers file for bankruptcy or experience difficulties  or should anticipated recoveries relating to the receivables in existing bankruptcies and other workout situations fail to materialize  we could experience reduced cash flows and losses in excess of current reserves 
goodwill and other intangibles 
as stated in note of notes to consolidated financial statements  sfas no 
provides that goodwill and other intangible assets that have indefinite useful lives not be amortized  but instead must be tested at least annually for impairment  and intangible assets that have finite useful lives should continue to be amortized over their useful lives 
sfas no 
also provides specific guidance for testing goodwill and other nonamortized intangible assets for impairment 
goodwill of a reporting unit shall be tested for impairment between annual tests if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying amount 
examples of such events or circumstances may include a significant change in business climate or a loss of key personnel  among others 
sfas no 
requires that management make certain estimates and assumptions in order to allocate goodwill to reporting units and to determine the fair value of reporting unit net assets and liabilities  including  among other things  an assessment of market conditions  projected cash flows  cost of capital and growth rates  which could significantly impact the reported value of goodwill and other intangible assets  as compared to our accounting policy for the assessment of goodwill impairment in  which was based on an undiscounted cash flow model 
estimating future cash flows requires significant judgment and our projections may vary from cash flows eventually realized 
revenue recognition 
we typically record revenues from fixed price contracts on a percentage of completion basis  using the cost to cost method based on the percentage of total costs incurred to date in proportion to total estimated costs to complete the contract 
changes in job performance  job conditions and final contract settlements  among others  are factors that influence the assessment of the total estimated costs to complete these contracts 
self insurance 
we are insured for workers compensation  employer s liability  auto liability and general liability claims  subject to a deductible of  per occurrence 
on march   we increased the deductible for workers compensation insurance to  per occurrence 
effective january   we consolidated the various non union employee related health care benefits plans that existed at certain of our subsidiaries into one corporate plan that is subject to a deductible of  per claimant per year 
losses up to the deductible amounts are accrued based upon our estimates of the ultimate liability for claims incurred and an estimate of claims incurred but not reported 
however  insurance liabilities are difficult to assess and estimate due to unknown factors  including the severity of an injury  the determination of our liability in proportion to other parties  the number of incidents not reported and the effectiveness of our safety program 
the accruals are based upon known facts and historical trends and management believes such accruals to be adequate 
stock options 
we account for our stock based compensation under apb opinion no 
accounting for stock issued to employees 
under this accounting method  no compensation expense is recognized in the consolidated statements of operations if no intrinsic value of the option exists at the date of grant 
in october  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation 
sfas no 
encourages companies to account for stock based compensation awards based on the fair value of the awards at the date they are granted 
the resulting compensation cost would be shown as an expense in the consolidated statements of operations 
companies can choose not to apply the new accounting method and continue to apply current accounting requirements  however  disclosure is required as to what net income and earnings per share would have been had the new accounting method been followed 
outlook the following statements are based on current expectations 
these statements are forward looking  and actual results may differ materially 
like many companies that provide installation and maintenance services to the electric power  gas  telecommunications and cable television industries  we are facing a number of challenges 
our operating environment has changed dramatically 
the telecommunications and utility markets have experienced substantial change during as evidenced by an increased number of bankruptcies in the telecommunica tions market  continued devaluation of many of our customers debt and equity securities and pricing pressures resulting from challenges faced by major industry participants 
these factors have contributed to the delay and cancellation of projects and reduction of capital spending that have impacted our operations and ability to grow at historical levels 
we continue to focus on the elements of the business we can control  including cost control  the margins we accept on projects  collecting receivables  ensuring quality service and right sizing initiatives to match the markets we serve 
these initiatives include aligning our work force with our current revenue base  evaluating opportunities to reduce the number of field offices and evaluating our non core assets for potential sale 
such initiatives could result in future charges related to  among others  severance  facilities shutdown and consolidation  property disposal and other exit costs as we execute these initiatives 
we expect consistent demand for our services from our electric power and gas customers throughout with continued weakness in demand for our services from our telecommunications and cable customers and relatively level demand for our ancillary services 
financial and economic pressures have led our customers to return to their core competencies and focus on cost reductions  resulting in an increased focus on outsourcing services 
we believe that we are adequately positioned to provide these services because of our proven full service operating units with broad geographic reach  financial capability and technical expertise 
capital expenditures in are expected to be approximately million 
a majority of the expenditures will be for operating equipment 
we expect expenditures for to be funded substantially through internal cash flows and  to the extent necessary  from borrowings under our credit facility 
in march  in conjunction with a stock option exchange program  we cancelled eligible options to purchase an aggregate of  shares of our common stock 
pursuant to the terms of the offer  quanta granted restricted stock representing an aggregate of  shares of our common stock 
this restricted stock issuance will require us to recognize a non cash compensation charge of approximately million per year over the three year vesting period of the restricted stock

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to market risk primarily related to potential adverse changes in interest rates and  to a certain extent  commodity prices  as discussed below 
management does not generally use derivative financial instruments for trading or to speculate on changes in interest rates or commodity prices 
as of december   however  we had a derivative contract outstanding that related to anticipated exposure in the price of natural gas 
we monitor our derivative position by regularly evaluating our position 
management is actively involved in monitoring exposure to market risk and continues to develop and utilize appropriate risk management techniques 
we are not exposed to any other significant market risks  foreign currency exchange risk or interest rate risk from the use of derivative financial instruments 
the sensitivity analyses below  which illustrate our hypothetical potential market risk exposure  estimate the effects of hypothetical sudden and sustained changes in the applicable market conditions on earnings 
the sensitivity analyses presented do not consider any additional actions we may take to mitigate our exposure to such changes 
the hypothetical changes and assumptions may be different from what actually occurs in the future 
interest rates 
as of december   we had no derivative financial instruments to manage interest rate risk 
as such  we are exposed to earnings and fair value risk due to changes in interest rates with respect to our long term obligations 
as of december  and  the fair value of our fixed rate debt of million and million was approximately million and million  respectively  based upon discounted future cash flows using incremental borrowing rates and current market prices 
as of december   the fair value of our variable rate debt of million approximated book value and the detrimental effect on our pretax earnings of a hypothetical basis point increase in fixed interest rates would be approximately million 
as of december   we had no borrowings under our credit facility and no other variable rate obligations 
commodity price exposure 
in october  we entered into a forward purchase contract contract a with settlements through  in order to secure pricing on anticipated gas requirements related to a project in process at december  that was substantially complete at march  our objective was to mitigate the variability in the price of natural gas by securing the price we will have to pay to the contract a counterparty 
on march   we entered into a sub services agreement with one of our customers the counterparty contract whereby the customer assumed all obligations associated with contract a 
on november   contract a was sold for a gain of million and the related counterparty contract was terminated 
in april  we entered into another forward purchase contract contract b with settlements through march  in order to secure pricing on anticipated gas requirements related to a project completed during the quarter ended september  our objective was to mitigate the variability in the price of natural gas by securing the price we will have to pay the contract b counterparty 
as of december   the fair value of contract b was approximately
