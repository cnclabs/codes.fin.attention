item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations our management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations md a relates to amerigas partners and the operating partnerships 
amerigas finance corp  amerigas eagle finance corp 
and ap eagle finance corp 
have nominal assets and do not conduct any operations but act as co obligors of certain amerigas partners debt securities 
accordingly  discussions of the results of operations and financial condition and liquidity of these entities are not presented 
our md a should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes thereto included elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
analysis of results of operations the following analysis compares the partnership s results of operations for the year ended september  fiscal with the year ended september  fiscal and fiscal with the year ended september  fiscal

b total margin represents total revenues less total cost of sales 
c ebitda earnings before interest expense  income taxes  depreciation and amortization should not be considered as an alternative to net income as an indicator of operating performance or as an alternative to cash flow as a measure of liquidity or ability to service debt obligations and is not a measure of performance or financial condition under accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
management believes ebitda is a meaningful non gaap financial measure used by investors to compare the partnership s operating performance with other companies within the propane industry and to evaluate our ability to meet loan covenants 
weather significantly impacts demand for propane and profitability because many customers use propane for heating purposes 
the following table includes reconciliations of net income to ebitda for the fiscal years presented year ended september  net income income tax expense benefit interest expense depreciation amortization ebitda d results for fiscal and reflect the elimination of goodwill amortization resulting from the adoption of statement of financial accounting standards no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
pro forma operating income for fiscal as if the adoption of sfas had occurred as of october  is million 
e deviation from average heating degree days based upon national weather statistics provided by the national oceanic and atmospheric administration noaa for airports in the united states  excluding alaska 
fiscal compared with fiscal weather based upon heating degree days was essentially normal during fiscal compared to weather that was warmer than normal in fiscal although temperatures nationwide averaged near normal during fiscal  our overall results reflect weather that was significantly warmer in the west and generally colder than normal in the east 
retail propane volumes sold increased million gallons in fiscal due principally to the effects of the colder weather and  to a much lesser extent  volume growth from acquisitions and customer growth 
these increases were achieved notwithstanding the effects of price induced customer conservation and  with respect to commercial and industrial customers  continuing economic weakness 
retail propane revenues increased million reflecting a million increase due to higher average selling prices and a million increase due to the higher retail volumes sold 
wholesale propane revenues increased million reflecting a million increase due to higher average selling prices and a million increase due to the higher volumes sold 
the higher retail and wholesale selling prices reflect significantly higher propane product costs during fiscal resulting from  among other things  higher crude oil and natural gas prices and lower propane inventories 
other revenues from ancillary sales and services were million in fiscal and million in fiscal total cost of sales increased million reflecting the higher propane product costs and higher volumes sold 
the million increase in total margin is principally due to the higher propane gallons sold and  to a lesser extent  slightly higher average retail propane unit margins 
notwithstanding the previously mentioned significant increase in the commodity price of propane  retail propane unit margins were slightly higher than the prior year reflecting the effects of the higher average selling prices and the benefits of favorable propane product cost management activities 
beginning in fiscal and continuing in fiscal  unit margins associated with the partnership s prefilled propane xchange program ppx r were higher than historical levels reflecting increases in ppx r sales prices to fund cylinder valve replacement capital expenditures 
these capital expenditures resulted from national fire protection association nfpa guidelines enacted in fiscal requiring propane grill cylinders be fitted with overfill protection devices opds 
the extent to which this level of ppx r margin is sustainable in the future will depend upon a number of factors including the continuing rate of opd valve replacement and competitive market conditions 
ebitda increased million in fiscal reflecting the previously mentioned increase in total margin and a million increase in other income partially offset by a million increase in operating and administrative expenses and a million increase in losses associated with early extinguishments of long term debt 
although ebitda is not a measure of performance or financial condition under accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america  management believes ebitda is a meaningful non gaap financial measure used by investors to compare the partnership s operating performance with other companies within the propane industry and to evaluate our ability to meet loan covenants 
operating and administrative expenses increased principally due to higher medical and general insurance expenses  higher distribution expenses as a result of the previously mentioned greater retail volumes  and higher incentive compensation and uncollectible accounts expenses 
in addition  the partnership incurred million of costs during fiscal associated with a realignment of the partnership s management structure announced in june other income in fiscal includes a gain of million from the settlement of certain hedge contracts and greater income from finance charges and asset sales while other income in the prior year was reduced by a million loss from declines in the value of propane commodity option contracts 
operating income in fiscal increased less than the increase in ebitda due to higher depreciation expense principally associated with ppx r partially offset by the previously mentioned increase in losses associated with early extinguishments of long term debt 
fiscal compared with fiscal the partnership s fiscal operating results were negatively impacted by significantly warmer than normal heating season weather 
fiscal temperatures based upon heating degree day data provided by noaa were approximately warmer than normal and warmer than fiscal notwithstanding the impact of the warmer weather on heating related sales and the effects of a sluggish us economy on commercial sales  retail gallons sold increased million gallons principally as a result of the full year effect of the partnership s august  acquisition of columbia propane and  to a much lesser extent  greater volumes from our ppx r grill cylinder exchange business 
the increase in ppx r sales principally reflects the effect on fiscal grill cylinder exchanges resulting from the previously mentioned nfpa guidelines requiring grill cylinders be fitted with opds and  to a lesser extent  the full year effects of fiscal increases in the number of ppx r distribution outlets 
retail propane revenues were  million in fiscal  a decrease of million from fiscal  reflecting a million decrease as a result of lower average selling prices partially offset by a million increase as a result of the greater retail volumes sold 
wholesale propane revenues were million in fiscal  a decrease of million  reflecting a million decrease due to lower average selling prices and a million decrease as a result of lower wholesale volumes sold 
the lower fiscal retail and wholesale selling prices resulted from lower fiscal propane product costs 
revenues from other sales and services increased million primarily due to the full year impact of the columbia propane acquisition 
total cost of sales declined million in fiscal reflecting lower average propane product costs and the lower wholesale sales partially offset by the higher retail gallons sold 
total margin increased million reflecting the full year volume impact of the columbia propane acquisition and a million increase in total margin from ppx r reflecting higher volumes and unit margins 
ppx r propane unit margins in fiscal were higher than in fiscal reflecting increases in sales prices to fund opd valve replacement capital expenditures on out of compliance grill cylinders 
ebitda increased million excluding the million cumulative effect of the partnership s changes in accounting for tank fee revenue and tank installation costs and the adoption of sfas in fiscal as the significant increase in total margin was substantially offset by a million increase in partnership operating and administrative expenses and a decrease in other income 
ebitda of ppx r increased approximately million in fiscal partially offsetting the effects of the significantly warmer winter weather on our heating related volumes 
the greater operating and administrative expenses in fiscal resulted primarily from the full year impact of the columbia propane acquisition and higher volume driven ppx r expenses 
during fiscal  the partnership completed its planned blending of columbia propane distribution locations with existing amerigas propane locations 
as a result of these district consolidations and other cost reduction activities  management believes that by september  it achieved its anticipated million reduction in annualized operating cost savings subsequent to the acquisition of columbia propane 
operating income increased million principally due to the cessation of goodwill amortization in fiscal as a result of the adoption of sfas partially offset by higher depreciation and intangible asset amortization associated with columbia propane and higher ppx r depreciation 
fiscal operating income includes million of goodwill amortization 
financial condition and liquidity capitalization and liquidity the partnership s debt outstanding at september  totaled million 
there were no amounts outstanding under amerigas olp s credit agreement at september  amerigas olp s credit agreement expires on october  and consists of a million revolving credit facility and a million acquisition facility 
the revolving credit facility may be used for working capital and general purposes of amerigas olp 
the acquisition facility provides amerigas olp with the ability to borrow up to million to finance the purchase of propane businesses or propane business assets or  to the extent it is not so used  may be used for working capital and general purposes 
issued and outstanding letters of credit under the revolving credit facility  which reduce the amount available for borrowings  totaled million at september  amerigas olp s short term borrowing needs are seasonal and are typically greatest during the fall and winter heating season months due to the need to fund higher levels of working capital 
amerigas olp also has a credit agreement with the general partner to borrow up to million on an unsecured  subordinated basis  for working capital and general purposes 
ugi has agreed to contribute up to million to the general partner to fund such borrowings 
amerigas partners periodically issues debt and equity securities and expects to continue to do so 
it has effective debt and equity shelf registration statements with the us securities and exchange commission sec under which it may issue up to an additional million principal amount of senior notes due  million amerigas partners common units and up to million of debt or equity pursuant to an unallocated shelf registration statement 
amerigas olp must maintain certain financial ratios in order to borrow under its credit agreement including a minimum interest coverage ratio and a maximum debt to ebitda ratio  as defined 
amerigas olp s ratios calculated as of september  permit it to borrow up to the maximum amount available 
for a more detailed discussion of the partnership s credit facilities  see note to consolidated financial statements 
based upon existing cash balances  cash expected to be generated from operations  borrowings available under its credit agreement  and the expected refinancing of its maturing long term debt  the partnership s management believes that the partnership will be able to meet its anticipated contractual commitments and projected cash needs in fiscal partnership distributions since its formation in  the partnership has paid the minimum quarterly distribution of mqd on all limited partner units outstanding 
the amount of available cash needed annually to pay the mqd on all units and the general partner interests in fiscal  and was approximately million  million and million  respectively 
based upon the number of partnership units outstanding on september   the amount of available cash needed annually to pay the mqd on all units and the general partner interests is approximately million 
a reasonable proxy for the amount of cash available for distribution that is generated by the partnership can be calculated by subtracting from the partnership s ebitda interest expense and capital expenditures needed to maintain operating capacity 
partnership distributable cash as calculated under this method for fiscal  and is as follows year ended september  millions of dollars net income income tax expense benefit interest expense depreciation amortization ebitda interest expense maintenance capital expenditures distributable cash although distributable cash is a reasonable estimate of the amount of cash generated by the partnership  it does not reflect  among other things  the impact of changes in working capital  which can significantly affect cash available for distribution 
distributable cash should not be considered as an alternative to net income as an indicator of operating performance or as an alternative to cash flow as a measure of liquidity or ability to service debt obligations and is not a measure of performance or financial condition under accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
management believes distributable cash is a meaningful non gaap measure for evaluating the partnership s ability to declare and pay the mqd pursuant to the terms of the partnership agreement 
the partnership s definition of distributable cash may be different from that used by other companies 
although the level of distributable cash in fiscal was less than the full mqd  other sources of cash  including cash from equity offerings and borrowings and changes in working capital  was more than sufficient to permit the partnership to pay the full mqd 
the ability of the partnership to pay the mqd on all units depends upon a number of factors 
these factors include the level of partnership earnings  the cash needs of the partnership s operations including cash needed for maintaining and increasing operating capacity  changes in operating working capital  and the partnership s ability to borrow under its bank credit agreement  to refinance maturing debt and to increase its long term debt 
some of these factors are affected by conditions beyond our control including weather  competition in markets we serve  the cost of propane and changes in capital market conditions 
conversion of subordinated units in december  the general partner determined that the cash based performance and distribution requirements for the conversion of the remaining  subordinated units  all of which were held by the general partner  had been met in respect of the quarter ended september  as a result  these subordinated units were converted to a like number of common units effective november  the conversion of the subordinated units did not result in an increase in the total number of amerigas partners limited partner units outstanding 
contractual cash obligations and commitments the partnership has certain contractual cash obligations that extend beyond fiscal including obligations associated with long term debt  lease obligations and propane supply contracts 
the following table presents significant contractual cash obligations as of september  in millions 
payments due by period less than after total year years years years long term debt operating leases propane supply contracts total  cash flows operating activities 
due to the seasonal nature of the partnership s business  cash flows from operating activities are generally strongest during the second and third fiscal quarters when customers pay for propane consumed during the heating season months 
conversely  operating cash flows are generally at their lowest levels during the first and fourth fiscal quarters when the partnership s investment in working capital  principally accounts receivable and inventories  is generally greatest 
the partnership uses its revolving credit facility to satisfy its seasonal operating cash flow needs 
cash flow from operating activities was million in fiscal  million in fiscal  and million in fiscal cash flow from operating activities before changes in operating working capital was million in fiscal  million in fiscal and million in fiscal changes in operating working capital used million of operating cash flow in fiscal  and provided million and million in fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
the increase in fiscal working capital cash needs primarily reflects the effects of higher propane product costs on customer accounts receivable and inventories 
investing activities 
cash flow used in investing activities was million in fiscal  million in fiscal  and million in fiscal which included the acquisition of columbia propane 
we spent million for property  plant and equipment comprising maintenance capital expenditures of million and growth capital expenditures of million in fiscal compared to expenditures of million comprising million of maintenance capital expenditures and million of growth capital expenditures in fiscal during fiscal  the partnership acquired several propane distribution businesses for total cash consideration of million 
financing activities 
cash flow used by financing activities was million in fiscal and million in fiscal cash provided by financing activities was million in fiscal which includes debt and equity issued in conjunction with the acquisition of columbia propane 
financing activity cash flow is primarily the result of repayments and issuances of long term debt  borrowings under our credit agreement  distributions on limited partner units and proceeds from issuances of common units 
in june  amerigas partners sold  common units in an underwritten public offering at a public offering price of per unit 
the net proceeds of the public offering totaling million  and associated capital contributions from the general partner totaling million  were contributed to amerigas olp and used to reduce indebtedness under its bank credit agreement and for general partnership purposes 
the underwriters overallotment option expired unexercised 
the partnership also completed a number of debt transactions during fiscal in december  amerigas partners issued million face amount of senior notes due at an effective interest rate of 
the net proceeds of million were used in january to redeem prior to maturity amerigas partners million face amount of senior notes due april at a redemption price of  plus accrued interest 
the partnership recognized a loss of million relating to the redemption premium and other associated costs and expenses 
in april  amerigas olp repaid million of maturing first mortgage notes 
in conjunction with this repayment  in april amerigas partners issued million face amount of senior notes due at an effective interest rate of and contributed the net proceeds of million  including debt premium  to amerigas olp 
related party transactions pursuant to the partnership agreement and a management services agreement among amerigas eagle holdings  inc aeh  the general partner of amerigas eagle propane  lp eagle olp  and amerigas propane  inc the general partner  the general partner is entitled to reimbursement for all direct and indirect expenses incurred or payments it makes on behalf of the partnership 
these costs  which totaled million in  million in and million in  include employee compensation and benefit expenses of employees of the general partner and general and administrative expenses 
ugi corporation ugi provides certain financial and administrative services to the general partner 
ugi bills the general partner for these direct and indirect corporate expenses and the general partner is reimbursed by the partnership for these expenses 
such corporate expenses totaled million in  million in  and million in in addition  ugi and certain of its subsidiaries provide office space and automobile liability insurance to the partnership 
these expenses totaled million in  million in and million in subsequent to the columbia propane acquisition  the partnership purchases propane on behalf of atlantic energy  inc atlantic energy 
atlantic energy reimburses amerigas olp for its purchases plus interest as atlantic energy sells such propane to third parties or to amerigas olp itself 
the total dollar value of propane purchased on behalf of atlantic energy was million and million in and  respectively 
purchases of propane by amerigas olp from atlantic energy during and totaled million and million  respectively 
the general partner also provides other services to atlantic energy including accounting  insurance and other administrative services and is reimbursed for the related costs 
such costs were not material during or in addition  amerigas olp enters into product cost hedging contracts on behalf of atlantic energy 
when these contracts are settled  amerigas olp is reimbursed the cost of any losses  or distributes the proceeds of any gains  to atlantic energy 
amounts due from atlantic energy at september  and totaled million and million  respectively  which amounts are included in accounts receivable related parties in the consolidated balance sheets 
off balance sheet arrangements we lease various buildings and other facilities  transportation  computer and office equipment 
we account for these arrangements as operating leases 
these off balance sheet arrangements enable us to lease facilities and equipment from third parties rather than  among other options  purchasing the equipment and facilities using on balance sheet financing 
for a summary of scheduled future payments under these lease arrangements  see contractual cash obligations and commitments 
market risk disclosures our primary financial market risks include commodity prices for propane and interest rates on borrowings 
the risk associated with fluctuations in the prices the partnership pays for propane are principally a result of market forces reflecting changes in supply and demand for propane and other energy commodities 
the partnership s profitability is sensitive to changes in propane supply costs  and the partnership generally attempts to pass on increases in such costs to customers 
the partnership may not  however  always be able to pass through product cost increases fully  particularly when product costs rise rapidly 
in order to reduce the volatility of the partnership s propane market price risk  we use contracts for the forward purchase or sale of propane  propane fixed price supply agreements  and over the counter derivative commodity instruments including price swap and option contracts 
over the counter derivative commodity instruments utilized by the partnership to hedge forecasted purchases of propane are generally settled at expiration of the contract 
in order to minimize credit risk associated with derivative commodity contracts  we carefully monitor established credit limits with the contract counterparties 
although we use derivative financial and commodity instruments to reduce market price risk associated with forecasted transactions  we do not use derivative financial and commodity instruments for speculative or trading purposes 
the partnership has both fixed rate and variable rate debt 
changes in interest rates impact the cash flows of variable rate debt but generally do not impact its fair value 
conversely  changes in interest rates impact the fair value of fixed rate debt but do not impact their cash flows 
our variable rate debt includes borrowings under amerigas olp s credit agreement 
this agreement has interest rates that are generally indexed to short term market interest rates 
at september   there were no borrowings outstanding under this agreement 
at september   borrowings outstanding under the prior bank credit agreement totaled million 
based upon weighted average borrowings outstanding under these agreements during fiscal and fiscal  an increase in short term interest rates of basis points would have increased our interest expense by million and million  respectively 
the remainder of our debt outstanding is subject to fixed rates of interest 
a basis point increase in market interest rates would result in decreases in the fair value of this fixed rate debt of million and million at september  and  respectively 
a basis point decrease in market interest rates would result in increases in the fair market value of this debt of million and million at september  and  respectively 
our long term debt is typically issued at fixed rates of interest based upon market rates for debt having similar terms and credit ratings 
as these long term debt issues mature  we may refinance such debt with new debt having interest rates reflecting then current market conditions 
this debt may have an interest rate that is more or less than the refinanced debt 
in order to reduce interest rate risk associated with near term forecasted issuances of fixed rate debt  from time to time we enter into interest rate protection agreements 
the following table summarizes the fair values of unsettled market risk sensitive derivative instruments held at september  and it also includes the changes in fair value that would result if there were an adverse change in the market price of propane of cents per gallon and interest rates on ten year us treasury notes of basis points change in fair fair value value millions of dollars september  propane commodity price risk interest rate risk september  propane commodity price risk interest rate risk because the partnership s derivative instruments generally qualify as hedges under sfas  we expect that changes in the fair value of derivative instruments used to manage propane price or interest rate risk would be substantially offset by gains or losses on the associated underlying transactions 
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in compliance with generally accepted accounting principles requires the selection and application of appropriate accounting principles to the relevant facts and circumstances of the partnership s operations and the use of estimates made by management 
the partnership has identified the following critical accounting policies that are most important to the portrayal of the partnership s financial condition and results of operations 
changes in these policies could have a material effect on the financial statements 
the application of these accounting policies necessarily requires management s most subjective or complex judgments regarding estimates and projected outcomes of future events which could have a material impact on the financial statements 
management has reviewed these critical accounting policies  and the estimates and assumptions associated with them  with its audit committee 
in addition  management has reviewed the following disclosures regarding the application of these critical accounting policies with the audit committee 
litigation accruals 
the partnership is involved in litigation regarding pending claims and legal actions that arise in the normal course of its business 
in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america  the partnership establishes reserves for pending claims and legal actions when it is probable that a liability exists and the amount or range of amounts can be reasonably estimated 
reasonable estimates involve management judgments based on a broad range of information and prior experience 
these judgments are reviewed quarterly as more information is received and the amounts reserved are updated as necessary 
such estimated reserves may differ materially from the actual liability  and such reserves may change materially as more information becomes available and estimated reserves are adjusted 
depreciation and amortization of long lived assets 
we compute depreciation on property  plant and equipment on a straight line basis over estimated useful lives generally ranging from to years 
we also use amortization methods and determine asset values of intangible assets other than goodwill using reasonable assumptions and projections 
changes in the estimated useful lives of property  plant and equipment and changes in intangible asset amortization methods or values could have a material effect on our results of operations
