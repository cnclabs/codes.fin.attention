item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations certain statements in this annual report on form k include forward looking information within the meaning of section a of the securities act of  as amended  and section e of the securities exchange act of  as amended  and are subject to the safe harbor created by those sections 
these forward looking statements involve certain risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward looking statements 
such risks and uncertainties include  but are not limited to  the factors listed under special cautionary notice regarding forward looking information  included on page of this report and those described in this discussion and analysis 
management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations analyzes the major elements of the company s balance sheets and statements of earnings 
this section should be read in conjunction with the company s consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes and other detailed information appearing elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
application of critical accounting policies and accounting estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes 
while the company bases its estimates on historical experience  current information and other factors deemed to be relevant  actual results could differ from those estimates 
the company considers accounting estimates to be critical to its reported financial results if i the accounting estimate requires management to make assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain and ii different estimates that management reasonably could have used for the accounting estimate in the current period  or changes in the accounting estimate that are reasonably likely to occur from period to period  would have a material impact on the company s financial statements 
accounting polices related to allowance for loan losses and loss contingencies are considered to be critical as these policies involve considerable subjective judgment and estimation by management 
critical accounting policies  and the company s procedures related to these policies  are described in detail below 
also see note summary of significant accounting policies in the accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements 
allowance for loan losses 
the allowance for loan losses is a reserve established through a provision for loan losses charged to expense and represents management s best estimate of probable losses that have been incurred within the existing portfolio of loans 
the allowance  in management s judgment  is necessary to reserve for estimated loan losses and risks inherent in the loan portfolio 
in estimating the allowance for loan losses  management considers historical charge off experience  loan delinquencies  the credit worthiness of individual customers  economic conditions affecting specific customer industries and general economic conditions  among other factors 
should any of these factors change  the company s estimate of probable loan losses could also change  which could affect the level of the future provisions for loan losses 
see additional discussion under the sections captioned  allowance for loan losses and provision for loan losses  included elsewhere in this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
also see note loans and allowance for loan losses in the accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements 
loss contingencies 
there are times when non recurring events occur that require management to consider whether an accrual for a loss contingency is appropriate 
accruals for such loss contingencies typically relate to legal proceedings and other claims and are recorded when management believes the likelihood of an adverse outcome is probable and the amount of the loss is reasonably estimable 
contingent liabilities are often resolved over long time periods 
estimating probable losses requires analysis of multiple forecasts that often depend on judgments about potential actions by third parties 
while there can be no assurance  the company currently believes the outcome of current outstanding legal proceedings will not have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition or results of operations 
the outcomes are inherently uncertain  and it is possible that some of these matters may be resolved materially adversely to the company 
the adverse resolution of any one or more of these matters could have a material adverse effect on the company s financial condition or results of operations

results of operation net interest income net interest income represents the amount by which interest income on interest earning assets  which include securities  loans  and federal funds sold  exceeds interest expense incurred on interest bearing liabilities  which include deposits and other borrowed funds 
net interest income is the principal source of the company s earnings 
interest rate fluctuations  as well as changes in the amount and type of earning assets and liabilities  combine to affect net interest income

in  the company made significant enhancements to the allowance for loan loss methodology to better quantify the risk associated with these internal and external factors 
the company s provision for loan losses for was million compared with million for the decrease in the provision was due primarily to a decrease in total nonperforming loans of million  or

management believes the company has maintained good asset quality is still as net charge offs remain at manageable levels totaling  or of average loans in compared with  or of average loans in the company s provision for loan losses increased from  in to million in primarily due to loan growth  an increase in classified loans  and the national economic conditions 
noninterest income noninterest income is an important source of revenue for financial institutions 
the company s primary sources of noninterest income are service charges on deposit accounts and other banking service related fees 
noninterest income for the year ended december  was million  a decrease of million from million in but up from million in the decrease is primarily due to a nonrecurring gain of million in in connection with the settlement of the guaranty federal lawsuit 
this gain represents the amount received in january in connection with the november settlement and concurrent transfer of the company s rights to certain intangible assets 
this income was partially offset by a nonrecurring impairment charge during of million associated with the aft lease transaction 
during  guaranty leasing  acquired a ownership interest in aft for approximately million 
the aft ownership interest is classified as an other asset on the company s balance sheet 
as of december  and  the book value of the aft ownership was million 
during the fourth quarter of  on belief that the company s investment in aft was impaired by declines in air travel and reduced demand for commercial aircraft  an impairment charge of million was recorded and the carrying amount of the investment was reduced to million 
during the third quarter of  aft recorded an impairment charge of million related to two airplanes 
in addition  management received indications the apprised value of aft s fleet of airplanes had declined approximately from their value the past year 
based on these factors  the limited marketability of the investment  the uncertainty surrounding the air transport industry and general economic conditions  management believed that the value of its investment in aft was permanently impaired 
excluding the gain on settlement of litigation and the impairment charge of the aft  recurring noninterest income for totaled million

securities gains decreased  from  in to  in as to normal and recurring noninterest income  the company experienced a increase to million for the twelve months ended december  and a increase to million for the same period in the following table presents for the periods indicated the major categories of noninterest income years ended december  dollars in thousands service charges    securities gains  net fee income fiduciary income earnings from key man life insurance gain on sale of loans gain on sale of assets gain on sale of ore income from lease transactions income from investment in aft impairment of investment in aft  gain on settlement of litigation  other noninterest income total noninterest income    the increase in noninterest income in both to  excluding the gain on settlement of litigation and the impairment charge taken in aft  resulted primarily from service charges and fee income due to an increase in the number of deposit accounts 
additionally  the company continued to emphasize fee based services resulting in greater income from check cashing  atm fees  appraisal fees and wire transfer fees 
noninterest expense for the years ended december   and  noninterest expense totaled million  million and million  respectively 
the million  or  increase in was primarily the result of increases in employee compensation and benefits 
employee compensation and benefits increased from million in to million in  an increase of million  or 
this increase was due to an increase in full time equivalent employees from at december  to at december   normal salary adjustments  increased bonus incentives  profit sharing contributions  and payroll taxes 
the increase in total noninterest expense for over of million  or  was primarily the result of increases in employee compensation and benefits  fixed asset expense  and increased litigation expense 
employee compensation and benefits increased from million in to million in  an increase of  or 
this increase was due to an increase in full time equivalent employees from at december  to at december   an increase in incentive compensation  and normal salary adjustments 
legal and professional fees increased  or primarily due to litigation involving the lawsuit with guaranty federal 
the company s efficiency ratios  calculated by dividing total noninterest expense excluding securities gains and losses by net interest income plus noninterest income  were in  in  and in the following table presents for the periods indicated the major categories of noninterest expense years ended december  dollars in thousands employee compensation and benefits    non staff expenses occupancy expenses    legal and professional fees director and committee fees advertising atm and debit card expense office and computer supplies postage phone expense other    total non staff expenses    total noninterest expense    income taxes federal income tax is reported as income tax expense and is influenced by the amount of taxable income  the amount of tax exempt income  the amount of non deductible interest expense and the amount of other non deductible expense 
the company utilized tax benefits on leveraged lease transactions in the amounts of   and  for  and  respectively 
the effective tax rates for  and were  and  respectively 
income taxes for financial purposes in the consolidated statements of earnings differ from the amount computed by applying the statutory income tax rate of to earnings before income taxes 
the difference in the statutory rate is primarily due to the tax benefits on the leveraged lease transactions and non taxable income 
additionally  the state of texas imposes a texas franchise tax 
taxable income for the income tax component of the texas franchise tax is the federal pre tax income  plus certain officers salaries  less interest income from federal securities 
total franchise tax expense was  in   in and  in such expense was included as a part of other noninterest expense 
impact of inflation the effects of inflation on the local economy and on the company s operating results have been relatively modest for the past several years 
since substantially all of the company s assets and liabilities are monetary in nature  such as cash  securities  loans and deposits  their values are less sensitive to the effects of inflation than to changing interest rates  which do not necessarily change in accordance with inflation rates 
the company tries to control the impact of interest rate fluctuations by managing the relationship between its interest rate sensitive assets and liabilities

financial condition loan portfolio including loans held for sale the company provides a broad range of commercial  real estate and consumer loan products to small and medium sized businesses and individuals in its market areas 
the company aggressively pursues qualified lending customers in both the commercial and consumer sectors  providing customers with direct access to lending personnel and prompt  professional service 
the gross loan to deposit ratio as of december   reflects the company s commitment as an active lender in the local communities it serves 
total loans were million at december   an increase of million  or compared with million at december  in  total loans increased by million  or to million from million at december  in  total loans increased by million  or from million at december  the growth in loans reflects the stable local economy  an aggressive advertising campaign  the company s pro lending reputation and the solicitation of new companies and individuals entering the company s market areas 
the following table summarizes the loan portfolio including loans held for sale of the company by type of loan as of the dates indicated december  amount percent amount percent amount percent amount percent amount percent dollars in thousands commercial and industrial   agriculture     real estate construction and land development     family residential    loans held for sale   farmland     commercial     multi family residential    consumer  net of unearned discounts    total loans    the primary lending focus of the company is on loans to small and medium sized businesses and one to four family residential mortgage loans 
the company s commercial lending products include business loans  commercial real estate loans  equipment loans  working capital loans  term loans  revolving lines of credit and letters of credit 
most commercial loans are collateralized and on payment programs 
the purpose of a particular loan generally determines its structure 
in almost all cases  the company requires personal guarantees on commercial loans to help assure repayment 
commercial the company s commercial loans are primarily made within its market area and are underwritten on the basis of the borrower s ability to service such debt from income 
as a general practice  the company takes as collateral a lien on any available real estate  equipment  or other assets obtained owned by the borrower and obtains a personal guaranty of the borrower 
in general  commercial loans involve more credit risk than residential mortgage loans and commercial mortgage loans and  therefore  usually yield a higher return 
the increased risk for commercial loans is due to the type of collateral securing these loans 
the increased risk also derives from the expectation that commercial loans generally will be serviced principally from the business operations  and those operations may not be successful 
as a result of these additional complexities  variables and risks  commercial loans require more thorough underwriting and servicing than other types of loans 
in addition to commercial loans secured by real estate  the company makes commercial mortgage loans to finance the purchase of real property  which generally consists of real estate with completed structures 
commercial mortgage lending typically involves higher loan principal amounts and the repayment of loans is dependent  in large part  on sufficient income from the properties securing the loans to cover operating expenses and debt service 
as a general practice  the company requires its commercial mortgage loans to be secured by well managed income producing property with adequate margins and to be guaranteed by responsible parties 
the company s commercial mortgage loans are generally secured by first liens on real estate 
loans with fixed interest rates typically amortize over a to year period with balloon payments due at the end of one to five years 
in underwriting commercial mortgage loans  consideration is given to the property s operating history  future operating projections  current and projected occupancy  location and physical condition 
the underwriting analysis also includes credit checks  appraisals and a review of the financial condition of the borrower and guarantor 
construction the company makes loans to finance the construction of residential and  to a limited extent  nonresidential properties 
construction loans generally are secured by first liens on real estate 
the company conducts periodic inspections  either directly or through an agent  prior to approval of periodic draws on these loans 
construction loans involve additional risks attributable to the fact that loan funds are advanced upon the security of a project under construction  and the project is of uncertain value prior to its completion 
because of uncertainties inherent in estimating construction costs  the market value of the completed project and the effects of governmental regulation on real property  it can be difficult to accurately evaluate the total funds required to complete a project and the related loan to value ratio 
as a result of these uncertainties  construction lending often involves the disbursement of substantial funds with repayment dependent  in part  on the success of the ultimate project rather than the ability of a borrower or guarantor to repay the loan 
if the company is forced to foreclose on a project prior to completion  there is no assurance that it will be able to recover all of the unpaid portion of the loan 
in addition  the company may be required to fund additional amounts to complete a project and may have to hold the property for an indeterminate period of time 
family residential the company offers a variety of mortgage loan products 
the company s loans collateralized by one to four family residential real estate generally are originated in amounts of no more than of the lower of cost or appraised value 
the company generally requires mortgage title insurance and hazard insurance in the amount of the loan 
of the mortgages originated  the company generally retains mortgage loans with short terms or variable rates and sells longer term fixed rate loans that do not meet the company s credit underwriting standards 
prior to the acquisition of first american in september  the company sold such loans to texas independent bank mortgage company  however  since the first american acquisition  the company sells these loans directly into the secondary market 
as of december   the company s one to four family residential real estate loan portfolio including loans held for sale was million 
of this amount  million is repriceable in one year or less and an additional million is repriceable from one year to five years 
these high percentages in short term real estate loans reflect the company s commitment to reducing interest rate risk 
consumer the company provides a wide variety of consumer loans including motor vehicle  watercraft  education loans  personal loans collateralized and uncollateralized and deposit account collateralized loans 
the terms of these loans typically range from to months and vary based upon the nature of collateral and size of loan 
as of december   the company had no indirect consumer loans  indicating a preference to maintain personal banking relationships and strict underwriting standards 
consumer loans entail greater risk than do residential mortgage loans  particularly in the case of consumer loans that are unsecured or secured by rapidly depreciating assets such as automobiles 
in such cases  any repossessed collateral for a defaulted consumer loan may not provide an adequate source of repayment for the outstanding loan balance 
the remaining deficiency often does not warrant further substantial collection efforts against the borrower beyond obtaining a deficiency judgment 
in addition  consumer loan collections are dependent on the borrower s continuing financial stability  and thus are more likely to be adversely affected by job loss  divorce  illness or personal bankruptcy 
furthermore  the application of various federal and state laws may limit the amount which can be recovered on such loans 
during the last several years  management has placed tighter controls on consumer credit due to record high personal bankruptcy filings nationwide 
agriculture the company provides agricultural loans for short term crop production  including cotton  milo and corn  farm equipment  cattle and agricultural real estate financing 
the company evaluates agricultural borrowers primarily based on their historical profitability  level of experience in their particular agricultural industry  overall financial capacity and the availability of secondary collateral to withstand economic and natural variations common to the industry 
because agricultural loans present a higher level of risk associated with events caused by nature  and the volatility of the world market prices on commodities  the company routinely makes on site visits  inspections  and utilize government guaranteed programs in order to monitor  identify and manage such risks 
the company rarely makes loans at its legal lending limit 
lending officers are assigned various levels of loan approval authority based upon their respective levels of experience and expertise 
all loans above  are evaluated and acted upon by the executive committee  which meets weekly 
all new and renewed loans greater than  are reported monthly to the board of directors 
all new and renewed loans of  or less are reported weekly to the executive committee 
the company s strategy for approving or disapproving loans is to follow conservative loan policies and underwriting practices which include i granting loans on a sound and collectible basis  ii investing funds properly for the benefit of shareholders and the protection of depositors  iii serving the legitimate needs of the community and the company s general market area while obtaining a balance between maximum yield and minimum risk  iv ensuring that primary and secondary sources of repayment are adequate in relation to the amount of the loan  v developing and maintaining adequate diversification of the loan portfolio as a whole and of the loans within each category  and vi ensuring that each loan is properly documented and  if appropriate  insurance coverage is adequate 
the company s loan review and compliance personnel interact daily with commercial and consumer lenders to identify potential underwriting or technical exception variances 
in addition  the company has placed increased emphasis on the early identification of problem loans to aggressively seek resolution of the situations and thereby keep loan losses at a minimum 
the contractual maturity ranges of the commercial  industrial  agriculture  commercial real estate  and real estate construction loan portfolio and the amount of such loans with predetermined interest rates in each maturity range as of december   are summarized in the following table december  one year or less after one through five years after five years total dollars in thousands commercial and industrial     agriculture    real estate construction   commercial real estate     total     loans with a predetermined interest rate    loans with a floating interest rate     total     nonperforming assets the company has several procedures in place to assist it in maintaining the overall quality of its loan portfolio 
the company has established underwriting guidelines to be followed by its officers and also monitors its delinquency levels for any negative or adverse trends 
there can be no assurance  however  that the company s loan portfolio will not become subject to increasing pressures from deteriorating borrower credit due to general economic conditions 
nonperforming assets at december   decreased million  or  to million compared with million at december  this decrease reflects a reduction in nonaccrual loans primarily attributed to transferring the collateral on two large lines of credit into other real estate 
the reduction in past due loans is the result of the company s continued aggressive collection efforts and the balance of reductions were a result of liquidation of collateral and loan payoffs 
nonperforming assets were million at december  this resulted in ratios of nonperforming assets to total loans plus other real estate of  and for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the company generally places a loan on nonaccrual status and ceases to accrue interest when loan payment performance is deemed unsatisfactory 
loans where the interest payments jeopardize the collection of principal are placed on nonaccrual status  unless the loan is both well secured and in the process of collection 
cash payments received while a loan is classified as nonaccrual are recorded as a reduction of principal as long as doubt exists as to collection 
if interest on nonaccrual loans had been accrued  such income would have been approximately  and  for and  respectively 
the company is sometimes required to revise a loan s interest rate or repayment terms in a troubled debt restructuring  however  the company had no restructured loans or additional nonperforming interest earning assets at december     or in addition to an internal loan review  the company retains ibs on a semi annual basis to evaluate the loan portfolio 
the company maintains current appraisals on loans secured by real estate  particularly those categorized as nonperforming loans and potential problem loans 
in instances where updated appraisals reflect reduced collateral values  an evaluation of the borrower s overall financial condition is made to determine the need  if any  for possible write downs or appropriate additions to the allowance for loan losses 
the company records other real estate at the lower of its fair market value  minus estimated costs to sell the property  or the recorded investment in the loan on the date of transfer 
the following table presents information regarding nonperforming assets at the dates indicated december  dollars in thousands nonaccrual loans    accruing loans past due days or more   other real estate  total nonperforming assets     nonperforming assets to total loans and other real estate the company considers a loan to be impaired based on current information and events  if it is probable that the company will be unable to collect the scheduled payments of principal or interest when due according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement 
the measurement of impaired loans is based on the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the loan s effective interest rate or the loan s observable market price or based on the fair value of the collateral if the loan is collateral dependent 
allowance for loan losses the allowance for loan losses is a reserve established through charges to earnings in the form of a provision for loan losses 
management has established an allowance for loan losses  which it believes  is adequate for estimated losses in the company s loan portfolio 
based on an evaluation of the loan portfolio  management presents a quarterly review of the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses to the company s board of directors 
in making its evaluation  management considers the diversification by industry of the company s commercial loan portfolio  the effect of changes in the local real estate market on collateral values  the results of recent regulatory examinations  the effects on the loan portfolio of current economic indicators and their probable impact on borrowers  the amount of charge offs for the period  the amount of nonperforming loans and related collateral security  the results of management s internal loan review  the evaluation of its loan portfolio through a semi annual external loan review conducted by ibs and the annual examination of the company s financial statements by its independent auditors 
charge offs occur when loans are deemed to be uncollectible 
the company follows an internal loan review program to evaluate the credit risk in the loan portfolio 
through the loan review process  the company maintains an internally classified loan list  which  along with the delinquency list of loans  helps management assess the overall quality of the loan portfolio and the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses 
loans internally classified as substandard or in the more severe categories of doubtful or loss are those loans that  at a minimum  have clear and defined weaknesses such as a highly leveraged position  unfavorable financial ratios  uncertain repayment sources or poor financial condition  which may jeopardize recoverability of the debt 
at december   the company had million of such loans compared with million at december   a decrease of million  or 
this decrease is primarily due to the improvement  workout  or foreclosure of nine large loan relationships between  and million  partially offset by the classification of five new relationships  ranging from  to  specific reserves have been established for these new lines based on the estimated exposure on these lines 
in addition to the internally classified loan list and delinquency list of loans  the company maintains a separate watch list which further aids the company in monitoring loan portfolios 
watch list loans show warning elements where the present status portrays one or more deficiencies that require attention in the short term or where pertinent ratios of the loan account have weakened to a point where more frequent monitoring is warranted 
these loans do not have all of the characteristics of a classified loan substandard or doubtful but do show weakened elements as compared with those of a satisfactory credit 
the company reviews these loans to assist in assessing the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses 
at december   the company had million of such loans compared with million at december   an increase of million  or 
this increase is primarily due to the addition of three relationships totaling million 
all of the loans associated with these relationships are well secured and appropriately structured 
with the exception of one small loan  all of these borrowers are current with their payments 
in order to determine the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses  the company establishes both specific and general reserves 
the company establishes specific allocations for the majority of problem loans based on the estimated exposure in each individual loan 
the exposure is generally identified by determining the present value of estimated future cash flows or the fair value of collateral if repayment is expected solely from the collateral 
the company establishes general reserves for non problem loans primarily based on its historical charge off experience 
consideration is also given to the level and trend of delinquent loans  loan growth  underwriting standards  economic conditions  and other qualitative factors based on management s judgment 
loans are charged off against the allowance for loan losses when appropriate 
although management believes it uses the best information available to make determinations with respect to the allowance for loan losses  future adjustments may be necessary if economic conditions differ from the assumptions used in making the initial determinations 
during  net loan charge offs totaled  or of average loans outstanding for the period  compared with  in net loan charge offs or of average loans for the year ended december  during  the company recorded a provision for loan losses of million compared with million for the decrease in provision for is due primarily to a decrease in classified loans 
the company made a provision for loan losses of  for the increase in provision from to is due primarily to loan growth  an increase in classified loans  and general economic uncertainty

at december   investment securities totaled million  an increase of million from million at december  the increase was primarily attributable to million in securities purchases in  partially offset by million in securities sold and in principal repayments 
generally  the growth in securities was funded by increases in deposits and federal home loan bank advances in excess of loan growth 
the december  net unrealized gain was million compared to the december  net unrealized gain of million

us government securities increased from million at december  to million at december  the company continues to hold collateralized mortgage obligations cmo s in its securities portfolio 
a cmo is collateralized directly by mortgages or by mortgage backed securities issued by government agencies 
the company s investment in cmo s decreased from million at december  to million at december   a decrease of million or 
the company also had an increase of million in mortgage backed securities from million at december  to million at december  investments in obligations of state and political subdivisions decreased from million at december  to million at december  as securities that were called or sold or matured were not reinvested in the same category 
the following table summarizes the fair value of securities available for sale held by the company as of the dates shown december  dollars in thousands us government agency securities   mortgage backed securities    collaterized mortgage obligations    equity securities    obligations of state and political subdivisions    total securities    the following table summarizes the contractual maturity of securities available for sale based on fair value and their weighted average yields as of december  december  within one year after one year but within five years after five years but within ten years after ten years total amount yield amount yield amount yield amount yield amount yield dollars in thousands us government securities  mortgage backed securities    cmos    equity securities   state and municipal securities totals    the company classifies debt and equity securities at the date of purchase into one of two categories held to maturity  or available for sale 
at each reporting date  the appropriateness of the classification is reassessed 
investments in debt securities are classified as held to maturity and measured at amortized cost in the financial statements only if management has the positive intent and ability to hold those securities to maturity 
investments not classified as held to maturity are classified as available for sale and measured at fair value in the financial statements with unrealized gains and losses reported  net of tax  in a separate component of shareholders equity until realized 
the company had no securities classified as held to maturity at december   or mortgage backed securities and cmo s are securities  which have been developed by pooling a number of real estate mortgages and are principally issued by or guaranteed by federal agencies such as the federal national mortgage association and the federal home loan mortgage corporation 
these securities are deemed to have high credit ratings and regular monthly cash flows of principal and interest  which are guaranteed by the issuing agencies 
all the company s mortgage backed securities at december  were agency issued collateral obligations 
at december   of the mortgage backed and cmo securities held by the company had final maturities of more than years 
however  unlike us treasury and us government agency securities  which have a lump sum payment at maturity  mortgage backed and cmo securities provide cash flows from regular principal and interest payments and principal prepayments throughout the lives of the securities 
therefore  the average life  or the average amount of time until the company receives the total amount invested  of the mortgage backed or cmo security will be shorter than the contractual maturity 
the company estimates the remaining average life of the fixed rate mortgage backed and cmo security portfolio to be less than three years 
these securities  when purchased at a premium  will generally suffer decreasing net yields as interest rates drop because homeowners tend to refinance their mortgages 
thus  the premium paid must be amortized over a shorter period 
therefore  securities when purchased at a discount will obtain higher net yields in a decreasing interest rate environment 
as interest rates rise  the opposite will generally be true 
during a period of increasing interest rates  fixed rate mortgage backed and cmo securities do not tend to experience heavy prepayments of principal and consequently  the average lives of these securities will not be unduly shortened 
premises and equipment premises and equipment totaled million at december  and million at december  the net change reflects a decrease of  or in fixed assets 
the decrease is primarily due to the purchase of furniture and computer hardware for the company offset by depreciation recorded for the year

the net cash surrender value of these polices totaled million at december  and million at december  at december  the company also had recorded a receivable of million reflecting the settlement of its lawsuit against guaranty federal 
the company received the million in january deposits the company offers a variety of deposit accounts having a wide range of interest rates and terms 
the company s deposit accounts consist of demand  savings  money market and time accounts

certificates of deposit increased from million at december  to million at december   an increase of million  or 
other interest bearing deposits increased from million at december  to million at december   an increase of million  or 
the increase in deposits is primarily due to a generally increasing customer base across most of the company s market areas 
the paris and sulphur springs locations reflected the largest increases in deposits by dollar volume  combining for a million  or increase 
deport  commerce  pittsburg  and texarkana combined for an million  or increase  while the remaining locations showed more modest gains 
two locations showed slight declines in deposits 
management feels that the majority of the locations will continue to gain market shares as the company continues to become better known in its respective market areas

fhlb advances can be particularly attractive as a longer term funding source to balance interest rate sensitivity and reduce interest rate risk 
the company is eligible for two borrowing programs through the fhlb 
the first  called short term fixed  requires delivery of eligible securities for collateral 
maturities under this program range from days 
the company does not currently have any borrowings under this program 
as of december   the company does not have any of its investment securities in safekeeping at the fhlb 
the second borrowing program  the blanket borrowing program  is under a borrowing agreement which does not require the delivery of specific collateral 
borrowings are limited by the level of qualified  pledgable real estate loans held and fhlb stock owned 
at december   the company had approximately million borrowed of a potential million available under this program  leaving approximately million in available borrowings

capital resources and liquidity capital management consists of providing equity to support both current and future operations 
the company is subject to capital adequacy requirements imposed by the federal reserve and the bank is subject to capital adequacy requirements imposed by the fdic and the tdb 
both the federal reserve and the fdic have adopted risk based capital requirements for assessing bank holding company and bank capital adequacy 
these standards define capital and establish minimum capital requirements in relation to assets and off balance sheet exposure  adjusted for credit risk 
the risk based capital standards currently in effect are designed to make regulatory capital requirements more sensitive to differences in risk profiles among bank holding companies and banks  to account for off balance sheet exposure and to minimize disincentives for holding liquid assets 
assets and off balance sheet items are assigned to broad risk categories  each with appropriate relative risk weights 
the resulting capital ratios represent capital as a percentage of total risk weighted assets and off balance sheet items 
the risk based capital standards issued by the federal reserve require all bank holding companies to have tier capital of at least and total risk based capital tier and tier of at least of total risk adjusted assets 
tier capital generally includes common shareholders equity and qualifying perpetual preferred stock together with related surpluses and retained earnings  less deductions for goodwill and various other intangibles 
tier capital may consist of a limited amount of intermediate term preferred stock  a limited amount of term subordinated debt  certain hybrid capital instruments and other debt securities  perpetual preferred stock not qualifying as tier capital  and a limited amount of the general valuation allowance for loan losses 
the sum of tier capital and tier capital is total risk based capital 
the federal reserve has also adopted guidelines which supplement the risk based capital guidelines with a minimum ratio of tier capital to average total consolidated assets leverage ratio of for certain institutions with well diversified risk  including no undue interest rate exposure  excellent asset quality  high liquidity  good earnings  and that are generally considered to be strong banking organizations  rated composite under applicable federal guidelines  and that are not experiencing or anticipating significant growth 
other banking organizations are required to maintain a leverage ratio of at least to 
these rules further provide that banking organizations experiencing internal growth or making acquisitions will be expected to maintain capital positions substantially above the minimum supervisory levels and comparable to peer group averages  without significant reliance on intangible assets 
pursuant to fdicia  each federal banking agency revised its risk based capital standards to ensure that those standards take adequate account of interest rate risk  concentration of credit risk and the risks of nontraditional activities  as well as reflect the actual performance and expected risk of loss on multifamily mortgages 
the bank is subject to capital adequacy guidelines of the fdic that are substantially similar to the federal reserve s guidelines 
also pursuant to fdicia  the fdic has promulgated regulations setting the levels at which an insured institution such as the bank would be considered well capitalized  adequately capitalized  undercapitalized  significantly undercapitalized and critically undercapitalized 
the bank is classified well capitalized for purposes of the fdic s prompt corrective action regulations 
see supervision and regulation the company and the bank 
shareholders equity increased to million at december   from million at december   an increase of million  or 
this increase was primarily the result of net earnings of million and the net change in unrealized gain on available for sale securities of  offset by the payment of common stock dividends of  and the purchase of treasury stock of million 
the following table provides a comparison of the company s and the bank s leverage and risk weighted capital ratios as of december  to the minimum and well capitalized regulatory standards minimum required to be well capitalized under prompt corrective action provisions actual ratio at december  the company leverage ratio n a tier risk based capital ratio n a risk based capital ratio n a the bank leverage ratio tier risk based capital ratio risk based capital ratio the federal reserve may require the company to maintain a leverage ratio above the required minimum 
the fdic may require the bank to maintain a leverage ratio above the required minimum 
at december   the company s capital ratios exceeded the minimums required by regulatory guidelines 
the company intends to maintain an optimal capital and leverage mix 
liquidity involves the company s ability to raise funds to support asset growth or reduce assets to meet deposit withdrawals and other payment obligations  to maintain reserve requirements and otherwise to operate the company on an ongoing basis 
the company s liquidity needs are met primarily by financing activities  which consisted mainly of growth in core deposits  supplemented by investment securities and earnings through operating activities 
access to purchased funds from correspondent banks is available and has been utilized on occasion to take advantage of investment opportunities 
the cash and federal funds sold position  supplemented by amortizing investments along with payments and maturities within the loan portfolio  have historically created an adequate liquidity position 
the company s liquidity management objective is to meet maturing debt obligations  fund loan commitments and deposit withdrawals  and manage operations on a cost effective basis 
management believes that sufficient resources are available to meet the company s liquidity objective through its debt maturity structure  holdings of liquid assets  and access to the capital markets through a variety of funding vehicles 
proper liquidity management is crucial to ensure that the company is able to take advantage of new business opportunities as well as meet the demands of its customers 
the bank s traditional funding sources consist primarily of core deposits  established federal funds and other borrowing lines with major banks  proceeds from matured investments  contracts to repurchase investment securities and principal and interest repayments on loans 
management is not aware of any events that are reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on the company s liquidity  capital resources or operations 
in addition  management is not aware of any regulatory recommendations regarding liquidity  which if implemented  would have a material adverse effect on the company 
industry segments the principal business of the company is overseeing the business of the bank 
the company has no significant assets other than its investment in the bank  therefore  the banking operation is the company s only reportable segment

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company s asset liability and funds management policy provides management with the necessary guidelines for effective funds management  and the company has established a measurement system for monitoring its net interest rate sensitivity position 
the company manages its sensitivity position within established guidelines 
interest rate risk is managed by the asset liability committee alco  which is composed of senior officers of the company  in accordance with policies approved by the company s board of directors 
the alco formulates strategies based on appropriate levels in interest rate risk 
in determining the appropriate level of interest rate risk  the alco considers the impact on earnings and capital based on the current outlook on interest rates  potential changes in interest rates  regional economies  liquidity  business strategies  and other factors 
the alco meets regularly to review  among other things  the sensitivity of assets and liabilities to interest rate changes  the book and market values of assets and liabilities  unrealized gains and losses  purchase and sale activity  commitments to originate loans  and the maturities of investments and borrowings 
additionally  the alco reviews liquidity  cash flow flexibility  maturities of deposits and consumer and commercial deposit activity 
management uses two methodologies to manage interest rate risk i an analysis of relationships between interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities  and ii interest rate shock simulation models 
the company has traditionally managed its business to reduce its overall exposure to changes in interest rates  however  under current policies of the company s board of directors  management has been given some latitude to increase the company s interest rate sensitivity position within certain limits if  in management s judgment  it will enhance profitability 
as a result  changes in market interest rates may have a greater impact on the company s financial performance in the future than they have had historically 
to effectively measure and manage interest rate risk  the company uses interest rate shock simulation models to determine the impact on net interest income under various interest rate scenarios  balance sheet trends and strategies 
from these simulations  interest rate risk is quantified and appropriate strategies are developed and implemented 
additionally  duration and market value sensitivity measures are utilized when they provide added value to the overall interest rate risk management process 
the overall interest rate risk position and strategies are reviewed by the company s board of directors on an ongoing basis 
the company manages its exposure to interest rates by structuring its balance sheet in the ordinary course of business 
the company does not currently enter into instruments such as leveraged derivatives  structured notes  interest rate swaps  caps  floors  financial options  financial futures contracts or forward delivery contracts for the purpose of reducing interest rate risk 
the impact on future net earnings based on interest sensitive assets and liabilities held at december  using the interest rate shock simulation is as follows change in interest rates net earnings change in net earnings base  an interest rate sensitive asset or liability is one that  within a defined time period  either matures or experiences an interest rate change in line with general market interest rates 
the management of interest rate risk is performed by analyzing the maturity and repricing relationships between interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities at specific points in time gap and by analyzing the effects of interest rate changes on net interest income over specific periods of time by projecting the performance of the mix of assets and liabilities in varied interest rate environments 
interest rate sensitivity reflects the potential effect on net interest income of a movement in interest rates 
a company is considered to be asset sensitive  or having a positive gap  when the amount of its interest earning assets maturing or repricing within a given period exceeds the amount of its interest bearing liabilities also maturing or repricing within that time period 
conversely  a company is considered to be liability sensitive  or having a negative gap  when the amount of its interest bearing liabilities maturing or repricing within a given period exceeds the amount of its interest earning assets also maturing or repricing within that time period 
during a period of rising interest rates  a negative gap would tend to affect net interest income adversely  while a positive gap would tend to result in an increase in net interest income 
during a period of falling interest rates  a negative gap would tend to result in an increase in net interest income  while a positive gap would tend to affect net interest income adversely 
however  it is management s intent to achieve a proper balance so that incorrect rate forecasts should not have a significant impact on earnings 
the following table sets forth an interest rate sensitivity analysis for the company at december  volumes subject to repricing within days days days years years greater than years total dollars in thousands interest earning assets securities     loans       federal funds sold   total interest earning assets    interest bearing liabilities now  money market and savings deposits  certificates of deposit and other time deposits     borrowed funds     long term debt   total interest bearing liabilities     period gap       cumulative gap      period gap to total assets cumulative gap to total assets cumulative interest earning assets to cumulative interest bearing liabilities the company s one year cumulative gap position at december   was negative million or of assets 
this is a one day position that is continually changing and is not indicative of the company s position at any other time 
while the gap position is a useful tool in measuring interest rate risk and contributes toward effective asset and liability management  it is difficult to predict the effect of changing interest rates solely on that measure  without accounting for alterations in the maturity or repricing characteristics of the balance sheet that occur during changes in market interest rates 
for example  the gap position reflects only the prepayment assumptions pertaining to the current rate environment 
assets tend to prepay more rapidly during periods of declining interest rates than during periods of rising interest rates 
because of this and other risk factors not contemplated by the gap position  an institution could have a matched gap position in the current rate environment and still have its net interest income exposed to increased rate risk 
to better qualify and account for the variables not incorporated into gap analysis  the company utilizes an interest rate simulation model as discussed previously 
the company maintains a rate committee and the alco that reviews the company s interest rate risk position on a weekly or monthly basis  respectively
