item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
critical accounting policies the accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the accounting policies discussed below are considered by management to be critical to an understanding of our financial statements because their application requires significant judgment and reliance on estimations of matters that are inherently uncertain 
specific risks related to these critical accounting policies are described in the following paragraphs 
revenue recognition  accounts receivable and allowances for doubtful accounts our revenues are derived primarily from providing long term healthcare services 
approximately of our current net operating revenues is derived from funds provided under federal and state medical assistance programs 
as discussed more fully in item note  we record our revenues at standard charges when services are provided  adjusted to amounts estimated to be received under governmental programs or other third party contractual arrangements 
these revenues are subject to audit and retroactive adjustment by governmental and third party agencies 
due to the complexity of the laws and regulations governing the federal and state medical assistance programs  there is at least a possibility that recorded estimates may change by a material amount in the near term 
consistent with health care industry accounting practices  changes to these third party revenue estimates are recorded in the year the change or adjustment becomes known 
we record bad debt expense monthly using a percentage of revenue approach that reflects our historical experience 
each quarter we adjust the reserves for bad debts according to the aging of the receivables 
these adjustments are based on our weighted average experience by payor type  and recognize the relative risk depending on the source of the payment 
private pay accounts usually represent our highest collectibility risk 
in addition  specific accounts that are determined to be uncollectible due to bankruptcy  insufficient documentation  lack of third party coverage or financial resources and the like are fully reserved when such determinations are made 
if circumstances change including  but not limited to economic downturn  higher than expected defaults or denials  reduced collections  and changes in our payor mix  our estimates of the recoverability of our receivables could be reduced by a material amount 
our provision for bad debts represented  and of net operating revenues in  and  respectively 
our allowance for doubtful accounts represented and of patient accounts receivable at december  and  respectively 
insurance and patient liability risks general and professional liability costs for the long term care industry have become increasingly expensive and difficult to estimate 
in addition  insurance coverage for patient care liability and other risks  for nursing facilities specifically and companies in general  has become increasingly difficult to obtain 
when obtained  insurance carriers are often requiring companies to significantly increase their liability retention levels and or pay substantially higher premiums for reduced coverage 
the company s retained liabilities have increased in recent years 
we have purchased insurance for property  casualty and other risks from numerous insurance companies 
in many cases  the policies provide coverage for events occurring in specific time frames that may only be determined in later years 
we exercise care in selecting companies from which we purchase insurance including review of published ratings by recognized rating agencies  advice from national brokers and consultants  and review of trade information sources 
there exists a risk that any of these insurance companies may become insolvent and unable to fulfill its obligation to defend  pay or reimburse us when that obligation becomes due 
although we believe the companies we have purchased insurance from are solvent  in light of the dramatic changes occurring in the insurance industry in recent years  we cannot be assured that they will remain solvent and able to fulfill their obligations 

table of contents as described more fully in item note  we believe adequate provision has been made in the financial statements for liabilities that may arise out of patient care and other services 
these provisions are made based primarily upon the results of independent actuarial valuations  prepared by actuaries with long term care industry experience 
this provision also includes accruals for insurance premiums for the coverage period and our estimate of any experience adjustments to premiums 
the actuarial valuations are prepared twice a year using the most recent trends of claims  settlements and other relevant data 
the majority of our auto liability and workers compensation risks are insured through loss sensitive insurance policies with affiliated and unaffiliated insurance companies 
for our general and professional liabilities  we are responsible for the first dollar of each claim  up to a self insurance limit determined by the individual policies  subject to aggregate limits in certain prior policy years 
the company s retained liabilities are estimated by our independent actuaries 
on an undiscounted basis  these liabilities totaled approximately million at december  on our financial statements  these liabilities are discounted at to their present value using expected loss payment timing patterns 
the discount rate is based upon our best estimate of the incremental borrowing rate that would be required to fund these liabilities with uncollateralized debt 
a reduction in the discount rate by one half of a percentage point would have resulted in an additional pre tax charge for of million 
our independent actuaries estimate our range of discounted exposure for these liabilities to be million to million 
our recorded reserves for these liabilities totaled million at december  off balance sheet obligations we have two off balance sheet financing arrangements which totaled approximately million at december   including million of medium term notes due march the medium term notes  and million under an off balance sheet lease arrangement expiring in april the medium term notes are obligations of a non consolidated bankruptcy remote  qualifying special purpose entity  beverly funding corporation bfc 
bfc s sole purpose is to acquire  own  hold  and otherwise administer certain patient accounts receivable originated and sold to it by certain of the company s operating subsidiaries and to issue beneficial interests in those receivables 
under the terms of the arrangement  certain wholly owned operating subsidiaries of the company groups of nursing facilities within each state that the company operates  referred to as the selling subsidiaries  which are separate legal entities  sell medicaid and veterans administration patient accounts receivable at their net realizable value to beverly health and rehabilitation services  inc bhrs  a wholly owned operating subsidiary of the company 
bfc then purchases these receivables under a revolving sales structure from bhrs at a discount of 
bfc receives its funding from the issuance of debt to third party investors  and investments made in bfc by beverly enterprises  inc the parent company and a non transferor 
at december  and  bfc had approximately million and million  respectively  of net receivables 
the medium term notes were issued in june and july to third party investors 
the proceeds were used to redeem million of then outstanding medium term notes issued by bfc in that were nearing maturity and to purchase additional eligible receivables from bhrs 
beverly enterprises  inc also increased its investment in bfc allowing bfc to purchase additional eligible receivables to serve as excess collateral for the new medium term notes 
under the terms of the arrangement  bfc is required to maintain receivables in excess of the outstanding balance of the medium term notes based on a calculated formula included in the master sales and servicing agreement 
the medium term notes mature in  however  according to the provisions of the notes  principal payments on these obligations  calculated based on quarterly collections of the underlying receivables  begin during the second quarter of based on current collection trends  it is expected that these obligations will be paid off by the third quarter of bhrs recognizes a loss at the time the receivables are sold to bfc equal to the discount and this loss is included in other operating and administrative costs and expenses and in net cash provided by 
table of contents operating activities in our consolidated financial statements 
bhrs provides invoicing and collection services related to the purchased receivables for a market based servicing fee 
neither the loss on sale of receivables nor the servicing fee revenue is material to the company s results of operations or cash flows 
prior to june  bfc s assets  liabilities and operating results were consolidated with the company 
however  in june in connection with the redemption of previously issued medium term notes  and issuance of the medium term notes in june and july  the master sale and servicing agreement was amended so that bfc met the definition of a qualifying special purpose entity as defined in statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for transfers and servicing of financial assets and extinguishments of liabilities sfas no 

specifically  bfc was no longer permitted to hold or purchase receivables that originated prior to january  a condition that prevented it from becoming a qualifying special purpose entity prior to june 
the company continually evaluates the organizational structure and operations of bfc to ensure that it remains legally isolated from the company and each of its operating subsidiaries and that it maintains its status as a qualifying special purpose entity and  thereby  remains deconsolidated 
the company s investment in bfc has been recorded as a non current asset in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets  which is subject to periodic collectibility review 
the primary factor in the collectibility review is the determination of the net realizable value of the excess receivables serving as collateral for the medium term notes 
the net realizable value is determined through a collectibility analysis of the receivables purchased and held by bfc 
this collectibility analysis considers historical collection experience and is adjusted according to the aging of the receivables 
once the net realizable value of the excess receivables is determined  we compare it to the carrying value of the asset and adjust the asset downward when the analysis indicates that it will not be recovered 
at december  and  the company s investment of approximately million and million  respectively  was included in other assets on the consolidated balance sheets 
at december  and  bfc had excess receivables of approximately million and million  respectively 
our total investments in bfc have been adjusted from their initial value of million due to cumulative credit losses incurred by bfc associated with the purchased receivables since june we believe our asset will be realized upon the maturity and repayment of the medium term notes and collection of the excess receivables and is expected to approximate the company s recorded asset 
at december   the company leased five nursing facilities  one assisted living center and its corporate headquarters under an off balance sheet lease arrangement 
the special purpose entity lessor financed the construction of these properties and we lease the properties under a master operating lease agreement  which matures in april see item note for a discussion of the amendments and their impact on this financing arrangement 
there is a third party entity at risk under this arrangement for of the original commitment 
of the remaining original commitment  is secured by first mortgages on the related properties and or approximately million at december  is guaranteed by the company and secured by second mortgages on the related properties 
we monitor these off balance sheet obligations throughout the year and believe the obligations and any related assets should not be included in our consolidated financial statements under current generally accepted accounting principles 
in january  the financial accounting standards board issued fasb interpretation no 
 consolidation of variable interest entities fin  which is effective for us in the third quarter of under this interpretation  we do not currently anticipate that our accounting for bfc will be affected 
however  based on our initial evaluation of fin  it is possible that the special purpose entity lessor in the lease arrangement may need to be consolidated with the company beginning in the third quarter of we are continuing to evaluate the consolidation and transition rules under fin  however  if the special purpose entity lessor needs to be consolidated  the leased assets will be consolidated at their depreciated cost and recorded as capital leased assets  with the difference between the historical and the depreciated cost on the date of consolidation being recorded as the cumulative effect of an accounting change 
the remaining obligation as of july  million as of december  and expected to be million as of july  would be recorded as a capital lease obligation on the company s 
table of contents consolidated balance sheet 
if consolidated under fin  we will continue to make quarterly payments under the obligation  to be recorded as interest expense  and the capital leased assets will be depreciated  increasing our annual depreciation and amortization expense by approximately million 
under the terms of the lease arrangement  we have the option to purchase the leased assets and prepay the obligation 
in addition  we have off balance sheet debt guarantees of approximately million that primarily arose from our sale of nursing facilities 
we also guarantee certain third party operating leases 
those guarantees arose from our dispositions of leased facilities and the underlying leases have approximately million of minimum rental commitments remaining through the initial lease terms 
in addition  we guarantee an officer s bank loan of approximately  which is collateralized by shares of our common stock pledged by the officer 
see item note for a more complete description of each of these items 
each of these guarantees will be subject to fasb interpretation no 
 guarantor s accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees including indirect guarantees of indebtedness of others fin  issued in november see new accounting standards below 
asset impairments we recorded pre tax asset impairment charges of million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
we also recorded additional impairments of goodwill of million in as the cumulative effect of an accounting change 
we evaluate our long lived assets for impairment whenever indicators of impairment exist  in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets sfas no 

these indicators of impairment can include  but are not limited to  the following a history of operating losses  with expected future losses  changes in the regulatory environment affecting reimbursement  decrease in cash flows or cash flow deficiencies  changes in the way an asset is used in the business  and commitment to a plan to sell or otherwise dispose of an asset 
during  changes in the regulatory environment affecting medicare reimbursement led to a long lived asset impairment analysis on our nursing facilities segment 
during  continuing operating losses in several of our lines of business  including certain matrix clinics  our managed care contracting entity  certain home care businesses and a few of our nursing facilities  led to impairment analyses on these assets 
during  operating losses at certain matrix clinics and management s determination to dispose of  or terminate the leases on  six nursing facilities led to impairment analyses to be calculated on these assets 
these impairment analyses included estimating the undiscounted cash flows to be generated by each clinic  unit  facility or property  primarily over the remaining life of the primary asset  and reducing the carrying value of the asset to the estimated fair value when the total estimated undiscounted cash flows was less than the current book value of the clinic  unit  facility or property 
in estimating the undiscounted cash flows for our nursing facilities  we primarily used our internally prepared budgets and forecast information  with certain probability adjustments  including  but not limited to  the following items medicare and medicaid funding  overhead costs  capital expenditures  and patient care liability costs 
in order to estimate the fair values of the nursing facilities  we used a discounted cash flow approach  supplemented by public resource information on valuations of nursing facility sales transactions  by region of the country 
where the estimated undiscounted cash flows were negative  we estimated the fair values based on discounted public resource information  sales values or estimated salvage value 
for other lines of business that lack significant property investments  we discounted the next five years of expected cash flows 
a substantial change in the estimated future cash flows for these facilities or businesses could materially change the estimated fair values of these assets  possibly resulting in an additional impairment 

table of contents in july  statement of financial accounting standards no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets sfas no 
was issued  which established new rules on the accounting for goodwill and other intangible assets 
in accordance with this standard  we performed the initial screening for potential impairments of our indefinite lived intangible assets by reporting unit as of january  we determined the estimated fair values of each reporting unit using discounted cash flow analyses  along with independent source data related to recent transactions 
based on this determination  we identified potential goodwill impairments at our matrix segment and at care focus  a reporting unit within our home care segment 
we engaged a qualified  independent valuation group to determine the estimated fair values of each of these reporting units 
their analysis was completed in the fourth quarter of  and led to the recording of goodwill impairment charges as the cumulative effect of an accounting change of million as of january   including million for matrix and million for care focus 
based on our annual october  assessment of all reporting units  no additional impairment of goodwill was required 
during  management initiated a formal plan to dispose of all of our nursing facility operations in florida 
accordingly  these assets were written down to their estimated sales value less selling costs 
we ultimately leased these assets to a third party in the fourth quarter of  with the real estate transaction closing in january see item note for a more detailed discussion of this transaction  including related exit and other costs  and other impairments we have recorded 
under accounting standards in effect in  our florida assets were not considered discontinued operations 
operating results compared to results of operations continuing operations we reported a net loss from continuing operations for the year ended december  of million  compared to a net loss from continuing operations of million for the year ended december  the net loss from continuing operations for included pre tax charges totaling approximately million  including million for asset impairments  workforce reductions and other unusual items  million for the florida insurance reserve adjustment  million for the california investigation settlement and related costs  and partially offset by a million adjustment to reduce estimated reserves no longer needed  related to settlements of federal government investigations 
the million for asset impairments  workforce reductions and other unusual items includes the following million write down of property and equipment on certain nursing facilities whose book value exceeded fair value when tested for impairment as a result of the reduction in medicare funding effective october  these assets were included in the total assets of the nursing facilities operating segment in  million of workforce reductions see below  and million adjustment to asset impairments and  reversal of workforce reduction charges recorded in  which were no longer needed 
we recorded a pre tax charge of million during for workforce reductions which were primarily the result of a continuing operational reorganization required to support the implementation of our three year strategic plan 
during  we notified associates that their positions would be eliminated 
the charge included the following million of cash expenses  approximately million of which was paid during the year ended december   and 
table of contents non cash expenses of  related to the issuance of  shares under our stock grant plan as defined herein 
we estimate the annual cost savings of this operational reorganization to be approximately million 
the following table summarizes activity in our estimated workforce reduction and exit costs for the years ended december in thousands workforce exit workforce exit workforce exit reductions costs reductions costs reductions costs balance beginning of year charged to operations cash payments stock transactions reversals balance end of year net loss from continuing operations for included pre tax charges totaling approximately million primarily for asset impairments  exit costs and workforce reductions 
see compared to results of operations 
income taxes we recorded a provision for income taxes of approximately million for the year ended december   primarily related to state income taxes 
we increased our valuation allowance on our deferred tax assets by million during to million as of december  this valuation allowance is required under the guidance of sfas no 
due to our historical operating performance and our reported cumulative net losses 
our realization of the deferred tax benefits primarily associated with our net operating losses is dependent upon our achieving sufficient future pre tax income 
under federal income tax regulations  we have up to years to generate sufficient taxable income to realize the deferred benefits 
however  given the size of our pre tax losses in and and uncertainties created by medicare reimbursement enhancements which expired on september   a valuation allowance is considered to be appropriate under the more stringent accounting standards for the realization of these deferred tax benefits  which is contingent upon future income 
at december   for income tax purposes  we had federal net operating loss carryforwards of million which expire in years through  general business tax credit carryforwards of million which expire in years through  and alternative minimum tax credit carryforwards of million which do not expire 
future tax benefits associated with these carryforwards are not recorded in our and consolidated financial statements as a result of the valuation allowance recorded 
net operating revenues we reported net operating revenues of  million during the year ended december  compared to  million for the same period in approximately and of our total net operating revenues for each of the years ended december  and  respectively  were derived from services provided by our nursing facilities segment 
the decrease in net operating revenues of approximately million for the year ended december   as compared to the same period in  is due to the following a decrease of million due to dispositions  primarily related to our florida facilities  an increase of approximately million from facilities we operated during each of the years ended december  and same facility operations  
table of contents an increase of million from growth in aegis external therapy business  and an increase of million due to a facility acquisition  and the opening of a newly constructed facility and four hospice centers 
the increase in net operating revenues of approximately million from same facility operations for the year ended december   as compared to the same period in  was primarily due to the following million due to an increase in medicaid  medicare and private payment rates  million due to a positive shift in our patient mix  million due to an increase in medicare part b revenues  and partially offset by a decrease of million due to a decline in same facility census 
effective october   certain medicare add on payments were eliminated when the federal government failed to pass legislation to restore the funding 
these add on payments included a add on to the nursing component of all resource utilization grouping rug categories and a overall increase in the adjusted rates for all rug categories 
our net operating revenues were reduced by approximately million as a result of the elimination of these add ons in the fourth quarter of this reduction is netted above with the increases in payment rates from all sources of revenue for over assuming a similar volume and mix of medicare patients in  we anticipate our net operating revenues will decline an additional million from  for an annual impact of million 
additional medicare add on payments  currently approximating million of our annual net operating revenues  are scheduled to expire when cms releases refinements to the current rug payment system 
we cannot currently predict when this will happen  or the ultimate impact it will have on our operating results or cash flows 
in addition  we currently anticipate that on july   part b therapy caps will go into effect on a prospective basis 
based on the current volume of part b therapy in our nursing homes  the decrease in our annual net operating revenues is anticipated to be approximately million 
our aegis outside therapy contract business will likely be further impacted in terms of revenue and may be required to adjust therapy staffing levels to offset a portion of this revenue impact 
operating and administrative expenses we reported operating and administrative expenses of  million during the year ended december  compared to  million for the same period in the decrease of approximately million consists of the following a decrease of million due to dispositions  primarily related to our florida facilities  an increase of million due to a facility acquisition  and the opening of a newly constructed facility and four hospice centers  and an increase of approximately million in same facility operations 
the increase in operating and administrative expenses of approximately million from same facility operations for the year ended december   as compared to the same period in  was due primarily to the following million of additional wages and related expenses primarily due to an increase in our weighted average wage rate and an increase in nursing hours per patient day  million additional provision for reserves on accounts and notes receivable  million due to an increase in contracted services  primarily due to outsourcing certain housekeeping  laundry and dietary services in our nursing facilities segment  and million increase in our provision for insurance and related claims  as discussed below 

table of contents our provision for insurance and related items increased approximately million for the year ended december   as compared to the same period in  primarily due to rising patient care liability costs 
based on the results of our mid year actuarial study completed in mid july  we recorded a pre tax charge of million to increase our reserves for prior policy year patient care liability costs  including million related to our previously operated florida facilities  which have been sold  and million related to same facility operations 
we believe that adequate provision has been made in the financial statements for liabilities that may arise out of patient care services 
these provisions are made based upon the results of independent actuarial valuations and other information available  including management s best judgments and estimates 
our most recent actuarial study indicated our reserves were adequate 
however  the provision and liability have been difficult to estimate and have been escalating in recent periods 
there can be no assurance that the provision and the resulting reserves will not require material adjustment in future periods 
interest expense  net interest income increased to million for the year ended december   as compared to million for the same period in primarily due to certain notes receivable accepted as partial consideration for the sale of the florida facilities 
interest expense decreased to million for the year ended december   as compared to million for the same period in this was primarily due to the reduction of debt using the net proceeds from the sale of the florida facilities 
depreciation and amortization depreciation and amortization expense was million for the year ended december   as compared to million for the same period in depreciation and amortization decreased approximately million due to the elimination of amortization on goodwill and other indefinite lived intangibles with the implementation of sfas no 
 and the dispositions of  or lease terminations on  certain facilities 
however  these decreases were substantially offset by increases of million related to capital additions and improvements as well as acquisitions and openings 
discontinued operations in accordance with the provisions of sfas no 
 the results of operations of matrix and mk medical have been reclassified and reported  for all periods presented  as discontinued operations in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations 
following is a summary of the discontinued operations of matrix and mk medical for the years ended december in thousands matrix mk medical total matrix mk medical total matrix mk medical total net operating revenues operating income loss exit costs asset impairments workforce reductions and other unusual items pre tax income loss provision for benefit from income taxes discontinued operations  net of taxes includes an adjustment of million in for estimated overpayments to mk medical by government payors 
see item note includes million accrued for legal and related fees associated with the mk medical estimated overpayment issue 

table of contents cumulative effect of accounting change in july  the financial accounting standards board issued sfas no 
 which established new rules on the accounting for goodwill and other intangible assets 
under sfas no 
 goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives are no longer amortized  however  they are subject to annual impairment tests as prescribed by the statement 
intangible assets with definite lives will continue to be amortized over their estimated useful lives 
with respect to our goodwill and intangible assets  sfas no 
was effective for us beginning january  following is a summary of adjusted operating results reflecting the effects of adopting sfas no 
 net of income taxes  for the periods ended december in thousands  except per share amounts years ended december  reported net loss add back goodwill amortization operating rights amortization adjusted net loss years ended december  reported diluted net loss per share add back goodwill amortization operating rights amortization adjusted diluted net loss per share we completed the impairment assessment of our indefinite lived intangible assets  other than goodwill  during the first quarter of  with no impairment identified 
sfas no 
described a two step process for testing goodwill for impairment 
the first step is a screen for potential impairment  while the second step measures the amount of the impairment  if any 
upon completion of the first step of the goodwill impairment test for all reporting units of the company  results indicated that goodwill appeared to be impaired for our matrix and home care services care focus reporting units 
we subjected the goodwill at these reporting units to step two under sfas no 
we engaged a qualified  independent third party to determine the estimated fair value of these two reporting units 
their valuation was completed during the fourth quarter of  and the resulting impairment losses amounted to approximately million for matrix and million for home care services care focus 
as required by sfas no 
 these impairment losses have been recorded in the accompanying statement of operations as the cumulative effect of a change in accounting for goodwill as of january  in accordance with sfas no 
 we completed our annual impairment assessment of all of our indefinite lived intangible assets  including goodwill  as of october  with no additional impairment required 
new accounting standards in january  the fasb issued interpretation no 
 consolidation of variable interest entities  fin 
fin requires a variable interest entity vie  sometimes known as a special purpose entity  to be consolidated by a company when that company is subject to a majority of the risk of loss from the vie s activities or entitled to receive a majority of the vie s residual returns  or both 
fin is effective on july  as it relates to vies created prior to february  based on our initial evaluation of fin  
table of contents it is possible that the special purpose entity lessor in the lease arrangement may need to be consolidated with the company beginning in the third quarter of we are continuing to evaluate the consolidation and transition rules under fin  however if the special purpose entity lessor needs to be consolidated  the leased assets will be consolidated at their depreciated cost and recorded as capital leased assets  with the difference between the historical and the depreciated cost on the date of consolidation being recorded as the cumulative effect of an accounting change 
the remaining obligation as of july  million as of december  and expected to be million as of july  would be recorded as a capital lease obligation on the company s consolidated balance sheet 
the assets would be depreciated and payments on the obligations would be recorded as interest expense until the obligations are satisfied 
fin is not expected to impact our accounting treatment of bfc 
see off balance sheet obligations herein 
in november  the fasb issued interpretation no 
 guarantor s accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees  including indirect guarantees of indebtedness of others fin 
fin requires certain guarantees to be recorded at fair value when a transaction is consummated 
this differs from current practice  which is generally to record a liability only when a loss is probable and reasonably estimable 
fin applies to guarantee contracts having financial guarantees  performance guarantees  indemnification or indirect guarantees of the indebtedness of others 
fin also requires a guarantor to make significant new disclosures  even when the likelihood of making any payments under the guarantee is remote 
we have complied with the new disclosure requirements  which are effective for us as of december  the recognition and measurement provisions of fin are applicable on a prospective basis to guarantees issued or modified after december  we are continuing our review of the implications of fin  which may impact our accounting for future dispositions 
in july  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities sfas no 

sfas no 
requires that a liability for a cost associated with an exit or disposal activity be recognized and measured at its fair value when the liability is incurred rather than when an entity commits to an exit plan 
depending on the terms of the exit or disposal  under sfas no 
 severance pay could be recognized over time or up front 
also  sfas no 
requires that a liability be recognized  measured at its fair value  when an entity ceases operation at a location covered under a pre existing contract  such as a lease 
fair value in this case would represent the present value of the future payment obligations net of assumed receipts  such as sublease income  at current market value 
sfas no 
is effective for all exit or disposal activities initiated after december  many of the provisions of sfas no 
affect only the timing of when a liability is recorded and not the amount of the liability 
therefore  we do not expect there will be a material effect on our consolidated financial position or results of operations as a result of adopting sfas no 
in april  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 rescission of fasb statements no 
  and  amendment of fasb statement no 
 and technical corrections sfas no 

this statement eliminates extraordinary accounting treatment for reporting gains or losses on debt extinguishments  and amends certain other existing accounting pronouncements 
the provisions of this statement are effective for the company beginning with the first quarter of with restatement of prior year debt extinguishment related extraordinary items required 
compared to results of operations continuing operations we reported a net loss from continuing operations for the year ended december  of million  compared to a net loss from continuing operations of million for the year ended december  net loss from continuing operations for included pre tax charges totaling approximately million  primarily including million for asset impairments  exit and other costs and million for workforce reductions and related costs 
these pre tax charges have been included in the 
table of contents consolidated statement of operations caption asset impairments  workforce reductions and other unusual items 
the asset impairment and exit costs relate to million write down of florida facilities and million of florida exit and other costs  as discussed below 
these assets were included in the total assets of the nursing facilities segment as of december  write down of goodwill of million  property  equipment and other intangible assets of million and recording of closing and other costs of million on under performing home care businesses 
these assets were included in the total assets of the home care segment as of december  write down of property and equipment of million  and goodwill and other intangibles of  on certain under performing nursing facilities 
these assets were included in the total assets of the nursing facilities operating segment as of december   write off of abandoned projects and investments totaling million  and million related to the termination of a lease in indiana and the write off of the net book value of the related assets 
during  a formal plan was initiated by management to pursue the sale of our nursing home operations in florida  which included nursing facilities  beds and four assisted living centers units the florida facilities 
the plan included the pursuit of the sale of one additional nursing facility beds in florida and certain other assets which would be sold in separate transactions 
the decision to sell these properties was made primarily due to the excessive patient care liability costs that we had been incurring in the state of florida 
accordingly  the property and equipment  identifiable intangibles and operating supplies of our florida nursing home operations at march  were considered assets held for sale 
management estimated the fair value less selling costs of such assets and took pre tax charges in totaling million to write down the florida assets 
effective december   we entered into a lease agreement on the florida facilities with florida health care properties and we closed the real estate transaction on january  in conjunction with the sale of the florida facilities  we also recorded pre tax charges totaling million for certain exit and other costs 
these costs related to severance agreements  termination payments on certain contracts and various other items 
at december   the florida assets held for sale totaled approximately million and were classified as current assets in the consolidated balance sheet 
annualized revenues for the florida facilities were approximately million 
during the year ended december   our florida nursing home operations recorded pre tax income of approximately  this amount does not include certain costs which were recorded at the parent company level and were not fully allocated to the individual subsidiaries or facilities 
we did not record depreciation and amortization expense on the florida assets during the period these assets were held for sale  since these assets were adjusted to their estimated net realizable value 
the amount of depreciation and amortization expense that we did not have to record during the year ended december  on the florida assets was approximately million 
during  we recorded pre tax charges totaling approximately million for workforce reductions and related costs 
approximately million of these pre tax charges related to severance and other employment agreements for approximately associates who were notified in that their positions would be eliminated  including million of cash expenses  approximately million and million of which was paid during the years ended december  and  respectively  non cash expenses of million related to the issuance of shares under our stock grant plan  and non cash expenses of  related to other long term incentive agreements 
we estimated the annual costs savings of this operational reorganization to be approximately million 
much of this savings was realized in  since the majority of the workforce reductions took place in 
table of contents the first quarter 
these estimated savings are net of the additional costs we incurred to increase the operations and clinical staff at the facility and district level 
approximately  of these workforce reduction charges in were reversed during in january  we filed a registration statement under form s with the securities and exchange commission registering  shares of our common stock 
these shares were previously repurchased by the company and held in treasury 
they will be issued under the beverly enterprises  inc stock grant plan the stock grant plan to holders of restricted stock who  by virtue of the terms of their employment contracts  severance agreements or other similar arrangements  are entitled to the immediate vesting of their restricted stock 
 shares of common stock under the stock grant plan have been issued in and to various officers in exchange for shares of restricted stock held by them  which have been cancelled 
on february   we made a settlement offer to the federal government to resolve open reimbursement issues under the former cost reimbursement system for medicare 
for accounting purposes  this settlement offer was required to be recorded in our operating results for the year ended december  and resulted in a pre tax charge of approximately million which is included in the caption special charges and adjustments related to settlements with the federal government 
this charge included a million cash settlement and the write off of million of related cost report receivables  offset by a million reserve established in for related issues 
this matter was settled with cms in the fourth quarter of  and required no increase in accruals previously recorded 
income taxes we recorded a provision for income taxes at for the year ended december   even though we had a pre tax loss  primarily due to the recording of a million valuation allowance on our deferred tax assets 
this valuation allowance was required under the guidance of sfas no

the amendments were required because recording the special charges  as discussed in item note  would have resulted in our noncompliance with a financial covenant ratio contained in those debt agreements
