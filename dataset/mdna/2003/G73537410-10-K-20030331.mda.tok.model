item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview scottish annuity life is a holding company organized under the laws of the cayman islands with its principal executive office in bermuda 
we are a reinsurer of life insurance  annuities and annuity type products 
these products are written by life insurance companies and other financial institutions located principally in the united states  as well as around the world 
we refer to this portion of our business as life reinsurance north america 
on december   we completed the purchase of world wide holdings limited and its subsidiary world wide reassurance company limited 
world wide reassurance specializes in niche markets in developed countries and broader life insurance markets in the developing world 
we refer to this portion of our business as life reinsurance international 
life reinsurance north america and life reinsurance international together are a reportable operating segment 
to a lesser extent  we directly issue variable life insurance and variable annuities and similar products to high net worth individuals and families for insurance  investment and estate planning purposes 
we refer to this portion of our business as wealth management  which is another reportable operating segment 
other revenues and expenses not related to life reinsurance or wealth management are reported in the other segment 
revenues we derive revenue from four principal sources premiums from reinsurance assumed on life business  fee income from our variable life insurance and variable annuity products and from financial reinsurance transactions  investment income from our investment portfolio  and realized gains and losses from our investment portfolio 
premiums from reinsurance assumed on life business are included in revenues over the premium paying period of the underlying policies 
when we acquire blocks of in force business  we account for these transactions as purchases  and our results of operations include the net income from these blocks as of their respective dates of acquisition 
reinsurance assumed on annuity business does not generate premium income but generates investment income over time on the assets we receive from the ceding company 
we also earn fees in our financial reinsurance transactions with us insurance company clients 
because some of these transactions do not satisfy the risk transfer rules for reinsurance accounting  the premiums and benefits are not reported in the consolidated statements of income 
a deposit received on a funding agreement also does not generate premium income but does create income to the extent we earn an investment return in excess of our interest payment obligations thereon 
in our wealth management business  when we sell a variable life insurance policy or a variable annuity contract  we charge mortality  expense and distribution risk fees that are based on total assets in each policyholder s separate account 
in the case of variable life insurance policies  we also charge a cost of insurance fee based on the amount necessary to cover the death benefit under the policy 
our investment income includes interest earned on our fixed income investments and income from funds withheld at interest under modified coinsurance agreements 
under gaap  because our fixed income investments are held as available for sale  these securities are carried at fair value  and unrealized appreciation and depreciation on these securities is not included in investment income on our statements of income  but is included in comprehensive income as a separate component of shareholders equity 
realized gains and losses include gains and losses on investment securities that we sell during a period and write downs of securities deemed to be other than temporarily impaired 
expenses we have five principal types of expenses claims and policy benefits under our reinsurance contracts  interest credited to interest sensitive contract liabilities  acquisition costs and other insurance expenses  operating expenses  and interest expense 
when we issue a life reinsurance contract  we establish reserves for benefits 
these reserves are our estimates of what we expect to pay in claims and policy benefits and related expenses under the contract or policy 
from time to time  we may change the reserves if our experience leads us to believe that benefit claims and expenses will ultimately be greater than the existing reserve 
we report the change in these reserves as an expense during the period when the reserve or additional reserve is established 
in connection with reinsurance of annuity and annuity type products  we record a liability for interest sensitive contract liabilities  which represents the amount ultimately due to the policyholder 
we credit interest to these contracts each period at the rates determined in the underlying contract  and the amount is reported as interest credited to interest sensitive contract liabilities on our consolidated statements of income 
a portion of the costs of acquiring new business  such as commissions  certain internal expenses related to our policy issuance and underwriting departments and some variable selling expenses are capitalized 
the resulting deferred acquisition costs asset is amortized over future periods based on our expectations as to the emergence of future gross profits from the underlying contracts 
these costs are dependent on the structure  size and type of business written 
for certain products  we may retrospectively adjust our amortization when we revise our estimate of current or future gross profits to be realized 
the effects of this adjustment are reflected in earnings in the period in which we revise our estimate 
operating expenses consist of salary and salary related expenses  legal and professional fees  rent and office expenses  travel and entertainment  directors expenses  insurance and other similar expenses  except to the extent capitalized in deferred acquisition costs 
interest expense consists of interest charges on our borrowings 
factors affecting profitability we seek to generate profits from three principal sources 
first  in our life reinsurance business  we seek to receive reinsurance premiums and financial reinsurance fees that  together with income from the assets in which those premiums are invested  exceed the amounts we ultimately pay as claims and policy benefits  acquisition costs and ceding commissions 
second  in our wealth management business  we seek to generate fee income that will exceed the expenses of maintaining and administering our variable life insurance and variable annuity products 
third  within our investment guidelines  we seek to maximize the return on our unallocated capital 
the following factors affect our profitability the volume of business we write  our ability to assess and price adequately for the risks we assume  the mix of different types of business that we reinsure  because profits on some kinds of business emerge later than on other types  our ability to manage our assets and liabilities to manage investment and liquidity risk  the level of fees that we charge on our wealth management contracts  and our ability to control expenses 
in addition  our profits can be affected by a number of factors that are not within our control 
for example  movements in interest rates can affect the volume of business that we write  the income earned from our investments  the interest we credit on interest sensitive contracts  the level of surrender activity on contracts that we reinsure and the rate at which we amortize deferred acquisition costs 
other external factors that can affect profitability include mortality experience that varies from our assumed mortality  changes in regulation or tax laws which may affect the attractiveness of our products or the costs of doing business and changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
critical accounting policies financial accounting standard applies to traditional life policies with continuing premiums 
for these policies  future benefits are estimated using a net level premium method on the basis of actuarial assumptions as to mortality  persistency and interest established at policy issue 
assumptions established at policy issue as to mortality and persistency are based on anticipated experience  which  together with interest and expense assumptions  provide a margin for adverse deviation 
acquisition costs are deferred and recognized as expense in a constant percentage of the gross premiums using these assumptions established at issue 
should the liabilities for future policy benefits plus the present value of expected future gross premiums for a product be insufficient to provide for expected future benefits and expenses for that product  deferred acquisition costs will be written off and thereafter  if required  a premium deficiency reserve will be established by a charge to income 
changes in the assumptions for mortality  persistency and interest could result in material changes to the financial statements 
financial accounting standard applies to investment contracts  limited premium contracts  and universal life type contracts 
for investment and universal life type contracts  future benefit liabilities are held using the retrospective deposit method  increased for amounts representing unearned revenue or refundable policy charges 
acquisition costs are deferred and recognized as expense as a constant percentage of gross margins using assumptions as to mortality  persistency  and expense established at policy issue without provision for adverse deviation and are revised periodically to reflect emerging actual experience and any material changes in expected future experience 
liabilities and the deferral of acquisition costs are established for limited premium policies under the same practices as used for traditional life policies with the exception that any gross premium in excess of the net premium is deferred and recognized into income as a constant percentage of insurance in force 
should the liabilities for future policy benefits plus the present value of expected future gross premiums for a product be insufficient to provide for expected future benefits and expenses for that product  deferred acquisition costs will be written off and thereafter  if required  a premium deficiency reserve will be established by a charge to income 
changes in the assumptions for mortality  persistency  maintenance expense and interest could result in material changes to the financial statements 
the development of policy reserves and amortization of deferred acquisition costs for our products requires management to make estimates and assumptions regarding mortality  lapse  expense and investment experience 
such estimates are primarily based on historical experience and information provided by ceding companies 
actual results could differ materially from those estimates 
management monitors actual experience  and should circumstances warrant  will revise its assumptions and the related reserve estimates 
in  we completed the acquisition of an in force block of business 
the determination of the fair value of the assets acquired and the liabilities assumed required management to make estimates and assumptions regarding mortality  lapse and expenses 
these estimates were based on historical experience  actuarial studies and information provided by the ceding company 
actual results could differ materially from these estimates 
present value of in force business is established upon the acquisition of a subsidiary and is amortized over the expected life of the business at the time of acquisition 
the amortization each year will be a function of the gross profits or revenues each year in relation to the total gross profits or revenues expected over the life of business  discounted at the assumed net credit rate 
the determination of the initial value and the subsequent amortization require management to make estimates and assumptions regarding the future business results that could differ materially from actual results 
estimates and assumptions involved in the present value of in force business and subsequent amortization are similar to those necessary in the establishment of reserves and amortization of deferred acquisition costs 
goodwill is established upon the acquisition of a subsidiary 
goodwill is calculated as the difference between the price paid and the value of individual assets and liabilities on the date of acquisition 
in june  the financial accounting standards board issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  effective for fiscal years beginning after december  under the new rules  goodwill and intangible assets deemed to have indefinite lives are no longer amortized but are subject to annual impairment tests in accordance with the statement 
we applied the new rules on accounting for goodwill during goodwill recognized in the consolidated balance sheet was assigned to reporting units and tested for impairment 
there was no impairment in goodwill recognized on initial adoption 
during the year we finalized the goodwill arising on the acquisition of world wide holdings 
goodwill arising on this acquisition amounts to million in comparison with million at december  the increase has arisen from additional legal  professional and other costs relating to the acquisition and finalization of the deferred tax balance existing at the date of the acquisition 
fixed maturity investments are evaluated for other than temporary impairments in accordance with sfas and eitf as described in note to the consolidated financial statements 
under these pronouncements  realized losses are recognized on securities if the securities are determined to be other than temporarily impaired 
factors involved in the determination of potential impairment include fair value as compared to cost  length of time the value has been below cost  credit worthiness of the issuer  forecasted financial performance of the issuer  position of the security in the issuer s capital structure  the presence and estimated value of collateral or other credit enhancement  length of time to maturity  interest rates and our intent and ability to hold the security until the market value recovers 
our accounting policies addressing reserves  deferred acquisition costs  value of business acquired  goodwill and investment impairment involve significant assumptions  judgments and estimates 
changes in these assumptions  judgments and estimates could create material changes in our consolidated financial statements 
results of operations our results of operations for each of the years ended december  and do not include the results of operations of world wide holdings  which we acquired at the close of business on december  earnings per share year ended december  dollars in thousands  except per share data net income    basic earnings per ordinary share diluted earnings per ordinary share weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding basic    diluted    our net income for the year ended december  increased to million from million in  which was an increase of from million in the increase in is attributable to the inclusion of world wide holdings for the first time since its acquisition  continued growth in our life reinsurance north america operations  and an increase in investment income primarily due to the increase in average invested assets 
the contribution to net income by world wide holdings amounted to million for the year ended december  the increase in net income was offset in part by an increase in realized losses on fixed maturity investments and unit linked securities  and by losses incurred in our wealth management and other segments 
realized losses were million for the year ended december   compared to realized losses of million in the year ended december  the losses in our wealth management operations arose principally from increased commission costs  costs of establishing our luxembourg office and severance payments 
the losses in our other segment arose because of reductions in investment income as we deployed more capital in the life reinsurance north america segment and increased costs in the first full year of our operations in bermuda 
the increase in earnings in is primarily due to increased income from life reinsurance and wealth management operations and an increase in investment income due to the increase in average invested assets  offset in part in by an increase in realized losses on fixed maturity investments 
diluted earnings per share for the year ended december  increased to from in  and increased in from in diluted earnings per share increased as a result of the growth in net income described above 
this increase has occurred despite the increase in the number of ordinary shares outstanding 
the increase in the number of ordinary shares outstanding is a result of shares issued in the acquisition of world wide holdings and the equity offering discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements 
the underlying shares of the convertible debt offering do not increase the number of shares outstanding until the price of our ordinary shares reaches during specified trading periods 
this did not occur in the increase in diluted earnings per share in was due to the increased earnings plus the repurchase of  shares in and  shares in  offset in part by the increase in the dilutive effect of options and warrants 
year ended december  dollars in thousands  except per share data gaap net income    non recurring items realized losses net of deferred acquisition costs non taxable companies   realized losses gains net of deferred acquisition costs taxable companies  provision for taxes taxable companies  cumulative effect of change in accounting principle net operating earnings    net operating earnings is a non gaap measurement 
we determine net operating earnings by adjusting gaap net income for net realized capital gains and losses  as adjusted for the related effects upon the amortization of deferred acquisition costs  and non recurring items that we believe are not indicative of overall operating trends 
non recurring items in the year ended december  include a charge of  relating to severance arrangements with certain employees and in a charge of  due to the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle 
while these items may be significant components in understanding and assessing our consolidated financial performance  we believe the presentation of net operating earnings enhances the understanding of our results of operations by highlighting earnings attributable to the normal  recurring operations of our business 
however  net operating earnings are not a substitute for net income determined in accordance with gaap 
net operating earnings for the year ended december  increased to million from million in the same period in the increase in net operating earnings is primarily attributable to the inclusion of world wide holdings for the first time since its acquisition  continued growth in our life reinsurance north america operations and an increase in investment income primarily due to the increase in average invested assets 
the increases have been offset by increased costs in our wealth management and other segments as described above 
net operating earnings increased to million in from million in revenues during the year ended december  revenues increased by million or to million in comparison with the same period in the increase is primarily due to the acquisition of world wide holdings  the growth in our life reinsurance north america operations and an increase in investment income primarily due to the growth in our invested assets 
the growth in our invested assets is due to the new business and the equity and debt offerings discussed in liquidity and capital resources 
revenues increased by million or to million in from million in the increases are primarily due to growth in our life reinsurance north america operations and an increase in investment income due to the increase in our invested assets resulting from new business  offset in part by an increase in realized losses

premiums earned in increased to million and were from treaties 
premiums earned in of million were from life reinsurance clients 
premiums earned in increased over due to the increase in the number of clients and the increase in business from those clients in our life reinsurance north america operations 
as of december   in our life reinsurance north america operations we reinsured approximately billion of life coverage on million lives 
the average benefit coverage per life is  and our maximum corporate retention on any one life is  as of december   we reinsured approximately billion of life coverage on  lives 
the average benefit coverage per life was  fee income both life reinsurance and wealth management operations generate fee income 
we earn fees in life reinsurance on certain of our financial reinsurance treaties that do not qualify under risk transfer rules for reinsurance accounting 
life reinsurance fees increased by to million during the year ended december  compared to the same period in the increase is due to the growth in the number of clients 
wealth management fees increased by to million during the year ended december  compared to the growth in fees is principally due to the growth in segregated account balances which is due to an increase in the number of clients offset in part by negative investment performance 
wealth management fees increased in by to million from million in the growth has been primarily due to increases in variable account balances on which we earn fees and the increase in the number of clients

investment income net investment income increased by to million during the year ended december  compared to million in the same period in the increase is due to the growth in our average invested assets offset in part by decreases in realized yields in the current year 
our total invested assets have increased significantly because of growth in our life reinsurance north america operations  assets acquired through the acquisition of world wide holdings  investment of the proceeds of our equity offering in april and our convertible debt and capital securities offerings in november total invested assets have increased from billion at december  to billion at december  funds withheld at interest grew from million to billion during during the year ended december   average book yields were lower than in  particularly on floating rate assets and cash 
on the billion portfolio managed by our external investment managers the yields on fixed rate assets were and at december  and  respectively 
the reduction in yield was due primarily to the much lower market yields at which new cash flows were invested and proceeds of maturities and sales were reinvested 
yields on floating rate assets are indexed to libor 
the yield on our floating rate assets decreased to from  and the yield on our cash and cash equivalents decreased to from 
the volume of floating rate assets increased in as a result of our investing the proceeds of a million floating rate funding agreement to earn a spread over the cost of funds 
net investment income increased by million or to million in from million in primarily as a result of an increase in average invested assets 
funds withheld at interest grew from million to million 
since most of this growth occurred in the second half of  its contribution to income was for only part of excluding funds withheld at interest and the world wide holdings portfolio  which was added at december   our general account portfolio declined during this decline resulted from the recapture by a ceding company of million of assets on april   offset in part by the addition of investments funded by new transactions and borrowings 
during  as compared to  average book yields were lower  particularly on floating rate assets and cash 
yields on floating rate assets decreased significantly during on the million portfolio managed by external investment managers  the yields on fixed rate assets were and at december  and  respectively 
between those dates  however  libor decreased to from  causing the yield on floating rate assets to decrease to from and the yield on cash and cash equivalents to decrease to from 
since the floating rate assets were funded by floating rate liabilities  the decrease in yield on floating rate assets had no material effect on earned margins 
the analysis of investment income by segment is as follows year ended december  dollars in thousands life reinsurance north america    international  total life reinsurance    wealth management other    total    other includes investment income on unallocated capital 
realized losses during the year ended december   realized losses amounted to million in comparison with million in realized losses are stated net of associated amortization of deferred acquisition costs 
the losses in consist of realized investment losses on unit linked securities held by world wide holdings of million  impairment losses recognized under eitf of million and other than temporary impairments on fixed maturity investments of million

these losses were partially offset by net realized gains on the sales of fixed maturity investments of million 
during the year ended december  realized losses included amounts recognized as other than temporary impairments on fixed maturity investments of million 
the other than temporary impairments were recognized due to credit deterioration on various securities 
the realization of losses in was due to the sale and write down of carrying values of securities  predominately securities issued by enron and its affiliate  osprey 
these losses were offset in part by gains realized primarily for tax purposes on bonds in the portfolio of scottish re us  inc and gains of  on assets sold to fund part of the recapture of a block of business by one client on april  during  we also recognized in income unrealized losses of million on certain structured securities in accordance with the requirements of eitf see discussion of eitf below 
management reviews securities with material unrealized losses and tests for other than temporary impairments on a quarterly basis 
factors involved in the determination of impairment include fair value as compared to amortized cost  length of time the value has been below amortized cost  credit worthiness of the issuer  forecasted financial performance of the issuer  position of the security in the issuer s capital structure  the presence and estimated value of collateral or other credit enhancement  length of time to maturity  interest rates and our intent and ability to hold the security until the market value recovers 
we review all investments with fair values less than amortized cost  and pay particular attention to those that have traded continuously at less than of amortized cost for at least six months or of amortized cost for at least months and other assets with material differences between amortized cost and fair value 
investments meeting those criteria are analyzed in detail for other than temporary impairment 
when a decline is considered to be other than temporary a realized loss is incurred and the cost basis of the impaired asset is adjusted to its fair value

at december  these securities satisfied the impairment tests of eitf at december  there were securities with fair values that traded continuously at less than of amortized cost for at least six months or of amortized cost for at least months 
the total unrealized loss on these securities amounted to million and the largest unrealized loss position was million 
at december   there were seven securities with fair values that traded continuously at less than of amortized cost for at least six months or of amortized cost for at least months 
the total unrealized loss on these securities amounted to million and the largest unrealized loss position was million 
funds withheld at interest funds withheld at interest arise on contracts written under modified coinsurance agreements 
in each case  the business reinsured consists of fixed deferred annuities 
in substance  these agreements are identical to coinsurance treaties except that the ceding company retains control of and title to the assets 
the deposits paid to the ceding company by the underlying policyholders are held in a segregated portfolio and managed by the ceding company or by investment managers appointed by the ceding company 
these treaties transfer a quota share of the risks 
the funds withheld at interest represent our share of the ceding companies statutory reserves 
the cash flows exchanged with each monthly settlement are netted and include  among other items  our quota share of investment income on our proportionate share of the portfolio  realized losses  realized gains amortized to reflect the statutory rules relating to interest maintenance reserve  interest credited and expense allowances

lincoln national insurance company has financial strength ratings of a from am best  aa from standard poor s  aa from moody s and aa from fitch 
in the event of insolvency of the ceding companies on our modified coinsurance arrangements we would need to exert a claim on the assets supporting the contract liabilities 
however  the risk of loss is mitigated by our ability to offset amounts owed to the ceding company  which are included in interest sensitive contract liabilities  with the amounts owed to us by the ceding company 
interest sensitive contract liabilities relating to the lincoln national insurance company contracts amounted to billion and million at december  and  respectively 
at december   funds withheld at interest totaled billion with an average rating of a  an average effective duration of years and an average book yield of as compared with an average rating of a  an average effective duration of years and an average book yield of at december  these are fixed income investments associated with modified coinsurance transactions  they include marketable securities  commercial mortgages  private placements and cash

in periods of growth of new business our operating cash flow may decrease due to first year commissions paid on new business generated 
for income recognition purposes these commissions are deferred and amortized over the life of the business 
in addition  operating cash flow includes million  million  and million of funds received in connection with the acquisition of blocks of reinsurance during  and  which are not reflected in the consolidated statements of income 
these acquisitions are explained in more detail in note to the consolidated financial statements 
the decrease in operating cash flow from to was primarily due to increases in benefits and expenses paid greater than increases in premiums  fees  and investment income

capital and collateral at december  total capitalization was million compared to million at december  total capitalization includes long term debt and is analyzed as follows december  december  dollars in thousands shareholders equity   long term debt  the million increase in capitalization is due primarily to the net proceeds of the equity offering of million  the net proceeds of the convertible debt and capital securities offerings of million and net income for the year of million less dividends paid of million and increases in comprehensive income 
other comprehensive income consists of the cumulative translation adjustment arising from the translation of world wide holdings balance sheet at exchange rates as of december  and a minimum pension liability adjustment 
at december   total capitalization was million compared to million in the million increase in capitalization at december  is a result of net income for the year of million less dividends paid of million plus the issuance of  ordinary shares with a value of million in respect of the acquisition of world wide holdings on december   less the repurchase of  ordinary shares for a total of million during the year 
pursuant to stock repurchase programs approved by our board of directors  we repurchased  ordinary shares for million in and  ordinary shares for million in since our initial public offering in november  we have repurchased a total of  ordinary shares at a cost of million 
there were no repurchases in the year ended december  on april  we completed a public offering of  ordinary shares which included the over allotment option of  ordinary shares in which we raised aggregate net proceeds of approximately million 
we used the net proceeds of the offering to repay short term borrowings of million  which we had borrowed under a credit facility with a us bank  and for general corporate purposes 
on november  we completed the private offering of million of senior convertible notes due which included the over allotment option of million in which we raised aggregate net proceeds of approximately million 
we used the net proceeds of the offering to repay short term borrowings of million  under reverse repurchase agreements  and for general corporate purposes 
on december  we privately placed million of capital securities which were issued by a trust subsidiary holding a thirty year million aggregate principal amount subordinated note of scottish holdings  inc which is guaranteed by scottish annuity life insurance company cayman ltd 
net proceeds were million 
scottish holdings  inc provided a million capital infusion to its direct subsidiary  scottish re us  inc and used the remainder of the net proceeds for general corporate purposes 
during we paid quarterly dividends totaling million or per share 
during  we paid quarterly dividends totaling million or per share 
during  we arranged two secured credit facilities with us banks totaling million 
each of the credit facilities provides for a combination of borrowing and letters of credit of million 
these facilities expire in september but are renewable with the agreement of both parties 
one of the facilities requires that scottish annuity life insurance company cayman ltd  which we refer to as salic  and world wide reassurance maintain standard poor s ratings of at least a and that salic maintains shareholder s equity of at least million 
at december   salic and world wide reassurance each had a standard poor s rating of a and salic s shareholder s equity was million 
the other facility requires that scottish annuity life maintain consolidated net worth of million and a maximum debt to total capitalization ratio of 
at december   scottish annuity life s net worth was million and the ratio of debt to total capitalization was 
our failure to comply with the requirements of the credit facilities would  subject to grace periods  result in an event of default  and we could be required to repay any outstanding borrowings 
at december   there were no borrowings under the facilities 
outstanding letters of credit under these facilities amounted to million 
at december  we had borrowed million under a reverse repurchase agreement with a major broker dealer 
in november  borrowings of million remained outstanding under this agreement and were repaid from the proceeds of the convertible debt offering 
we must have sufficient assets available for use as collateral to support borrowings  letters of credit  and certain reinsurance transactions 
with these reinsurance transactions  the need for collateral or letters of credit arises in four ways when scottish annuity life insurance company cayman ltd  scottish re dublin limited or world wide reassurance enters into a reinsurance treaty with a us customer  we must contribute assets into a reserve credit trust with a us bank or issue a letter of credit in order that the ceding company may obtain reserve credit for the reinsurance transaction  when scottish re us  inc enters into a reinsurance transaction  it typically incurs a need for additional statutory capital this need can be met by its own capital surplus  an infusion of cash or assets from scottish annuity life or an affiliate or by ceding a portion of the transaction to another company within the group or an unrelated reinsurance company  in which case that reinsurer must provide reserve credit by contributing assets in a reserve credit trust or a letter of credit  scottish re us  inc is licensed  accredited  approved or authorized to write reinsurance in states and the district of columbia 
when scottish re us  inc enters into a reinsurance transaction with a customer domiciled in a state in which it is not a licensed  accredited  authorized or approved reinsurer  it likewise must provide a reserve credit trust or letter of credit  and even when scottish re us  inc is licensed  accredited  approved or authorized to write reinsurance in a state  it may agree with a customer to provide a reserve credit trust or letter of credit voluntarily to mitigate the counter party risk from the customer s perspective  thereby doing transactions that would be otherwise unavailable or would be available only on significantly less attractive terms 
scottish annuity life insurance company cayman ltd 
has agreed with scottish re us  inc that it will cause scottish re us  inc 
to maintain capital and surplus equal to the greater of million or such amount necessary to prevent the occurrence of a company action level event under the risk based capital laws of the state of delaware and provide scottish re us  inc with enough liquidity to meet its obligations in a timely manner 
in addition  scottish annuity life insurance company cayman ltd 
and scottish annuity life have agreed with world wide reassurance that in the event world wide reassurance is unable to meet its obligations under its insurance or reinsurance agreements  scottish annuity life insurance company cayman ltd 
or if scottish annuity life insurance company cayman ltd 
cannot fulfill such obligations  then scottish annuity life will assume all of world wide reassurance s obligations under such agreements 
scottish annuity life and scottish annuity life insurance company cayman ltd 
have executed similar agreements for scottish re dublin limited and world wide life assurance sa and may  from time to time  execute additional agreements guaranteeing the performance and or obligations of their subsidiaries 
our business is capital intensive 
we expect that our cash and investments  together with cash generated from our businesses  will be sufficient to meet our current liquidity and letter of credit needs 
however  if our business continues to grow significantly  we will need to raise additional capital 
off balance sheet arrangements we have no obligations  assets or liabilities other than those disclosed in the financial statements forming part of this form k  no trading activities involving non exchange traded contracts accounted for at fair value  and no relationships and transactions with persons or entities that derive benefits from their non independent relationship with us or our related parties

 embedded derivatives bifurcation of a debt instrument that incorporates both interest rate risk and credit rate risk exposures that are unrelated or only partially related to the creditworthiness of the issuer of that instrument dig b 
dig b addresses whether statement of financial accounting standard no 
accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities requires bifurcation of a debt instrument into a debt host contract and an embedded derivative if the debt instrument incorporates both interest rate risk and credit risk exposures that are unrelated or only partially related to the creditworthiness of the issuer of that instrument

item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we measure and manage market risks and other risks as part of an enterprise wide risk management process 
the market risks described in this section relate to financial instruments  primarily in our investment portfolio  that are sensitive to changes in interest rates  credit risk premiums or spreads  foreign exchange rates and equity prices 
our investments  which are primarily fixed income securities  are subject to market value  reinvestment  and liquidity risk 
our invested assets are funded not only by capital but also by the proceeds of reinsurance transactions  some of which entail substantial deposits of funds or assets 
the cash flows required to pay future benefits are subject to actuarial uncertainties and  in some cases  the policies that we reinsure contain provisions that tend to increase benefits to customers depending on movements in interest rates 
we analyze the potential results of a transaction  including the cash flows of the liabilities and of the related assets  and any risk mitigation measures  and we price transactions to cover our costs  including estimated credit losses  and earn a desirable risk adjusted return under various scenarios 
although we have not done so in the past  we may use interest rate swaps and other hedging instruments as tools to mitigate these risks 
we may also retrocede some risks to other reinsurers 
interest rate risk interest rate risk consists of two components in a falling rate scenario  we have reinvestment risk  which is the risk that interest rates will decline and funds reinvested will earn less than is necessary to match anticipated liabilities  and in a rising rate scenario  we have the risk that cash outflows will have to be funded by selling assets  which will then be trading at depreciated values 
with some annuity liabilities  these risks are compounded by variability in liability cash flows arising from adverse experience in withdrawals  surrenders  mortality  and election of early retirement 
we mitigate both components of risk through asset liability management  including the technique of simulating future results under a variety of interest rate scenarios and modifying the investment and hedging strategy to mitigate downside risk to earnings 
our investment portfolio is composed of fixed maturity bond investments  of which the majority are at fixed interest rates 
for fixed rate investments backing reinsurance liabilities  the maturity structure has been designed to have approximately the same exposure to changes in interest rates as the related liabilities 
floating rate liabilities  including borrowings  are backed primarily by floating rate assets 
in the capital account  however  we own investments that are also sensitive to interest rate changes and this sensitivity is not offset by liabilities 
our overall objective is to limit interest rate exposure 
credit risk credit risk relates to the uncertainty associated with the continued ability of a given obligor to make timely payments of principal and interest 
we measure and manage credit risk not only of bond issuers but also of counter parties in reinsurance  retrocession and hedging transactions 
in our investment portfolio  credit risk is manifested in three ways actual and anticipated deterioration in the creditworthiness of an issue  as may be reflected in downgrades in its ratings  tend to reduce its market value  our managers might react to the actual or expected deterioration and or downgrade of an issuer by selling some or all of our positions  realizing a loss or a profit smaller than would have been realized if the deterioration or downgrade had not occurred  and the issuer may go into default  ultimately causing us to realize a loss 
one of our key objectives in managing credit risk is to keep actual credit losses below both the amounts that we have assumed and allowed for in pricing reinsurance transactions and the amounts we would have lost  given the general level of experience for comparably rated securities of the same type in the general market 
we seek to prevent credit risk  in the aggregate  from becoming the dominant source of risk in our overall book of retained risks as a reinsurer 
we mitigate credit risk by adopting an investment policy  approved by our board of directors  which limits overall exposure to credit risk and requires diversification by limiting exposure to any single issuer 
we also use outside professional money management firms and monitor their capabilities  performance and compliance with our investment and risk management policies 
equity risk world wide reassurance assumed an interest in a unit investment trust that is classified as a trading security and is recorded at fair value 
the equity risk in connection with this security is substantially passed on to the holders of the investment type products  because the value of policyholder benefits is determined based on the value of the investment 
world wide reassurance retains the investment income on the investment in the unit investment trust  and bears the risk that investment income derived from this security will be less than anticipated 
foreign currency risk our functional currency is the united states dollar 
however  our uk subsidiaries  world wide holdings and world wide reassurance  maintain a part of their investment portfolio and operating expense accounts in british pounds and receive other currencies in payment of premiums 
all of world wide reassurance s original us business is settled in united states dollars  all canadian and certain asia and middle east business is converted and settled in united states dollars  and all other currencies are converted and settled in british pounds 
the results of the business in british pounds are then translated to united states dollars 
world wide reassurance attempts to limit substantial exposures to foreign currency risk  but does not actively manage currency risks 
to the extent our foreign currency exposure is not properly managed or otherwise hedged  we may experience exchange losses  which in turn would adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 
we may enter into investment  insurance and reinsurance transactions in the future in currencies other than united states dollars 
our objective is to avoid substantial exposures to foreign currency risk 
we will manage these risks using policy limits  asset liability management techniques and hedging transactions 
sensitivity analysis change in interest rates we regularly conduct analyses to gauge the financial impact of changes in interest rates on our financial condition 
techniques include  but are not limited to  comparison of option adjusted duration of assets and liabilities and simulation of future asset and liability cash flows under multiple interest rate scenarios 
financial simulations are also used to evaluate exposure to credit spreads and will be used as we consider investments and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies 
on a monthly basis  we measure the gap between the effective duration of the investments and the target duration 
for assets supporting liabilities  we set the target duration to minimize interest rate risk for each liability transaction 
our investment policy limits the duration gap to years 
for floating rate borrowings and liabilities  we target floating rate assets  which have a duration near zero 
for capital account assets  we target a duration of years 
quantitative disclosure of interest rate risk the following tables provide information as of december  about the interest rate sensitivity of the portion of our investment portfolio managed by external managers 
the tables do not include other cash balances of million  or modified coinsurance assets of billion 
the tables show the aggregate amount  by book value and fair value  of the securities that are expected to mature in each of the next five years and thereafter  as well as the weighted average book yield of those securities
