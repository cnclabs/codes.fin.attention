overview intrabiotics pharmaceuticals  inc is a biopharmaceutical company focused on developing iseganan hcl oral solution for the prevention of ventilator associated pneumonia vap 
in  we focused our resources mainly on developing iseganan hcl for the prevention of ulcerative oral mucositis 
the top line results of our patient phase iii clinical trial of iseganan hcl oral solution to treat patients undergoing radiotherapy to prevent or reduce ulcerative oral mucositis showed no significant difference between iseganan and placebo in the primary or secondary end points 
the top line results of our patient phase iii clinical trial of iseganan hcl oral solution to treat patients undergoing aggressive chemotherapy to prevent or reduce ulcerative oral mucositis showed no significant difference between iseganan and placebo in the primary end point 
iseganan appears to be safe when applied to the oral cavity 
we are not pursuing further development of iseganan hcl to treat oral mucositis 
previously  we completed two earlier stage trials for other indications of iseganan hcl to prevent pneumonia in patients requiring breathing assistance from a mechanical ventilator and to treat respiratory infections in patients with cystic fibrosis 
we believe the data from each of these trials support the advancement to the next stage of human clinical testing for each of these two indications 
in february  we announced plans to launch a patient phase ii iii clinical study of iseganan hcl for the prevention of vap 
we recently concluded a productive meeting with the fda to discuss the development of iseganan for vap and anticipate enrolling the first patient before the end of the third quarter if we obtain additional financing 
since commencing operations in  we have not generated any revenue from product sales  and we have funded our operations primarily through the private sale of equity securities  funds received from a terminated collaboration agreement  the proceeds of equipment financing arrangements and our initial public offering of common stock in march during the quarter ended march   we completed a private placement of million shares of common stock resulting in net proceeds of million  and during the quarter ended june   we completed a private placement of million shares of common stock to ernest mario  phd resulting in proceeds of million 
in addition  during the quarter ended june   we sold two pre clinical anti infective programs to micrologix biotech inc  a canadian company  for cash and  shares of series a preferred shares of micrologix  and recognized other income of  during the quarter ended september   we also recognized  of other income in connection with the redemption of  shares of series a preferred shares of micrologix  which was triggered by a milestone set forth in our agreement with micrologix 
we have incurred losses in each year since inception  and we expect to incur substantial losses for at least the next several years 
we expect that losses may fluctuate  and that such fluctuations may be substantial 
as of december   our accumulated deficit was approximately million 
we will need to raise additional funds in the future to continue our operations 
in april  we acquired apothogen  inc  a privately held pharmaceutical in licensing company based in north carolina 
we issued  shares of its common stock in exchange for all of apothogen s outstanding capital stock 
the total purchase price of million was determined based on the average closing price of our common stock on the two days prior to the closing date  the closing date and two days after the closing date 

table of contents we allocated the purchase price based on the relative fair value of the net tangible and intangible assets acquired 
the amount of the purchase price in excess of the net tangible assets acquired of million was allocated to acquired workforce  which was to be amortized over three years 
the acquired workforce  net of amortization  of million was deemed to be impaired after the negative results of the phase iii trial of iseganan hc for the prevention of oral mucositis in cancer patients receiving chemotherapy were announced 
the acquired workforce was comprised of sales and marketing management  and given there would be no drug approval in the near future  the acquired workforce was deemed impaired  and therefore written down to zero in december concurrent with the closing of the acquisition  ernest mario  phd joined us as chairman and chief executive officer and purchased million of newly issued shares of our common stock in a private placement at a purchase price per share of 
in october  we announced a restructuring plan  which included a significant reduction in force 
as a result of the restructuring  we planned to reduce our expenses from approximately million per quarter to approximately million per quarter 
the restructuring plan was substantially completed by year end and included a reduction of approximately positions  or of our workforce 
in addition  we terminated some of our contracts including our real estate leases  which we believe are not necessary for our future operations 
we have recorded charges related to the impairment of equipment and acquired workforce totaling million  which are included in operating expenses for the year ended december  in february  we entered into agreements with certain investors providing for the issuance  in a private placement financing  subject to shareholder approval  of newly created series a convertible preferred stock  and warrants to purchase common stock  for an aggregate gross purchase price of million 
the primary purpose of completing the private placement is to provide funds to allow us to conduct and complete our clinical trial of iseganan hcl for the prevention of vap 
a special meeting of stockholders at which the approval and ratification of the private placement is solicited is scheduled to take place on april  if the stockholders approve the transaction  we anticipate completing the private placement during the second quarter on march   we received an alternative financing proposal from mr 
c 
robert coates 
we are currently evaluating mr 
coates proposal 
critical accounting policies estimates our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities and expenses  and related disclosures 
on an on going basis  we evaluate these estimates  including those related to clinical trial accruals  restructuring accruals and stock based compensation 
estimates are based on historical experience  information received from third parties and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
impairment of long lived assets long lived assets and certain identifiable intangible assets to be held and used are reviewed for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable 
determination of recoverability is based on an estimate of undiscounted cash flows resulting from the use of the assets and their eventual disposition 
in the event that such cash flows are insufficient to recover the carrying amount of the assets  the assets are written down to the estimated fair value 
long lived assets to be disposed of are reported at the lower of the carrying amount or the estimated fair value less costs to sell 

table of contents clinical trial accruals our accrued costs for clinical trial activities performed by contract research organizations are based upon estimates of the percentage of work completed over the life of the individual study 
these estimates may or may not match the actual services performed by the organization as determined by patient enrollment levels and related activities 
we monitor patient enrollment levels and related activities to the extent possible  however  if we underestimated activity levels associated with various studies at a given point in time  we could record significant research and development expenses in future periods 
all such costs are charged to r d expense as incurred 
restructuring charges our restructuring charges include our estimate of the costs for terminated employees in accordance with eitf and related interpretations 
we continue to monitor the actual costs and expected remaining obligations in connection with our restructuring plan  and revise the estimates accordingly 
severance estimates were determined based on our assessment of remaining payroll and employee benefits for the employees involved 
results of operations comparison of years ended december  and revenues intrabiotics had no product sales or contract revenue for the years ended december  and we do not anticipate any product revenue in the near future 
expenses research and development research and development expenses decreased to million for the year ended december  compared to million for the same period in the decrease primarily consists of decreases of million in salaries and benefits  million of outside services related to clinical trials and million of license fees 
during  we commenced a research and technology licensing agreement with new chemical entities  inc now albany molecular research  inc amri and with diversa corporation 
in conjunction with the may restructuring  we terminated or restructured research and licensing collaborations with amri  biosearch italia  spa  cetek corporation and diversa corporation 
the total research and development expenses incurred in in conjunction with these collaborations were million of which million was charged to research and development and million was charged to restructuring 
in addition  we issued  warrants to diversa corporation  valued at  which was also charged to restructuring 
research and development expenses include salaries for research and development personnel  contractor and clinical trial site fees  drug substance  building and equipment costs  supplies  collaboration expenses  administrative expenses and allocations of corporate costs 
in  approximately of research and development expenses were for various contractor and clinical trial site fees compared to in included in research and development expenses are non cash stock compensation charges of  and million in and  respectively 
during  we completed two phase iii clinical studies 
we are no longer developing iseganan hcl oral solution for the reduction in incidence and severity of ulcerative oral mucositis 
subsequent to our october restructuring  we terminated our supply agreement with polypeptide laboratories for iseganan hcl manufacturing 
as a result of this termination agreement  during the quarter ended december   we have expensed million related to the delivery of lots h  j  k and l  and recorded a prepaid for drug substance of million as of december   which will be expensed upon delivery of lots i i research and development expenses may increase in the future if we are able to advance new and existing product candidates into later stages of clinical development 
for example  we anticipate that the initiation of our phase ii iii clinical trial for vap will result in increased research and development expenses  compared 
table of contents to expenses incurred when no clinical trial is in progress 
the commencement and completion of our clinical trials may be delayed by many factors  including slower than expected rate of patient enrollment  our inability to adequately obtain data about patients after their treatment in our clinical trials  additional regulatory requests  inability to manufacture sufficient quantities of materials used for clinical trials or unforeseen safety issues 
as a result  our research and development expenses may also fluctuate 
our future capital requirements will depend on many factors  including the timing  cost  extent and results of clinical trials  payments associated with manufacturing scale up  the costs and timing of regulatory approvals  costs associated with researching drug candidates  securing in licensing opportunities and conducting pre clinical research 
general and administrative general and administrative expenses decreased to million for the year ended december   compared to million for the same period in the decrease was primarily attributed to the restructuring implemented in may with a large percentage attributable to costs related to the reduction in headcount for all of this decrease was partially offset due to the acquisition of apothogen in april  as general and administrative headcount was increased as a result of the acquisition 
general and administrative expenses include salaries for administrative personnel  outside contractors  travel costs  legal fees  building and equipment costs  supplies and other general administrative expenses

this plan reduced headcount by employees  or of the workforce 
we recorded restructuring charges of  for severance costs of which   was paid as of december  no other charges were incurred as a result of the restructuring plan 
at december   there were no remaining employees working who were affected by the restructuring plan 
the remaining accrued severance as of december  of  remains in the liability account and was paid in january to employees who left the company in december as of december   we had full time employees 
in may  we implemented a restructuring plan intended to conserve capital and focus resources on the development of iseganan hcl 
as a result of this restructuring plan  we recorded restructuring charges of million and asset write down charges of million for a total of approximately in the second quarter of the million restructuring charge was for costs incurred in work force reduction of million  the termination of collaboration agreements of million and facilities consolidation million

the may restructuring also included the termination of certain research and development collaborations and the consolidation of operations into one existing facility in mountain view  california 
the estimated costs associated with terminated collaboration agreements were increased by  in the fourth quarter of and  in there are no remaining amounts payable for such agreements and costs at december  we vacated three facilities in mountain view  california as a part of the may restructuring plan  comprising  square feet 
one of the vacated facilities was subleased during  and the landlord took another back  with no continuing obligation to us

interest income and expense interest income decreased to  for the year ended december  from million for the same period in the decrease in interest income resulted from the decrease in average cash and investment balances as well as a decline in interest rates 
interest expense decreased to  for the year ended december  from million for the same period in the decrease was primarily attributed to a repayment of our line of credit and bank loan in october  as well as a reduction in the interest rate on our line of credit

during the quarter ended march   we sold million shares of common stock in a private placement resulting in net cash proceeds of approximately million 
also during the quarter ended march   we received cash of million in settlement of our arbitration with a contract vendor relating to a drug dispensing error in iseganan hcl oral solution phase iii clinical trials 
during the quarter ended june   we completed a private placement of million shares of common stock to ernest mario  phd resulting in net proceeds of million 
in the initial public offering  which was completed in march we sold million shares of common stock at a price of per share 
net proceeds from the initial public offering were approximately million 
prior to our initial public offering  we had financed our operations primarily through private placements of preferred stock and warrants  funds received from our prior collaboration with pharmacia upjohn spa and the proceeds of equipment financings 
through december   we had raised aggregate net proceeds from the sale of preferred stock and warrants of million 
prior to termination of the pharmacia upjohn spa agreement  we received an aggregate of million in cash payments under this agreement  of which million of unused development funding was returned to pharmacia upjohn spa in cash  cash equivalents  restricted cash and short term investments were million at december   compared to million at december  on december   we had restricted cash of  compared to million at december  the  of restricted cash consists of a certificate of deposit guaranteeing a standby letter of credit for product supplies

table of contents net cash provided by used in investing activities was million for the year ended december   million for the year ended december  and million for the year ended december  the decrease in the cash used by investing activities in from the cash provided by investing activities in is reflected in the maturities of short term investments of million in the increase in cash provided by investing activities in from a use of cash in was also due to the maturities of short term investments used to fund our operations in net cash provided by used in financing activities was million for the year ended december   million for the year ended december  and million for the year ended december  the cash provided by financing activities in was due to the issuance of million shares of common stock in private placements and the issuance of  shares of common stock upon exercise of options for a total of million  offset by million paid to silicon valley bank svb during the fourth quarter of  for principal and interest payments to retire our corporate debt 
the cash used in financing activities in was primarily due to payments on financing obligations partially offset by proceeds from financing obligations 
the cash provided by financing activities for the year ended december  was due to the issuance of common stock  including net proceeds of million from the initial public offering  and proceeds of million from equipment lease financing arrangements  partially offset by payments on these obligations 
in august  we refinanced all of the existing financing obligations by entering into a new line of credit of million and term loan agreement of million with svb 
the interest rate varied according to the prime rate 
on october   we repaid to svb  the million line of credit and the remaining million balance of the million term loan at which time the restriction on the million certificate of deposit was released 
at december   the company had no obligations to svb 
at december   we had no lease commitments on facilities 
in february  we entered into an agreement to lease a facility under an operating lease agreement  which expires in june under the terms of this lease we are committed to pay approximately  in and  in the following are future contractual commitments at december   in thousands payments due by period contractual commitment total year years years thereafter consultant payments polypeptide labs total contractual commitments the  commitment to polypeptide labs represents  in year one  the payment of  for drug substance   for a completion report  and  fee for storage of drug substance and for future years the remaining  represents storage fees for our drug substance 
we have an obligation to pay ongoing consulting payments to a former officer during totaling approximately  we expect to continue to incur substantial operating losses 
we believe that existing capital resources will be sufficient to fund our operations for at least the next months 
in addition  in february  we entered into agreements to sell to certain investors  in a private placement  series a preferred stock and warrants to purchase common stock  subject to stockholder approval and ratification of the transaction 
if we are able to secure stockholder approval  and the transaction is successfully completed  we will receive aggregate gross proceeds of approximately million 
we believe that this additional capital would be sufficient to meet our operating and capital needs for an additional three months 
however  we cannot assure you that the stockholders will approve the transaction  or that our current estimates and assumptions will remain 
table of contents unchanged 
this forecast is a forward looking statement that involves risks and uncertainties  and actual results could vary 
our future capital requirements will depend on many factors  including the timing  delay  cost  extent and results of clinical trials  future opportunities for raising capital  payments to third parties for manufacturing scale up  the costs and timing of regulatory approvals  the costs of establishing sales  marketing and distribution capabilities  and the progress of our development activities 
until we can generate sufficient cash from our operations  which we do not expect for the foreseeable future  we expect to finance future cash needs through private and public financings  including equity financings 
we cannot be certain that additional funding will be available when needed or on favorable terms 
if additional funding is not available  we may need to delay or curtail our development and clinical trial activities to a significant extent

quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk the primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve our capital until it is required to fund operations while at the same time maximizing the income we receive from our investments without significantly increasing risk 
we own financial instruments that are sensitive to market risks as part of our investment portfolio 
to minimize this risk  we maintain a portfolio of cash equivalents and short term investments in a variety of securities  including money market funds and certificates of deposit 
the average duration of all our investments in fiscal and was less than one year
