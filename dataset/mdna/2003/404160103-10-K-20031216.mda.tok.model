item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
in thousands of dollars fiscal started off slow but was bolstered by the acquisition of our amo in the second quarter 
revenue in the first quarter began the year with the lowest revenue we have experienced in thirteen quarters at  that was a drop in revenue from our first quarter of our fiscal year ended august  fiscal 
the cost reduction plan implemented in second quarter of fiscal continued into fiscal it is important to note that our variable costs have historically represented as much as approximately of our revenue  which makes us extremely volume sensitive the cost reduction plan has lowered our quarterly breakeven point to approximately  as of the end of fiscal we will continue to manage our costs and have a goal to lower the quarterly breakeven point by the end of fiscal our commitment to research and development continued in fiscal and we have and will continue this effort to maintain and increase our propriety technology and manufacturing process 
with revenue continuing to be our biggest issue in fiscal we have streamlined and improved our sales and marketing efforts with renewed focus and talent 
we are experiencing positive results from this effort and will continue to concentrate on this during fiscal to not only increase our sales  but to increase our diversification of revenue 
critical accounting policies the accompanying consolidated financial statements are based on the selection and application of accounting principles generally accepted in the united states gaap  which require estimates and assumptions about future events that may affect the amounts reported in these financial statements and the accompanying notes 
future events and their effects cannot be determined with absolute certainty 
therefore  the determination of estimates requires the exercise of judgment 
actual results could differ from those estimates  and any such differences may be material to the financial statements 
we believe that the following accounting policies may involve a higher degree of judgment and complexity in their application and represent the critical accounting policies used in the preparation of our financial statements 
if different assumptions or conditions were to prevail  the results could be materially different from reported results 
revenue recognition  sales returns and warranty we recognize revenue upon shipment of products to customers  when all contractual obligations have been satisfied and collection of the resulting receivable is reasonably assured 
for inventory shipped on consignment  revenue is recognized upon transfer of title when the customer uses the inventory 
in the normal course of business we enter into a number of contracts with our customers under which we provide engineering services on a per project basis 
we recognize revenue on these services based upon meeting certain milestones and or benchmarks that are attributable to the different contractual elements of the overall contract 
based on the accomplishments of these goals we use the percentage of completion methodology to recognize the revenue and related costs to generate the revenues 
sales  payment terms and pricing extended to customers are governed by the respective contract agreements or binding pos for each transaction and provide no right of return outside of contractual warranty terms 
payment terms are seven days for consignment program sales and from four to days for other customers 
for items delivered with contingent payment terms  revenue is deferred for the greater of the amount of the contingent payment or the fair value of the undelivered elements and recognized when the contingency is resolved 
we provide engineering and product development services to our customers pursuant to written contracts 
the majority of these arrangements are time and material contracts 
we recognize revenue as time is incurred or materials are consumed 
to a lesser extent we have fixed price contracts which are accounted for using either the completed contract method or the percentage of completion method 
we record provisions against net sales for estimated product returns 
these estimates are based on factors that include  but are not limited to  historical sales returns  analyses of credit memo activities  current economic trends and changes in the demands of our customers 
provisions are also recorded for warranty claims that are based on historical trends and known warranty claims 
should actual product returns exceed 
table of contents estimated allowances  additional reductions to our net sales would result 
as of august  and  warranty and product return reserves were and  respectively 
allowance for uncollectible accounts we estimate the collectibility of trade receivables and note receivables  which requires considerable amount of judgment in assessing the realization of these receivables  including the current credit worthiness of each customer and related aging of the past due balances 
in order to assess the collectibility of these receivables  we perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers financial condition 
through these evaluations  we may become aware of a situation where a customer may not be able to meet its financial obligations due to a deterioration of its financial viability  credit ratings or bankruptcy 
the reserve requirements are based on the best facts available to us and reevaluated and adjusted as additional information is received 
we are not able to predict changes in the financial condition of our customers and  if circumstances related to our customers deteriorate  our estimates of the recoverability of our receivables could be materially affected and we may be required to record additional allowances for uncollectible accounts 
alternatively  if we provide more allowances than we need  we may reverse a portion of such provisions in future periods based on changes in estimates from our actual collection experience 
as of august  and  we had accounts receivable allowances of and  respectively 
inventories we record inventories at the lower of cost  using the standard and average cost method or market value 
generally  all inventory purchases are for customized parts for customer specific programs 
contractual arrangements are typically agreed to with the customer prior to ordering customized parts to protect us in cases where the demand decreases  as often times the parts cannot be consumed in other programs 
even though contractual arrangements may be in place  we are still required to assess the utilization of inventory 
in assessing the ultimate realization of inventories  judgments as to future demand requirements are made and compared to the current or committed inventory levels and contractual inventory holding requirements 
reserve requirements generally increase as projected demand requirements decrease due to market conditions  technological and product life cycle changes as well as longer than previously expected usage periods 
it is possible that significant charges to record inventory at the lower of cost or market may occur in the future if there is a further decline in market conditions 
as of august  and  we have reduced the carrying value to the lower of cost or market for excess and obsolete inventory by  and  respectively 
long lived assets we continually evaluate whether events and circumstances have occurred that indicate the remaining estimated useful life of long lived assets may warrant revision  or that the remaining balance of these assets may not be recoverable 
we evaluate the recoverability of our long lived assets in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
when deemed necessary  we complete this evaluation by comparing the carrying amount of the assets against the estimated undiscounted future cash flows associated with them 
if such evaluations indicate that the future undiscounted cash flows of long lived assets are not sufficient to recover the carrying value of such assets  the assets are adjusted to their estimated fair values 
during fiscal we recorded asset impairment charges of for fiscal we did not record any long lived asset impairment charges 
during fiscal we recorded asset impairment charges of for leasehold improvements and fixed assets related to the mexico facilities closing 
valuation of deferred taxes significant management judgment is required in determining the provision for income taxes  deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowance recorded against net deferred tax assets 
we record a current provision for income taxes based on amounts payable or refundable 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences of differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and operating loss and tax credit carryforwards 

table of contents deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in the period that includes the enactment date 
the overall change in deferred tax assets and liabilities for the period measures the deferred tax expense or benefit for the period 
we recognize a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not that deferred assets are not recoverable 
at august  and  we had valuation allowances of approximately  and  respectively  because of uncertainties related to the ability to utilize certain federal and state net loss carryforwards due to the company s historical losses and net tax operating loss carryforward position 
the valuation allowance is based on estimates of taxable income by jurisdiction and the period over which our deferred tax assets are recoverable 
purchase accounting the accompanying statements set forth in note to our consolidated financial statements reflect a preliminary allocation of the purchase price of our amo 
this allocation includes an accrual of related to an unfavorable operating lease   for future estimated lease payments and a accrual to fulfill estimated contractual manufacturing obligations 
the  accrued for estimated lease payments consists of  for future lease obligations less estimated sublease payments of  on unoccupied space for which we are in the process of reviewing alternative uses 
we have entered into an agency agreement with julien j 
studley  inc  a national commercial real estate services firm  to assist hei in reducing its occupancy costs at this facility by sub leasing the  square foot addition 
the final allocation of the consideration to be paid may differ from those assumptions reflected in the accompanying audited consolidated financial statements 
in our opinion  all adjustments necessary to present fairly such financial statements have been made based on the terms and structure of the amo acquisition 
we continue the process of gathering information to complete our analysis of the excess lease capacity and the contractual manufacturing obligations 
any reductions in these liabilities will result in a decrease in the carrying value of the intangible assets and fixed assets 
conversely  an increase in these liabilities increases the carrying values of long lived assets 
at august   the carrying value of long lived assets has been reduced by a net of  by the allocation of negative goodwill 
results of operations percentage of net sales fiscal year ended august  gross profit selling  general and administrative research  development and engineering other the following table illustrates the approximate percentage of our net sales by market segment served 
fiscal year ended august  market medical hearing communications rfid other 
table of contents net sales our net sales for fiscal  increased  or  compared to fiscal this increase in net sales from fiscal was the result of  in net sales generated by our amo  which we acquired in january the increase in sales associated with the addition of our amo was partially offset by a decrease in sales of approximately  to two of our major medical hearing customers 
net sales in fiscal decreased  or  compared to fiscal the decrease in net sales from fiscal was largely a result of the general economic slowdown and the resulting impact in the medical hearing  communications  rfid and electronic contract manufacturing markets 
additionally  during the fourth quarter of fiscal  the internal manufacturing capacity of one of our customers increased  resulting in approximately  reduced sales of our products in fiscal the communications and rfid markets remain soft as our customers are awaiting market acceptance of new products and increased demand for existing products 
as the demand for these products increases  we believe that we are positioned for an increase in sales in these markets 
in addition  we are experiencing continued interest in our proprietary products which have received design approval for numerous applications with increasing low volume production 
we continue to work on new designs  qualification testing and continue to receive prototype orders from numerous customers 
sales to medical hearing customers represents of total net sales for fiscal and increased from  to  or by  or compared to fiscal the increase is primarily a result of the addition of our advanced medical operations  which contributed  for the year in medical revenue 
the increase associated with our amo addition was partially offset as we continued to experience fluctuations in demand for our hearing products 
the decreases in our hearing products are mainly due to excess inventory positions at significant hearing customers and reflect the general economic slowdown  which continues to negatively impact the hearing related contract manufacturing markets 
during the latter part of fiscal  a major customer s internal manufacturing capabilities increased  which reduced annual revenues for fiscal by approximately  also a significant customer advised us in june that it intended to discontinue a significant program with us in order to place it offshore 
this program was discontinued in the first quarter of fiscal and had net sales of   and  in fiscal  fiscal  and fiscal  respectively 
this program discontinuance will reduce but not eliminate sales to this customer 
during the first quarter of fiscal  we entered into a program with siemens in which our finished goods inventory is held at siemens and we recognize revenue when they use the product 
in connection with this program  certain raw materials used by us for siemens products are being consigned to us by siemens 
the result of this program is that our finished goods inventory has increased  while raw materials for these programs have decreased 
fiscal sales to medical hearing customers decreased from  in fiscal to  or by  or 
the decrease in demand comparing fiscal to fiscal is a result of the general economic slowdown impacting the hearing contract manufacturing markets 
also  during the latter part of fiscal one of our customer s internal manufacturing capabilities increased  negatively impacting revenue by approximately  in fiscal net sales to the communications and industrial products market decreased from  in fiscal to  in fiscal  or or 
the fiscal decrease as compared to fiscal is largely a result of the current weakness in the telecommunications markets 
we are experiencing increased activity in this market with numerous low volume purchase orders 
in september  we realigned our sales emphasis to narrowly focus our efforts to key niche customers to obtain the best margin revenue while improving the efficiencies in developing new business 
net sales decreased in fiscal from  in fiscal to  in fiscal  or by  or 
this decrease comparing fiscal to fiscal is largely a result of weakness in the telecommunications markets 
net sales to the rfid products market represents decreased from  in fiscal to  in fiscal or by or 
this decrease was driven by a drop in orders from a major customer that  in fiscal  sold one division and terminated operations of another 
we are also experiencing competition from overseas manufacturers in this market 
new products have been developed and capabilities have been 
table of contents expanded to improve revenue  however  the actual level of market acceptance of these initiatives is currently unknown 
rfid sales decreased in fiscal from  in fiscal to  or by  or  primarily due to the above mentioned drop in orders from one major customer 
at august   our backlog of orders for revenue in fiscal was approximately  compared to approximately  and  at august  and  respectively 
we expect to ship our backlog as of august  during fiscal this increase in backlog is mainly due to increased order activity from the overall stronger economic conditions in our markets and  from the acquisition of amo 
the backlog from our amo includes customer commitments that have longer terms  as compared to our historical customer commitments 
our backlog is not necessarily a firm commitment from our customers and can change  in some cases materially  beyond our control 
because our sales are generally tied to the customers projected sales and production of the related product  our sales levels are subject to fluctuations beyond our control 
to the extent that sales to any one customer represent a significant portion of our sales  any change in the sales levels to that customer can have a significant impact on our total sales 
in addition  production for one customer may conclude while production for a new customer has not yet begun or is not yet at full volume 
these factors may result in significant fluctuations in sales from quarter to quarter 
gross profit our gross profit as a percentage of net sales was in fiscal  as compared to in fiscal and in fiscal our gross margin percent of net sales increased slightly in fiscal due to overall material costs improvement resulting in an improvement of of net sales offset by increases in direct labor of and manufacturing costs of 
in future periods  we expect gross margins to be impacted in a similar manner as revenues fluctuate 
our gross profit as a percentage of sales was in fiscal  as compared to in fiscal while our gross margin percentages are heavily impacted by revenue  due to the fixed nature of many of our manufacturing costs  we were able to improve gross margins in fiscal from fiscal despite a decrease in net sales 
this improvement is due to a reduction of direct labor and manufacturing employees in fiscal resulting in a savings of in direct labor and in administrative salary costs  improved manufacturing yields to in fiscal from in fiscal  reduced scrap expense to in fiscal from in fiscal calculated as a percentage of gross sales  and from the closure of the mexico product line  which generated negative gross margins of during fiscal operating expenses selling  general and administrative selling  general and administrative expenses in total were of net sales in fiscal  compared to and in fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
selling  general and administrative expenses in fiscal increased  when compared to fiscal the increase is mainly due to the acquisition of our amo in january  which contributed  in expenses for the year 
in addition  excluding the depreciation related to amo fixed assets  depreciation costs decreased in fiscal as some of our assets  mainly computer software and equipment  were fully depreciated during the year 
these reductions were mitigated by increases in advertising  travel and board of director fees 
during fiscal  selling  general and administrative expenses decreased by when compared to fiscal  due to the closure of the mexico operations and other cost reductions  including reduction of employees  travel and other operational costs 
these reductions were offset by increases in professional fees and insurance costs totaling an employee reduction during fiscal resulted in decreased selling  general and administrative expenses of during fiscal these overall decreasing expenses are a result of our continued efforts to size our cost structure to revenue while balancing our commitment to maintain our research and development efforts and continued sales and marketing focus 

table of contents research  development  and engineering expenses research  development  and engineering expenses increased in fiscal  when compared to fiscal  and increased  when compared to fiscal comparing fiscal to fiscal  costs increased in fiscal by or  compared to fiscal in fiscal and fiscal  the increases in research  development and engineering expenses are a result of our commitment to maintain our design capabilities to support future programs and continue the development and enhancement of our proprietary products and manufacturing processes 
unusual charges the unusual charges of in the current year relate to the impairment of equipment 
the asset impairment was triggered in the fourth quarter of fiscal by the development of alternative testing that was more efficient than what could be performed by our existing equipment and notification in the same quarter that a large portion of a significant customer program will be moved offshore in the first quarter of fiscal the unusual charges of  incurred in fiscal relate to the write off of accounts receivable related to customers of the mexico operations and the closure of those operations 
other income expense  net other expenses of  in fiscal increased  from fiscal  which reflects a decrease of when compared to fiscal the current year increase is due primarily to costs related to the non cash write off of deferred financing bank fees of related to the terminated revolving line of credit with lasalle business credit  and establishment of a reserve of for mr 
fant s promissory note and other amounts that were determined to be uncollectible 
other expense in fiscal of decreased by as compared to fiscal  primarily due to lower interest expense 
net interest expense for fiscal decreased by from fiscal as a result of the lower average debt in fiscal of approximately  and higher average cash balances of approximately  along with average interest rates of approximately lower during fiscal compared to fiscal the lower average debt and higher average cash balances are the result of the net offering proceeds of  received in august in addition  other expense  net for fiscal of includes a non cash charge of net of tax related to costs associated with the abandoned cmed transaction 
income tax expense benefit management performs an analysis of the realization of the deferred tax asset each fiscal quarter 
during fiscal we recognized an income tax benefit of compared to an income tax expense of  in fiscal during fiscal  we did not recognize a tax benefit for any of the company s losses 
the fiscal tax expense resulted from the establishment of a deferred tax valuation allowance to fully reserve all of our deferred tax assets 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal  we determined that a valuation allowance of  should be established for all of our deferred tax assets due to the softness in our markets  the results of operations for the fourth quarter  uncertainties about visibility to customer order rates and a general economic recovery 
an aggregate of of tax valuation allowance was reflected as an adjustment to additional paid in capital as it represents the tax asset benefit from stock option exercises that are included in our net operating loss carryforwards 
the fiscal deferred tax expense was partly offset by a federal income tax benefit of comparing fiscal to fiscal  we recognized tax expense of  during fiscal compared to a tax benefit of in fiscal during fiscal we benefited the net operating loss carryforwards created by the company resulting in a tax benefit 
as noted above  we established a deferred tax valuation allowance for all the deferred income tax assets as of august  at the end of fiscal  we had net operating loss carryforwards expiring at various dates ranging from through even though valuation allowances have been established  we still retain all the economic benefits of the net operating loss in future years 

table of contents financial condition our net cash flow provided by operating activities for fiscal was compared to  and  for fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
for fiscal  cash flow from operating activities was generated as a result of a decrease of in inventories  an increase in accounts payable of  and accrued liabilities of  offset by an increase in accounts receivable of  and a increase in the net loss from  in fiscal to  in fiscal non cash expenses for fiscal consist of depreciation of  the increases in non cash expenses were primarily the result of increased depreciation from the acquisition of our amo  the establishment of an allowance for note receivable of and impaired assets charges of the fiscal increase in accounts receivable  accounts payable and accrued liability balances is attributable primarily to the post acquisition activity of our amo 
the decrease in inventory is due to reduced requirements at year end for major programs from two significant customers  sonic innovations  inc and siemens  inc net cash provided by operating activities totaled  and  respectively  in fiscal and fiscal this decrease was a result of higher revenue in fiscal  which caused higher accounts receivable and inventory balances when compared to fiscal our net cash flow used in investing activities was   and  for fiscal  fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
we spent on capital expenditures and patent costs in fiscal compared to  in fiscal during fiscal we spent  on capital expenditures 
the capital expenditures in all three years relate to facility improvements and purchases of manufacturing equipment to enhance our production capabilities and quality control systems 
our net cash flow used in financing activities was  and  respectively for fiscal and fiscal  and our net cash flow provided by financing activities was  for fiscal cash generated from issuance of common stock was  and  for fiscal  fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
during fiscal  in connection with the purchase of amo  we issued the subordinated promissory note to cmed in the principal amount of  the  decrease in restricted cash for fiscal was used to prepay long term debt as a result of the december   loan modification 
during fiscal  we completed a private placement of common stock that generated  in net proceeds 
other issuances of common stock during the past three fiscal years were from the exercise of stock options 
the majority of other year to year changes relate to the borrowings and repayment under the company s revolving line of credit and term debt agreements 
the result of these activities was a decrease in cash by  and  during fiscal and fiscal  respectively  and an increase in cash of  during fiscal at the end of fiscal our unrestricted cash balance was accounts receivable average days outstanding were days at august   compared to and days at august  and  respectively 
inventory turns were  and  for the fiscal  fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
the decreased days outstanding are mainly due to two significant customers that pay seven or less day terms 
increased inventory turns for fiscal were primarily due to the increase in revenue with associated cost of sales in the last quarter of the fiscal as compared to fiscal the decreased days outstanding and decreased inventory turns in fiscal were primarily due to the slow down in revenue in the last quarter of fiscal as compared to fiscal the company s current ratio at the end of fiscal was as compared to and at the end of fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
the increase in fiscal to fiscal is slight and is principally due to increased accounts receivable and inventories offset by increased accounts payable and accrued liabilities due to the acquisition of our amo 
the decrease in fiscal as compared to fiscal is principally due to the receipt of  from the closing of a private placement in august  off set by additions to property and equipment and payments on long term debt with the  increase in current maturities of long term debt exceeding the  generated by operating activities in fiscal based on the modified bank covenants  amended december   and the required repayment of  of long term debt  the current ratio at the end of fiscal would have been 
table of contents term debt long term debt during fiscal and early fiscal  we have undertaken a number of activities to restructure our term debt 
the following is a summary of those transactions we originally issued idrbs in april in connection with the construction of a new addition to our manufacturing facility in victoria  minnesota  and for the purchase of production equipment 
on march   an aggregate of approximately  of debt proceeds from the subordinated promissory note were used to fund the repayment of principal and interest on the idrbs 
we also used of the proceeds from the subordinated promissory note to retire our capital expenditure notes with lasalle business credit llc 
the subordinated promissory note was funded by cmed at the time of our amo acquisition in january on may  the subordinated promissory note was sold by cmed to whitebox hedged high yield partners whitebox for  and continued with the same terms as the original agreement with cmed until august  to encourage early repayment  the terms of the subordinated promissory note were modified on may  and subsequently modified on september  on october   we prepaid the subordinated promissory note for a discount on the principal amount outstanding of  the payment of accrued interest totaling with  unregistered common shares of hei stock valued at per share and forgiveness of interest from september  through october  as a result of the prepayment of the subordinated promissory note  the company will recognize a gain on the early extinguishment of the subordinated promissory note totaling during the first quarter of fiscal the funds to prepay the subordinated promissory note were obtained from two separate loans in the aggregate amount of  under new term credit facilities with commerce bank  a minnesota state banking association  and its affiliate  commerce financial group  inc  a minnesota corporation 
the first note  with commerce bank  in the amount of  was executed on october  this note is secured by our victoria  minnesota facility 
the term of the first note is six years with interest rate at a nominal rate of per annum for the first three years 
thereafter the interest rate will be adjusted on the first date of the fourth loan year to a nominal rate per annum equal to the then three year treasury base rate as defined plus  provided  however  that in no event will the interest rate be less than the prime rate plus per annum 
monthly payment of principal and interest will be based on a twenty year amortization with a final payment of approximately due on november  the second note  with commerce financial group  inc  in the amount of  was executed on october  the second note is secured by our victoria facility and equipment located at our tempe facility 
the term of the second note is four years  with an interest rate of per year through september  monthly payments of principal and interest in the amount of will be paid over a forty eight month period beginning on october  short term debt on may   we entered into an accounts receivable agreement the credit agreement with beacon bank of shorewood  minnesota for a period of twelve months 
on december   the company extended the credit agreement to september  the credit agreement is an accounts receivable backed facility and is additionally secured by inventory  intellectual property and other general intangibles 
the credit agreement replaced our revolving line of credit with lasalle business credit  llc  and is not subject to any restrictive financial covenants 
we have a maximum of  available under the credit agreement  with the actual borrowings based on eligible accounts receivable 
as of august   there were of borrowings under the credit agreement 
the credit agreement bears an immediate processing fee of of each assigned amount  a daily per diem equal to on any uncollected accounts receivable and a monthly minimum of in processing fees for the first six months the credit agreement is in place 
borrowings are reduced as collections and payments are received into a lock box by the bank 
the effected interest rate based on our average dso of days would be annualized 

table of contents fiscal liquidity the accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared assuming the company will continue as a going concern  which contemplates the realization of assets and the satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business 
the company incurred net losses of   and  for the years ended august   and  respectively 
we have historically financed our operations through the public and private sale of debt and equity securities  bank borrowings under lines of credit  operating equipment leases and cash generated by operations 
significant financial restructuring occurred during our fiscal year ended august   and early in our current fiscal year ending august   transforming our capital structure to a lower interest rate and less restrictive structure 
we replaced a revolving line of credit with lasalle business credit  llc with an accounts receivable backed credit agreement with beacon bank that does not have restrictive covenants 
on october  we completed the funding of two separate loans in the aggregate amount of  under new term credit facilities with commerce bank  a minnesota state banking corporation  and its affiliate  commerce financial group  a minnesota corporation 
the first note  with commerce bank in the amount of  is secured by our victoria  minnesota facility 
the second note  with commerce financial group  inc in the amount of  is secured by our victoria facility and equipment located at our tempe facility 
these loans provided us with the necessary resources to prepay the subordinated promissory note from the colorado medtech  inc cmed acquisition held by whitebox hedged high yield partners see note 
the terms of the new loans have an average interest rate of as compared to for the retired debt 
at august   our sources of liquidity consisted of of cash and cash equivalents and our revolving credit line agreement  which was due to expire in may on december  the revolving line was extended to september  the credit line agreement allows for borrowings of up to  subject to availability based on accounts receivable 
there was outstanding debt at august   leaving an available credit of  at year end 
our liquidity is affected by many factors  some of which are based on the normal ongoing operations of our business  the most significant of which include the timing of the collection of receivables  the level of inventories and capital expenditures 
in the event cash flows are not sufficient to fund operations at the present level numerous measures can be taken to reduce the expenditure levels including but not limited to reduction of spending for research and development elimination of budgeted raises  and reduction of non strategic employees 
during fiscal  we intend to spend approximately for manufacturing equipment  extend the sap software solution to our amo and minor facility improvements 
these additions  if made  will increase efficiency though the further integration of the boulder operations and increase manufacturing capacity to meet anticipated production requirements and add technological capabilities 
it is expected that these expenditures will be funded from operations  existing cash and cash equivalents and available debt financing for the next months 
we generated cash flows from operating activities of  during fourth quarter of fiscal we believe that existing cash and cash equivalents  current lending capacity and cash generated from operations will supply sufficient cash flow to meet short and long term debt obligations and operating requirements during the next months 
management believes that  as a result of the financial restructuring actions it has taken to reduce cash expenditures  the continuing efforts to increase revenues from continuing customers and to generate new customers in various industry sectors  the replacement and subsequent extension of its revolving and term credit facilities it has obtained  it will meet for its fiscal year ending august  contractual obligations giving effect to the refinancing in the first quarter of fiscal of our subordinated promissory note with the two notes from commerce bank and its affiliate  commerce financial group  inc  and the resulting gain that has been reflected below as a reduction of contractual obligations  our contractual obligations at august   are summarized in the following table fiscal fiscal fiscal total amount thereafter committed long term debt contractual obligation operating leases total contractual obligations 
table of contents risk factors in thousands except per share amounts this annual report on form k contains forward looking statements that are based on our current expectations and involve a number of risks and uncertainties 
factors that may materially affect revenues  expenses and operating results include  without limitation  adverse business or market conditions  our ability to secure and satisfy customers  the availability and cost of materials from suppliers  adverse competitive developments and change in or cancellation of customer requirements 
the forward looking statements included herein are based on current assumptions that we will continue to develop  market  manufacture and ship products on a timely basis  that competitive conditions within our markets will not change materially or adversely  that we will continue to identify and satisfy customer needs for products and services  that we will be able to retain and hire key personnel  that our equipment  processes  capabilities and resources will remain competitive and compatible with the current state of technology  that risks due to shifts in customer demand will be minimized  and that there will be no material adverse change in our operations or business 
assumptions relating to the foregoing involve judgments that are based on incomplete information and are subject to many factors that can materially affect results 
we operate in a volatile segment of high technology markets and applications that are subject to rapid change and technical obsolescence 
because of these and other factors affecting our operating results  past financial performance should not be considered an indicator of future performance  and investors should not use historical trends to anticipate results or trends in future periods 
the following factors also may materially affect results and therefore should be considered 
if we are unable to integrate  operate and manage the advanced medical operations  our operating results and business condition may be reduced 
on january   we acquired our colorado business unit from cmed 
this business unit incurred substantial losses during cmed s fiscal years ended june  and and for the six months ended december  we may not be able to successfully and profitably integrate  operate  maintain and manage our advanced medical operations in a competitive environment 
in addition  we may not be able to integrate the newly hired employees and operational issues may arise as a result of a lack of integration or our lack of familiarity with issues specific to this operation 
further  certain of our assumptions relating to the timing of the integration and the use of the leased facility in boulder  colorado  may not prove to be accurate  causing increased costs at this facility 
the inability to integrate the operations could impair our combined revenue opportunity and reduce the return on the assets purchased 
the consolidated integration technology could take longer than anticipated  limiting the speed of the business combination  not allowing costs to be removed as quickly as originally forecasted 
if the components that we design and manufacture are the subject of product recalls or a product liability claim  our business may be damaged  we may incur significant legal fees and our results of operations and financial condition may be adversely affected 
certain of the components we design or manufacture are used in medical devices  several of which may be used in life sustaining or life supporting roles 
the tolerance for error in the design  manufacture or use of these components and products may be small or nonexistent 
if a component we designed or manufactured is found to be defective  whether due to design or manufacturing defects  improper use of the product or other reasons  the product may need to be recalled  possibly at our expense 
further  the adverse effect of a product recall on our business might not be limited to the cost of the recall 
recalls  especially if accompanied by unfavorable publicity or termination of customer contracts  could result in substantial costs  loss of revenues and damage to our reputation  each of which would have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
the manufacture and sale of the medical devices involves the risk of product liability claims 
although we generally obtain indemnification from our customers for components that we manufacture to the customers specifications and we maintain product liability insurance  there can be no assurance that the indemnities will be honored or the coverage of our insurance policies will be adequate 
further  we generally provide a design defect warranty and indemnify to our customers for failure of a product to conform to design specifications and against defects in materials and workmanship 
product liability insurance is expensive and 
table of contents in the future may not be available on acceptable terms  in sufficient amounts  or at all 
a successful product liability claim in excess of our insurance coverage or any material claim for which insurance coverage was denied or limited and for which indemnification was not available could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
our customer base is highly concentrated and the loss of a key customer may reduce our operating results and financial condition 
our customer base is highly concentrated 
in fiscal  fiscal  and fiscal  our three largest customers  siemens  inc  sonic innovations  inc  and ge medical systems  in the aggregate accounted for   and  respectively  of net sales 
each of these customers has multiple programs in production with us 
although we are reducing this concentration  we expect that sales to a relatively small number of oems will continue to account for a substantial portion of net revenues for the foreseeable future 
the loss of  or a decline in orders from  any one of our key customers would materially adversely affect our operating results and financial condition 
we are working for diversification such that no one market would account for or more in revenue  no one customer at or greater revenue and no one program at or greater 
if we are unable to develop new products and services our revenue could decrease 
our products are subject to rapid obsolescence and our future success will depend upon our ability to develop new products and services that meet changing customer and marketplace requirements 
our products are based upon specifications from our customers 
we may not be able to satisfactorily design and manufacture customer products based upon these specifications 
if we fail to properly anticipate the market for new products and service we may lose revenue 
even if we are able to successfully identify  develop and manufacture as well as introduce new products and services  there is no assurance that a market for these products and services will materialize to the size and extent that we anticipate 
if a market does not materialize as we anticipate  our business  operating results and financial condition could be materially adversely affected 
the following factors could affect the success of our products and services in the microelectronic and other marketplaces the failure to adequately equip our manufacturing plant in anticipation of increasing business  the failure of our design team to develop products in a timely manner to satisfy our present and potential customers  and our limited experience in specific market segments in marketing our products and services  specifically in the telecom industry 
we may fail to have enough liquidity to operate our business because we may not adequately adjust our expenses to predicted revenue in any given period  which may dramatically and negatively impact our cash flow 
our basis for determining our ability to fund our operations depends on our ability to accurately estimate our revenue streams and our ability to accurately predict  our related expenditures 
furthermore  our borrowing base is fixed 
as a result  we may fail to adequately adjust our expenses to actual revenue in any given period or we may experience significant fluctuations in quarterly revenue  either of which may dramatically and negatively affect our cash flow 
we may fail to adequately adjust our expenses to predicted revenue in any given period or we may experience significant fluctuations in quarterly revenue because the sales cycle for our products and services is lengthy and unpredictable 
while our sales cycle varies from customer to customer  it historically has ranged from two to months 
our pursuit of sales leads typically involves an analysis of our prospective customer s needs  preparation of a written proposal  one or more presentations and contract negotiations 
our sales cycle may also be affected by the complexity of the product to be developed and manufactured as well as a prospective customer s budgetary constraints and internal acceptance reviews  over which we have little or no control 
as a result of these things combined with the fact that our expenses are fixed  we may fail to adequately adjust our expenses to predicted revenue in any given period or we may experience significant fluctuations in quarterly revenue 

table of contents our business may suffer and cause our stock price to decline if we are unable to protect our intellectual property rights 
intellectual property rights are important to our success and our competitive position 
it is our policy to protect all proprietary information through the use of a combination of nondisclosure agreements and other contractual provisions and patent  trademark  trade secret and copyright law to protect our intellectual property rights 
there is no assurance that these agreements  provisions and laws will be adequate to prevent the imitation or unauthorized use of our intellectual property 
policing unauthorized use of proprietary systems and products is difficult and  while we are unable to determine the extent to which infringement of our intellectual property exists  we expect infringement to be a persistent problem 
in addition  the laws of some foreign countries do not protect our products to the same extent that the laws of the united states protect our products 
if our intellectual property rights are not protected our business may suffer if a competitor uses our technology to capture our business  which could cause our stock price to decline 
furthermore  even if the agreements  provisions and intellectual property laws prove to be adequate to protect our intellectual property rights  our competitors may develop products or technologies that are both non infringing and substantially equivalent or superior to our products or technologies 
third party intellectual property infringement claims may be costly and may prevent the future sale of our products 
substantial litigation and threats of litigation regarding intellectual property rights exist in our industry 
third parties may claim that our products infringe upon their intellectual property rights 
in particular  defending against third party infringement claims may be costly and divert important management resources 
furthermore  if these claims are successful  we may have to pay substantial royalties or damages  remove the infringing products from the marketplace or expend substantial amounts in order to modify the products so that they no longer infringe on the third party s rights 
we may pursue future acquisitions and investments that may adversely affect our financial position or cause our earnings per share to decline 
in the future we may continue to make acquisitions of and investments in businesses  products and technologies that could complement or expand our business 
such acquisitions  though  involve certain risks we may not be able to negotiate or finance the acquisition successfully  the integration of acquired businesses  products or technologies into our existing business may fail  and we may issue equity securities  incur debt  assume contingent liabilities or have amortization expenses and write downs of acquired assets which could cause our earnings per share to decline 
if our customers are unable to gain market acceptance for the products that we develop or manufacture for them  we may lose revenue 
we design and manufacture components for other companies 
we also sell proprietary products that contain components to other companies and end user customers 
for products we manufacture manufactured for others or those we sell directly  our success is dependent on the acceptance of those products in their markets 
we have no control over the products or marketing of products that we sell to our customers 
market acceptance may depend on a variety of factors  including educating the target market regarding the use of a new procedure 
market acceptance and market share are also affected by the timing of market introduction of competitive products 
some of our customers  especially emerging growth companies  have limited or no experience in marketing their products and may be unable to establish effective sales and marketing and distribution channels to rapidly and successfully commercialize their products 
if our customers are unable to gain any significant market acceptance for the products we develop or manufacture for them  our business will be adversely affected 
if we fail to comply with environmental laws and regulations we may be fined and prohibited from manufacturing products 
as a small generator of hazardous substances  we are subject to local governmental regulations relating to the storage  discharge  handling  emission  generation  manufacture and disposal of toxic or other hazardous substances  such as waste oil  acetone and alcohol that are used in very small quantities to manufacture our products 
while we are currently in compliance with applicable regulations  if we fail to comply with these regulations substantial fines could be imposed on us and we could be required to suspend production  alter manufacturing processes or cease operations 

table of contents future quarterly and annual operating results may fluctuate substantially due to a number of factors  many of which are beyond our control  which may cause our stock price to decline 
we have experienced substantial fluctuations in our annual and quarterly operating results  and such fluctuations may continue in future periods 
our operating results are affected by a number of factors  many of which are beyond our control  including the following we may manufacture products that are custom designed and assembled for a specific customer s requirement in anticipation of the receipt of volume production orders from that customer  which may not always materialize to the degree anticipated  if at all  we may incur significant start up costs in the production of a particular product  which costs are expensed as incurred and for which we attempt to seek reimbursement from the customer  we may experience fluctuations and inefficiencies in managing inventories  fixed assets  components and labor  in the degree of automation used in the assembly process  in the costs of materials  and the mix of materials  labor  manufacturing  and overhead costs  we may experience unforeseen design or manufacturing problems  price competition or functional competition other means of accomplishing the same or similar packaging end result  we may be unable to pass on cost overruns  we may not have control over the timing of expenditures in anticipation of increased sales  customer product delivery requirements and the range of services provided  and we may experience variance in the amount and timing of orders placed by a customer due to a number of factors  including inventory balancing  changes in manufacturing strategy  and variation in product demand attributable to  among other things  product life cycles  competitive factors  and general economic conditions 
any one of these factors  or a combination of one or more factors  could adversely affect our annual and quarterly operating results  which in turn may cause our stock price to decline 
we are dependent on a single industry and adverse trends in that industry may reduce our revenues 
during the past several years  we have been significantly dependent on a single market 
in fiscal  fiscal  and fiscal    and  respectively of our net sales came from the hearing instrument and medical device manufacturers 
these industries are characterized by intense competition  relatively short product life cycles  rapid technological change  significant fluctuations in product demand and significant pressure on vendors to reduce or minimize cost 
accordingly  we may be adversely affected by these industry trends to the extent that they reduce our revenues 
in particular  if the hearing instrument manufacturers develop new technologies that do not incorporate our products  or if our competitors offer similar products at a lower cost to such manufacturers  our revenues may decrease and our business would be adversely affected 
although we are attempting to reduce our dependence on a single industry  we do not expect this historic dependence to change dramatically or quickly 
moreover  a significant amount of our non hearing instrument industry sales are made in the medical products industry  which is characterized by trends similar to those in the hearing instrument manufacturer industry 
our customers are permitted to cancel their orders  change production quantities  delay production and terminate their contracts and any such event or series of events may adversely affect our gross margins and operating results 
we  as a medical device development and manufacturing service provider  must provide product output that matches the needs of their customers  which can change from time to time 
we generally do not obtain long term commitments from our customers and we continue to experience reduced lead times in customer orders 
customers may cancel their orders  change production quantities  delay production  or terminate their contracts for a number of reasons 
in certain situations  cancellations  reductions in quantities  delays or terminations by a significant customer could adversely affect our operating results 
such cancellations  reductions or delays have occurred and may continue to occur in response to slowdowns in our customers businesses or for other reasons 
in addition  we make significant decisions  including determining 
table of contents the levels of business that we will seek and accept  production schedules  parts procurement commitments  and personnel needs based on our estimates of customer requirements 
because many of our costs and operating expenses are relatively fixed  a reduction in customer demand or a termination of a contract by a customer could adversely affect our gross margins and operating results 
inventory risk and production delay may adversely affect our financial performance 
most of our contract manufacturing services are provided on a turnkey basis  where we purchase some or all of the materials required for product assembling and manufacturing 
we bear varying amounts of inventory risk in providing services in this manner 
in manufacturing operations  we need to order parts and supplies based on customer forecasts  which may be for a larger quantity of product than is included in the firm orders ultimately received from those customers 
while many of our customer agreements include provisions that require customers to reimburse us for excess inventory which we specifically order to meet their forecasts  we may not actually be reimbursed or be able to collect on these obligations 
in that case  we could have excess inventory and or cancellation or return charges from our suppliers 
our imaging and medical device manufacturing customers continue to experience fluctuating demand for their products  and in response they may ask us to reduce or delay production 
if we delay production  our financial performance may be adversely affected 
we may lose business and revenues if we fail to successfully compete with our customers for business 
we face competition from the internal operations of our current and potential oem customers and from offshore contract manufacturers  which  because of their lower labor rates and other related factors  may enjoy a competitive advantage over us with respect to high volume production 
we expect to continue to encounter competition from other electronics manufacturers that currently provide or may begin to provide contract design and manufacturing services 
a number of our competitors may have substantially greater manufacturing  financial  technical  marketing  and other resources than we have  and may offer a broader scope and presence of operations on a worldwide basis 
significant competitive factors in the microelectronics market include price  quality  design capabilities  responsiveness  testing capabilities  the ability to manufacture in very high volumes and proximity to the customers final assembly facilities 
while we have competed favorably in the past with respect to these factors  this is a particularly fast changing market  and there can be no assurance that we will continue to do so in the future 
we are often one of two or more suppliers on any particular customer requirement and are  therefore  subject to continuing competition on existing programs 
in order to remain competitive in any of our markets  we must continually provide timely and technologically advanced design capabilities and manufacturing services  ensure the quality of our products  and compete favorably with respect to turnaround and price 
if we fail to compete favorably with respect to the principal competitive factors in the markets we serve  we may lose business and our operating results may be reduced 
fluctuations in the price and supply of components used to manufacture our products may reduce our profits 
substantially all of our manufacturing services are provided on a turnkey basis in which we  in addition to providing design  assembly and testing services  are responsible for the procurement of the components that are assembled by us for our customers 
although we attempt to minimize margin erosion as a result of component price increases  in certain circumstances we are required to bear some or all of the risk of such price fluctuations  which could adversely affect our profits 
to date  we have generally been able to negotiate contracts that allow us to shift much of the impact of price fluctuations to the customer  however  there can be no assurance that we will be able to do so in all cases 
in order to assure an adequate supply of certain key components that have long procurement lead times  such as ics  we occasionally must order such components prior to receiving formal customer purchase orders for the assemblies that require such components 
failure to accurately anticipate the volume or timing of customer orders can result in component shortages or excess component inventory  which in either case could adversely affect our operating results and financial condition 
certain of the assemblies manufactured by us require one or more components that are ordered from  or which may be available from  only one source or a limited number of sources 
delivery problems relating to 
table of contents components purchased from any of our key suppliers could have a material adverse impact on our financial performance 
from time to time  our suppliers allocate components among their customers in response to supply shortages 
in some cases  supply shortages will substantially curtail production of all assemblies using a particular component 
in addition  at various times there have been industry wide shortages of electronic components 
while we have not experienced sustained periods of shortages of components in the recent past  there can be no assurance that substantial component shortages will not occur in the future 
any such shortages could reduce our operating results 
our costs may increase significantly if we are unable to forecast customer orders and production schedules 
the level and timing of orders placed by customers vary due to the customers attempts to balance their inventory  changes in customers manufacturing strategies  and variations in demand for the customers products 
due in part to these factors  most of our customers do not commit to firm production schedules more than several weeks in advance of requirements 
our inability to forecast the level of customers orders with certainty makes it difficult to schedule production and optimize utilization of manufacturing capacity 
this uncertainty could also significantly increase our costs related to manufacturing product 
in the past  we have been required to increase staffing and incur other expenses in order to meet the anticipated demands of our customers 
from time to time  anticipated orders from some of our customers have failed to materialize and delivery schedules have been deferred as a result of changes in a customer s business needs  both of which have adversely affected our operating results 
on other occasions  customers have required rapid increases in production that has placed an excessive burden on our resources 
there can be no assurance that we will not experience similar fluctuations in customer demand in the future 
we may be unable to realize revenue from our backlog 
we compute our backlog from purchase orders received from our customers and from other contractual agreements 
our backlog is typically not a firm commitment from the customers 
as such  even though we may have contractual agreements or purchase orders for future shipments  there is no guarantee that this backlog will be realized as revenue 
we may have a significant accounts receivable write off as well as an increase in inventory reserve due to the inability of our customers to pay their accounts 
we may carry significant accounts receivable and inventory in connection with providing manufacturing services to our customers 
if one or more of our principal customers were to become insolvent  or otherwise fail to pay for the services and materials provided by us  our operating results and financial condition would be adversely affected 
our business success may be adversely affected by our ability to hire and retain employees 
our continued growth and success depend to a significant extent on the continued service of senior management and other key employees and the hiring of new qualified employees 
we rely upon the acquisition and retention of employees with extensive technological experience 
competition for skilled business  product development  technical and other personnel is intense 
there can be no assurance that we will be successful in recruiting new personnel and retaining existing personnel 
our executive officers are subject to employment agreements that can be terminated upon providing days advance  written notice by either party 
the loss of one or more key employees may materially adversely affect our growth 
we operate in a regulated industry  and our products and revenue are subject to regulatory risk 
we are subject to a variety of regulatory agency requirements in the united states and foreign countries relating to many of the products that we develop and manufacture 
the process of obtaining and maintaining required regulatory approvals and otherwise remaining in regulatory compliance can be lengthy  expensive and uncertain 
the fda inspects manufacturers of certain types of devices before providing a clearance to manufacture and sell such device  and the failure to pass such an inspection could result in delay in moving ahead with a product or project 
we are required to comply with the fda s qsr for the development and manufacture of medical products 
in addition  in order for devices we design or manufacture to be exported and for us and our customers to be qualified to use the ce mark in the european union  we maintain iso en certification which  like the qsr  subjects our operations to periodic surveillance audits 
to ensure compliance with various regulatory and quality requirements  we expend significant time  resources and effort in the areas of training  production and quality assurance 
if we fail to comply with regulatory or quality 
table of contents regulations or other fda or applicable legal requirements  the governing agencies can issue warning letters  impose government sanctions and levy serious penalties 
noncompliance or regulatory action could have a negative impact on our business  including the increased cost of coming into compliance  and an adverse effect on the willingness of customers and prospective customers to do business with us 
such noncompliance  as well as any increased cost of compliance  could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
if our customers do not promptly obtain regulatory approval for their products  our projects and revenue may be adversely affected 
the fda regulates many of our customers products  and requires certain clearances or approvals before new medical devices can be marketed 
as a prerequisite to any introduction of a new device into the medical marketplace  our customers must obtain necessary product clearances or approvals from the fda or other regulatory agencies 
this can be a slow and uncertain process  and there can be no assurance that such clearances or approvals will be obtained on a timely basis  if at all 
in addition  products intended for use in foreign countries must comply with similar requirements and be certified for sale in those countries 
a customer s failure to comply with the fda s requirements can result in the delay or denial of approval to proceed with the product 
delays in obtaining regulatory approval are frequent and  in turn  can result in delaying or canceling customer orders 
there can be no assurance that our customers will obtain or be able to maintain all required clearances or approvals for domestic or exported products on a timely basis  if at all 
the delays and potential product cancellations inherent in the regulatory approval and ongoing regulatory compliance of products we develop or manufacture may have a material adverse effect on our projects and revenue  as well as our business  reputation  results of operations and financial condition 
if government or insurance company reimbursements for our customers products change  our products  revenues and profitability may be adversely affected 
governmental and insurance industry efforts to reform the healthcare industry and reduce healthcare spending have affected  and will continue to affect  the market for medical devices 
there have been several instances of changes in governmental or commercial insurance reimbursement policies that have significantly impacted the markets for certain types of products or services or that have had an impact on entire industries  such as recent policies affecting payment for nursing home and home care services 
adverse governmental regulation relating to our components or our customers products that might arise from future legislative  administrative or insurance industry policy cannot be predicted and the ultimate effect on private insurer and governmental healthcare reimbursement is unknown 
government and commercial insurance companies are increasingly vigorous in their attempts to contain healthcare costs by limiting both coverage and the level of reimbursement for new therapeutic products even if approved for marketing by the fda 
if government and commercial payers do not provide adequate coverage and reimbursement levels for uses of our customers products  the market acceptance of these products and our revenues and profitability would be adversely affected 
we have customers located in foreign countries and our unfamiliarity of the laws and business practices of such foreign countries could cause us to incur increased costs 
we currently have customers located in foreign countries and anticipate additional customers located outside the united states 
our lack of knowledge and understanding of the laws of  and the customary business practices in  foreign counties could cause us to incur increased costs in connection with disputes over contracts  environmental laws  collection of accounts receivable  holding excess and obsolete inventory  duties and other import and export fees  product warranty exposure and unanticipated changes in governmental regimes 
the price of our common stock may be adversely affected by significant price fluctuations due to a number of factors  many of which are beyond our control 
the market price of our common stock has experienced significant fluctuations and may continue to fluctuate in the future 
the market price of the common stock may be significantly affected by many factors  including changes in requirements or demands for our services  the announcement of new products or product enhancements by us or our competitors  technological innovations by us or our competitors  
table of contents quarterly variations in our or our competitors operating results  changes in prices of our or our competitors products and services  changes in our revenue and revenue growth rates  changes in earnings estimates by market analysts  speculation in the press or analyst community  and general market conditions or market conditions specific to particular industries 
the stock prices for many companies in the technology sector have experienced wide fluctuations that often have been unrelated to their operating performance 
such fluctuations may adversely affect the market price of our common stock 
our amended and restated articles of incorporation and our amended and restated bylaws  as amended  may discourage lawsuits and other claims against our directors 
our articles of incorporation provide  to the fullest extent permitted by minnesota law  that our directors shall have no personal liability for breaches of their fiduciary duties to us 
in addition  our bylaws provide for mandatory indemnification of directors and officers to the fullest extent permitted by minnesota law 
these provisions may reduce the likelihood of derivative litigation against directors and may discourage shareholders from bringing a lawsuit against directors for a breach of their duty 
we have issued numerous options to acquire our common stock that could have a dilutive effect on our common stock 
as of december   we had options outstanding to acquire  shares of our common stock  exercisable at prices ranging from to per share  with a weighted average exercise price of approximately per share 
during the terms of these options  the holders will have the opportunity to profit from either an increase in the market price of our common stock with resulting dilution to the holders of shares who purchased shares for a price higher than the respective exercise or conversion price 
in addition  the increase in the outstanding shares of our common stock as a result of the exercise or conversion of these options could result in a significant decrease in the percentage ownership of our common stock by the purchasers of our common stock 
the market price of our common stock may be reduced by future sales of our common stock in the public market 
sales of substantial amounts of common stock in the public market that are not currently freely tradable  or even the potential for such sales  could have an adverse effect on the market price for shares of our common stock and could impair the ability of purchasers of our common stock to recoup their investment or make a profit 
as of december   these shares consist of approximately  shares beneficially owned by our executive officers and directors  and approximately  shares issuable to option and warrant holders 
unless the shares of our outstanding common stock owned by our executive officers and directors are further registered under the securities laws  they may not be resold except in compliance with rule promulgated by the sec  or some other exemption from registration 
rule does not prohibit the sale of these shares but does place conditions on their resale that must be complied with before they can be resold 
the trading dynamics of our common stock makes it subject to large fluctuations in the per share value 
our common stock is a micro stock that is thinly traded on the nasdaq national market 
in some cases  our common stock may not trade during any given day 
small changes in the demand for shares of our common stock can have a material impact  both negatively and positively  in the trading share price of our stock 
our amended and restated articles of incorporation contain provisions that could discourage or prevent a potential takeover  even if such transaction would be beneficial to our shareholders 
our amended and restated articles of incorporation authorize our board of directors to issue up to  shares of common stock and  shares of undesignated stock  the terms of which may be determined at the time of issuance by the board of directors  without further action by our shareholders 
undesignated stock authorized by the board of directors may include voting rights  preferences as to dividends and liquidation  
table of contents conversion and redemptive rights and sinking fund provisions that could affect the rights of the holders of our common stock and reduce the value of our common stock 
the issuance of preferred stock could also prevent a potential takeover because the terms of any issued preferred stock may require the approval of the holders of the outstanding shares of preferred stock in order to consummate a merger  reorganization or sale of substantially all of our assets or other extraordinary corporate transaction 
our amended and restated articles of incorporation provide for a classified board of directors with staggered  three year terms 
our amended and restated articles of incorporation also require the affirmative vote of a supermajority of the voting power for the following matters to approve the merger or consolidation of hei or any subsidiary with or into any person that directly or indirectly beneficially owns  or owned at any time in the preceding months  five percent or more of the outstanding shares of our stock entitled to vote in elections of directors a related person  to authorize the sale of substantially all of our assets to a related person  to authorize the issuance of any of our voting securities in exchange or payment for the securities or assets of any related person  if such authorization is otherwise required by law or any agreement  to adopt any plan for the dissolution of hei  and to adopt any amendment  change or repeal of certain articles of the amended and restated articles of incorporation  including the articles that establish the authority of the board of directors  the supermajority voting requirements and the classified board of directors 
these provisions may have the effect of deterring a potential takeover or delaying changes in control or our management 
item a 
qualitative and quantitative disclosures about market risk 
in thousands market risk we do not have material exposure to market risk from fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates because all sales are denominated in us dollars 
interest rate risk we are exposed to a floating interest rate risk from our new term credit facilities with commerce bank  a minnesota state banking association 
we obtained two separate loans in the aggregate amount of  the first note  with commerce bank  in the amount of  was executed on october  this note has a floating interest rate 
the term of the first note is six years with interest rate at a nominal rate of per annum for the first three years 
thereafter the interest rate will be adjusted on the first date of the fourth loan year to a nominal rate per annum equal to the then three year treasury base rate as defined plus  provided  however  that in no event will the interest rate be less than the prime rate plus per annum 
monthly payment of principal and interest will be based on a twenty year amortization with a final payment of approximately due on november  the second note  with commerce financial group  inc  in the amount of  was executed on october  the term of the second note is four years  with a fixed interest rate of per year through september  monthly payments of principal and interest in the amount of will be paid over a forty eight month period beginning on october  a change in interest rates is not expected to have a material adverse effect on our near term financial condition or results of operation as the first note has a fixed rate for its first three years and the second note has a fixed rate for its term
