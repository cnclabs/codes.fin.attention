summit is a real estate operating company that has elected reit status and focuses on the operation  development and acquisition of class a luxury apartment communities located throughout the southeast and mid atlantic united states  as well as in texas 
we focus our efforts in five core markets  with particular emphasis on washington  dc  southeast florida and atlanta  georgia 
our other core markets are raleigh durham and charlotte  north carolina 
while we currently operate in texas as well  we intend to exit our texas markets and use the sales proceeds from those communities to increase our presence in the washington  dc and southeast florida markets 
because we focus on certain core markets  changes in local economic and market conditions in these markets may significantly affect our current operations and future prospects 
critical accounting policies we prepare our financial statements in accordance with gaap 
a summary of our significant accounting policies is disclosed in note to our consolidated financial statements  which are included in this annual report 
the preparation of financial statements in conformity with gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
as an owner  operator  developer and acquirer of apartment communities  our critical accounting policies are related to rental revenue recognition  cost capitalization and asset impairment evaluation 
we lease our residential properties under operating leases with terms of generally one year or less 
rental revenue is recognized on the accrual method of accounting as earned  which is not materially different from revenue recognition on a straight line basis 
we lease our office and retail space under operating leases with terms ranging from two to ten years 
rental revenue for office and retail space is recognized on a straight line basis over the lives of the respective leases 
it is our policy to reduce rental revenue by the amount of rent receivable from those residents whose payments are more than days past due following move out 
we have recorded an allowance for uncollectible rent in the accompanying balance sheets for such items 
expenditures directly related to the acquisition  development and improvement of real estate assets are capitalized at cost as land  buildings and improvements or furniture  fixtures and equipment in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for costs and initial rental operations of real estate projects 
improvements are categorized as either non recurring or recurring capitalized expenditures 
non recurring capitalized expenditures primarily consist of the cost of improvements such as new garages  water submeters  gated security access and improvements made in conjunction with renovations of apartment homes 
excluding rehabilitations  recurring capitalized expenditures consist primarily of floor coverings  furniture  appliances and equipment  and exterior paint and carpentry 
repairs and maintenance  such as landscaping maintenance  interior painting and cleaning and supplies used in such activities  are expensed as incurred and we do not accrue for such costs in advance 
we capitalize interest  the cost of our development efforts directly related to apartment construction  and certain operational costs for communities under construction and in lease up 
interest costs are capitalized in accordance with sfas no 
 capitalization of interest cost  based on the ratio of those units available for rental to the total number of units in the community and depreciated over the lives of the constructed assets 
we capitalize the cost of our development department efforts to projects currently under construction  currently at a rate of of such construction assets 
such costs are then depreciated over the lives of the constructed assets upon their completion 
we treat each unit in an apartment community separately for capitalization and expense recognition purposes  resulting in a proration of interest and operational costs in a development community between costs that are capitalized or expensed 
as units become available for their intended use  we cease capitalization of interest and operational costs on those units based on the ratio of those units available for rental to the total number of units in the community 
we record our real estate assets at cost less accumulated depreciation and  if there are indications that impairment exists  adjust the carrying value of those assets in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
assets to be disposed of are recorded at the lower of carrying amount or fair value less cost to sell 
in accordance with sfas no 
 we present operating results of communities we consider held for sale  as well as those sold  in discontinued operations in our consolidated statements of earnings prospectively from the date of adoption  which was january  although the adoption of sfas no 
did not have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations for the year ended december   it did have a significant effect on the comparability of amounts presented from year to year on the consolidated statements of earnings 
historical results of operations our income from continuing operations is generated primarily from operations of our apartment communities 
the changes in operating results from period to period reflect changes in existing community performance and changes in the number of apartment homes due to development  acquisition or disposition of communities 
where appropriate  comparisons are made on a fully stabilized communities  acquisition communities  stabilized development communities  communities in lease up and disposition communities basis in order to adjust for changes in the number of apartment homes 
a community that we have acquired is deemed fully stabilized when we have owned it for one year or more as of the beginning of the current year 
a community that we have developed is deemed fully stabilized when stabilized for at least one year as of the beginning of the current year 
a community is deemed to be a stabilized development community when stabilized as of the beginning of the current year but not the entire prior year 
we consider a community to be stabilized when it has attained a physical occupancy level of at least 
a community in lease up is defined as one that has commenced rental operations but was not stabilized as of the beginning of the current year 
a community s average physical occupancy is defined as the number of apartment homes occupied divided by the total number of apartment homes contained in the community  expressed as a percentage 
average physical occupancy has been calculated using the average of the occupancy that existed on sunday during each week of the period 
average monthly rental revenue presented represents the average monthly net rental revenue per occupied apartment home 
our methodology for calculating average physical occupancy and average monthly rental revenue may differ from the methodology used by other apartment companies and  accordingly  may not be comparable to other apartment companies 
results of operations for the years ended december   and we have experienced weakening apartment fundamentals due to the downturn in the national economy as well as declining economic conditions in our core markets 
local demand for apartment homes has declined due to lower job growth and or job losses  primary drivers of apartment demand  which has led to lower rental rates and higher concessions in order to achieve increased occupancy rates 
additionally  the favorable interest rate environment has produced record homes sales which  when combined with the slowing economy  has depleted the number of prospective residents 
the favorable interest rate environment has also provided the opportunity for developers to continue to add to the supply of apartments in our core markets 
although the current economic environment is unpredictable  we expect these trends to continue in income from continuing operations before gain on sale of real estate assets  impairment loss on investments in technology companies  minority interest of common unitholders in the operating partnership  dividends to preferred unitholders in the operating partnership and extraordinary items decreased to million in from million in the primary factors causing this decrease are a million decrease in property operating income from continuing operations and an increase in depreciation expense of million due to the initiation and increase of depreciation on recently developed communities  as well as depreciation on the community acquired during the second half of  offset by the absence of a full year of depreciation on communities sold during and  all offset by a decrease in interest expense of million as a result of decreased average indebtedness outstanding and a decreased average effective interest rate 
this same measure decreased to million in from million in primarily due to a million increase in depreciation expense  a million increase in general and administrative costs primarily as a result of million of non recurring charges related to an increase in costs for abandoned pursuit projects and severance costs associated with senior staff reductions and a million increase in interest expense as a result of increased average indebtedness outstanding  all offset by increased property operating income of million 
operating performance of our portfolio of communities we evaluate community performance based on growth of property operating income  which is defined as rental and other property revenues less property operating and maintenance expense 
we believe that property operating income is a meaningful measure for an investor s analysis of community performance as it represents the most consistent  comparable operating performance among our communities 
depreciation is a fixed cost not controllable by our property management staff and not all communities are encumbered by financing instruments 
therefore  all property operating and maintenance expense amounts in this management s discussion and analysis section are presented before depreciation  interest and amortization 
property operating income does not include any allocation of corporate overhead 
you should not consider property operating income as an alternative to net income determined in accordance with gaap as an indication of our financial performance or as an alternative to cash flows from operating activities determined in accordance with gaap  as a measure of our liquidity 
our calculation of property operating income may differ from the methodology and definition used by other apartment companies  and accordingly  may not be comparable to similarly entitled measures used by other apartment companies 
a summary of our apartment homes excluding joint ventures for the years ended december   and is as follows apartment homes at the beginning of the year acquisitions developments which were completed during the year sale of apartment homes apartment homes at the end of the year the operating performance of our communities excluding joint venture communities is summarized below dollars in thousands year ended december  year ended december  change change property revenue fully stabilized communities acquisition communities stabilized development communities communities in lease up disposition communities total property revenue property operating and maintenance expense fully stabilized communities acquisition communities stabilized development communities communities in lease up disposition communities total property operating and maintenance expense property operating income fully stabilized communities acquisition communities stabilized development communities communities in lease up disposition communities property operating income interest and other income depreciation expense interest and amortization expense general and administrative expense loss income on equity investments gain on sale of real estate assets impairment loss on technology investments minority interest of common unitholders in operating partnership dividends to preferred unitholders in operating partnership extraordinary items  net of minority interest net income operating performance of our fully stabilized communities the operating performance of our fully stabilized communities is summarized below dollars in thousands  except average monthly rental revenue year ended december  year ended december  change change property revenue rental other total property revenue property operating and maintenance expense personnel advertising and promotion utilities building repairs and maintenance real estate taxes and insurance property supervision other operating expense total property operating and maintenance expense property operating income average physical occupancy average monthly rental revenue number of apartment homes number of apartment communities rental and other revenue decreased from to due to weakening fundamentals in our markets primarily driven by a decline in job growth and or an increase in job losses  residents leaving our communities to purchase homes in the low interest rate environment  and the new supply of apartment homes added to our core markets by builders taking advantage of low interest rates 
concessions at our fully stabilized communities increased by million  or  in when compared to the current level of concessions offered to residents in our markets ranges from one to three months of free rent and we expect significant concessions to continue in our core markets in as we try to maintain elevated occupancy levels 
property operating and maintenance expense increased by from to primarily due to an increase in advertising costs  personnel costs and real estate taxes and insurance costs 
the increase in advertising costs is primarily due to a increase in fees paid to locator companies for assistance in referring residents to our communities 
personnel costs increased from to primarily due to an increase in group insurance costs 
real estate taxes and insurance costs increased primarily due to an increase in property liability insurance costs of 
as a percentage of total property revenue  total property operating and maintenance expenses for our fully stabilized communities increased to in from in we expect that property operating income for our fully stabilized communities will continue to decline in based on what we believe to be reasonable assumptions as to future economic conditions and the quantity of competitive supply expected in our markets 
however  there can be no assurance that actual results will not differ from this assumption  especially due to the unpredictable nature of the current economy 
rental and other revenue increased by from to primarily due to higher average rental rates and increased revenue from sources other than rental income  such as water sub meter income  trash fees and redecorating fees 
property operating and maintenance expense increased by from to primarily due to increased personnel costs  utility costs and real estate taxes and insurance  all offset by a decrease in advertising costs 
personnel costs increased from to primarily due to a one time policy change which decreased discounts offered to employees who rent apartment homes at our communities resulting in commensurate increases in those employees salaries 
utility costs increased from to primarily as a result of rising gas prices  as well as an increase in vacant utility costs driven by lower occupancy 
real estate tax costs increased as a result of higher assessments for our communities in over  primarily in texas 
the decrease in advertising costs from to is primarily the result of a reduction in media advertising and locator fees

all of the construction revenue during the years ended december   and was from contracts with the operating partnership 
operating expenses decreased at the management company primarily due to a reduction in personnel expenses of  at the management company and construction company during the year 
the decrease in construction revenues and reduction in personnel expenses at the construction company were due to the fact that we have curtailed  and may continue to curtail  our development efforts to increase our financial flexibility in the current economic environment 
the increase in revenue from to was primarily due to an increase in fees earned from managing our lease up communities

the sale of summit breckenridge  summit new albany and summit pike creek completed our exit of richmond  virginia  columbus  ohio and wilmington  delaware 
we believe that by concentrating our efforts and capital in a limited number of core markets we will gain a competitive advantage as we improve operational efficiencies  build a more significant brand name and improve market knowledge 
also  by disposing of assets that no longer meet our long term growth objectives  capital is provided to fund the development and acquisition of new assets with higher growth potential 
in december  we announced our intention to exit our texas markets and use the sale proceeds from those communities primarily to increase our presence in the washington  dc and southeast florida markets 
as a result  we would reduce the number of core markets in which we operate from seven to five 
we currently own seven communities with a total of  apartment homes located in texas 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to sell our texas communities in a timely manner  on satisfactory terms or at all  or that we will be able to find attractive investment opportunities in the washington  dc and southeast florida markets

direct stock purchases under the drip were suspended effective october  and dividend reinvestment under the drip was suspended effective november  the drip provided both new investors and existing holders of our stock including common stock and other classes of stock which may be outstanding from time to time with a method to purchase shares of common stock under the stock purchase program component of the plan 
the plan also permitted stockholders to designate all  a portion or none of the cash dividends on their newly purchased common stock and cash dividends on their existing stock for reinvestment in more shares of common stock through the dividend reinvestment program component of the plan 
with respect to reinvested dividends and optional cash payments  shares of common stock were purchased for the plan at a discount ranging from to established from time to time from the market price  as more fully described in the prospectus relating to the plan 
common stock was purchased by the plan s agent wachovia bank directly from us or in open market or privately negotiated transactions  as determined from time to time  to fulfill requirements for the plan 
employee stock purchase plan in  we established a non qualified employee stock purchase plan espp which allowed our employees to purchase up to  of common stock per year 
the price of the shares of the common stock purchased was the lesser of percent of the closing price of such shares either on a the first day of each six month purchase period  or b the last day of each six month purchase period 
transactions under the espp were suspended effective july  employee loan program our board of directors believes that ownership of our common stock by our executive officers and certain other qualified employees aligns the interests of these officers and employees with the interests of our stockholders 
to this end  our board of directors approved  and we instituted  a loan program 
as a result of recent legislation  we are no longer permitted to make loans to our executive officers and  therefore  new issuances to our executive officers under the loan program have been terminated 
under the terms of the loan program  we lent amounts to certain of our executive officers and other qualified employees to a finance the purchase of our common stock on the open market at then current market prices  b finance the payment of the exercise price of one or more stock options to purchase shares of our common stock  or c finance the annual tax liability or other expenses of an executive officer related to the vesting of shares of common stock which constitute a portion of a restricted stock award granted to the executive officer 
the relevant officer or employee has executed a promissory note and security agreement related to each loan extended 
each outstanding note bears interest at a rate established on the date of the note  is full recourse to the officers and employees and is collateralized by the shares of our common stock which are the subject of the loans 
if the market price of summit s common stock falls materially below the price at which the shares of stock were purchased  the proceeds of the sale of the common stock may not be sufficient to repay the loan 
during the three months ended june   we issued million of loans to six executive officers 
as of december   we had loans receivable in the amount of million which were collateralized by  shares of our common stock valued at million 
the proceeds from the shares that serve as collateral for the loans would not be sufficient to repay the loans in full 
however  since the loans are full recourse  we have the right to collect any additional amount owed directly from the officer or employee to the extent such officer or employee is able to pay such amount 
we had loans receivable in the amount of million as of december  impairment loss management considers events and circumstances that may indicate impairment of an investment  including operating performance and cash flow projections 
in  management determined that our investments in broadbandnow  inc and yieldstar technology llc were impaired and that such impairment was other than temporary 
as a result  we recorded an impairment loss in the aggregate amount of million  which represents our entire investment in these two technology companies 
we have no other technology company investments

the tax exempt bond bears interest at various rates set by a remarketing agent at the demand note index plus  set weekly  or the lowest percentage of prime which allows the resale at a price of par 
the bond is enhanced by a letter of credit from a financial institution  which will terminate prior to the maturity date of the related bond

we generally refinance maturing debt instruments at then existing market interest rates and terms which may be more or less favorable than the interest rates and terms of the maturing debt 
while we have historically had limited involvement with derivative financial instruments  we may utilize such instruments in certain situations to hedge interest rate exposure by modifying the interest rate characteristics of related balance sheet instruments and prospective financing transactions 
we generally do not utilize derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes 
on january   we adopted sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  as amended 
sfas no 
establishes accounting and reporting standards for derivative instruments  including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts  and for hedging activities 
it requires that entities recognize all derivatives as either assets or liabilities in the consolidated balance sheet and measure those instruments at fair value 
the cumulative effect of adopting sfas no 
was not material to our financial statements 
on june   we terminated an interest rate swap with a million notional amount 
under sfas no 
 as a result of the termination  we de designated the million swap as a fair value hedge against certain fixed rate debt 
we will amortize as a reduction of interest expense million  which represents the difference between the par value and carrying amount of the fixed rate debt obligation  over the remaining term of the debt obligation  which matures on december  interest expense was reduced by  in as a result of amortizing this difference 
on june   we entered into an interest rate swap with a notional amount of million  relating to million of fixed rate notes issued under our mtn program 
under the interest rate swap agreement  through the maturity date of august   a we have agreed to pay to the counterparty the interest on a million notional amount at a floating interest rate of three month libor plus basis points  and b the counterparty has agreed to pay to us the interest on the same notional amount at the fixed rate of the underlying debt obligation 
the floating rate as of december  was 
the fair value of the interest rate swap was an asset of million as of december  the swap has been designated as a fair value hedge of the underlying fixed rate debt obligation and has been recorded in other assets in the accompanying balance sheets 
we assume no ineffectiveness as the interest rate swap meets the short cut method conditions required under sfas no 
for fair value hedges of debt instruments 
accordingly  no gains or losses were recorded in income relative to our underlying debt and interest rate swap 
the following table provides information about our interest rate swap and other financial instruments that are sensitive to changes in interest rates and should be read in conjunction with the accompanying consolidated financial statements and related notes

lauderdale  fl    q other development and construction costs consists primarily of land held for development and other pre development costs 
the estimated cost to complete the development communities listed above of million  our commitment to purchase summit brickell for an estimated price ranging from million to million and our commitment to purchase land for summit brookwood for million see the section entitled commitments and contingencies below  represent substantially all of our material commitments for capital expenditures as of december  factors affecting the performance of our development communities as with any development community  there are uncertainties and risks associated with the development of the communities described above 
while we have prepared development budgets and have estimated completion and stabilization target dates based on what we believe are reasonable assumptions in light of current conditions  there can be no assurance that actual costs will not exceed current budgets or that we will not experience construction delays due to the unavailability of materials  weather conditions or other events 
we also may be unable to obtain  or experience delays in obtaining  all necessary zoning  land use  building  occupancy  and other required governmental permits and authorizations 
other development risks include the possibility of incurring additional costs or liabilities resulting from increased costs for materials or labor or other unexpected costs or defects in construction material  and the possibility that financing may not be available on favorable terms  or at all  to pursue or complete development activities 
similarly  market conditions at the time these communities become available for leasing will affect the rental rates that may be charged and the period of time necessary to achieve stabilization  which could make one or more of the development communities unprofitable or result in achieving stabilization later than currently anticipated 
in addition  we are conducting feasibility and other pre development work for five communities 
we could abandon the development of any one or more of these potential communities in the event that we determine that market conditions do not support development  financing is not available on favorable terms or at all  or we are unable to obtain necessary permits and authorizations  or due to other circumstances which may prevent development 
there can be no assurance that  if we do pursue one or more potential communities  that we will be able to complete construction within the currently estimated development budgets or that construction can be started at the time currently anticipated 
americans with disabilities act and similar laws under the americans with disabilities act  all places of public accommodation are required to meet federal requirements related to access and use by disabled persons 
we believe that our communities are substantially in compliance with present requirements of the americans with disabilities act as they apply to multifamily dwellings 
a number of additional federal  state and local laws exist or may be imposed which also may require modifications to our communities or regulate certain further renovations with respect to access by disabled persons 
the ultimate amount of the cost of compliance with the americans with disabilities act or related legislation is not currently ascertainable  and while these costs are not expected to have a material effect on us  they could be substantial 
limitations or restrictions on the completion of renovations may limit application of our investment strategy in particular instances or reduce overall returns on our investments 
inflation substantially all of the leases at our communities are for a term of one year or less 
the short term nature of these leases generally serves to reduce the risk of the adverse effect of inflation 
commitments and contingencies the estimated cost to complete the four development projects currently under construction was million as of december  anticipated construction completion dates of the projects range from the second quarter of to the third quarter of we carry terrorism insurance on all communities that serve as collateral for mortgage debt  as well as on two communities which do not serve as collateral for mortgage debt  but which are located in washington  dc the terrorism insurance is subject to coverage limitations  which we believe are commercially reasonable 
no assurance can be given that material losses in excess of insurance proceeds will not occur in the future  or that insurance coverage for acts of terrorism will be available in the future 
in january  the operating partnership entered into a real estate purchase agreement with a third party real estate developer 
under the terms of the agreement  the operating partnership has agreed to purchase upon completion a class a mixed use community  which will be called summit brickell  and is located in miami  florida 
the operating partnership will purchase summit brickell upon the earlier of one year after construction completion or the achievement of occupancy 
the operating partnership may extend this closing obligation for six months after the initial purchase period 
the operating partnership expects to close on the purchase of summit brickell in the final purchase price will be determined based on budgeted construction costs plus a bonus to the developer based on the capitalized income of the property at the time of purchase 
in the event there are net cost savings during construction  a portion of such savings will be used to reduce the purchase price and a portion will be paid as an incentive to the developer pursuant to an agreed upon formula 
in the event there are net cost overruns during construction  the developer will be responsible for funding such overruns unless those overruns result from design change orders which are requested by the operating partnership  such change order overruns will be added to the purchase price 
the purchase price is expected to range from million to million 
the purchase of summit brickell by the operating partnership is subject to customary closing conditions 
the operating partnership has issued a letter of credit in the amount of million  which will serve as a credit enhancement to the developer s construction loan 
in the event that any amount under the letter of credit is drawn upon  the operating partnership shall be treated as having issued a loan to the developer in the amount of such draw 
any such loan will accrue interest at a rate of eighteen percent per year 
on may   we contributed million for a interest in a joint venture named szf  llc  which owns substantially all of the interests in a limited liability company that is developing  through a third party contractor  an apartment community in miami  florida 
the community will consist of apartment homes and  square feet of office retail space 
the limited liability company has also acquired an adjacent piece of land 
the construction costs are being funded through the equity that the joint venture contributed to the limited liability company and by a loan to that company from an unrelated third party 
in the event that construction costs exceed the construction loan amount  we have agreed to advance the amount required to fund such costs in excess of the construction loan 
this advance accrues a preferential return at the rate of eleven percent per year to be paid from the distributions from the joint venture 
as of december   we had advanced million to szf  llc 
subsequent to december   we have advanced an additional million to szf  llc 
during  we completed the development of summit brookwood  a unit apartment community located in atlanta  georgia 
as of december   we are the lessee under a land lease related to the land on which summit brookwood was constructed 
we have exercised our purchase option under the land lease to purchase the related land for million 
we expect to finalize the purchase of the land at summit brookwood during using cash and or common units in the operating partnership as consideration 
we have employment agreements with two of our former executive officers  both of whom resigned from such executive positions  but who remain as employees and have agreed to provide various services to us from time to time through december  each employment agreement requires that we pay to the former officers a base salary aggregating up to million over the period from july  to december  beginning with calendar year  up to  on an annual basis 
each employment agreement also requires that we provide participation in our life insurance plan  office space  information systems support and administrative support for the remainder of each officer s life  and participation in our health and dental insurance plans until the last to die of the officer or such officer s spouse 
either party can terminate the employment agreements  effective business days after written notice is given 
the full base salary amount due shall be payable through whether or not the agreements are terminated earlier in accordance with their terms 
funds from operations we consider funds from operations ffo to be an appropriate measure of performance of an equity reit 
we compute ffo in accordance with standards established by the national association of real estate investment trusts nareit 
ffo  as defined by nareit  represents net income loss excluding gains or losses from sales of property and extraordinary items  plus depreciation of real estate assets  and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures  all determined on a consistent basis in accordance with gaap 
our methodology for calculating ffo may differ from the methodology for calculating ffo utilized by other real estate companies  and accordingly  may not be comparable to other real estate companies 
ffo does not represent amounts available for management s discretionary use because of needed capital expenditures or expansion  debt service obligations  property acquisitions  development  dividends and distributions or other commitments and uncertainties 
ffo should not be considered as an alternative to net income determined in accordance with gaap as an indication of our financial performance or to cash flows from operating activities determined in accordance with gaap as a measure of our liquidity  nor are they indicative of funds available to fund our cash needs  including our ability to pay dividends or make distributions 
we believe ffo is helpful to investors as a measure of our performance because  along with cash flows from operating activities  financing activities and investing activities  it provides investors with an understanding of our ability to incur and service debt and make capital expenditures 
funds from operations is calculated as follows dollars in thousands net income extraordinary items extraordinary items management company minority interest of common unitholders in operating partnership gain on sale of real estate assets gain on sale of real estate assets joint ventures gain on sale of real estate assets management company adjusted net income depreciation real estate assets real estate joint venture funds from operations recurring capital expenditures non recurring capital expenditures cash flow provided by used in operating activities investing activities financing activities weighted average shares and units outstanding basic weighted average shares and units outstanding diluted recurring capital expenditures are expected to be funded from operations and consist primarily of exterior painting  new appliances  vinyl  blinds  tile  wallpaper and carpet
