item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview pac west is a provider of integrated communications services in the western united states 
our customers include internet service providers and enhanced communications service providers  collectively referred to as service providers sps  and small and medium sized enterprise sme businesses  many of which are communications intensive users 
our predecessor  also known as pac west telecomm  inc  began selling office phone systems in and reselling long distance service to small and medium sized businesses and residential customers in beginning in  our predecessor began offering paging and telephone answering services to its customers 
effective september   our predecessor transferred its telephone and answering service divisions to us 
prior to september   we did not conduct any operations and  since that time  we have disposed of the answering service division and have focused our business strategy on operating as a provider of integrated communications services we built our facilities based network to capitalize on the significant growth in internet usage and in the related demand for local telephone service by sps  as well as the increasing demand of sme businesses for customized and integrated voice and data communications services 
we believe the statewide footprint of our network  which encompasses all of the major metropolitan areas of california  provides us with a significant competitive advantage over ilecs and other clecs  particularly with regard to sp customers 
our ubiquitous network within the state of california enables sps to provide their business and residential customers with access to internet  paging and other data and voice services from almost any point in the state through a local call 
we believe the breadth of our product offerings and the structure of our network enable us to generate high network utilization  and strong gross profit margins 
for the years ended december   and we had net revenues of approximately million  million and million  respectively 
included in net revenues for the years ended december  were million from the gain recognized on the repurchase of certain of the company s senior notes and million of amounts collected in settlement for amounts owed but withheld by certain ilecs during and years prior 
the amounts collected in the settlement represent of our total revenues for operating expenses for the years ended december   and were million  million and million  respectively

net income for the year ended december  includes a gain on repurchase of bonds of million 
ebitda for the years ended december   and were million  million and million  respectively 
ebitda represents earnings before interest  net  income taxes  depreciation and amortization 
although ebitda is not a measure of financial performance under generally accepted accounting principles  we believe it is a common measure used by analysts and investors in comparing our company s results with those of our competitors as well as a means to evaluate our capacity to meet our service obligations 
the company uses ebitda as an internal measurement tool quarterly and annual performance and to compensate the entire employee base of the company during due  in part  to the achievement of targeted ebitda goals 
the company has also included ebitda performance goals in its compensation package 
accordingly  we are including ebitda in our discussion of financial performance as we believe that its presentation provides useful and relevant information 
the table below reconciles ebitda to the company s net income loss as determined in accordance with generally accepted accounting principals for each of the periods presented

in response to technology and network design evolution toward increased data and voice over internet protocol voip standards  in the fourth quarter of the company retroactively adjusted its line counting methodology to adopt industry standard bandwidth based measurement of lines in ds equivalents 
our total lines in service include wholesale and on network retail line equivalents 
the company has also segregated small to medium size lines into on network and off network components as related to the company s decision to exit a number of off network lines of business 
for the years ended december   and our minutes of use were billion  billion and billion  respectively 
the corresponding percentage increase in minutes of use on a year over year period for to and to are and  respectively 
in june  we approved a restructuring plan that contained additional business initiatives to those approved and announced in august the restructuring plan was approved in response to continuing competitive pressure from competitors who had reorganized and lowered their cost structure  overcapacity in our industry and lower demand for our products and services 
among the initiatives  the restructuring plan provides for the closure of our switch facility in colorado 
in connection with such closing  we recorded a million restructuring charge in the second quarter of of this amount  million related to the write off of the net book value of leasehold improvements and equipment  which could not be redeployed to other locations and  in management s best estimate  had a fair market value of zero  million related to circuit commitment obligations  and million related to future rent payments due for the abandoned premise in colorado  which will be paid over the respective lease term which ends in fiscal year in order to estimate rent expense  we made certain assumptions related to this abandoned premise including the time period over which the premise would remain vacant  sublease terms  and estimated sublease rents 
due to the specialized nature of the switch facility and current economic conditions in colorado  no sublease income was estimated 
we anticipate operating and selling  general and administrative savings of approximately million per quarter from the implementation of this restructuring plan  beginning in as of december   the company has a remaining liability for this restructuring activity of approximately million 
in august  in response to a weakening economy and increasing competitive pressure resulting from lower than expected demand for telecommunications services and overcapacity in our industry  we shifted our strategy to margin improvement  cost containment and cash conservation rather than top line growth the company approved and announced a restructuring plan 
among the initiatives included in the restructuring plan was the suspension of its expansion plans in certain states  exiting of certain lower margin products and services  including residential resale and customer owned and maintained coam equipment  and undertaking certain cost reduction initiatives 
in addition to restructuring certain product offerings  the company closed its switch facility in utah  consolidated six sales offices  and completed a workforce reduction of approximately employees as part of the restructuring initiative 
as a result of these restructuring initiatives  the company recorded an million restructuring charge  of which million was related to the write off of leasehold improvements and other equipment in utah 
as of december   the company has a remaining restructuring liability of million  relating to this restructuring activity 
in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
sfas  accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  and previous to the adoption of sfas  sfas no 
accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of  the company periodically evaluates the carrying amount of its property and equipment when events or changes in business circumstances have occurred which indicate the carrying amount of such assets may not be fully recoverable 
determination of impairment is based on an estimate of undiscounted future cash flows resulting from the use of the assets and their eventual disposition 
if the company determines an asset has been impaired  the impairment charge is recorded based on a comparison of the net book value of the identified fixed assets and the estimated discounted future cash flows the company expects to be generated from the use of the assets over their estimated useful lives or the fair market value of the asset if available 
during the second quarter of fiscal year  as a result of the continuing competitive pressures in the telecommunications industry  the company made certain business decisions that adversely affected the undiscounted cash flows for specific markets in which the company competes 
these decisions included refocusing the company s sales and marketing efforts primarily within california  not filling open positions outside of california  the preservation of cash for servicing and repurchasing of the company s outstanding debt and closing the company s switch facility in colorado for which the company recorded a restructuring reserve 
these decisions  which limited the resources available to grow the markets outside of california  combined with slower sales growth forecasts  caused the carrying value of the company s assets located in the markets outside of california which could not be redeployed in california to no longer be recoverable from the estimated future undiscounted cash flows 
at this time  in accordance with sfas no 
 the company recorded an impairment charge of million that represented the difference between the net book value of the identified fixed assets and the estimated discounted future cash flows the company expected to be generated from the use of these assets over the average remaining useful lives 
the company s cash flow projections for each of the company s geographic locations were developed using each locations historical growth rate 
certain locations outside of the company s primary business locations had negative cash flows over the estimated useful lives of the assets under evaluation 
due to an excess of commercial real estate availability existing in the identified markets where the company s impaired leasehold improvements existed and a remote possibility of being able to sublease the facilities  the company assigned a fair value of zero for the impaired leasehold improvements 
in the fourth quarter of  due to changes in technology and the design of the company s next generation switching equipment  certain equipment that had previously been identified as eligible for redeployment within positive cash flow markets  was no longer eligible for redeployment 
as a result  these specific assets were impaired and written down to their fair market value of million in accordance with sfas no 
the company employed the services of a professional appraisal firm to determine the fair market value of the specific assets identified as impaired 
accordingly  in the fourth quarter of  the company recorded an impairment charge of million 
to the extent actual market conditions differ significantly from management s estimates  the estimated fair market value of our long lived assets could change  which may result in a future impairment charge and such charge  if any  may be material 
during fiscal year  we purchased from holders of our senior notes an aggregate of approximately million principal amount of senior notes at a substantial discount to face value 
the differences between the amounts we paid to the holders of the senior notes and the face values of the amounts purchased and costs paid to outside parties to complete the transaction  were recorded as gains on repurchase of bonds of million for the year ended december  we have recorded the gains on repurchase of bonds in accordance with financial accounting standards board fasb issued sfas no 
 rescission of fasb statements no 
  and  amendment of fasb statement no 
 and technical corrections 
this statement  issued in april  rescinds fasb statement no 
 reporting gains and losses from extinguishment of debt  and an amendment of that statement  fasb statement no 
 extinguishments of debt made to satisfy sinking fund requirements 
the provisions of sfas no 
are effective in fiscal years beginning after may   with early adoption permitted and  in general  are to be applied prospectively 
we continue to review all of our debt obligations and are considering various alternatives to continue to reduce such obligations  including  among other things  the purchase of additional senior notes in open market and privately negotiated transactions 
on may   our common stock ceased being quoted on the nasdaq national market and began being quoted on the nasdaq smallcap market 
we are currently not in compliance with the nasdaq s minimum bid price requirement 
to regain compliance with this requirement  the minimum closing bid price of our stock must close at or above per share for a period of consecutive business days 
the bid price for our common stock has not closed above per share since august  on march  we were notified by nasdaq that we will be provided with an additional days  or until may   to regain compliance with the minimum bid price requirement 
if we are unable to regain compliance with the nasdaq s minimum bid price requirements  we expect to receive notification that our securities will be delisted from the nasdaq smallcap market 
if this happens  we may appeal the decision to a listing qualifications panel  however there can be no assurance that we will be afforded any additional time to regain compliance 
if we are delisted from the nasdaq smallcap market  there may be a further reduction in the liquidity of the market for our common stock  which may cause a material adverse effect on the price of our common stock 
delisting could reduce the ability of holders of our common stock to purchase or sell shares as quickly and as inexpensively as they could have done in the past 
this lack of liquidity would make it more difficult for us to raise capital in the future 
although we are working to comply with all continued listing requirements of nasdaq  there can be no assurance that we will be able to satisfy such requirements 
application of critical accounting policies critical accounting policies 
the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities  and reported amounts of revenues and expenses for the reporting period 
we consider certain accounting policies related to revenue recognition and the collectibility of related receivables  provision for doubtful accounts receivable  estimated settlement of disputed billings and impairment for long lived assets and goodwill to be critical policies due to the estimation processes involved in each 
by their nature  these judgments are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty 
thus  actual results could differ from estimates made and such differences could be material 
revenue recognition and collectibility of related receivable 
in compliance with the securities and exchange commission sec staff accounting bulletin no 
sab revenue recognition in financial statements  the company recognizes revenue when there is pervasive evidence of an arrangement  delivery of the product or performance of the service has occurred  the selling price is fixed and determined and collectibility is reasonably assured 
the company s adoption of sab in changed the timing of when revenue is recognized for non refundable up front payments received for installation services 
historically  these amounts have been recognized in the period received 
under the revised revenue recognition policy  these payments  and related costs up to the amount of revenues  are recognized as revenue and expense ratably over the term of the service contracts  generally to months 
any costs in excess of recognized revenues are expensed in the current period 
as of december  and   and  respectively  of installation payments received and  and  respectively  of associated costs were deferred and are included in deferred revenues and other assets  respectively  in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets 
the cumulative effect of this accounting change was  net of income tax benefit of  and was taken as a charge to the first quarter of the accounting change did not have a material effect on quarterly revenue and quarterly earnings during the company restated its results for the first three quarters of the year ended december   as reflected in note the pro forma impact of this change on years prior to has not been presented  as the impact of such change is immaterial to the individual years presented 
revenues from the sale of telecommunications products are recognized upon installation  or if no installation is required  upon shipment  which is concurrent with the transfer of legal title 
revenues from service access agreements are recognized as the service is provided  except for reciprocal compensation generated by calls placed to isps connected through the company s network 
the rights of clecs  such as the company  to receive this type of compensation is the subject of numerous regulatory and legal challenges see note 
until this issue is ultimately resolved  the company will continue to recognize reciprocal compensation as revenue when the price becomes fixed and determinable and collectibility is reasonably assured 
two ilecs with which the company has interconnection agreements see note had withheld payments from amounts billed by the company under their agreements from to in  settlements were entered into with these ilecs whereby the ilecs paid an aggregate of million to the company 
the settlements were included in revenues for the year ended december provision for doubtful accounts receivable 
provisions for allowances for doubtful accounts receivable are estimated based upon historical collection experience  customer delinquencies and bankruptcies  information provided by the company s customers  observance of trends in the industry and other current economic conditions 
if this information does not properly reflect future collections  the company s accounts receivable balance could be overstated or understated 
accruals for disputed billings 
during the ordinary course of business  the company may be billed for carrier traffic that management believes the company is not responsible for 
accordingly  the company will enter into a dispute with the appropriate vendor and withhold payment until the matter is resolved 
the company s current disputes are primarily related to incorrect facility rates or incorrect billing elements the company believes it is being charged 
management regularly reviews and monitors all disputed items and  based on industry experience  records an accrual that is representative of what it believes it may pay to settle the dispute 
although the company continues to actively try and expedite resolutions  often times the state public utilities commission must get involved to arbitrate such agreements 
this process is often not timely and resolutions often subject to appeal 
as of december   the company has accrued approximately million  representing approximately of the gross amount of disputes in negotiation at this time 
if resolutions to items in negotiation are favorable or unfavorable to management s estimations  the company s reserve for disputed items may be over or understated 
long lived assets 
in  the company adopted sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
the company evaluates its long lived assets if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such assets may not be fully recoverable 
recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to the potential future income expected to be generated by the asset 
if an asset is considered to be impaired  it is written down to its estimated fair market value 
this is assessed based on factors specific to the type of asset 
in assessing the recoverability of these assets  the company must make assumptions regarding  among other things  estimated future cash flows to determine the fair value of the respective assets 
if these estimates and the related assumptions change in the future  the company may be required to record additional impairment charges for these assets in the future 
factors affecting operations revenues 
we derive our revenues from monthly recurring charges  usage charges and amortization of initial non recurring charges 
monthly recurring charges include the fees paid by customers for lines in service and additional features on those lines  as well as equipment collocation services 
usage charges consist of fees paid by end users for each call made  fees paid by ilecs as reciprocal compensation for completion of their customers calls through our network  and access charges paid by carriers for long distance traffic terminated on our network 
initial non recurring charges consist of fees paid by end users for the installation of our service 
these payments  and related costs up to the amount of revenues  are recognized as revenue and expense ratably over the term of the service contracts  generally months 
in accordance with staff accounting bulletin no 
revenue recognition in financial statements  the company recognizes revenue when there is persuasive evidence of an arrangement  delivery of the product or performance of the service has occurred  the selling price is fixed or determinable and collectibility is reasonably assured 
a substantial portion of our revenues is derived from reciprocal compensation paid by ilecs with which we have interconnection agreements 
the revenues from these carriers are the result of interconnection agreements we have entered into with them that provide for the transport and termination of local telecommunication traffic 
reciprocal compensation payments are currently an important source of revenue for the company  and as a result  the failure  for any reason  of one or more ilecs from which we receive reciprocal compensation payments to make all or a significant portion of such payments in the future could adversely affect our financial condition 
reciprocal compensation revenue key drivers are the number of calls we terminate  the minutes of use associated with such calls and the rates we are compensated at by the ilecs 
during  we experienced a decrease of approximately in the rate at which we are compensated by the ilecs 
further rate reductions in reciprocal compensation in are anticipated 
however to date  the company has been successful in partially offsetting the impact of the rate reductions on its revenues due to increases in both the number of calls we terminate and in the total minutes of use associated with such calls 
future impact to the company s overall revenue will continue to be determined by the ability of the company to partially offset reciprocal compensation rate reductions with increased usage 
the right of clecs  such as the company  to receive reciprocal compensation is the subject of numerous regulatory and legal challenges  further described below 
until the issues surrounding reciprocal compensation are ultimately resolved  the company will continue to recognize reciprocal compensation as revenue when received in cash or when collectibility is reasonably assured 
accordingly  settlements the company receives in connection with previously withheld reciprocal compensation billings are recognized as revenue in the month the cash is received 
for the years ended december   and  reciprocal compensation was million  million and million  respectively  and accounted for approximately  and  respectively  of our total revenues 
reciprocal compensation revenue recorded in the year ended december  includes a settlement of million received from verizon california verizon  formerly known as gte  related to previously withheld reciprocal compensation billings 
in addition  on october   pac west entered into a settlement agreement with sbc communications sbc regarding various disputes between the parties for charges billed by pac west in prior fiscal years and during through august st 
under the terms of the settlement agreement  sbc agreed to pay pac west fifteen million eight hundred thousand dollars in settlement of those claims  which is also included within reciprocal compensation revenue for the year ended december  from june through december of  verizon withheld certain reciprocal compensation payments on the basis that the amounts invoiced by the company exceeded the amounts permissible under an order of the federal communications commission fcc which permitted ilecs to adopt a plan  on a statewide basis  containing such reduced rates 
the company contested verizon s withholdings before the california public utilities commission  and on january   the california public utilities commission ordered verizon to pay all such withheld reciprocal compensation of approximately million  plus interest 
on may   the california public utilities commission implemented a une unbundled network element pricing structure for local traffic exchanged with sbc in california 
a regulatory hearing is underway to determine the appropriate rate elements and costs for interconnecting local traffic between carriers in the state of california 
the impact of this pricing structure has reduced the company s reciprocal compensation revenues by approximately million per month from previous billings 
we expect that reciprocal compensation will continue to represent a significant portion of our revenues in the future  however  recorded reciprocal compensation as a percentage of revenues is expected to decline 
we are currently negotiating and implementing new interconnection agreements and the terms including reciprocal compensation 
the per minute reciprocal compensation rate we receive from sbc under our current agreement is significantly lower than it was under our previous agreement as a result of the new une pricing structure 
based on current market conditions  we expect the per minute reciprocal compensation rate could decline from historic rates under interconnection agreements in the future 
further  as discussed in note to the accompanying audited consolidated financial statements  to the extent that the april  federal regime for intercarrier compensation for isp bound traffic applies to the company and is adopted by ilecs exchanging traffic with the company  reciprocal compensation or intercarrier compensation rates will decline 
it is not possible to estimate the impact of the april  fcc regime at this time because the federal regime does not alter existing contracts except to the extent that they incorporate changes of federal law  and because adoption of the federal regime is within the discretion of the ilec exchanging traffic with clecs on a state by state basis 
in addition  the rules are the subject of petitions for reconsideration before the fcc and review on remand from the us court of appeals for the district of columbia circuit 
in the event an ilec determines not to adopt the federal regime  the ilec must pay the same rate for internet service provider bound traffic as for calls subject to reciprocal compensation 
we cannot predict the impact of the fcc s and the court s ruling on existing state decisions  the outcome of pending appeals or future litigation on this issue 
cost of sales 
costs of sales are comprised primarily of leased transport charges  usage charges for long distance and intrastate calls and  to a lesser extent  reciprocal compensation we pay to other companies related to calls that originate with a pac west customer and terminate on the network of an ilec or other clec 
our leased transport charges include the lease payments we incur for the transmission facilities  or circuits  used to connect our customers to our switches and to connect to the ilec and other clec networks 
due to our strategy of leasing rather than building our own transport facilities our operating costs provide for gross margins in excess of 
our lease commitments often have initial lease terms in excess of one year from the commitment date 
when the lease commitment is fulfilled  the lease often converts to a month to month agreement and thus reduces our future lease commitments 
in fiscal years and  our lease payments for transmission facilities increased significantly as a result of our expansion at that time 
during these years  we increased the capacity of our switching facilities in los angeles  oakland and stockton  california and completed new switching facilities in  or near  phoenix  arizona  seattle  washington  denver colorado and salt lake city  utah 
however  in connection with our restructuring initiatives announced in the third quarter of and the second quarter of  designed  among other things  to improve our capital utilization and efficiencies  our recurring circuit commitment costs have decreased from prior periods 
although we continue to look for ways to continue to reduce our operating costs  we cannot guarantee that our operating costs will continue to decline in the future 
selling  general and administrative expenses 
our selling  general and administrative expenses include network development  administration and maintenance costs  selling and marketing  customer service  provisions for doubtful accounts  information technology  billing  corporate administration and personnel

in addition  there was an increase of million in recurring charges and installation charges billed directly to sp and sme business customers and an increase of million in switched access revenues resulting from increased line growth and usage 
these increases were partially offset by a decrease of million in product and service revenues related to exiting the coam business  a decrease of million in local and long distance usage revenues and a decrease of million in dedicated transport services due primarily to declining market rates 
during  we experienced a decrease of approximately in the reciprocal compensation rate at which we are compensated at by the ilecs 
further rate reductions in reciprocal compensation in are anticipated 
however  to date  the company has been successful in partially offsetting the impact of the rate reductions on its revenues due to increases in both the number of calls we terminate and in the total minutes of use associated with such calls 
the total lines in service increased to  as of december  from  lines as of december  billable minutes of use were billion for the twelve months ended december   up from billion billed minutes during as discussed above  in response to technology and network design evolution toward increased data and voice over ip voip standards  the company has retroactively adjusted its line counting methodology to adopt industry standard bandwidth based measurement of lines in ds equivalents 
the company has also segregated sme lines into on network and off network components as related to the company s decision to exit a number of off network lines of business 
the number of inbound local minutes subject to reciprocal compensation revenues in accordance with interconnection agreements were billion and billion for the years ended december  and  respectively  while the year over year increase of billion billable minutes of use from to represented a increase 
however  the favorable increase in inbound local minutes was offset by the decline in the reciprocal compensation rate over the course of the year 
net of the effect of the negotiated settlements for reciprocal compensation of million during the year ended december   reciprocal compensation revenues decreased million from to million compared to million for the year ended december  total reciprocal compensation revenue  inclusive of settlement amounts  for the year ended december  was million 
direct billings to sp customers increased during the year ended december  from the same period in by million  or to million from million during the year ended december  this change was due to the increase in lines in service to this market from  lines at december  to  lines in service at december  the revenue effect of the increase in lines in service was partially offset by the drop in dsl revenue when the company exited the dsl market during the second quarter of direct billings to sme business customers increased during the year ended december  from the same period in by million  or to million from million during the year ended december  this change was due to the increase in lines in service from  lines at december  to  lines in service at december  the revenue effect of the increase in lines in service was partially offset by a drop in the residential resale revenue when the company exited the residential market during the second quarter of  outbound local and long distance revenues  including   and numbers and travel card calls  decreased during the year ended december  from the same period in by million or to million from million during the year ended december  although total minutes billed to customers increased between periods  the average rate per minute charged to customers declined in part to a change in the mix between local and long distance calls made by customers changed during these periods 
during the year ended december   approximately of minutes billed to customers were charges for local minutes compared to approximately in the same period ended the revenue effect was also impacted when the company made business decisions to exit certain lines of business such as residential  certain numbers and the suspension of service in states outside the company s network footprint 
the million  or  decrease in dedicated transport revenues to million during the year ended december  from million during the year ended december  primarily relates to decreases in the number of sp customers who collocate at our superpops 
as a result of comprehensive product reviews intended to identify opportunities to improve profitability undertaken in connection with the development of the restructuring plan  we decided to exit certain low margin businesses in such as coam equipment  residential resale and dsl and concentrate efforts in developing next generation offerings 
this decision contributed to decreased revenues from product and service offerings of million  or  for the year ended compared to the same period ended the significant costs and expenses of the company for the years ended december  are as follows year ended d ecember  change costs and expenses in millions cost of sales selling  general and administrative depreciation and amortization total costs and expenses our consolidated cost of sales for the year ended december  decreased million  or to million from million for the year ended december  although we continue to experience an increase in network operations associated with a higher level of minutes of use passing through our network  our cost of sales is declining from the prior year as a result of discontinuing certain low margin products and services  the business decision made by the company to shut down certain of its switch locations during and improving capital utilization 
our consolidated selling  general and administrative expenses for the year ended december  decreased million  or  to million from million for the year ended december  in first two quarters of we incurred significant selling and marketing costs in connection with our anticipated efforts to expand our operations and establish ourselves in new markets before the decision was made to implement the restructuring plan  which provided for  among other things  a workforce reduction 
our headcount remained fairly stable throughout with employees as of december  compared to employees at december  during the fourth quarter of the company completed a work force reduction of approximately employees as part of its restructuring plan 
as anticipated  the workforce reduction resulted in payroll savings of approximately million for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  selling  general and administrative expenses for the year ended december  also include approximately million of provision for doubtful accounts compared to million for the year ended december   a decrease of million 
during the company experienced an unusually high level of delinquencies and bankruptcies in its customer base 
this was primarily due to the company s mix of customers  which included among others residential  paging and coam 
the company exited these product lines during and early due in part to the high level of delinquencies experienced in on these product lines 
in addition  the company s sp customer base contracted as the smaller  less financially stable customers were forced to restructure  or failed to survive 
the company s overall sp lines in service and sp revenues were not directly affected by this contraction as the company s larger sp customers absorbed many of the smaller sp customers end user base 

partially offsetting these costs savings  however  were additional legal expenses incurred in connection with the company s efforts to defend its position on various reciprocal compensation proceedings described above in factors affecting operations  and additional maintenance and property tax expense incurred on purchases of equipment between the years 
selling  general and administrative expenses were and of revenues for the years ended december  and respectively 
our consolidated depreciation and amortization expense for the year ended december  increased million to million from million for the year ended december  depreciation and amortization as a percentage of revenues increased to for the year ended december  from from the year ended december  the increase in depreciation and amortization expense was primarily due to additional depreciation expense incurred related to significant capital purchases between years 
during the year ended december the company purchased an additional million of property and equipment 
our consolidated interest expense for the year ended december  decreased million to million from million for the year ended december  interest expense is net of capitalized interest 
interest expense over these two years is primarily related to the million senior notes issued on january   including amortization of related deferred financing costs associated with the offering over a period of ten years 
as a result of purchasing form holders of our senior notes an aggregate of approximately million principal amount of senior notes during  described above  interest expense on our senior notes declined between the years 
however  these interest savings were partially offset by a reduction of capitalized interest of million and million for the twelve months ended december  and respectively 
our consolidated interest income for the year ended december  decreased million to million from million for the year ended december  this decrease is primarily related to lower cash balances between the years 
interest income includes realized gains and losses on investments

in  we increased the capacity of our switching facilities in los angeles  oakland and stockton  california and completed new switching facilities in  or near  phoenix  arizona  denver  colorado and salt lake city  utah our restructuring plan provided for the closure of our utah switch facility  which was closed in december 
as a result of additional switching facilities  increased utilization of expanded switch capacities and acquisitions completed during  our revenues for the year ended december  increased million  or  from the same period ended in the total lines in service increased to  as of december  from  lines as of december  billable minutes of use were billion for the twelve months ended december   up from billion billed during the same period in the number of inbound local minutes subject to reciprocal compensation revenues in accordance with interconnection agreements  for the year ended december  over the same period ended the minutes subject to reciprocal compensation increased billion minutes to billion minutes in from billion minutes in however  favorable revenues from increased inbound local calls and minutes was almost entirely offset as one ilec with which we have an interconnection agreement  refused to pay that portion of reciprocal compensation due under their interconnection agreement that they estimated was in excess of the payments required if the rate structure pursuant to the fcc order on remand was applicable to our interconnection agreement with them

as a result of normal attrition and the workforce reduction  our headcount was reduced to employees as of december  from employees at december  in addition  selling  general and administrative expenses for the year ended december  include approximately million of provision for doubtful accounts reflective of the softening economy and increased delinquencies and bankruptcies  an increase of million from the same period ended selling  general and administrative expenses were and of revenues for the years ended december  and  respectively

liquidity and capital resources net cash provided by operating activities was million for the year ended december  as compared to million for the same period ended in one of the primary differences between the periods was attributable to settlements received from ilecs for amounts previously owed  but withheld  during that totaled million 
excluding this transaction the net cash provided by operating activities increased million for the year ended december  over the significant activities which comprised this change were recognized cost savings due to the company s previously announced restructuring plans in and along with its on going actions to review and implement process improvements designed to decreased costs resulted in cost savings of million of cost of sales and million in selling  general and administrative costs  an increase of million in the company s accrued payroll and other liabilities  an increase in our depreciation and amortization expenses of million due primarily to a full year of depreciation being recognized in on million of switching and related equipment placed in service during  a million change in deferred income tax benefit and million change in the income tax receivable due to the income tax planning strategies put into effect by the company during these increases were partially off set by a decrease in revenues  exclusive of the settlements received  of million for the year ended december  compared to december  due primarily to market pricing pressures and regulatory decisions effected during pertaining to reciprocal compensation rates 
during  we experienced a decrease of approximately in the rate at which we are compensated at by the ilecs 
further rate reductions in reciprocal compensation in are anticipated 
however to date  the company has been successful in partially offsetting the impact of the rate reductions on its revenues due to increases in both the number of calls we terminate and in the total minutes of use associated with such calls 
future impact to the company s overall revenue will continue to be determined by the ability of the company to partially offset reciprocal compensation rate reductions with increased usage 
there can be no assurance that the company will be successful in its ability to offset future rate reductions by increased usage

in addition  the company made million in payments on its outstanding capital leases during the year ended december  compared to million for the same period ended the telecommunications service business is capital intensive 
our operations have required substantial capital investment for the design  acquisition  construction and implementation of our network 
capital expenditures  including amounts financed under capital leases  were million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
approximately million of capital expenditures made during and are included in construction projects in progress as of december  and therefore are not being depreciated until they are placed in service in in response to the weakening economy and the significant negative industry trends including bankruptcies and depressed valuations of public telecommunication companies  we have undertaken various initiatives intended to not only maximize our performance  but to take advantage of emerging opportunities 
our business plan  as currently contemplated  anticipates capital expenditures  excluding acquisitions  of approximately million in however  the actual cost of capital expenditures during will depend on a variety of factors 
accordingly  our actual capital requirements may exceed  or fall below  the amounts described above 
our senior credit facility which provided for maximum borrowings of up to million and bore interest  at the option of the base rate  as defined in the senior credit facility  or the libor rate  as defined in the senior credit facility  plus between and  expired on june  at the time we had million of outstanding principal at a borrowing rate of approximately which was repaid in full on june  we are currently considering various alternatives to replace our senior credit facility 
however  there can be no assurance we will be successful in obtaining additional capital sources at rates and terms acceptable to the company 
our principal sources of funds for are anticipated to be current cash and short term investment balances and cash flows from operating activities 
we believe that these funds will provide us with sufficient liquidity and capital resources for us to fund our business plan through no assurance can be given  however  that this will be the case 
as currently contemplated  we expect to fund  among other things  our semi annual interest payments of approximately million each  anticipated capital expenditures of approximately million  capital lease payments including interest of approximately million and repayment of our fiber iru obligation of million 
the foregoing statements do not take into account additional acquisitions which  if made  are expected to be funded through a combination of cash and equity or the repurchase of any of our remaining outstanding senior notes 
depending upon our rate of growth and profitability  among other things  we may require additional equity or debt financing to meet our working capital requirements or capital needs 
there can be no assurance that additional financing will be available when required  or  if available  will be on terms satisfactory to us 
key factors with could affect our liquidity include future demand of our services  financial stability of our customers  outcomes of regulatory proceedings involving reciprocal compensation  capital expenditures  and our debt payments 
our senior notes indenture contain financial and other covenants that restrict  among other things  our ability to incur additional indebtedness  incur liens  pay dividends or make certain other restricted payments  consummate certain asset sales  enter into certain transactions with affiliates  merge or consolidate with any other person or sell  assign  transfer  lease  convey or otherwise dispose of substantially all of our assets 
such limitations could limit corporate and operating activities  including our ability to respond to market conditions to provide for unanticipated capital investments or to take advantage of business opportunities 
the company is in compliance with its financial covenants 
inflation we do not believe that inflation has had any material effect on our business over the past three years 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the sec s rule related to market risk disclosure requires that we describe and quantify our potential losses from market risk sensitive instruments attributable to reasonably possible market changes 
market risk sensitive instruments include all financial or commodity instruments and other financial instruments that are sensitive to future changes in interest rates  currency exchange rates  commodity prices or other market factors 
we are not exposed to market risks from changes in foreign currency exchange rates or commodity prices 
we do not hold derivative financial instruments nor do we hold securities for trading or speculative purposes 
at december   we had outstanding million principal amount of fixed rate notes due  and consequently we currently have no risk exposure associated with increasing interest rates on our debt 
additionally  we are exposed to changes in interest rates on our investments in cash equivalents and short term investments 
substantially all of our investments in cash equivalents and short term investments are in money market funds that hold short term investment grade commercial paper  treasury bills or other us government obligations 
currently this reduces our exposure to long term interest rate changes 
we do not use interest rate derivative instruments to manage our exposure to interest rate changes 
a hypothetical basis point decline in short term interest rates would reduce the annualized earnings on our million of cash and cash equivalents and short term investments at december  by approximately million
