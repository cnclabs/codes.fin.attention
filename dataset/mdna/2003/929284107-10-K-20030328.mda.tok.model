overview we design  develop and manufacture innovative  high quality commercial communications products that enable voice  data and image transport over wireless and broadband cable networks around the world 
our products are comprised of advanced  highly functional rf semiconductors  components and integrated assemblies which address the radio frequency challenges of both current and next generation wireless and broadband cable networks 
these products are used by telecommunication equipment manufacturers  in the network infrastructure supporting and facilitating mobile communications and enhanced voice services 
we believe our core expertise in semiconductor technology  coupled with our exceptional rf design  integration  and manufacturing capabilities  are critical to our long term success 
when we began our operations in the commercial communications market  we initially benefited from significant increases in spending on capital equipment by communications service providers  which resulted in increased demand for our products 
however  during and  the demand for telecommunications equipment has been very weak 
this weakness in demand is currently projected to continue throughout and potentially beyond based on customer forecasts for the purchase of our products 
the primary reason for this weakness in recent and forecasted demand for these products is an overall decline in capital spending by communication service providers resulting in our customers attempting to reduce their inventory levels 
a significant contributing factor to the decline in capital expenditures has been the numerous early stage communication service providers  who have previously been able to access the capital markets  that are having difficulties in finding new sources of capital and  in certain instances  have filed for bankruptcy 
in addition  several of the more established service providers financed the build out of their networks with debt 
many of these service providers have shifted their focus to debt reduction and profitability enhancement 
as a result  we believe that these companies have had to greatly reduce their capital expenditures 
this reduction in capital expenditures is being accentuated by the general economic slowdown  which is having a negative impact on communication service providers revenues and profitability 
on a long term basis  we believe that the demand for commercial communications equipment and our products will rebound 
during  we have introduced several new products which will further position us to benefit from the roll out of g and g wireless and cable access television catv 
in  we introduced forty new rf semiconductor products primarily targeted at wireless infrastructure applications and achieved over one hundred new design wins at major original equipment manufacturers oems 
during  we concentrated our resources on the development of rf semiconductors and expect to maintain our accelerated pace of new product introductions and design wins 
while customer interest  new product introductions  accelerating pace of design wins and new orders are encouraging  there is no assurance that they will have a positive impact on our overall sales 
our manufacturing operations are highly automated which has required us to make significant investments in equipment and fixed overhead 
as a result  the volume of product we produce and sell has a significant impact on our gross profit margin 
until demand increases  the slow down in spending on commercial communications equipment will negatively impact our gross margin 
in addition  we typically generate lower gross margin on new product introductions 
over time  we typically become more efficient relative to new products through learning and increased volumes as well as through introducing lower cost elements to the product designs 
we expect our new product introductions to continue to be a higher percentage of our sales mix  which will continue to have a temporary negative impact on our gross margin 
in addition  new product lines contain a greater degree of uncertainty due to a lack of visibility and predictability of customer demand and potential competition which will contribute to a higher level of inventory risk in our near future 
since the beginning of  we have been taking aggressive steps designed to more closely align our production costs with our customers current forecasted demand for our products 
as part of this effort  we reduced our workforce by approximately during and reduced non employee costs including sales and marketing  general and administrative  and overhead expenses 
our cost reduction initiatives have also included temporary shutdowns of our manufacturing facilities and significant reductions in capital spending 
we took further action in the third quarter of  primarily directed at production costs  by reducing our workforce by an additional  initiating a plan to sell excess manufacturing equipment and by consolidating our manufacturing operations and abandoning our excess leased space under our second restructuring plan see note to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this form k 
during  we began to design and manufacture semiconductors utilizing other manufacturing technologies at third party foundries 
we believe that this approach is required in order to continue to offer competitive products and expect that a greater number of our future products would be developed in this fashion 
in december  we determined that over the course of  we will transition to a fully outsourced business model and we recorded related restructuring charges as described in note to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this form k 
we believe that this business strategy offers considerable advantages such as allowing us to focus our resources on product development and marketing  minimizing capital expenditures  reducing operating expenses  allowing us to continue to offer competitive pricing  reducing time to market  reducing technology and product risks and facilitating the migration of our products to new process technologies  which reduce costs and optimize performance 
however  there are also significant business risks associated with our dependence upon third parties for our manufacturing needs and there can be no assurance that our outsourcing strategy will be a success 
we expect that reduced end customer demand  underutilization of our manufacturing capacity while we transition to a fully outsourced business model and other factors will continue to adversely affect our operating results in the near term and we anticipate incurring additional losses in in order to return to profitability  we must achieve substantial revenue growth and we currently face an environment of uncertain demand in the markets our products address 
we cannot assure you as to whether or when we will return to profitability or whether we will be able to sustain such profitability  if achieved 
sales we sell our products predominantly to large equipment manufacturers and service providers in the broadband cable and wireless network infrastructure markets 
our major customers provide forecasted demand on at least a monthly basis  which assists us in managing our inventory requirements 
these forecasts  however  are subject to changes  including changes as a result of market conditions  and could fluctuate from quarter to quarter 
we depend on a small number of customers for a majority of our sales 
during the year ended december   we had three customers which each accounted for more than of our sales and in aggregate accounted for of our sales 
those customers were lucent technologies  nortel networks and richardson electronics including sales to their respective manufacturing subcontractors 
during the year ended december   we had four customers which each accounted for more than of our sales and in aggregate accounted for of our sales 
those customers were lucent technologies  marconi communications  nortel networks and richardson electronics including sales to their respective manufacturing subcontractors 
during the year ended december   we had two customers which each accounted for more than of our sales and in aggregate accounted for approximately of our sales 
those customers were lucent technologies and nortel networks including sales to their respective manufacturing subcontractors 
we have diversified our customer base over the last few years and intend to further diversify our customer base and product offering in the future 
however  we anticipate that we will continue to sell a majority of our products to a relatively small group of customers 
in addition  most of our sales result from purchase orders or contracts that can be cancelled on short term notice 
delays in manufacturing or supply procurement or other factors  including general market slow downs  have caused and could potentially continue to cause cancellation  reduction or delay in orders by or in shipments to a significant customer 
during and throughout  the demand for telecommunications equipment has been very weak 
we project this weakness in demand to continue throughout and potentially beyond based on customer forecasts for the purchase of our products 
if the markets for our products in broadband cable or wireless communications decline  fail to grow  or grow more slowly than we anticipate  the use of our products may be reduced with a significant negative impact on our sales  earnings  inventory valuations and cash flow 
revenues from product sales are recognized when all of the following conditions are met the product has been shipped  we have the right to invoice the customer at a fixed price  the collection of the receivable is probable and there are no significant obligations remaining 
generally  title passes upon shipment of our products 
certain contracts are under a consignment arrangement under which title to our products does not pass until the customer utilizes these products in its production processes 
as a consequence  we recognize revenue on these contracts only when the customer notifies us of product consumption 
in addition to our internal sales efforts  we use a distributor to sell semiconductor products 
on june   the company announced it had entered into a sole distributorship agreement with richardson electronics  ltd 
revenues from this distributor are recognized upon shipment based on the following factors our sales price is fixed and determinable by contract at the time of shipment  payment terms are fixed at shipment and are consistent with terms granted to other customers  the distributor has full risk of physical loss  the distributor has separate economic substance  we have no obligation with respect to the resale of the distributor s inventory  and we believe we can reasonably estimate the potential returns from our distributor based on their history and our visibility in the distributor s success with its products and into the market place in general 
during the quarter ending july   we began using two distributors for sales of certain fixed wireless products 
lacking history with these distributors  we recorded revenue on these fixed wireless products at the time of the distributors sale to the ultimate end customer 
during the quarter ending march   we terminated our agreements with these two distributors as part of our exit from the fixed wireless customer premise equipment cpe market 
based on specific terms of the customer contract or purchase order  we may negotiate a final delivery and settlement in connection with customer order cancellations 
due to the uncertain and lengthy nature of these negotiations  a substantial portion  if not all  of the inventory subject to the cancellation may be written off 
in the fourth quarter of  we reached final agreement with one customer and recognized revenue of million related to the delivery of specific fixed wireless products that have previously been written off 
in the first quarter of  we completed a second fixed wireless contract with one customer resulting in million of sales for final product delivery 
substantially all of this inventory had been written off in in the second quarter of  we completed our largest long haul fiber optic contract for our oc dielectric resonator oscillator dro resulting in million of sales 
approximately million of the million of inventory associated with this transaction had been written off in the first quarter of the resulting margin was similar to other deliveries of this product 
in the future  we anticipate that similar arrangements for final deliveries could be made with other customers upon completion of major contracts  however there can be no assurance that this will occur 
generally  the selling prices of our products decrease over time as a result of increased volumes or general competitive pressures 
we expect that prices will continue to decline as a result of volume increases or these competitive pressures 
cost of goods sold our cost of goods sold consists primarily of direct material costs of product components  production wages  taxes and benefits  costs of assembly and test by third party contract manufacturers  labor contracted on a temporary basis  supplies consumed in the manufacturing process  depreciation and amortization of manufacturing and test equipment and leasehold improvements  lease expense for our manufacturing facilities  allocated occupancy costs  scrapped material used in the production process  and provision for excess and obsolete inventory 
we recognize cost of goods sold upon recognition of revenue 
we recognize losses on contracts  including purchase order commitments  when identified 
operating expenses our operating expenses are classified into two general categories research and development  and selling and administrative 
we classify all charges to these two categories based on the nature of the expenditures 
although each of these two categories includes expenses that are unique to the category type  there are commonly recurring expenditures that are typically included in these categories  such as wages  fringe benefit costs  depreciation and allocated overhead 
research and development research and development expense represents wages  supplies and allocated overhead costs to design  develop and improve products and processes 
these costs are expensed as incurred 
selling and administrative selling and administrative expense consists primarily of wages  travel and facility costs incurred by and other expenses allocated to our selling and administrative departments 
selling and administrative expense also includes manufacturer representatives and distributor sales commissions  trade show and advertising expenses and fees and expenses of legal  accounting  and other professional consultants 
amortization of deferred stock compensation we have recorded deferred stock compensation representing the differential between the deemed fair value of our common stock and the exercise price at the date of grant for options or date of sale for stock purchases 
we are amortizing this amount using the straight line method over the vesting period of the options granted 
recapitalization merger and other our recapitalization merger and other expense is a non recurring expenditure comprised of expenses incurred by the special committee to our board of directors to review the proposal from an affiliate  fox paine company llc to acquire all of the shares of company common stock held by unaffiliated stockholders for per share in cash 
these expenses include legal and financial consulting fees as well as compensation to the members of the special committee 
our recapitalization merger and other expense is a non recurring expenditure comprised of employee retention and severance compensation  legal  professional and other costs associated with our recapitalization merger and the sale of our telecommunications group 
restructuring charge our restructuring charge reflects our decision to abandon a leased facility based on revised anticipated demand for our products and current market conditions 
it is comprised of future lease payments net of anticipated sublease income  broker commissions and other facility costs  and an asset impairment charge on tenant improvements 
in determining this estimate  we have made certain assumptions with regards to our ability to sub lease the space and have reflected off setting assumed sub lease income in line with our best estimate based on the current market conditions 
our restructuring charge reflects further consolidation and abandonment of leased space and associated impairment of tenant improvements  severance costs  an asset impairment charge and the initiation of a program to sell excess manufacturing equipment resulting from the prolonged downturn in the telecommunications industry  especially related to our fiber optics products 
the restructuring charge also includes an additional charge for the leased facility we abandoned in based on our downward revised assumptions regarding sublease occupancy rates and market rates due to an overall deteriorating real estate market and difficulties encountered in subleasing the available space 
also during  we recorded a restructuring charge related to our decision in december to completely outsource our internal wafer fabrication within one year 
as a result of the planned fab closure  we have accrued associated severance expenses  accrued the eventual abandonment of additional excess space for which we will have a remaining two year commitment and recorded an impairment on our internal wafer fabrication equipment and related leasehold improvements 
critical accounting policies our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on a continuous basis  we evaluate all our significant estimates including those related to doubtful accounts receivable  inventory valuation  impairment of long lived assets  income taxes  restructuring including accruals for abandoned lease properties  contingencies and litigation 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstance  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions and such differences could be material 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
see note to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this form k for a detailed discussion of all our significant accounting policies 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue in accordance with sec staff accounting bulletin sab no 
 revenue recognition in financial statements  as amended 
sab requires that four basic criteria must be met before revenue can be recognized persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred or services rendered  the fee is fixed or determinable  and collectibility is reasonably assured 
determination of criteria and are based on management s judgments regarding the fixed nature of the fee charged for services rendered and products delivered and the collectibility of those fees 
revenues from our distributor are recognized upon shipment based on the following factors our sales price is fixed and determinable by contract at the time of shipment  payment terms are fixed at shipment and are consistent with terms granted to other customers  the distributor has full risk of physical loss  the distributor has separate economic substance  we have no obligation with respect to the resale of the distributor s inventory  and we believe we can reasonably estimate the potential returns from our distributor based on their history and our visibility in the distributor s success with its products and into the market place in general 
should changes in conditions cause management to determine these criteria are not met for certain future transactions  revenue recognized for any reporting period could be adversely affected 
in addition  failure to obtain anticipated orders or delays or cancellations of orders or significant pressure to reduce prices from key customers could have a material adverse effect on our revenue 
allowance for doubtful accounts we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
management specifically analyzes accounts receivable and historic bad debts  changes in customer credit worthiness  current economic trends and changes in our customer payment terms when evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
material differences may result in the amount and timing of expenses for any period if management made different judgments or utilized different estimates 
our allowance for doubtful accounts was approximately  as of december  approximately of our accounts receivable as of december  was concentrated with our top three customers  each  including their respective manufacturing subcontractors  accounting for more than of our sales  and in aggregate accounting for of our sales in write down of excess and obsolete inventory we write down our inventory for estimated obsolescence or unmarketable inventory equal to the difference between the cost of inventory and the estimated market value based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions 
management specifically identifies obsolete products and analyzes historical usage  forecasted production based on demand forecasts  current economic trends and historical write offs when evaluating the adequacy of the provision for excess and obsolete inventory 
due to rapidly changing customer forecasts and orders  additional write downs of excess or obsolete inventory  while not currently expected  could be required in the future 
in addition  the sale of previously written down inventory could result from significant unforeseen increases in customer demand 
material differences in estimates of excess and obsolete inventory may result in the amount and timing of cost of sales for any period if management made different judgments or utilized different estimates 
income taxes as part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements  we are required to estimate our income tax provision benefit in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate 
this process involves us estimating our current income tax provision benefit together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items for tax and accounting purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included within our consolidated balance sheet 
we record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
while we have considered future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for the valuation allowance  in the event we were to determine that we would be able to realize our deferred tax assets in the future in excess of our net recorded amount  an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would increase income in the period such determination was made 
likewise  should we determine that we would not be able to realize all or part of our net deferred tax asset in the future  an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would be charged to income in the period such determination was made 
management believes that it is more likely than not that its deferred tax assets will be realized through refunds from the carryback of our net operating loss 
restructuring during fiscal and  we recorded significant restructuring charges representing the direct costs of exiting certain product lines or businesses and the costs of downsizing our business 
such charges were established in accordance with eitf liability recognition for certain employee termination benefits and other costs to exit an activity including certain costs incurred in a restructuring 
these charges include abandoned leased properties comprised of future lease payments net of anticipated sublease income  broker commissions and other facility costs  and asset impairment charges on tenant improvements deemed no longer realizable 
in determining these estimates  we make certain assumptions with regards to our ability to sublease the space and reflected offsetting assumed sublease income in line with our best estimate of current market conditions 
should there be a further significant change in market conditions  the ultimate losses on these could be higher and such amount could be material 
during  we recorded restructuring charges of million related to restructuring activities initiated in and also recorded additional charges of million related to restructuring activities initiated in  primarily due to changes in estimated sublease income 
impairment of long lived assets in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no  accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  we review long lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable 
factors we consider that could trigger an impairment review include the following significant underperformance relative to expected historical or projected  future operating results  significant changes in the manner of our use of the acquired assets or the strategy for our overall business  significant negative industry or economic trends  or significant technological changes  which would render equipment and manufacturing process obsolete 
recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of these assets to future undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by these assets 
if such assets are considered to be impaired  the impairment to be recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceeds the fair value of the assets 
during  the company recognized an asset impairment of million for assets held and used and million for assets held for sale which are included in the consolidated statements of operations under restructuring charge see note to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this form k for further discussion of our impaired long lived assets 
significant management judgment is required in the forecasting of future operating results which are used in the preparation of projected cash flows and should different conditions prevail  material write downs of our long lived assets could occur 
current operations the following table sets forth certain statements of operations data expressed as a percentage of sales for the periods indicated 
as a result of our new products  our increased infrastructure  changing market conditions and other factors  the historical percentages and comparisons set forth below may not reflect our expected future operations 
percentage of sales year ended december  consolidated statements of operations data sales cost of goods sold gross profit operating expenses research and development selling and administrative amortization of deferred stock compensation recapitalization merger and other restructuring charge total operating expenses loss from operations interest income interest expense other income expense net gain on dispositions of real property income loss from continuing operations before income taxes income tax provision benefit loss from continuing operations comparison of years ended december  and sales we recognized million and million in sales for the fiscal years ended december  and  respectively 
this million or decrease in sales resulted primarily from a decline in the sale of our wireless products 
wireless product sales during totaled million  representing of total sales and a decrease of from wireless product sales for the first quarter of included million for final product delivery of our last major fixed wireless contract 
wireless product sales for the the fourth quarter of included million related to the final delivery of specific fixed wireless products under that contract 
we expect only minimal revenues from fixed wireless cpe products in future quarters 
semiconductor sales during totaled million  representing of total sales and a decrease of from our rf semiconductor sales in benefited from carryover demand from the strong telecommunications market of fiber optic sales decreased to million in due to the overall weakness in the long haul fiber optic market 
fiber optic sales represented of total sales for based on the protracted lack of demand for long haul fiber optic products  we have decided to exit that business after current contractual obligations have been satisfied 
we expect only minimal revenue from these products in the next quarter 
cost of goods sold our cost of goods sold for was million  a decrease of million or as compared with cost of goods sold of million in as a percentage of sales  our cost of goods sold decreased to of sales in from in the decrease in our cost of goods sold as a percentage of sales primarily relates to the following costs which were incurred in a million write down of excess and obsolete inventory  approximately  of severance expenses related to manufacturing personnel  and high variable costs on fixed wireless products which were being transitioned into manufacturing 
the million write down of excess and obsolete inventory largely related to inventory ordered to build base station products for our largest mobile wireless customer 
inventory levels of this product were purchased based on this customer s forecasted demand which had since been revised downward 
in addition  given the overall slowdown in market demand  we made write downs for other product lines where customer forecasts have significantly declined 
during  our cost of goods sold benefited from the sale of million of fixed wireless cpe inventory of which million had been previously written off in due to rapidly changing customer forecasts and orders  additional write downs of excess or obsolete inventory  while not currently expected  could be required in the future 
in addition  the sale of previously written down inventory could result from significant unforeseen increases in customer demand 
in addition  cost of goods sold has benefited from approximately million in savings of salaries  fringe benefits and payroll taxes due to our manufacturing workforce reductions initiated during in absolute dollars  the decrease in our cost of goods sold reflects the factors noted above as well as our decline in sales during we have a significant amount of unabsorbed overhead costs related to the increased manufacturing infrastructure we put in place to support our customers demand in the second half of this increased infrastructure includes  among other things  a new manufacturing facility and investments in equipment 
our restructuring program will mitigate our unabsorbed overhead through the write down of excess facilities and equipment  but we will still have fixed manufacturing costs that these efforts will not impact 
given the current economic slowdown  increased capacity may not be fully utilized and the ongoing costs thereof will still be incurred until such time as the market demand for our products increases 
in addition  we typically generate lower gross margin on new product introductions which we expect to be a higher percentage of our sales mix going forward 
over time  we typically become more efficient relative to new products through learning and increased volumes as well as through introducing lower cost elements to the product designs 
new product lines also contain a greater degree of inventory risk due to uncertainty regarding a lack of visibility and predictability of customer demand and potential competition 
research and development our research and development expense for was million  an increase of approximately  or as compared with research and development expense of million in during  we have greatly increased our expenditures on rf semiconductor development projects while significantly reducing or eliminating development efforts on other product lines 
research and development efforts in were attributable to increased spending on the development of fixed wireless broadband cpe  new rf semiconductor and new fiber optic products 
as a percentage of sales  research and development expenses increased to of sales in from of sales in the increase in research and development expense as a percentage of sales primarily relates to our decline in sales 
product research and development is essential to our future success and we expect to continue to make investments in new product development and engineering talent 
in particular  we will continue to focus our research efforts and resources on rf semiconductor development 
selling and administrative selling and administrative expense for was million or of sales  a decrease of million or as compared with selling and administrative expense of million or of sales in the decrease in absolute dollars is primarily related to reduced commission  advertising and promotion expenses  legal expenses and rent expense 
the reduced rent expense is related to our decision to abandon our new leased facility in september see note to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report 
until that time  the rent expense for that excess office space was included in selling and administrative expense 
as a percentage of sales  the increase in selling and administrative expense reflected the decrease in sales during amortization of deferred stock compensation amortization of deferred stock compensation expense in includes approximately  related to the granting of restricted stock during at a price below fair market value and the issuance of stock options during at prices deemed below fair market value 
amortization of deferred stock compensation expense in includes approximately  related to the issuance of stock options during at prices deemed below fair market value 
as of december   the balance of our remaining unamortized deferred stock compensation was approximately  to be amortized over the next months 
recapitalization merger and other we incurred recapitalization merger and other expense of  in related to our consideration of the proposed fox paine transaction 
on september   we announced the receipt of a proposal from an affiliate  fox paine company llc fox paine to acquire all of the shares of our common stock held by unaffiliated stockholders for per share in cash the acquisition proposal 
fox paine and its affiliates currently own approximately of our outstanding shares or approximately million shares of a total of approximately million shares outstanding 
our board of directors formed a special committee composed of two independent directors not affiliated with fox paine the special committee to review the acquisition proposal 
the special committee has retained its own independent legal and financial advisors to assist in reviewing the acquisition proposal 
these expenses include legal and financial consulting fees as well as compensation to the members of the special committee 
we expect these expenses to continue into and that they will be significant 
restructuring charge during  we have recorded a restructuring charge of million reflecting consolidation and abandonment of leased space and associated impairment of tenant improvements  severance costs  an asset impairment charge and the initiation of a program to sell excess manufacturing equipment resulting from the prolonged downturn in the telecommunications industry  especially related to our fiber optics products 
in the third quarter of  we decided to abandon a portion of our leased facility based on revised anticipated demand for our products and current market conditions 
this excess space  for which we have a remaining eight year commitment  is located on the first floor of our current corporate headquarters and originally housed a portion of our optics and integrated assemblies manufacturing operations 
this decision has resulted in a lease loss of million  comprised of future lease payments net of anticipated sublease income  broker commissions and other facility costs  and an asset impairment charge of million on tenant improvements deemed no longer realizable 
in determining this estimate  we made certain assumptions with regards to our ability to sublease the space and reflected offsetting assumed sublease income in line with our best estimate of current market conditions 
in addition  our management made a decision during the third quarter of to exit the fiber optics business after current contractual obligations have been satisfied 
this decision has resulted in a significant overcapacity of certain manufacturing equipment and we initiated a plan to sell this equipment before the end of the first quarter of our excess manufacturing equipment resulted in a total charge of million 
assets to be held for sale are measured at the lower of carrying amount or fair value less cost to sell 
fair market value was determined by obtaining an independent third party appraisal 
the majority of these impaired assets was sold in the fourth quarter of also during the third quarter of  our management identified manufacturing equipment exclusively supporting certain in warranty optics and fixed wireless products as well as manufacturing equipment supporting final orders for certain other optics and fixed wireless products and determined that the estimated future cash flows did not support the carrying value of these assets 
as such  the carrying value of these assets were written down to the estimated future cash flows that are directly associated with and that are expected to arise as a direct result of the use and eventual disposition of these assets 
fair market value was determined by obtaining an independent third party appraisal 
this action resulted in a  asset impairment charge 
during  we incurred severance expense of approximately  related to a reduction of approximately employees 
approximately  of the accrued severance expense was paid by december  also during  we recorded a restructuring charge of million related to our decision in december to completely outsource our internal wafer fabrication within one year 
as a result of the fab closure  approximately of the company s workforce approximately employees will be eliminated  which will result in severance payments of approximately  during the fourth quarter of the closure of the fab located at our milpitas facility will result in additional excess space of approximately  square feet for which we will have a remaining two year commitment 
this decision has resulted in a lease loss of million  comprised of future lease payments net of anticipated sublease income  broker commissions and other facility costs 
in determining this estimate  we made certain assumptions with regards to its ability to sublease the space and reflected offsetting assumed sublease income in line with our best estimate of current market conditions 
the decision to utilize our internal wafer fabrication equipment and related leasehold improvements for only one more year triggered an impairment under sfas no 
recoverability of these assets were measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of these assets to future undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by these assets over their remaining year of life 
as such  the carrying value of these assets were written down to the estimated future cash flows that are directly associated with and that are expected to arise as a direct result of the use and eventual disposition of these assets  which was determined by obtaining an independent third party appraisal 
this action resulted in a million asset impairment charge 
for  we recorded a restructuring charge of million related to our decision to abandon an excess facility 
in september  we decided not to occupy a new leased facility based on revised anticipated demand for our products and current market conditions 
this excess facility  for which we had a ten year commitment  is located adjacent to our current corporate headquarters and was originally developed to house additional administrative and corporate offices to accommodate planned expansion 
this decision resulted in a pre tax lease loss of million  comprised of future lease payments net of anticipated sub lease income  broker commissions and other facility costs  and a pre tax asset impairment charge of million on tenant improvements deemed no longer realizable 
the restructuring charge also includes an additional charge for the leased facility we abandoned in based on our downward revised assumptions regarding sublease occupancy rates and market rates due to an overall deteriorating real estate market and difficulties subleasing our available space 
in determining this estimate  we made certain assumptions with regards to our ability to sublease the space and reflected off setting assumed sublease income in line with our best estimate of the current market conditions 
for further discussion  see note to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this form k 
interest income interest income primarily represents interest earned on cash equivalents and short term available for sale investments 
our interest income for was million  a decrease of approximately million or as compared with interest income of million in this decrease primarily resulted from decreased average amounts of funds available for investment and a decrease in interest rates 
to the extent we continue to utilize our cash in the operation of our business  interest income is expected to decrease going forward 
additionally  our interest income will be impacted by changes in the market interest rates of our investments  which are generally lower than they were a year ago 
interest expense our interest expense for was  a decrease of  or as compared with interest expense of  in interest expense for both periods relates to fees associated with our revolving credit facility and outstanding letters of credit 
included an additional  of fees as we transitioned from our former credit facility with cibc world markets corp 
to our current credit facility 
other income expense net the other income realized in was primarily related to a  realized gain on the sale of short term investments  a business interruption insurance settlement of  net of expenses  related to a power outage at our milpitas facility and a  refund of an insurance premium for potential environmental liabilities on our former scotts valley facility 
gain on dispositions of real property during  we recorded a gain on dispositions of real property related to the release of  of escrow funds related to our sale of leasehold interests in our palo alto site during the fourth quarter of this gain was partially offset by  of residual expenses from the sale of the property 
income tax provision benefit beginning in  it was determined that it was not more likely than not that any additional deferred tax assets would be realized through the application of carryforward or carryback claims  thus we did not record a benefit against on going future net operating losses 
our effective tax rate in was a tax benefit of approximating our combined federal and state effective tax rates adjusted for valuation allowances against those deferred tax assets that management believes are not more likely than not to be realized 
comparison of years ended december  and sales we recognized million and million in sales for the fiscal years ended december  and  respectively 
this million or decrease in sales resulted primarily from an decrease in fiber optic sales of oc oscillators for use in long haul fiber optic systems 
fiber optic sales decreased to million as our sales continued to be impacted by the overall weakness in the long haul fiber optic market 
fiber optic sales represented of total sales for wireless product sales during totaled million  representing of total sales and a decrease of from semiconductor sales during totaled million  representing of total sales and a decrease of from based on specific terms of the customer contract and purchase order  we may negotiate a final delivery and settlement in connection with such cancellations 
due to the uncertain and lengthy nature of these negotiations  a substantial portion  if not all  of the inventory subject to the cancellation may be written off 
in the fourth quarter of  we reached final agreement with one customer  marconi communications  and recognized revenue of million related to the delivery of specific fixed wireless products that have previously been written off

as a percentage of sales  our cost of goods sold increased to of sales in from in the increase in our cost of goods sold as a percentage of sales relates to significant unabsorbed overhead  a million write down of excess and obsolete inventory  approximately  of severance expenses related to manufacturing personnel  and high variable cost on fixed wireless products which were being transitioned into manufacturing 
the significant amount of unabsorbed overhead costs relates to the increased manufacturing infrastructure we put in place to support our customers demand in the second half of this increased infrastructure includes  among other things  a new manufacturing facility and investments in machinery and equipment 
the million write down of excess and obsolete inventory largely related to inventory ordered to build base station products for our largest mobile wireless customer 
inventory levels of this product were purchased based on this customer s forecasted demand which had since been revised downward 
in addition  given the overall slowdown in market demand  we made write downs for other product lines where customer forecasts have significantly declined 
since the first quarter of  our cost of goods sold benefited from the subsequent sale of approximately million of this inventory to our largest mobile wireless customer 
this benefit was offset by an additional million in inventory write downs for other product lines where customer demand had significantly weakened 
due to rapidly changing customer forecasts and orders  additional write downs of excess or obsolete inventory  while not currently expected  could be required in the future 
in addition  the sale of previously written down inventory could result from significant unforeseen increases in customer demand 
with respect to our fixed wireless products  we typically experience higher cost of goods sold as a percentage of the selling price during the early stages of a new product life cycle 
over time  we typically become more efficient through learning and increased volumes  as well as through introducing lower cost elements in the product design 
margin improvement on our fixed wireless products has remained unrealized due to very low volume production during the second half of research and development our research and development expense for was million  a decrease of million or as compared with research and development expense of million in the decrease in research and development was primarily attributed to lower overall overhead costs and an increase in customer funded development 
as a percentage of sales  research and development expenses increased to of sales in from of sales in the increase in research and development expense as a percentage of sales primarily relates to our decline in sales 
selling and administrative selling and administrative expense for was million or of sales  a decrease of million or as compared with selling and administrative expense of million or of sales in the decrease in absolute dollars is primarily related to lower commission  recruiting  advertising and promotion expenses partially offset by approximately  of severance expenses and rent expense associated with our two new facilities including excess office space through august  see note to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report

this excess facility  for which we had a ten year commitment  is located adjacent to our current corporate headquarters and was originally developed to house additional administrative and corporate offices to accommodate planned expansion 
this decision resulted in a pre tax lease loss of million  comprised of future lease payments net of anticipated sub lease income  broker commissions and other facility costs  and a pre tax asset impairment charge of million on tenant improvements deemed no longer realizable 
interest income interest income primarily represents interest earned on cash equivalents and short term available for sale investments

the other expense incurred in is primarily related to losses realized when we liquidated short term investments to fund in part the recapitalization merger and to higher facility cost associated with our palo alto sub lease 
gain on dispositions of real property during  we recorded a gain on dispositions of real property related to the release of  of escrow funds related to our sale of leasehold interests in our palo alto site during the fourth quarter of this gain was partially offset by  of residual expenses from the sale of the property

the revolving facility requires that we maintain certain financial ratios and contains limitations on  among other things  our ability to incur indebtedness  pay dividends and make acquisitions without the bank s permission 
the revolving facility is secured by substantially all of our assets 
as of december   there were no outstanding borrowings under the revolving facility 
subsequent to year end  we obtained a waiver for the quarter ended december  of certain financial covenants under the revolving facility for which we were out of compliance 
in order for amounts to be available to us under the revolving facility in the future  we are negotiating with the lender to amend the financial covenants

thereafter  we will utilize our cash  cash flows and borrowings to the extent available and  if desirable or necessary  we may seek to raise additional capital through the sale of debt or equity 
there can be no assurances  however  that future borrowings and capital resources will be available on favorable terms or at all 
our cash flows are highly dependent on demand for our products  timing of orders and shipments with key customers and our ability to manage our working capital  especially inventory and accounts receivable  as well as controlling our production and operating costs in line with our revenue

we deny the allegations and intend to vigorously defend ourselves against these actions 
since these lawsuits are in the early stages of litigation  it is difficult at this time to evaluate whether we will incur any liability or to estimate the damages  or range of damages 
while we do not expect the ultimate result of these lawsuits to have a material adverse effect on our results of operations  financial position or cash flow  there can be no assurance that this will be the case 
we maintain a directors and officers liability insurance policy that provides million of coverage with retention of million and excess directors and officers liability reimbursement coverage of million 
however  there can be no assurance that our costs and expenses  including any monetary damages awarded to plaintiffs  will be covered by insurance or if covered  such insurance will be adequate 
we currently are also involved in litigation and regulatory proceedings incidental to the conduct of our business and expect that we will be involved in other litigation and regulatory proceedings from time to time 
while we believe that any adverse outcome of such pending matters will not materially affect our business or financial condition  there can be no assurance that this will be the case 
the company is also involved in various legal actions which arose in the ordinary course of its business activities 
management believes the final resolution of these matters should not have a material impact on its results of operations  cash flows  or financial position 
risk factors that may affect future results you should carefully consider the risks described below and all other information contained in this report and in our other filings with the sec in evaluating us and our business before making an investment decision 
if any of the following risks  or other risks and uncertainties that we have not yet identified or that we currently think are immaterial  actually occur and are material  our business  financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected 
in that event  the trading price of our common stock could decline and you may lose part or all of your investment 
we have recently incurred substantial operating losses and we anticipate additional future losses 
our sales for were million compared to million for due to sharply reduced end customer demand in many of the communications end markets which our products address 
we incurred a net loss of million for the year ended december  we expect that reduced end customer demand  underutilization of our manufacturing capacity and other factors will continue to adversely affect our operating results in the near term resulting in additional losses in in order to return to profitability  we must achieve substantial revenue growth and we currently face an environment of uncertain demand in the markets our products address 
we cannot assure you as to whether or when we will return to profitability or whether we will be able to sustain such profitability  if achieved 
if our common stock ceases to be listed for trading on the nasdaq national market  it may harm our stock price and make it more difficult for you to sell your shares 
our common stock is listed on the nasdaq national market and the bid price for our common stock has recently been below per share during certain periods 
the nasdaq national market rules for continued listing require  among other things  that the bid price for our common stock not fall below per share for a period of consecutive trading days 
on august  we received notification from nasdaq that for the prior consecutive trading days the price of our common stock had closed below the minimum bid price requirement 
however  we regained compliance when the bid price of our common stock subsequently closed at per share or more for a minimum of consecutive trading days 
while there are steps the company can take to address this situation in the future  including a reverse stock split or share repurchase  we cannot assure you that our stock will maintain such minimum bid price requirement or that we will be able to meet or maintain all of the nasdaq national market continued listing requirements in the future 
if  in the future  our minimum bid price is again below for consecutive trading days  under the current nasdaq national market rules we will have a period of days to attain compliance by meeting the minimum bid price requirement for consecutive days during the compliance period 
if our common stock ceases to be listed for trading on the nasdaq national market for failure to meet the minimum bid price requirement  we expect that our common stock would be traded on the nasd s over the counter bulletin board unless nasdaq grants an additional grace period for transfer to nasdaq s smallcap market  which also has a similar minimum bid requirement 
in addition  our stock could then potentially be subject to the securities and exchange commission s penny stock rules  which place additional disclosure requirements on broker dealers 
these additional disclosure requirements may harm your ability to sell your shares if it causes a decline in the ability or willingness of broker dealers to sell our common stock 
we also expect that the level of trading activity of our common stock would decline if it is no longer listed on the nasdaq national market or smallcap market 
as such  if our common stock ceases to be listed for trading on the nasdaq national market or smallcap market  it may harm our stock price  increase the volatility of our stock price and make it more difficult for you to sell your shares of our common stock 
we are exposed to the risks associated with the worldwide economic slow down and related uncertainties 
slower economic activity  concerns about inflation  decreased consumer confidence  reduced corporate profits and capital spending  adverse business conditions and liquidity concerns in the telecommunications and related industries  and international conflicts and terrorist and military activity have resulted in a downturn in worldwide economic conditions  particularly in the united states 
as a result of these unfavorable economic conditions  during we experienced a significant slow down in customer orders  an increase in the number of cancellations and reschedulings of backlog and higher overhead costs as a percentage of our reduced net sales 
entering  concerns remain regarding the timing  strength and duration of economic recovery in the semiconductor industry and commercial communications infrastructure markets 
in addition  political and social turmoil related to international conflicts and terrorist acts place further pressure on economic conditions in the us and to accurately forecast and plan future business activities 
if such conditions continue or worsen  our business  financial condition and results of operations will likely be materially and adversely affected 
a small number of customers account for a high percentage of our sales and the loss of  or a reduction in orders from  a significant customer could result in a reduction of sales 
we depend on a small number of customers for a majority of our sales 
during the year ended  we had three customers which each accounted for more than of our sales and in aggregate accounted for of our sales  including sales to their respective manufacturing subcontractors 
sales to our customers  including sales to their respective manufacturing subcontractors  in aggregate accounted for of our sales for the year ended december  and of our sales for the year ended december  in addition  most of our sales result from purchase orders or from contracts that can be cancelled on short term notice 
we expect that our key customers will continue to account for a substantial portion of our revenue in and in the foreseeable future 
the loss of or a reduction in orders from a significant customer for any reason could cause our sales to decrease 
we depend solely on richardson electronics  ltd 
for distribution of our rf semiconductor products 
on june  we entered into a distribution agreement with richardson electronics  ltd 
to act as the sole worldwide distributor of our complete line of rf semiconductor products 
our sales to richardson electronics  ltd 
represents  and of our semiconductor sales in  and  respectively 
we cannot assure you that this expanded relationship will result in an improvement in sales of our semiconductor products 
if this sole distributor fails to successfully market and sell our products  our semiconductor sales could materially decline 
our agreement with this distributor does not require it to purchase our products and is terminable at any time 
if this distribution relationship is discontinued  our rf semiconductor sales could materially decline 
our future success depends significantly on strategic relationships with certain of our customers 
if we cannot maintain these relationships or if these customers develop their own solution or adopt a competitor s solutions instead of buying our products  our operating results would be adversely affected 
in the past  we have relied on our strategic relationships with certain customers who are technology leaders in our target markets 
we intend to pursue and continue to form these strategic relationships in the future but we cannot assure you that we will be able to do so 
these relationships often require us to develop new products that typically involve significant technological challenges 
our partners frequently place considerable pressure on us to meet their tight development schedules 
accordingly  we may have to devote a substantial amount of our limited resources to our strategic relationships  which could detract from or delay our completion of other important development projects 
delays in development could impair our relationships with our strategic partners and negatively impact sales of the products under development 
moreover  it is possible that our customers may develop their own solutions or adopt a competitor s solution for products that they currently buy from us 
if that happens  our business  financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected 
our quarterly operating results may fluctuate significantly 
as a result  we may fail to meet or exceed the expectations of securities analysts and investors  which could cause our stock price to decline 
our quarterly revenues and operating results have fluctuated significantly in the past and may continue to vary from quarter to quarter due to a number of factors  many of which are not within our control 
if our operating results do not meet our publicly stated guidance or the expectations of securities analysts or investors  our stock price may decline 
fluctuations in our operating results may be due to a number of factors  including the following continued slow down and uncertainty in capital spending by communications service providers  the volume of our product sales and pricing concessions on volume sales  the timing  rescheduling  reduction or cancellation of significant customer orders and the ability of our customers to manage their inventories  the gain or loss of a key customer  the qualification  availability and pricing of competing products and technologies and the resulting effect on sales and pricing of our products  our ability to specify  develop or acquire  complete  introduce  market and transition to volume production new products and technologies in a timely manner and the acceptance of our new products by our customers  the timing of customer industry qualification and certification of our products and the risks of non qualification or non certification  the rate of which our present and future customers and end users adopt our technologies in our target markets  the rate of adoption and acceptance of new industry standards in our target markets  the effects of new and emerging technologies  patent and other intellectual property disputes  customer indemnification claims and other types of litigation risks  the effectiveness of our expense and product cost control and reduction efforts  fluctuations in our manufacturing yields and other problems or delays in the fabrication  assembly  testing or delivery of our products  changes in manufacturing capacity and the utilization of this capacity  the risks of producing products with new suppliers and at new fabrication and assembly facilities  our ability to retain and hire key executives  technical personnel and other employees in the numbers  with the capabilities and at the compensation levels that we need to implement our business and product plans  changes in our product mix or customer mix  the extent and duration of the current downturn in the economy and the weakness in demand by our customers  lack of visibility into the finished product inventories of our customers and end users  increased in house production by our customers  continued excessive inventories held by our customers or end users  the quality of our products and any remediation costs  the effects of natural disasters and other events beyond our control  the level of orders received that we can ship in a fiscal quarter  our inability to utilize our line of credit or comply with its terms  the availability and affordability of raw materials  cyclical nature of semiconductor business  continued reduction or loss of customer orders due to economic and business factors affecting our customers  should we begin to acquire technologies and businesses  the risks inherent in these acquisitions  including the timing and successful completion of technology and product development through volume production  integration issues  costs and unanticipated expenditures  change relationships with customers  suppliers and strategic partners  potential contractual  intellectual property or employment issues  accounting treatment and charges  and the risks that the acquisition cannot be completed successfully or that anticipated benefits are not realized  increased warranty claims  fluctuations in the manufacturing yields of any third party semiconductor foundries we employ and other problems or delays in the fabrication  assembly  testing or delivery of our products  the availability and pricing of third party semiconductor foundry and assembly and test capacity and raw materials  the risks and challenges of producing products with new suppliers and at new fabrication and assembly facilities  recognition of non recurring revenue generated from life time buys of discontinued products or settlements of contract cancellations for orders containing inventory protection clauses  the eventual actual cost of our abandonment of our leased facilities  our ability to sublease the excess space we abandoned in our leased facilities  our ability to successfully complete our restructuring programs  the impact of international conflicts and acts of terrorism on economic and market conditions  the impact of our restructuring efforts  cost and expense of outsourcing our semiconductor manufacturing  dependency on a limited number of outsourced semiconductor wafer fabrication facilities  diversion of management s attention and resources as a result of defending against litigation matters  cost  expense and any adverse outcome of the lawsuits filed against us and our directors in connection with fox paines s proposal to purchase all of the shares of our common stock not held by fox paine and their affiliates  continued poor economic and market conditions in our industry  and general economic and market conditions 
due to all of the foregoing factors  and the other risks discussed in this report  you should not rely on period to period comparisons of our operating results as an indication of future performance 
under our realigned manufacturing strategy  we will be increasingly dependent upon third parties for the manufacture of our products 
as we transition to a complete outsourcing business model  we will obtain an increasing portion of our wafer requirements from outside wafer fabrication facilities  known as foundries 
there are significant risks associated with our reliance on third party foundries  including the lack of ensured wafer supply  potential wafer shortages and higher wafer prices  limited control over product delivery schedules  quality assurance and control  manufacturing yields and production costs  and the unavailability of  or delays in obtaining  access to key fabrication process technologies 
we have no long term contracts with any foundry and we do not have a guaranteed level of production capacity at any foundry 
the ability of each foundry to provide wafers to us is limited by its available capacity and our foundry suppliers could provide that limited capacity to its other customers 
in addition  our foundry suppliers could reduce or even eliminate the capacity allocated to us on short notice 
moreover such a reduction or elimination is possible even after we have submitted a purchase order 
if we choose to use a new foundry  it typically takes several months to complete the qualification process before we can begin shipping products from the new foundry 
the foundries we use may experience financial difficulties or suffer damage or destruction to their facilities 
if these events or any other disruption of wafer fabrication capacity occur  we may not have a second manufacturing source immediately available 
we may therefore experience difficulties or delays in securing an adequate supply of our products  which could impair our ability to meet our customers needs and have a material adverse effect on our operating results 
in the event of these types of delays  we cannot assure you that the required alternate capacity  particularly wafer production capacity  would be available on a timely basis or at all 
even if alternate wafer production capacity is available  we may not be able to obtain it on favorable terms  which could result in a loss of customers 
we may be unable to obtain sufficient manufacturing capacity to meet demand  either at our own facilities or through foundry or similar arrangements with others 
in addition  the highly complex and technologically demanding nature of semiconductor manufacturing has caused foundries to experience from time to time lower than anticipated manufacturing yields  particularly in connection with the introduction of new products and the installation and start up of new process technologies 
lower than anticipated manufacturing yields may affect our ability to fulfill our customers demands for our products on a timely and cost effective basis 
we cannot be certain that we will be able to maintain our good relationships with our existing foundries 
in addition  we cannot be certain that we will be able to form relationships with other foundries as favorable as our current ones 
moreover  transferring from our internal fabrication facility or our existing foundries to another foundry  could require a significant amount of time and loss of revenue  and we cannot assure you that we could make a smooth and timely transition 
if foundries are unable or unwilling to continue to supply us with these semiconductor products in required time frames and volumes or at commercially acceptable costs  our business may be harmed 
if we are unable to develop and introduce new semiconductors successfully and in a cost effective and timely manner or to achieve market acceptance of our new semiconductors  our operating results would be adversely affected 
the future success of our semiconductor business will depend on our ability to develop new semiconductor solutions for existing and new markets  introduce these products in a cost effective and timely manner and convince leading equipment manufacturers to select these products for design into their own new products 
our quarterly results in the past have been  and are expected in the future to continue to be  dependent on the introduction of a relatively small number of new products and the timely completion and delivery of those products to customers 
the development of new semiconductor devices is highly complex  and from time to time we have experienced delays in completing the development and introduction of new products and lower than anticipated manufacturing yields in the early production of such products 
our ability to develop and deliver new semiconductor products successfully will depend on various factors  including our ability to accurately predict market requirements and evolving industry standards  accurately define new products  timely complete and introduce new product designs  timely qualify and obtain industry interoperability certification of our products and the products of our customers into which our products will be incorporated  obtain sufficient foundry capacity  achieve high manufacturing yields  shift our products to smaller geometry process technologies to achieve lower cost and higher levels of design integration  and gain market acceptance of our products and our customers products 
if we are not able to develop and introduce new products successfully and in a cost effective and timely manner  our business  financial condition and results of operations would be materially and adversely affected 
our new semiconductor products generally are incorporated into our customers products at the design stage 
we often incur significant expenditures for the development of a new product without any assurance that an equipment manufacturer will select our product for design into its own product 
the value of our semiconductors largely depends on the commercial success of our customers products and on the extent to which those products accommodate components manufactured by our competitors 
we cannot assure you that we will continue to achieve design wins or that equipment that incorporates our products will ever be commercially successful 
the amount and timing of revenue from newly designed semiconductors is often uncertain 
we have announced a significant number of new semiconductor products and design wins for new and existing semiconductors 
achieving a design win with a customer does not create a binding commitment from that customer to purchase our products 
rather  a design win is solely an expression of interest by potential customers in purchasing our products and is not supported by binding commitments of any nature 
accordingly  a customer may choose at any time to discontinue using our products in their designs or product development efforts 
even if our products are chosen to be incorporated in our customer s products  we still may not realize significant revenues from that customer if their products are not commercially successful 
a design win may not generate revenue if the customer s product is rejected by their end market 
typically  most new products or design wins have very little impact on near term revenue 
it may take well over a year before a new product or design win generates meaningful revenue 
once a manufacturer of communications equipment has designed a supplier s semiconductor into its products  the manufacturer may be reluctant to change its source of semiconductors due to the significant costs associated with qualifying a new supplier and potentially redesigning its product 
accordingly  our failure to achieve design wins with equipment manufacturers  which have chosen a competitor s semiconductor  could create barriers to future sales opportunities with these manufacturers 
our semiconductor products typically have lengthy sales cycles and we may ultimately be unable to recover our investment in new products 
after we have developed and delivered a semiconductor product to a customer  the customer will usually test and evaluate our product prior to designing its own equipment to incorporate our product 
our customer may need three to six months or longer to test  evaluate and adopt our semiconductors and an additional three to nine months or more to begin volume production of equipment that incorporates our semiconductors 
moreover  in light of the recent significant economic slow down in the telecommunications sector  it may take significantly longer than three to nine months before customers commence volume production of equipment incorporating some of our semiconductors 
due to this lengthy sales cycle  we may experience significant delays from the time we increase our expenses for research and development and sales and marketing efforts and make investments in inventory until the time that we generate revenue from these products 
it is possible that we may never generate any revenue from these products after incurring such expenditures 
even if a customer selects our semiconductors to incorporate into its equipment  we have no assurances that the customer will ultimately market and sell its equipment or that such efforts by our customer will be successful 
the delays inherent in our lengthy sales cycle increase the risk that a customer will decide to cancel or change its product plans 
such a cancellation or change in plans by a customer could cause us to lose sales that we had anticipated 
in addition  our business  financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected if a significant customer curtails  reduces or delays orders during our sales cycle or chooses not to release equipment that contains our products 
the resources devoted to product research and development and sales and marketing may not generate material revenue for us  and from time to time  we may need to write off excess and obsolete inventory 
if we incur significant marketing and inventory expenses in the future that we are not able to recover  and we are not able to compensate for those expenses  our operating results could be adversely affected 
in addition  if we sell our products at reduced prices in anticipation of cost reductions and we still have higher cost products in inventory  our operating results would be harmed 
if we are unable to respond to the rapid technological changes taking place in our industry  our existing products could become obsolete and we could face difficulties making future sales 
the markets in which we compete are characterized by rapidly changing technologies  evolving industry standards and frequent improvements in products and services 
if the technologies supported by our products become obsolete or fail to gain widespread acceptance  as a result of a change in industry standards or otherwise  we could face difficulties making future sales 
we must continue to make significant investments in research and development to seek to develop product enhancements  new designs and technologies on a cost effective basis 
if we are unable to develop and introduce new products or enhancements in a timely manner in response to changing market conditions or customer requirements  or if our new products do not achieve market acceptance  our sales could decline 
additionally  initial lower margins are typically experienced with new products under development 
our existing and potential customers operate in an intensely competitive environment and our success will depend on the success of our customers 
the companies in our target markets  communications equipment companies and service providers  face an extremely competitive environment 
some of the semiconductor and wireless products we design and sell are customized to work with specific customers systems 
if the companies with whom we establish business relations are not successful in building their systems  promoting their products  including new revenue generating services  receiving requisite approvals and accomplishing the many other requirements for the success of their businesses  our growth will be limited 
furthermore  our customers may have difficulty obtaining parts from other suppliers causing these customers to cancel or delay orders for our products 
in addition  we have limited ability to foresee the competitive success of our customers and to plan accordingly 
if the broadband cable and wireless communications markets fail to grow or they decline  our sales may not grow or may decline 
our future growth depends on the success of the broadband cable and wireless communications markets 
the rate at which these markets will grow is difficult to predict 
these markets may fail to grow or decline for many reasons  including insufficient consumer demand for broadband cable or wireless products or services  the inability of the various communications service providers to access adequate capital to build their networks  inefficiency and poor performance of broadband cable or wireless communications services compared to other forms of broadband access  and real or perceived security or health risks associated with wireless communications 
throughout  the demand for telecom equipment has been very soft 
this weakness in demand is currently projected to continue throughout and potentially beyond based on customer forecasts for the purchase of our products 
if the markets for our products in broadband cable or wireless communications decline  fail to grow  or grow more slowly than we anticipate  the use of our products may be reduced and our sales could suffer 
if we fail to accurately forecast component and material requirements for our manufacturing facilities  we could incur additional costs or experience manufacturing delays 
we use rolling forecasts based on anticipated product orders to determine our component requirements 
it is very important that we accurately predict both the demand for our products and the lead times required to obtain the necessary components and materials 
lead times for components and materials that we order vary significantly and depend on factors such as specific supplier requirements  the size of the order  contract terms and current market demand for the components 
for substantial increases in production levels  some suppliers may need six months or more lead time 
as a result  we may be required to make financial commitments in the form of purchase commitments 
we lack visibility into the finished goods inventories of our customers and the end users 
this lack of visibility impacts our ability to accurately forecast our requirements 
if we overestimate our component and material requirements  we may have excess inventory  which would increase our costs 
an additional risk for potential excess inventory results from our volume purchase commitments with certain material suppliers  which can only be reduced in certain circumstances 
additionally  if we underestimate our component and material requirements  we may have inadequate inventory  which could interrupt our manufacturing and delay delivery of our products to our customers 
any of these occurrences would negatively impact our sales and profitability 
we have incurred  and may in the future incur  charges related to excess and obsolete inventory 
while these charges may be partially offset by subsequent sales of previously written down inventory  there can be no assurance that any such sales will be significant 
as we broaden our product lines we must purchase a wider variety of components to utilize in our manufacturing processes 
in addition  new product lines contain a greater degree of uncertainty due to a lack of visibility of customer acceptance and potential competition 
both of these factors will contribute a higher level of inventory risk in our near future 
we depend on single or limited source suppliers for some of the key components and materials in our products  which makes us susceptible to supply shortages or price fluctuations that could adversely affect our operating results 
we typically purchase our components and materials through purchase orders  and we have no guaranteed supply arrangements with any of our suppliers 
we currently purchase several key components and materials used in the manufacture of our products from single or limited source suppliers 
in the event one of our sole source suppliers is unable or unwilling to sell us material components this could have a significant adverse effect on our operations 
additionally  we may fail to obtain required components in a timely manner in the future 
we may also experience difficulty identifying alternative sources of supply for the components used in our products 
we would experience delays if we were required to test and evaluate products of potential alternative suppliers 
furthermore  financial or other difficulties faced by our suppliers or significant changes in demand for the components or materials they supply to us could limit the availability of those components or materials to us 
in addition  we utilize overseas vendors in our semiconductor business to provide gaas wafers  fabricate certain products and package the majority of our products 
these vendors are located in singapore  the philippines  malaysia  taiwan and france 
reliance on oversea vendors subject us to risks and challenges such as compliance with a wide variety of foreign laws and regulations  changes in laws and regulations relating to the import or export of semiconductor products  legal uncertainties regarding taxes  tariffs  quotas  export controls  export licenses and other trade barriers  political and economic instability in or for foreign conflicts involving the countries of our manufacturers and subcontractors causing delays in our ability to obtain our product  reduced protection for intellectual property rights in some countries  and fluctuations in freight rates and transportation disruptions 
political and economic instability and changes in governmental regulations in these areas as well as the united states could affect the ability of our overseas vendors to supply materials or services 
any interruption or delay in the supply of our required components  materials or services  or our inability to obtain these components  materials or services from alternate sources at acceptable prices and within a reasonable amount of time  could impair our ability to meet scheduled product deliveries to our customers and could cause customers to cancel orders 
we rely on the significant experience and specialized expertise of our senior management in the rf industry and must retain and attract qualified engineers and other highly skilled personnel in a highly competitive job environment to maintain and grow our business 
our performance is substantially dependent on the continued services and on the performance of our senior management and our highly qualified team of engineers  who have many years of experience and specialized expertise in our business 
our performance also depends on our ability to retain and motivate our other executive officers and key employees 
the loss of the services of any of our executive officers or of a number of our engineers could harm our ability to maintain and build our business 
we have no key man life insurance policies 
our future success also depends on our ability to identify  attract  hire  train  retain and motivate highly skilled technical  managerial  marketing and customer service personnel 
if we fail to attract  integrate and retain the necessary personnel  our ability to maintain and build our business could suffer significantly 
additionally  california state law can create unique difficulties for a california based company attempting to enforce covenants not to compete with employees which could be a factor in our future ability to retain key management and employees in a competitive environment 
our business is subject to the risks of product returns  product liability and product defects 
products as complex as ours frequently contain undetected errors or defects  especially when first introduced or when new versions are released 
the occurrence of errors could result in product returns from and reduced product shipments to our customers 
in addition  any failure by our products to properly perform could result in claims against us by our customers 
such failure also could result in the loss of or delay in market acceptance of our products or harm our reputation 
due to the recent introduction of some of our products  we have limited experience with the problems that could arise with these products 
our purchase agreements with our customers typically contain provisions designed to limit our exposure to potential product liability claims 
however  the limitation of liability provision contained in these agreements may not be effective as a result of federal  state or local laws or ordinances or unfavorable judicial decisions in the united states or other countries 
although we maintain million of insurance to protect against claims associated with the use of our products  our insurance coverage may not adequately cover all claims asserted against us 
in addition  even ultimately unsuccessful claims could result in costly litigation  divert our management s time and resources and damage our customer relationships 
we use a number of specialized technologies  some of which are patented  to design  develop and manufacture our products 
infringement of our intellectual property rights could hurt our competitive position  harm our reputation and cost us money 
we regard the protection of our copyrights  patents  service marks  trademarks  trade dress and trade secrets as critical to our future success and plan to rely on a combination of copyright  patent  trademark and trade secret law  as well as on confidentiality procedures and contractual provisions  to protect our proprietary rights 
we seek patent protection for our unique developments in circuit designs  processes and algorithms 
adequate protection of our intellectual property rights may not be available in every country where our products and services are made available 
we intend  as a general policy  to enter into confidentiality and invention assignment agreements with all of our employees and contractors  as well as into nondisclosure agreements with parties with which we conduct business  to limit access to and disclosure of our proprietary information  however  we have not done so on a uniform basis 
as a result  we may not have adequate remedies to preserve our trade secrets or prevent third parties from using our technology without authorization 
we cannot assure you that all future employees  contractors and business partners will agree to these contracts  or that  even if agreed to  these contractual arrangements or the other steps we have taken to protect our intellectual property will prove sufficient to prevent misappropriation of our technology or to deter independent third party development of similar technologies 
if we are unable to execute these agreements or take other steps to prevent misappropriation of our technology or to deter independent development of similar technologies  our competitive position and reputation could suffer and we could be forced to make significant expenditures 
we regularly file patent applications with the us patent and trademark office and in selected foreign countries covering particular aspects of our technology and intend to prosecute such applications to the fullest extent of the law 
based upon our assessment of our current and future technology  we may decide to file additional patent applications in the future  and may decide to abandon current patent applications 
we cannot assure you that any patent application we have filed or will file will result in an issued patent  or  if patents are issued to us  that such patents will provide us with any competitive advantages and will not be challenged by third parties or invalidated by the us patent and trademark office or foreign patent office 
any failure to protect our existing patents or to secure new patents may limit our ability to protect the intellectual property rights that such patents or patent applications were intended to cover 
furthermore  the patents of others may impair our ability to do business 
we have several registered trademarks and service marks  in the united states and abroad  and are in the process of registering others in the united states 
nevertheless  we can not assure you that the us patent and trademark office will grant us these registrations 
should we decide to apply to register additional trademarks or service marks in foreign countries  there is no guarantee that we will be able to secure such registrations 
the inability to register or decision not to register in certain foreign countries and adequately protect our trademarks and service marks could harm our competitive position  harm our reputation and negatively impact our future profitability 
we must gain access to improved process technologies 
for our semiconductor products  our future success will depend upon our ability to continue to gain access to new and or improved process technologies in order to adapt to emerging industry standards or competitive market conditions 
in the future  we may be required to transition one or more of our products to process technologies with smaller geometries  other materials or higher speed in order to reduce costs and or improve product performance 
we may not be able to gain access to new process technologies in a timely or affordable manner 
in addition  products based on these technologies may not achieve market acceptance 
our controlling stockholder has the ability to take action that may adversely affect our business  our stock price and our ability to raise capital 
as of december   fox paine company  llc fox paine is the indirect beneficial owner of of our outstanding share capital 
as a result  fox paine has and will continue to have control over the outcome of matters requiring stockholder approval  including the power to elect all of our directors and the directors of our subsidiaries  amend our charter or by laws  and agree to or prevent mergers  consolidations or the sale of all or substantially all our assets or our subsidiaries assets 
fox paine also will be able to delay  prevent or cause a change in control relating to us 
fox paine s control over us and our subsidiaries  and its ability to delay or prevent a change in control relating to us could adversely affect the market price of our common stock 
fox paine s controlling interest could also subject us to a class action lawsuits which could result in substantial costs and divert our management s attention and financial resources from more productive uses 
as previously announced  we received a proposal from fox paine to acquire all of the shares of our common stock held by unaffiliated stockholders for per share in cash the acquisition proposal 
the acquisition proposal was withdrawn by fox paine on march  to date  three putative class action lawsuits and one lawsuit by our former chief executive officer have been filed against fox paine  the company and certain of our current and former directors in connection with the acquisition proposal 
the lawsuits seek to enjoin the acquisition proposal and unspecified compensatory damages 
we cannot assure you that these proceedings will not adversely affect our business or our stock price  or that no additional purported class action lawsuits will be filed against us based on similar allegations 
as of december   we have incurred approximately  of costs and expenses related to the acquisition proposal 
these expenses continued into furthermore  we cannot assure you that fox paine will not in the future attempt to acquire complete control of the company or engage in a going private transaction 
in addition  fox paine receives management fees from us which could influence their decisions regarding us 
fox paine may in the future make significant investments in other communications companies 
some of these companies may be our competitors 
fox paine and its affiliates are not obligated to advise us of any investment or business opportunities of which they are aware  and they are not restricted or prohibited from competing with us 
the sale of a substantial number of shares of our common stock by fox paine or the perception that such sale could occur  could negatively affect the market price of our common stock and could also materially impair our future ability to raise capital through an offering of securities 
we face intense competition  and  if we do not compete effectively in our markets  we will lose sales and have lower margins 
the market for wireless communications services is relatively new  rapidly evolving and intensely competitive  and we expect competition to intensify further in the future 
many of our current and potential competitors have substantially greater technical  financial  marketing  distribution and other resources than we have 
price competition is intense and the market prices and margins of products frequently decline after competitors begin making similar products 
in addition  we compete with the captive manufacturing operations of large communications original equipment manufacturers such as lucent technologies  marconi and nortel networks who are also our customers 
they may decide at any time to satisfy some or all of their product needs through their own in house sources 
a number of our competitors may have greater name recognition and market acceptance of their products and technologies 
furthermore  our competitors  or the competitors of our customers  may develop new technologies  enhancements of existing products or new products that offer superior price or performance features 
these new products or technologies could render obsolete our products or the systems of our customers into which our products are integrated 
we may pursue acquisitions and investments in new businesses  products or technologies that involve numerous risks  including the use of cash and diversion of management s attention 
in the future  we may make acquisitions of and investments in new businesses  products and technologies 
if we identify an acquisition candidate  we may not be able to successfully negotiate or finance the acquisition 
even if we are successful  we may not be able to integrate the acquired businesses  products or technologies into our existing business and products 
as a result of the rapid pace of technological change in the communications industry  we may misgauge the long term potential of the acquired business or technology or the acquisition may not be complementary to our existing business 
furthermore  potential acquisitions and investments  whether or not consummated  may divert our management s attention and require considerable cash outlays at the expense of our existing operations 
in addition  to complete future acquisitions  we may issue equity securities  incur debt  assume contingent liabilities or have amortization expenses and write downs of acquired assets  which could affect our profitability 
claims that we are infringing third party intellectual property rights may result in costly litigation 
as a provider of technologically advanced products  we are at particular risk of becoming subject to litigation based on claims that we are infringing the intellectual property rights of others 
in the past  we have been subject to claims that some of our products infringe the proprietary rights of third parties 
we cannot assure you that we will not be subject to any such claims in the future 
any future similar claims  whether meritorious or not  could be time consuming to defend  damage our reputation  result in substantial and unanticipated costs associated with litigation and require us to enter into royalty or licensing agreements  which may not be available on acceptable terms or at all 
the variability of our manufacturing yields may affect our gross margins 
the success of our business depends largely on our ability to produce our products efficiently through a manufacturing process that results in a large number of usable products or yields  from any particular production run 
in the past  we have experienced significant delays in our product shipments due to lower than expected production yields 
due to the rigid technical requirements for our products and manufacturing processes  our production yields may be negatively affected by a variety of factors  some of which are beyond our control 
for instance  yields may be reduced by impurities in materials used  contamination of the manufacturing environment  human error  in part  due to insufficient employee training  and equipment failures 
our manufacturing yields also vary significantly among our products due to product complexity and the depth of our experience in manufacturing a particular product 
we cannot assure you that we will not experience problems with our production yields in the future 
decreases in our yields can result in substantially higher costs for our products 
if we cannot maintain acceptable production yields in the future  our gross margin may suffer 
changes in the regulatory environment of the communications industry may reduce the demand for our products 
the deregulation of the telecommunications industry has resulted in an increased number of service providers 
such increase  coupled with the expanding use of the internet and data networking by businesses and consumers  has resulted in the rapid growth of the communications industry 
this has led and will likely continue to lead to intense competition  short product life cycles  and  to some extent  regulatory uncertainty in and outside the united states 
the course of the development of the communications industry is difficult to predict 
for example  the delays in governmental approval processes that our customers are subject to  such as the issuance of site permits and the auction of frequency spectrum  have in the past caused  and may in the future cause  the cancellation  postponement or rescheduling of the installation of communications systems by our customers 
a reduction in network infrastructure expenditures could negatively affect the sale of our products 
moreover  in the short term  deregulation may result in a delay or a reduction in the procurement cycle because of the general uncertainty involved with the transition period of businesses 
our future profitability could suffer from known or unknown liabilities that we retained when we sold parts of our company 
in the recent past  we completed the divestiture of all but our current business 
in the transactions in which we sold our other businesses  we generally retained liability arising from events occurring prior to the sale 
some of these liabilities were or have since become known to us  such as the environmental condition of the production facilities we sold 
we may have underestimated the scope of these liabilities  and we may become aware of additional liabilities associated with the following in the future ownership of the intellectual property we have sold  the potential infringement by our sold businesses of the intellectual property of others  the regulatory compliance of our sold defense business  export control compliance with respect to our defense products purchased by the united states and foreign governments  and product defect claims with respect to products manufactured by our sold businesses before they were sold 
if these and any other unknown liabilities and obligations exceed our expectations and established reserves  our future profitability could suffer and our capital needs could increase 
if we fail to comply with environmental regulations we could be subject to substantial fines 
two of our current and former production facilities have significant environmental liabilities for which we have entered into and funded fixed price remediation agreements and obtained cost overrun and unknown pollution insurance coverage 
we cannot assure you that this insurance will be sufficient to cover all liabilities related to these sites 
in addition  we are subject to a variety of federal  state and local governmental regulations relating to the storage  discharge  handling  emission  generation  manufacture and disposal of toxic or other hazardous substances used to manufacture our products 
in the past  we have been subject to periodic environmental reviews and audits  which have resulted in minor fines 
if we fail to comply with these regulations  substantial fines could be imposed on us  and we could be required to suspend production  alter manufacturing processes or cease operations 
if rf emissions pose a health risk  the demand for our products may decline 
recent news reports have asserted that some radio frequency emissions from wireless handsets may be linked to various health concerns  including cancer  and may interfere with various electronic medical devices  including hearing aids and pacemakers 
if it were determined or perceived that rf emissions from wireless communications equipment create a health risk  the market for our wireless customers products and  consequently  the demand for our products could decline significantly 
our facilities are concentrated in an area susceptible to earthquakes 
our facilities are concentrated in an area where there is a risk of significant earthquake activity 
substantially all of the production equipment that currently accounts for our sales  as well as planned additional production equipment  is or will be located in a known earthquake zone 
we cannot predict the extent of the damage that our facilities and equipment would suffer in the event of an earthquake or how such damage would affect our business 
we do not maintain earthquake insurance 
our stock price is highly volatile 
the market price of our common stock has fluctuated substantially in the past and is likely to continue to be highly volatile and subject to wide fluctuations 
since our initial public offering in august   through february   our common stock has traded at prices as low as and as high as per share 
these fluctuations have occurred and may continue to occur in response to various factors  many of which we cannot control  including quarter to quarter variations in our operating results  announcements of technological innovations or new products by our competitors  customers or us  general conditions in the semiconductor industry and telecommunications and data communications equipment markets  changes in earnings estimates or investment recommendations by analysts  changes in investor perceptions  or changes in expectations relating to our products  plans and strategic position or those of our competitors or customers 
in addition  the market prices of securities on the nasdaq national market and that of our customers and competitors have been especially volatile 
this volatility has significantly affected the market prices of securities for reasons frequently unrelated to the operating performance of the specific companies 
accordingly  you may not be able to resell your shares of common stock at or above the price you paid 
in the past  companies that have experienced volatility in the market price of their securities have been the subject of securities class action litigation 
if we were the object of a securities class action litigation  it could result in substantial losses and divert management s attention and resources from other matters 
our business experiences seasonality 
it has been our experience that telecommunication equipment spending is typically lower in the first quarter of the calendar year and higher during the fourth quarter of the calendar year 
this apparent seasonality may be even more pronounced in light of the current economic downturn 
we may need to raise additional capital in the future through the issuance of additional equity or convertible debt securities or by borrowing money  and additional funds may not be available on terms acceptable to us 
we believe that the cash  cash equivalents and investments on hand  the cash we expect to generate from operations and borrowings under our line of credit will be sufficient to meet our liquidity and capital spending requirements for at least the next twelve months 
however  it is possible that we may need to raise additional funds to fund our activities during and or beyond that time 
we could raise these funds by selling more stock to the public or to selected investors  or by borrowing money 
in addition  even though we many not need additional funds  we may still elect to sell additional equity securities or obtain credit facilities for other reasons 
we may not be able to obtain additional funds on favorable terms  or at all 
if adequate funds are not available  we may be required to curtail our operations significantly or to obtain funds through arrangements with strategic partners or others that may require us to relinquish rights to certain technologies or potential markets 
if we raise additional funds by issuing additional equity or convertible debt securities  the ownership percentages of existing shareholders would be reduced 
in addition  the equity or debt securities that we issue may have rights  preferences or privileges senior to those of the holders of our common stock 
it is possible that our future capital requirements may vary materially from those now planned 
the amount of capital that we will need in the future will depend on many factors  including whether the company operates on a positive cash flow basis  the market acceptance of our products  the levels of promotion and advertising that will be required to launch our products and achieve and maintain a competitive position in the marketplace  volume price discounts  our business  product  capital expenditure and research and development plans and product and technology roadmaps  the levels of inventory and accounts receivable that we maintain  capital improvements to new and existing facilities  technological advances  our competitors response to our products  and our relationships with suppliers and customers 
in addition  we may require additional capital to accommodate planned growth  hiring  infrastructure and facility needs or to consummate acquisitions of other businesses  products or technologies 
there are inherent risks associated with sales to our foreign customers 
we sell a significant portion of our product to customers outside of the united states 
sales to customers outside of the united states accounted for approximately  and of our sales in  and  respectively 
we expect that sales to customers outside of the united states will continue to account for a significant portion of our sales 
although all of our foreign sales are denominated in us dollars  such sales are subject to certain risks  including  among others  changes in regulatory requirements  the imposition of tariffs and other trade barriers  the existence of political  legal and economic instability in foreign markets  language and cultural barriers  seasonal reductions in business activities  our ability to receive timely payment and collect our accounts receivable  currency fluctuations  and potentially adverse tax consequences  which could adversely affect our business and financial results 
future sales of our common stock could depress its market price 
sales of substantial amounts of common stock by our officers  directors and other stockholders in the public  or the awareness that a large number of shares is available for sale  could adversely affect the market price of our common stock 
in addition to the adverse effect a price decline would have on holders of our common stock  that decline would impede our ability to raise capital through the issuance of additional shares of common stock or other equity or convertible debt securities

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk s the following discussion about our market risk disclosures involves forward looking statements 
actual results could differ materially from those projected in the forward looking statements 
we are exposed to market risk related to changes in interest rates 
we do not use derivative financial instruments for speculative or trading purposes 
cash  cash equivalents and investments cash and cash equivalents consist of municipal bond funds and commercial paper acquired with remaining maturity periods of days or less and are stated at cost plus accrued interest which approximates market value 
short term investments consist primarily of high grade debt securities a rating or better with maturity greater than days from the date of acquisition and are classified as available for sale 
short term investments classified as available for sale are reported at fair market value with unrealized gains or losses excluded from earnings and reported as a separate component of stockholders equity  net of tax  until realized 
these available for sale securities are subject to interest rate risk and will rise or fall in value if market interest rates change 
they are also subject to short term market risk 
we have the ability to hold our fixed income investments until maturity  and therefore we would not expect our operating results or cash flows to be affected to any significant degree by the effect of a sudden change in market interest rates on our investment portfolio 
the following table provides information about our investment portfolio and constitutes a forward looking statement 
for investment securities  the table presents principal cash flows and related weighted average interest rates by expected maturity dates
