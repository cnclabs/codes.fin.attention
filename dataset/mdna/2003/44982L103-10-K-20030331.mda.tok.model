item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion is intended to assist in the understanding and assessment of significant changes and trends related to our results of operations and our financial condition together with our consolidated subsidiaries 
this discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
historical results and percentage relationships set forth in the statement of operations  including trends which might appear  are not necessarily indicative of future operations 
overview in  we restructured the company around our higher gross margin businesses 
the result is that we are focused on two businesses providing outsourced imaging services to facilitate online transactions in the auction  classifieds and real estate markets and providing immersive imaging solutions for the real estate  security and observation and visual documentation markets 
our products and services include the capture  processing  management and distribution of images and related data 
revenues from online auctions and classifieds are primarily transaction based 
our transaction services involve designing  building and managing an image management infrastructure as well as leasing spaces from state of the art co location facilities with access to telecommunications bandwidth 
since these services are capital intensive  a high percentage of the costs associated with transaction services are fixed and accordingly the margins from transaction services are highly dependent upon asset utilization 
substantially all of our recurring revenue is derived from transaction fees generated by our rimfire service 
in particular  ebay and homestore are our largest rimfire customers 
ebay represented approximately of total revenue and of total rimfire service revenue for and approximately of total revenue and of total rimfire service revenue for fourth quarter of homestore 
com represented approximately of total revenue and of total rimfire service revenue for  but less than of total revenue and rimfire revenue for the fourth quarter our principal agreements with homestore and ebay  expire on june  and september   respectively 
these agreements are subject to extension  amendment and re negotiation from time to time 
we are currently negotiating extensions to our agreements with both customers 
significant changes in the terms of our relationships with these customers or the loss of either customer could have a material adverse effect on our business 
we believe that transaction fees from ebay will continue to increase as a percentage of rimfire and total revenue through september  as more ebay customers utilize our service on the ebay auction web site 
our immersive technology primarily generates revenues in two ways licenses of software and re sale of camera equipment 
we utilize ipix keys to license our still immersive technology to capture and save a single immersive image 
we also offer time based seat or user licenses which permit an unlimited number of immersive images to be captured and saved within a specific time period  usually a year 
our video immersive technology  which may be off line or online  may be purchased on a per unit basis or a per year license 
we sell our immersive products and services primarily into the real estate  security and observation and visual documentation markets 
the cost of sales for our licenses is low in proportion to the related revenue 
the cost of sales for the sale of camera equipment has generally been to of related revenues 
we also provide professional services to customers that request specific customizations or integrations of our products and services 
providing professional services is labor intensive  and our cost of sales for professional service tends to be to of revenues 
our real estate business has changed over the past few years 
in  our real estate focused revenues were generated from four primary sources full service virtual tours  image management services  camera kits and immersive keys  and professional services 
we offered full service virtual tours through january a full service tour includes the capture  processing  management and distribution of real estate images and related data for one price 
as part of the sale of assets to a subsidiary of homestore in january  we no longer directly sell full service virtual tours to customers in the us residential real estate market 
throughout and  our real estate focused revenues were generated from three primary sources image management services  camera kits and immersive keys  and other services 
our image management products and services were used in the real estate industry primarily to associate online still images with for sale listings 
this service is offered to customers under license agreements  transaction based agreements and revenue share agreements for real estate properties around the world 
through january   we provided homestore with processing  hosting and distribution services and received transaction fees 
ipix international in the third quarter of  we entered into license  distribution and trademark agreements with soroof international  a saudi arabia based corporation soroof 
under the agreements  soroof is the exclusive distributor for ipix immersive still products  including the ipix gps mapping system  outside of north america and asia through soroof s newly established entity  ipix international ipix i 
the agreement  effective july   expires december   unless renewed 
ipix i has an exclusive license to develop integrated solutions for markets including real estate  travel and tourism and other markets in which online marketing is critical 
ipix i serves as an effective extension of our international channel strategy and allows ipix to provide our patented immersive still products globally 
for a more detailed description of ipix i  please see note in the accompanying financial statements 
critical accounting policies financial reporting release issued by the securities and exchange commission sec requires all registrants to discuss critical accounting policies or methods used in the preparation of the financial statements 
the notes to the consolidated financial statements included in our annual report filed on form k include a summary of the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
further  we have made a number of estimates and assumptions that affect reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses and actual results may differ from those estimates 
those areas that require the greatest degree of management judgment include revenue recognition  adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts  goodwill and significant accruals 
we believe that full consideration has been given to all relevant circumstances that we may be subject to  and our financial statements accurately reflect management s best estimate of the results of operations  financial position and cash flows for the periods presented 
we believe the following represent our critical accounting policies revenue recognition we recognize revenue in accordance with sop  software revenue recognition  and sab  revenue recognition in financial statements 
transaction hosting revenues are recognized as transactions are performed provided there was persuasive evidence of an arrangement  the fee was fixed or determinable and collection of the resulting receivable was reasonably assured 
initial license fees are recognized when a contract exists  the fee is fixed or determinable  software delivery has occurred and collection of the receivable is reasonably assured 
if there are continuing obligations  then we recognize license revenue ratably over the life of the contract 
product revenue is recognized upon shipment or delivery provided there are no uncertainties surrounding product acceptance or significant vendor obligations  persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  the fees are fixed or determinable and collection is reasonably assured 
royalties derived from desktop imaging products are recognized as revenues upon receipt of the royalty sell through reports from customers  which are generally in the quarter following the quarter in which the sale by the customer took place 
revenues from the sale of our virtual tour products are recognized upon distribution to the web site designated by the customer 
revenues generated from professional services are recognized as the related services are performed 
when such professional services are combined with on going transaction services or are deemed to be essential to the functionality of the delivered software product  revenue from the entire arrangement is recognized while the transaction services are performed  on a percentage of completion method or not until the contract is completed in accordance with sop  accounting for performance of construction type and certain production type contracts  and arb  long term construction type contracts 
allowances for doubtful accounts significant management judgments and estimates must be made and used in connection with establishing the doubtful account allowances in any accounting period 
management specifically analyzes accounts receivable and historical bad debts  customer concentrations  customer credit worthiness  current economic trends and changes in our customer payment terms when evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts 
material differences could result in the amount and timing of expense recorded if management had different judgment or utilized different estimates 
goodwill under united states generally accepted accounting principles  we evaluate goodwill for impairment on an annual basis and on an interim basis if events or changes in circumstances between annual impairment tests indicate that the asset might be impaired 
in assessing the recoverability of our goodwill  we must make assumptions regarding estimated future cash flows and other factors to determine the fair value of the goodwill 
these estimates include forecasted revenues and operating expenses  which are inherently difficult to predict 
if these estimates or their related assumptions change in the future  we may be required to record impairment charges for these assets 
we believe that the accounting estimate related to goodwill is a critical accounting estimate because it requires company management to make assumptions about fair values and the impact of recognizing an impairment could be material to our financial position  as well as our results of operations 
management s assumptions about fair values require significant judgment because broad economic factors  industry factors and technology considerations can result in variable and volatile fair values 
if we are unable to extend our agreement with ebay  we may incur a significant impairment of our goodwill 
significant accruals  including restructuring charges and sales tax we recorded restructuring charges associated with vacated facilities 
the key assumptions associated with these charges include the timing and amount of sub lease income 
in addition  in establishing and providing for sales tax accruals  we make judgments based on the actual tax laws and guidance 
while management believes that its judgments and interpretations regarding tax liabilities are appropriate  significant differences in actual experience may materially affect our future financial results

we account for our investment in ipix i on the cost basis 
we did not make any capital contributions to ipix i and we have no commitments to fund ipix i

as a result of the settlement  each of the lawsuits and the arbitration proceeding described above in item were dismissed and mutual releases were executed 
pursuant to the settlement agreement  neither party admitted liability or any wrong doing 
we were granted a non exclusive license under patents and pending patents conceived by oxaal or in which oxaal has an interest 
the license rights inure to the benefit of our customers with respect to their purchases from us and also inure to the benefit of our business partners with respect to their business relations with us

during the quarter ending september   we received approximately million in cash from a previously disclosed favorable jury verdict against infinite pictures that found the defendants liable for infringement of our patents under the doctrine of equivalents and awarding us million in damages  plus million in interest and court costs 
the defendants filed for a writ of certiorari with the united states supreme court in an effort to reverse the lower court s findings in our favor 
the supreme court refused to grant the writ  which exhausted the legal remedies for disputing the award 
accordingly  we recorded the million in damages as a patent infringement award  along with the million in interest and court costs  in the quarter ended september  restructuring actions we executed several restructuring actions throughout and these actions and the charges relating to them are described below 
on march   we had employees  but by the end of the second quarter we had reduced our workforce by approximately positions

we expect continued savings to be realized primarily in cost of sales  but also in selling  general and administrative expenses and research and development expenses 
outlook the company is subject to generally prevailing economic conditions and  as such  believes that much of our success in will be dependent upon the success of our customers and the appropriations processes of various governmental departments 
with the elimination of million of full service real estate revenue and other lower margin businesses  revenue in was less than  but due to the restructuring actions described above  our gross margins were improved 
our principal agreements with homestore and ebay  expire on june  and september   respectively 
these agreements are subject to extension  amendment and re negotiation from time to time 
we are currently negotiating extensions to our agreements with both customers 
significant changes in the terms of our relationships with these customers or the loss of either customer could have a material adverse effect on our business 
we believe that transaction fees from ebay will continue to increase as a percentage of revenue through september  as more ebay customers utilize our service on the ebay auction web site 
in  we are launching products aimed at serving the growing needs of the security and observation markets
