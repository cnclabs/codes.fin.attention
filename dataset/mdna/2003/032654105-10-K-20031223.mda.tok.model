item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations results of operations fiscal year overview overall  fiscal was a better year for analog devices than we had anticipated at the beginning of the year 
we recorded net sales of  million in fiscal  which was a increase over the amount recorded in fiscal fiscal was the low point in the current cycle in the industry when revenues were down from the levels recorded in fiscal however  the gradual recovery  which started for us in the second quarter of fiscal  continued throughout fiscal our gross margins improved to in fiscal from in fiscal and diluted earnings per share improved to per share in fiscal from per share in fiscal we generated million in operating cash during the year and finished the year with  million of cash  cash equivalents and short term investments after redeeming all of our  million outstanding debt 
fiscal results of operations compared to fiscal sales net sales were  million in fiscal  an increase of from net sales of  million in fiscal the increase in net sales in fiscal was attributable to increased demand for analog and dsp products used in wireless handsets  in desktop and laptop computers and for analog products used in consumer applications such as digital cameras and flat panel displays 
sales of analog and dsp products used in wireless infrastructure and broadband access grew slightly in fiscal and sales of broadband infrastructure applications decreased in fiscal from the levels recorded in the prior year 
we experienced a slow steady improvement in demand for products used in industrial applications during fiscal  particularly analog products used in automotive and automatic test equipment 
in general  demand during fiscal was strongest for products that are used by consumers while demand for products used in applications that depend on industrial  enterprise or carrier capital spending were flat 
during fiscal analog product sales increased from the levels recorded in fiscal dsp product sales increased by from the prior year during fiscal in fiscal  approximately of our net sales were from analog products  down from in the prior year 
dsp product sales represented the remaining and respectively  of our net sales in fiscal and fiscal sales of new products  which we define as sales of products introduced in the prior six quarters  were of net sales in fiscal as compared to in fiscal the year over year dollar increase in sales of new products was in fiscal and was attributable to design wins for some of our communications  consumer and computer products 
this increase followed declines of and respectively  in fiscal and fiscal as we went through the down turn of the current cycle in the semiconductor industry 
the percentage of sales by geographic region  based upon point of sale  for the last two years is as follows region fiscal fiscal north america europe japan southeast asia the fiscal decrease in north american sales and the increase in southeast asia sales as a percentage of total net sales were principally attributable to the ongoing transfer of customer manufacturing activity to asia 
sales in dollars increased in fiscal by and in southeast asia and japan  respectively  as a result of increased demand for products used in communications  consumer and computer applications as well as the ongoing transfer of manufacturing activity to locations primarily in asia 
sales in dollars in fiscal increased by in europe as a result of the steady improvement in demand for our 
table of contents products during the year 
the slight increase in north america sales in dollars was attributable to increased regional demand for our products that was largely offset by the transfer of customer manufacturing activity to locations in asia 
gross margin gross margin improved in fiscal to  million  or of net sales  up basis points from fiscal gross margin of million  or of net sales 
this improvement was primarily the result of spreading fixed manufacturing costs over an increasing sales level each quarter and  to a lesser extent  the impact of restructuring actions we took over the last two years and continued cost constraints at our manufacturing operations 
research and development research and development  or r d  expenses amounted to million in fiscal  an increase of million or from the million recorded in fiscal r d expenses declined as a percentage of net sales to in fiscal from in fiscal as a result of the year to year increase in revenue and only a year to year increase in r d expenses 
the year to year increase in r d expenses was limited to as a result of acquisition related expenses declining year to year by million and the company limiting discretionary expenses including salary increases for higher paid employees and curtailing hiring to strategically important new hires and college hires 
the reduction in acquisition related expenses to million in fiscal from million in fiscal arose primarily because fiscal costs included expense related to fixed value contingent compensation and the achievement of final performance based criteria that did not recur in fiscal r d expense as a percentage of net sales will fluctuate from year to year depending on the amount of net sales and the success of new product development efforts  which we view as critical for future growth 
at any point in time we have hundreds of r d projects underway  and we believe that none of these projects is material on an individual basis 
we expect to continue the development of innovative technologies and processes for new products and we believe that a continued commitment to r d is essential in order to maintain product leadership with our existing products and to provide innovative new product offerings  and therefore  we expect to continue to make significant r d investments in the future 
selling  marketing  general and administrative selling  marketing  general and administrative  or smg a  expenses were million in fiscal  an increase of million  or  from the million recorded in fiscal as a percentage of net sales  smg a declined to for fiscal from in fiscal primarily due to the increase in net sales 
the increase in smg a expenses in dollars was primarily the result of increased commission expenses paid due to the year to year increase in net sales  the decision to add additional field application engineers to assist customers and potential customers design products that incorporate adi technology to address their specific requirements  as well as initiatives to publicize new products 
these increases were offset by limiting discretionary expenses including salary increases for higher paid employees 
amortization of intangibles amortization of intangibles was million for fiscal compared with million for fiscal the decrease in amortization expense was the result of our fiscal adoption of statement of financial accounting standards no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
special charges during fiscal  we recorded special charges of million  and during fiscal we recorded special charges totaling million 
special charges recorded over the last three fiscal years are more fully described under the heading special charges below 

table of contents operating income our operating income was million  or of net sales  in fiscal  compared to million  or of net sales  in fiscal nonoperating income and expense interest expense was million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal fiscal includes interest expense for months and fiscal includes interest expense for only months because we redeemed our convertible subordinated notes  or notes  on october  in addition  an interest rate swap agreement we entered into in january had the effect of swapping the fixed rate of our notes into a libor based floating rate which was as of november  and was at the time we redeemed our notes on october  these two items resulted in the year to year decline in interest expense 
interest income was million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal the year to year decrease in interest income was attributable to less income earned on our invested cash balances due to the decline in interest rates during fiscal as a result of actions taken by the federal reserve board and our decision to increase our holdings of higher credit quality yet lower interest bearing investments 
provision for income taxes our effective income tax rate decreased to for fiscal as compared to for fiscal the decrease was primarily the result of the discontinuance of goodwill amortization in the first quarter of fiscal as a result of our adoption of financial accounting standards board statement of financial accounting standards no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
goodwill was treated as a permanent difference in prior years tax provisions which had the effect of increasing our effective income tax rate 
net income fiscal net income was million  or of net sales  and diluted earnings per share was compared to net income in fiscal of million  or of net sales  and diluted earnings per share of 
the fiscal increase in net income from fiscal was primarily due to increased revenue levels and  to a lesser extent  the cessation of goodwill amortization and reduced expenses related to special charges 
the impact of inflation on our business during the past three fiscal years has not been significant 
related party transactions one of our directors  who has been a director since  became a director of taiwan semiconductor manufacturing company  or tsmc  in fiscal we purchased approximately million and million of products from tsmc in fiscal and  respectively 
we believe that the terms and prices for the purchases of these products are at terms no less favorable than those obtained from unaffiliated parties 
approximately million and million was payable to tsmc as of november  and november   respectively 
we anticipate that we will make similar purchases from tsmc in fiscal year liquidity and capital resources fiscal net cash flow provided by operations was million  or of net sales  an increase of million over the prior year 
the year over year increase was primarily due to an increase in net income of million 
in addition  we received million in proceeds from our various employee stock programs 
these cash inflows were offset by a net payment of  million related to the redemption of all of our outstanding notes together with the associated redemption premium and the termination of the related interest rate swap and loan agreement and capital expenditures of million 
cash  cash equivalents and short term investments decreased million during fiscal to  million at november  from  million at november  primarily as a result of these activities 
accounts receivable of million at the end of fiscal increased million  or  from million at the end of fiscal this increase resulted principally from a million increase in net 
table of contents sales during the fourth quarter of fiscal as compared to the fourth quarter of fiscal days sales outstanding increased from days at the end of the fourth quarter of fiscal to days at the end of the fourth quarter of fiscal the year to year increase in days sales outstanding was due to a higher level of sales in the latter part of the fourth quarter of fiscal as compared to the fourth quarter of fiscal inventories declined by million  or  from the end of fiscal to million at the end of fiscal days cost of sales in inventory declined by days to days as of the end of the fourth quarter of fiscal the decrease in inventory in dollars was attributable to tight control of inventory levels as well as increasing demand for our products as the year progressed 
in response to the slowdown in our served markets in fiscal and  we have substantially reduced our capital spending in the last two years 
net additions to property  plant and equipment were million in fiscal and million in fiscal  which represented approximately of net sales for each of those years 
fiscal capital expenditures are expected to return to historical levels of of annual net sales  or approximately million 
in the fourth quarter of fiscal  we redeemed for cash all of our outstanding notes 
the redemption price was of the principal amount of the notes  or  million 
a net pre tax loss of million was recognized in other expense as a result of the redemption  comprised of a million gain on the redemption of the notes which was offset by a write off of million of deferred financing costs 
the gain on the redemption of the notes was due to the carrying value of the notes being greater than the redemption value as a result of the mark to market of the interest rate component of the notes to fair value 
as a result  apart from operating lease obligations  we had no debt at the end of fiscal year on november   our board of directors declared a cash dividend of per outstanding share of common stock 
the dividend was paid on december  and was approximately million 
the payment of future dividends will be based on our quarterly financial performance 
the table below summarizes our contractual obligations as of november  payment due by period thousands total less than year years years more than years contractual obligations operating leases at november   our principal source of liquidity was  million of cash and cash equivalents and short term investments 
we believe that our existing sources of liquidity and cash expected to be generated from future operations  together with anticipated available long term financing  will be sufficient to fund operations  capital expenditures and research and development efforts for at least the next twelve months and thereafter for the foreseeable future 
outlook analog devices is in a strong financial position entering fiscal we are planning for annual revenue growth of approximately  with gross margins continuing to improve through the year 
similar to fiscal  we anticipate that our operating expenses will grow at a rate well below our revenue growth rate 
our goal remains to increase our earnings at a rate that is twice the growth rate of our sales until we reach our model operating results 
we currently plan to make capital expenditures of approximately million in fiscal depreciation expense is expected to decrease to million in fiscal from million in fiscal we anticipate that our effective tax rate will remain relatively flat year to year at approximately 
as a result of increased demand for our products during the fourth quarter of fiscal  we are planning for revenues to increase from the fourth quarter of fiscal to the first quarter of fiscal and for diluted earnings per share to be in the range of to in the first quarter of fiscal 
table of contents fiscal results of operations compared to fiscal fiscal was a challenging year for analog devices 
the decrease in net sales from fiscal to fiscal was due to the declining demand in several markets that we serve  particularly the communications market  as well as an overall decline in the general economy 
quarterly sales reached million in the fourth quarter of fiscal but declined rapidly throughout fiscal and reached the lowest point in this cycle in the first quarter of fiscal  for which quarter we recorded sales of million 
in the last three quarters of fiscal  we experienced a steady sequential improvement in demand and sales reached million in the fourth quarter 
during this downturn  we maintained gross margins at in fiscal and  as a result of decisive cost containment measures we undertook  we reduced operating expenses year to year by 
cash flow remained strong with cash increasing by over million during fiscal to  million after we purchased million of our common stock 
profit and loss account year to year changes are summarized as follows net sales were  million  down from  million in fiscal as a result of the cyclical downturn in the semiconductor market 
the percentage of sales by geographic region  based upon point of sale  for fiscal years and is set out below 
the decline in north american sales and increase in southeast asia sales as a percentage of total sales was primarily due to a decline in the communications market in fiscal combined with the transfer of customer manufacturing activity to other locations  primarily in asia 
region fiscal fiscal north america europe japan southeast asia cost of sales was million in fiscal  down from  million in fiscal in the second quarter of fiscal  we announced that we would transition products from our older four inch wafer fabrication facilities to our six inch and eight inch wafer fabrication facilities that were then operating well below capacity 
as a result  the remaining service lives of certain assets within our wafer fabrication facilities were shortened 
depreciation expense included in cost of sales included additional depreciation of approximately million in fiscal associated with the shortened lives of some equipment in our older four inch wafer fabrication facilities 
gross margin in fiscal was million  or of net sales  down from  million  or of net sales  in the prior year 
the reduction was primarily due to the year to year decrease in revenue and lower utilization of our internal manufacturing facilities 
r d expenses declined from million in fiscal to million in fiscal the decline was primarily the result of the elimination of bonuses and the temporary reduction of salaries for our more highly compensated employees partially offset by an increase in acquisition related expenses and selective hiring of engineers 
r d expenses increased from of net sales in fiscal to of net sales in fiscal primarily as a result of the decline in sales year to year 
smg a expenses declined by million to million in fiscal  from the million recorded in fiscal the decline year to year was due to the elimination of bonuses  the temporary reduction in salaries for our highly compensated employees and tight control over all discretionary expenses 
these reductions were offset by our decision to increase our field applications engineers in order to help our customers design in our newest products 
smg a expenses increased from of net sales in fiscal to of net sales in fiscal primarily as a result of the reduced sales levels 
amortization of intangibles was million in fiscal  up from million recorded in fiscal the increase in amortization expense in fiscal was primarily due to amortization of goodwill for the full 
table of contents year associated with acquisitions completed in fiscal where amortization commenced during fiscal special charges recorded in fiscal and were million and million  respectively 
special charges recorded over the last three fiscal years are more fully described under the heading special charges below 
operating income was million  or of net sales  in fiscal  compared to million  or of net sales  in fiscal nonoperating income and expense interest expense was million and million in fiscal and  respectively 
the decrease year to year was the result of an interest rate swap agreement entered into in january that had the effect of swapping the fixed rate of our  million convertible subordinated notes into a libor based floating rate as of november  
interest income declined from million in fiscal to million in fiscal as a result of less income earned on our invested cash balances due to a decline in interest rates during fiscal other income declined approximately million from fiscal to fiscal due to a one time gain on the sale of an investment in wafertech recorded in the first quarter of fiscal our effective income tax rate decreased from for fiscal to for fiscal as a result of a shift in the mix of worldwide profits 
net income decreased to million  or of net sales  in fiscal from million  or of net sales  in fiscal this decrease in net income was primarily due to reduced revenue levels 
liquidity and capital resource changes year to year are summarized as follows cash  cash equivalents and short term investments amounted to  million at november   up million from  million at november  the increase of million was the result of operating cash inflows of million of fiscal net sales and million of proceeds from employee stock plans  offset by a million repurchase of shares of our common stock and million of capital expenditures 
accounts receivable increased by million to million from million at the end of fiscal  as a result of a million increase in fourth quarter sales year to year 
days sales outstanding remained flat at days for both fiscal year end and inventory increased by million  or  to million at the end of fiscal the inventory increase was primarily the result of a build in die bank inventory in preparation for the transfer of production from our four inch wafer fabrication facilities to our six and eight inch wafer fabrication facilities and the purchase of external wafers in support of expected demand in our handset and consumer analog business 
we acquired five companies during fiscal  as more fully described below under the heading acquisitions 
total cash used to purchase these companies was approximately million in and another million was paid in fiscal as certain operational objectives were achieved  and these additional payments were accounted for as additional goodwill 
net additions to property  plant and equipment were million in fiscal  down from million in fiscal the sharp year to year reduction in capital spending was in response to the cyclical downturn in the semiconductor industry worldwide 
special charges special charges fiscal during the third quarter of fiscal  we recorded a special charge of million 
the charge included a million write down of equipment to fair value due to a decision to outsource the assembly of products in 
table of contents plastic packages  which had been done internally at our facility in the philippines 
this amount was the net book value of the assets used in plastic assembly  net of proceeds received from the sale in the third quarter of a portion of the assets 
we also decided to abandon efforts to develop a particular expertise in optical communications that resulted in the write down of million of equipment to fair value 
during the quarter ended august   we determined that the costs remaining to be paid for certain restructuring charges would be less than the amount originally recorded 
accordingly  we recorded a change in estimate reducing the restructuring accruals by million related to prior restructuring charges as more fully described below 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal  we recorded a special charge of million as a result of a decision to close a small manufacturing facility in belfast  northern ireland that supplied foundry substrate services for optical applications 
the charge included million of severance costs for approximately manufacturing employees and engineering and administrative employees  none of whom had been terminated as of november  the charge also included million related to the write down of property  plant and equipment to fair value and million related to the write down of various other assets to fair values 
the closure is anticipated to be completed during the first half of fiscal we anticipate annual savings from the above actions of approximately million  of which half is in cost of sales and half is in operating expenses 
of the million of special charges recorded in fiscal  million related to separation costs remained accrued as of november  all remaining severance will be paid in the first half of fiscal special charges fiscal during the second quarter of fiscal  we recorded special charges of approximately million 
the second quarter charge was comprised of million related to the planned transfer of production from our three older four inch wafer fabrication facilities to our three six inch and one eight inch wafer fabrication facilities  and million primarily related to the impairment of an investment  which was partially offset by an adjustment of million related to equipment cancelation fees recorded in fiscal year the investment impairment  which was related to an equity investment in a private company  was due to our decision to abandon the product strategy for which the investment was made 
included in the million special charge were severance and fringe benefit costs of million for manufacturing employees in the united states and ireland  million related to the write down of equipment to be abandoned and million of other charges  primarily related to lease termination and cleanup costs 
the write down of equipment was principally due to a decision to discontinue various product development strategies 
in the third quarter of fiscal  we reversed million of the accrual primarily due to lower than previously expected severance costs 
the lower severance costs were the result of a reduction in the number of separated employees and  to a lesser extent  the average tenure of separated employees differing from estimates 
the employees projected to be terminated at the time of the original charge was adjusted down to  and as of november   employees had been terminated 
the reduction in the number of employees to be terminated was due to the transfer of employees  which primarily occurred in the third quarter of fiscal  to positions in our six inch wafer fabrication facilities where we experienced an unexpected increase in demand for our products 
the process of ceasing production in the four inch wafer fabrication facilities is complete 
the equipment disposition and clean up activity is underway at each site and the related clean up costs  which were included in the special charge  will be expended as this activity is completed 
the remaining clean up will be substantially complete by the end of the second quarter of fiscal since severance costs are paid as income continuance at some locations  these amounts will be expended over time subsequent to the final termination of employment 
we anticipate annual savings from the above actions of approximately million  primarily in cost of sales  and the first full year s impact will be fiscal in addition to the above special charges  the remaining service lives of certain assets within the older four inch wafer fabrication facilities were shortened 
as a result  cost of sales for the fiscal year included additional depreciation of approximately million associated with the shortened lives 
during the third quarter of fiscal  we recorded special charges of approximately million 
the charges included severance and fringe benefit costs of million related to cost reduction actions taken in 
table of contents several product groups and  to a lesser extent  in manufacturing  million related to the impairment of an investment  million related to the impairment of goodwill associated with the closing of an austrian design center acquired in fiscal and million primarily related to the abandonment of equipment and lease cancelation fees 
the investment impairment  which was related to an equity investment in a private company  was due to our decision to abandon the product strategy for which the investment was made 
the severance and fringe benefit costs were for approximately engineering employees in the united states  europe and canada  and approximately manufacturing employees in the united states 
all of the manufacturing employees and substantially all of the engineering employees had been terminated as of november  the workforce reductions are anticipated to result in annual savings of approximately million  primarily in operating expenses 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal  we recorded special charges of approximately million 
the charges included severance and fringe benefit costs of million related to cost reduction actions taken in the sales group  several product groups and our manufacturing test operations for approximately employees in the united states and europe  all of which had been terminated as of november  the charges also included million related to the impairment of investments  million primarily related to the abandonment of equipment and lease cancelation fees and a change in estimate of million for additional estimated clean up costs originally recorded in the second quarter of fiscal the investment impairment charges were related to the decline in fair value of a publicly traded equity investment to less than its cost basis that was determined to be other than temporary  and to an equity investment in a private company 
the private company equity investment was part of a product strategy that we decided to abandon 
the workforce reductions are anticipated to result in annual savings of approximately million  primarily in operating expenses 
of the million of special charges recorded in fiscal  million primarily related to clean up costs and million related to separation costs  primarily being paid as income continuance  remained accrued as of november  special charges fiscal during fiscal  we recorded special charges of approximately million related to cost reduction actions taken in response to the economic climate at that time 
the actions consisted of workforce reductions in manufacturing and  to a lesser extent  in selling  marketing and administrative areas as well as a decision to consolidate worldwide manufacturing operations and rationalize production planning and quality activities 
the cost reductions included severance and fringe benefit costs of million for approximately  employees in the us  europe  asia and the philippines  substantially all of which had been terminated as of november  the special charges also included million related to the abandonment of equipment resulting from the consolidation of worldwide manufacturing operations and million of other charges primarily related to equipment and lease cancelation fees 
based on the results of negotiations with vendors regarding purchase order cancelation fees  the amount paid was million less than the amount recorded for such charges and  accordingly  we adjusted the provision for purchase order cancelation fees by million in the second quarter of fiscal to reflect this change in estimate 
in the third quarter of fiscal  we determined that the severance costs remaining to be paid would be million less than the amount originally recorded for these charges and also determined that million originally reserved for the termination of two leases would not be required 
therefore  we adjusted the provision for these severance and other costs in the third quarter of fiscal to reflect this change in estimate 
the impact in fiscal of these cost savings was approximately million  consisting of a million reduction in cost of sales and a million reduction in operating expenses 
of the million of special charges recorded in fiscal  million remained accrued as of november   and primarily represents severance payments being paid as income continuance to certain of the  terminated employees  predominantly in the us  substantially all of which will be paid by the end of fiscal 
table of contents acquisitions during the first quarter of fiscal  we completed the following acquisitions in the first quarter of fiscal  we completed the acquisitions of thomas neuroth ag  signal processing associates pty 
ltd 
and integrated micro instruments  inc the total amount paid for these acquisitions  as of november   was million 
as of november   the remaining contingent consideration was million 
in order to be entitled to receive the contingent consideration  the former shareholders of integrated micro instruments  inc  who are employed by analog  must continue to be employed by analog 
as such  the contingent consideration will be recorded as compensation expense 
on january   we acquired chiplogic  inc of santa clara  california 
chiplogic is a developer of high performance integrated circuits and software focused on the convergence of voice  broadband access and network protocol processing 
the total purchase price of million consisted of cash of approximately million  approximately million shares of our common stock valued at million and the assumption of million of outstanding chiplogic vested stock options 
the fair value of our common stock issued was determined based on the average market price of our common stock for the seven day period  including three days before and after the date the acquisition was announced and the terms of the acquisition were agreed upon 
approximately million represented the purchase price of in process technology and was charged to operations during fiscal because the software project had not yet reached technological feasibility and had no alternative future use 
the in process technology related to software developed to handle voice processing  signaling  packet management and routing  quality of service and networking interface functions 
this software is embedded in a network processor that provides for a wide area to local area network bridge 
the fair value of the in process technology was determined by a third party using the income forecast method  which is a discounted net cash flow approach 
at the time of the acquisition  the in process technology was approximately complete 
the in process technology was completed in the second quarter of fiscal expenditures to complete the in process technology totaled million  representing primarily personnel costs 
an additional million of cash consideration and  shares of common stock were due and payable in the event that the former shareholders and key employees remain employed at analog and upon the achievement of certain operational objectives 
of these shares   shares have been issued to the former shareholders and have a fixed value of million 
this amount is being charged ratably to operations over a five year period based on continuing employment 
accordingly  the issuance of these shares is compensatory and is treated as compensation expense over the service period 
the remaining  shares were subject to operational performance based criteria and were only issuable to those former shareholders and key employees who remained employed at analog at the time the operational milestones were met 
accordingly  the issuance of these shares was compensatory and was recorded as compensation expense when the achievement of each defined contractual milestone became probable 
as of november   all of the operational milestones had been met and approximately million and million of expense was recorded related to the issuance of the shares in fiscal and  respectively 
as of november   there was approximately million of contingent consideration remaining to be paid 
an additional million of compensation expense is being recorded annually through fiscal related to the assumption of unvested stock options 
on january   we acquired staccato systems  inc of mountain view  california 
staccato is in the field of audio synthesis technology 
the total purchase price of million consisted of million in cash and the assumption of million of vested outstanding staccato stock options 
we paid an additional million to the selling shareholders related to the achievement of operational objectives 
these payments were accounted for as additional purchase price and recorded to goodwill because the payments were not contingent on continued employment by the former shareholders of staccato who became analog employees 
we paid contingent consideration payments to the former shareholders of million and million in fiscal and  respectively 
no additional contingent consideration payments will be made 
an additional million of compensation expense is being recorded annually through fiscal related to the assumption of unvested stock options

fas requires that all business combinations initiated after june  be accounted for using the purchase method of accounting 
fas  which became effective for our company in fiscal year  prohibits the amortization of goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite useful lives 
fas requires that these assets be reviewed for impairment at least annually  or more frequently if impairment indicators arise 
other intangible assets with finite lives will continue to be amortized over their estimated useful lives and assessed for impairment under fas we test goodwill for impairment using the two step process prescribed by fas the first step is a screen for potential impairment  while the second step measures the amount of the impairment  if any 
in the first step  if the fair value of the reporting unit s exceed s the carrying value  no impairment loss is recognized 
if the carrying value of the reporting unit s exceed s the fair value  goodwill is potentially impaired and we must complete step two in order to measure the impairment loss 
step two compares the implied fair value of the goodwill with the carrying amount of that goodwill 
if the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of that goodwill  an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess 
we adopted fas in the first quarter of fiscal application of the nonamortization provisions of fas resulted in an increase in annual net income of million in fiscal we completed the required impairment test of goodwill upon adoption of fas as of november  in the second quarter of fiscal the results of the impairment review indicated that there was no impairment of goodwill

we have also provided certain indemnities under which we may be required to make payments to an indemnified party in connection with certain transactions and agreements  in particular with respect to certain acquisitions and divestitures  we have provided customary indemnities for such matters as environmental  tax  product and employee liabilities 
in addition  in connection with various other agreements  including subsidiary banking agreements  we may provide routine guarantees 
generally  because a maximum obligation is not explicitly stated  the potential amount of future maximum payments cannot be reasonably estimated  and therefore  we have not recorded any liability for these indemnities in the consolidated financial statements 
the duration of the indemnities varies  and in many cases is indefinite 

table of contents in january  the financial accounting standards board issued financial accounting standards board interpretation no 
fin  consolidation of variable interest entities 
fin requires that if an entity has a controlling financial interest in a variable interest entity  the assets  liabilities and results of activities of the variable interest entity should be included in the consolidated financial statements of the entity 
fin is effective immediately for all new variable interest entities created or acquired after january  for variable interest entities created or acquired prior to february   the provisions of fin must be applied for the first interim or annual period beginning after december  we are required to adopt the provisions of fin in the second quarter of fiscal and do not expect the adoption to have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations 
critical accounting policies and estimates management s discussion and analysis of the financial condition and results of operations is based upon the consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
we base our estimates and judgments on historical experience  knowledge of current conditions and beliefs of what could occur in the future given available information 
we consider the following accounting policies to be both those most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and those that require the most subjective judgment 
if actual results differ significantly from management s estimates and projections  there could be a material effect on our financial statements 
inventory valuation inventories are valued at the lower of cost first in  first out method or market 
because of the cyclical nature of the semiconductor industry  changes in inventory levels  obsolescence of technology  and product life cycles  we write down inventories to net realizable value 
we employ a variety of consistent methodologies to determine the amount of inventory reserves necessary 
while a portion of the reserve is determined via reference to the age of inventory and lower of cost or market calculations  an element of the reserve is subject to significant judgments by us about future demand for our inventory 
additionally  we have built inventory in preparation for the transfer of production from our four inch wafer fabrication facilities to our six and eight inch wafer fabrication facilities for both lifetime supply and transition inventory 
we have recorded certain levels of reserves related to these inventory builds 
although we believe that we have used our best efforts and available information to estimate future demand  due to the uncertain economic times and the difficulty inherent in predicting future results  it is possible that actual demand for our products will differ from our estimates 
if actual demand for our products is less than our estimates  additional reserves for existing inventories may need to be recorded in future periods 
allowance for doubtful accounts we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts  when appropriate  for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  our actual losses may exceed our estimates  and additional allowances would be required 
long lived assets and goodwill we review property  plant  and equipment for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of assets may not be recoverable 
recoverability of these assets is measured by comparison of their carrying amount to future undiscounted cash flows the assets are expected to generate over their remaining economic life 
if such assets are considered to be impaired  the impairment to be recognized in earnings equals the amount by which the carrying value of the assets exceeds their fair market value determined by either a quoted market price  if any  or a value determined by utilizing a discounted cash flow technique 
although we have recognized no material impairment adjustments related to our property  plant  and equipment during the past three fiscal years  except those made in conjunction with restructuring actions  deterioration in our business in the future could lead to such impairment adjustments in future 
table of contents periods 
evaluation of impairment of long lived assets requires estimates of future operating results that are used in the preparation of the expected future undiscounted cash flows 
actual future operating results and the remaining economic lives of our long lived assets could differ from the estimates used in assessing the recoverability of these assets 
these differences could result in impairment charges  which could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations 
in june  the financial accounting standards board issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 or fas  goodwill and other intangible assets 
in the first quarter of fiscal  we adopted the new rules of fas for measuring and assessing goodwill for impairment 
as required by fas  all remaining and future acquired goodwill is subject to annual impairment tests  or earlier if indicators of potential impairment exist 
the estimates and assumptions described above along with other factors such as discount rates will affect the amount of an impairment loss  if any  we recognize under fas we are required to test goodwill for impairment  which may result in impairment losses that could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations 
accounting for income taxes we account for income taxes in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 or fas  accounting for income taxes  which requires that deferred tax assets and liabilities be recognized using enacted tax rates for the effect of temporary differences between the book and tax bases of recorded assets and liabilities 
fas also requires that deferred tax assets be reduced by a valuation allowance if it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax asset will not be realized 
we evaluate the realizability of our deferred tax assets quarterly 
at november   we had deferred tax assets of million primarily resulting from temporary differences between the book and tax bases of assets and liabilities 
while these assets are not assured of realization  we have conducted an assessment of the likelihood of realization and concluded that no significant valuation allowance is required 
in reaching our conclusion  we evaluated certain relevant criteria including the existence of deferred tax liabilities that can be used to absorb deferred tax assets  the taxable income in prior carryback years that can be used to absorb net operating losses and taxable income in future years 
our judgments regarding future profitability may change due to future market conditions  changes in us or international tax laws and other factors 
these changes  if any  may require material adjustments to these deferred tax assets  resulting in a reduction in net income or an increase in net loss in the period when such determinations are made 
in addition  we have provided for potential liabilities due in various foreign jurisdictions 
judgment is required in determining our worldwide income tax expense provision 
in the ordinary course of global business  there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax outcome is uncertain 
some of these uncertainties arise as a consequence of cost reimbursement arrangements among related entities 
although we believe our estimates are reasonable  no assurance can be given that the final tax outcome of these matters will not be different than that which is reflected in our historical income tax provisions and accruals 
such differences could have a material impact on our income tax provision and operating results in the period in which such determination is made 
contingencies from time to time  we receive notices that our products or manufacturing processes may be infringing the patent or intellectual property rights of others 
we periodically assess each matter in order to determine if a contingent liability in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 or fas  accounting for contingencies  should be recorded 
in making this determination  we may  depending on the nature of the matter  consult with internal and external legal counsel and technical experts 
based on the information we obtain  combined with our judgment regarding all the facts and circumstances of each matter  we determine whether it is probable that a contingent loss may be incurred and whether the amount of such loss can be reasonably estimated 
should a loss be probable and reasonably estimable  we record a contingent loss in accordance with fas in determining the amount of a contingent loss  we consider advice received from experts in the specific matter  current status of legal proceedings  settlement negotiations that may be ongoing  prior case history and other factors 
should the judgments and estimates made by us be incorrect  we 
table of contents may need to record additional contingent losses that could materially adversely impact our results of operations 
see note to our consolidated financial statements contained in item of this annual report on form k 
forward looking statements this annual report on form k contains or incorporates forward looking statements within the meaning of section a of the securities act of and section e of the securities exchange act of these forward looking statements are based on current expectations  estimates  forecasts and projections about the industry and markets in which we operate and management s beliefs and assumptions 
in addition  other written or oral statements that constitute forward looking statements may be made by or on our behalf 
words such as expect  anticipate  intend  plan  believe  seek  estimate  variations of such words and similar expressions are intended to identify such forward looking statements 
these statements are not guarantees of future performance and involve certain risks  uncertainties and assumptions that are difficult to predict 
we have included important factors in the cautionary statements below under the heading factors that may affect future results that we believe could cause our actual results to differ materially from the forward looking statements we make 
we do not intend to update publicly any forward looking statements  whether as a result of new information  future events or otherwise 
factors that may affect future results our future operating results are difficult to predict and may materially fluctuate 
our future operating results are difficult to predict and may be materially affected by a number of factors  including the timing of new product announcements or introductions by us or our competitors  competitive pricing pressures  fluctuations in manufacturing yields  adequate availability of wafers and manufacturing capacity  the risk that our backlog could decline significantly  our ability to hire  retain and motivate adequate numbers of engineers and other qualified employees to meet the demands of our customers  changes in product mix  and the effect of adverse changes in economic conditions in the united states and international markets 
in addition  the semiconductor market has historically been cyclical and subject to significant economic downturns 
our business is subject to rapid technological changes and there can be no assurance  depending on the mix of future business  that products stocked in inventory will not be rendered obsolete before we ship them 
as a result of these and other factors  there can be no assurance that we will not experience material fluctuations in future operating results on a quarterly or annual basis 
long term contracts are not typical for us and reductions  cancelations or delays in orders for our products could adversely affect our operating results 
in certain markets where end user demand may be particularly volatile and difficult to predict  some customers place orders that require us to manufacture product and have it available for shipment  even though the customer is unwilling to make a binding commitment to purchase all  or even any  of the product 
at any given time  this situation could affect a portion of our backlog 
as a result  we are subject to the risk of cancelation of orders leading to a sharp fall off of sales and backlog 
further  those orders may be for products that meet the customer s unique requirements so that those canceled orders would  in addition  result in an inventory of unsaleable products  resulting in potential inventory write offs 
as a result of lengthy manufacturing cycles for certain of the products subject to these uncertainties  the amount of unsaleable product could be substantial 
reductions  cancelations or delays in orders for our products could adversely affect our operating results 
our future success depends upon our ability to develop and market new products and enter new markets 
our success significantly depends on our continued ability to develop and market new products 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to develop and introduce new products in a timely manner or that new products  if developed  will achieve market acceptance 
in addition  our growth is dependent on our continued ability to penetrate new markets where we have limited experience and competition is intense 
there can be 
table of contents no assurance that the markets we serve will grow in the future  that our existing and new products will meet the requirements of these markets  that our products will achieve customer acceptance in these markets  that competitors will not force prices to an unacceptably low level or take market share from us  or that we can achieve or maintain profits in these markets 
furthermore  a decline in demand in one or several of our end user markets could have a material adverse effect on the demand for our products and our results of operations 
also  some of our customers in these markets are less established  which could subject us to increased credit risk 
we may not be able to compete successfully in the semiconductor industry in the future 
many other companies offer products that compete with our products 
some have greater financial  manufacturing  technical and marketing resources than we have 
additionally  some formerly independent competitors have been purchased by larger companies 
our competitors also include emerging companies selling specialized products to markets we serve 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to compete successfully in the future against existing or new competitors  or that our operating results will not be adversely affected by increased price competition 
we rely on third party subcontractors and manufacturers for some industry standard wafers and assembly test services  and therefore cannot control their availability or conditions of supply 
we rely  and plan to continue to rely  on assembly and test subcontractors and on third party wafer fabricators to supply most of our wafers that can be manufactured using industry standard submicron processes 
this reliance involves several risks  including reduced control over delivery schedules  manufacturing yields and costs 
additionally  we utilize third party wafer fabricators as sole source suppliers  primarily taiwan semiconductor manufacturing company 
these suppliers manufacture components in accordance with our proprietary designs and specifications 
we have no written supply agreements with these sole source suppliers and purchase our custom components through individual purchase orders 
if these sole source suppliers are unable or unwilling to manufacture and deliver sufficient quantities of components to us  on the time schedule and of the quality that we require  we may be forced to seek to engage additional or replacement suppliers  which could result in additional expenses and delays in product development or shipment of product to our customers 
we may not be able to satisfy increasing demand for our products  and increased production may lead to overcapacity and lower prices 
the cyclical nature of the semiconductor industry has resulted in sustained and short term periods when demand for our products has increased or decreased rapidly 
during these periods of rapid increases in demand  our available capacity may not be sufficient to satisfy the available demand 
we  and the semiconductor industry generally  expand production facilities and access to third party foundries in response to these periods of increased demand 
these capacity expansions by us and other semiconductor manufacturers has led to overcapacity in our target markets which could lead to price erosion that would adversely impact our operating results 
our revenues may not increase enough to offset the expense of additional capacity 
we  and the semiconductor industry generally  expand production facilities and access to third party foundries in response to periods of increased demand which can cause operating expenses to increase 
should customer demand fail to increase or should the semiconductor industry enter a period of reduced customer demand  our financial position and results of operations could be adversely impacted as a result of underutilization of capacity or asset impairment charges 

table of contents we may be unable to adequately protect our proprietary rights  which may limit our ability to compete effectively 
we rely primarily upon know how  rather than on patents  to develop and maintain our competitive position 
there can be no assurance that others will not develop or patent similar technology or reverse engineer our products or that the confidentiality agreements upon which we rely will be adequate to protect our interests 
other companies have obtained patents covering a variety of semiconductor designs and processes  and we might be required to obtain licenses under some of these patents or be precluded from making and selling the infringing products  if such patents are found to be valid 
there can be no assurance that we would be able to obtain licenses  if required  upon commercially reasonable terms  or at all 
moreover  the laws of foreign countries in which we design  manufacture and market our products may afford little or no effective protection of our proprietary technology 
we are involved in frequent litigation regarding intellectual property rights  which could be costly to defend and could require us to redesign products or pay significant royalties 
there can be no assurance that any patent will issue on pending applications or that any patent issued will provide substantive protection for the technology or product covered by it 
we believe that patent and mask set protection is of less significance in our business than experience  innovation and management skill 
there also can be no assurance that others will not develop or patent similar technology  or reverse engineer our products  or that our confidentiality agreements with employees  consultants  silicon foundries and other suppliers and vendors will be adequate to protect our interests 
the semiconductor industry is characterized by frequent claims and litigation involving patent and other intellectual property rights  including claims arising under our contractual indemnification of our customers 
we have received from time to time  and may receive in the future  claims from third parties asserting that our products or processes infringe their patents or other intellectual property rights 
in the event a third party makes a valid intellectual property claim against us and a license is not available to us on commercially reasonable terms  or at all  we could be forced either to redesign or to stop production of products incorporating that intellectual property  and our operating results could be materially and adversely affected 
litigation may be necessary to enforce our patents or other of our intellectual property rights or to defend us against claims of infringement  and this litigation could be costly and divert the attention of our key personnel 
see note in the notes to our consolidated financial statements contained in item of this annual report on form k for information concerning pending litigation that involves us 
an adverse outcome in this or other litigation could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position or on our consolidated results of operations or cash flows in the period in which the litigation is resolved 
if we do not retain our key personnel  our ability to execute our business strategy will be limited 
our success depends to a significant extent upon the continued service of our executive officers and key management and technical personnel  particularly our experienced engineers  and on our ability to continue to attract  retain  and motivate qualified personnel 
the competition for these employees is intense 
the loss of the services of one or more of our key personnel could have a material adverse effect on our operating results 
in addition  there could be a material adverse effect on us should the turnover rates for engineers and other key personnel increase significantly or if we are unable to continue to attract qualified personnel 
we do not maintain any key person life insurance policy on any of our officers or employees 
we rely on manufacturing capacity located in geologically unstable areas  which could affect the availability of supplies and services 
we  and many companies in the semiconductor industry  rely on internal manufacturing capacity located in california as well as wafer fabrication foundries in taiwan and other sub contractors in geologically unstable locations around the world 
this reliance involves risks associated with the impact of earthquakes on us and the semiconductor industry  including temporary loss of capacity  availability and cost of key raw materials and equipment and availability of key services including transport 
in addition  california has 
table of contents experienced intermittent interruption in the availability of electricity 
to date  the impact on us has been negligible 
however  electricity is a critical resource for us  without which our products could not be manufactured at factories exposed to continued lengthy power interruptions 
any prolonged inability to utilize one of our manufacturing facilities as a result of fire  natural disaster  unavailability of electric power or otherwise  would have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 
we are exposed to economic  political and other risks through our significant worldwide operations 
during fiscal year  approximately of our revenues were derived from customers in international markets 
although we engage in hedging transactions to reduce our exposure to currency exchange rate fluctuations  there can be no assurance that our competitive position will not be adversely affected by changes in the exchange rate of the united states dollar against other currencies 
we have manufacturing facilities outside the united states in ireland and the philippines 
in addition to being exposed to the ongoing economic cycles in the semiconductor industry  we are also subject to the economic and political risks inherent in international operations and their impact on the united states economy in general  including the risks associated with ongoing uncertainties and political and economic instability in many countries around the world as well as the economic disruption from acts of terrorism  and the response to them by the united states and its allies 
these risks include air transportation disruptions  expropriation  currency controls  currency exchange rate movement  and additional costs related to tax  tariff and freight rates 
our future operating results are dependent on the performance of independent distributors and sales representatives 
a significant portion of our sales are through independent distributors that are not under our control 
these independent distributors generally represent product lines offered by several companies and thus could reduce their sales efforts applied to our products or terminate their representation of us 
we generally do not require letters of credit from our distributors and are not protected against accounts receivable default or bankruptcy by these distributors 
our inability to collect open accounts receivable could adversely affect our results of operations 
termination of a significant distributor  whether at our initiative or the distributor s initiative  could disrupt our current business 
if we are unable to find suitable replacements in the event of terminations by significant distributors or sales representatives  our operating results could be adversely affected 
our manufacturing processes are highly complex and may be interrupted 
we have manufacturing processes that utilize a substantial amount of technology as the fabrication of integrated circuits is a highly complex and precise process 
minute impurities  contaminants in the manufacturing environment  difficulties in the fabrication process  defects in the masks used in the wafer manufacturing process  manufacturing equipment failures  wafer breakage or other factors can cause a substantial percentage of wafers to be rejected or numerous dice on each wafer to be nonfunctional 
while we have significant expertise in semiconductor manufacturing  it is possible that some processes could become unstable 
this instability could result in manufacturing delays and product shortages  which could have a material adverse effect on our financial position or results of operations 
our transition of products to more modern facilities and related inventory builds may not progress as planned 
we are transitioning products from our older four inch wafer fabrication facilities to our six inch and eight inch wafer fabrication facilities 
we have built inventory in preparation for this transfer for both lifetime supply and transition inventory 
we have recorded certain levels of reserves related to these inventory builds 
although we believe that we have used our best efforts and information to estimate future demand  due to the uncertain economic times and the difficulty inherent in predicting future results  it is possible that actual demand for our products will differ from our estimates 
if actual demand for products included in our inventory builds is less than our estimates  our financial position and results of operations could be adversely impacted 

table of contents item a 
qualitative and quantitative disclosures about market risk interest rate exposure our annual interest income would change by approximately million in fiscal and fiscal for each basis point increase or decrease in interest rates 
the fair values of our investment portfolio at november  and november  would not be significantly impacted by either an increase or decrease in interest rates primarily due to the short term nature of the major portion of our investment portfolio 
foreign currency exposure as more fully described in note i in the notes to our consolidated financial statements contained in item of this annual report on form k  we regularly hedge our non us dollar based exposures by entering into forward exchange contracts 
the terms of these contracts are for periods matching the duration of the underlying exposure and generally range from one month to six months 
the short term nature of these contracts has resulted in these instruments having insignificant fair values at november  and november  currently  our largest foreign currency exposure is against the euro  primarily because europe has a higher proportion of our local currency denominated expenses 
relative to foreign currency exposures existing at november  and november   a unfavorable movement in foreign currency exchange rates would not expose us to significant losses in earnings or cash flows or significantly diminish the fair value of our foreign currency financial instruments  primarily due to the short lives of the affected financial instruments that effectively hedge substantially all of our year end exposures against fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates 
the calculation assumes that each exchange rate would change in the same direction relative to the us dollar 
in addition to the direct effects of changes in exchange rates  such changes typically affect the volume of sales or the foreign currency sales price as competitors products become more or less attractive 
our sensitivity analysis of the effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates does not factor in a potential change in sales levels or local currency selling prices
