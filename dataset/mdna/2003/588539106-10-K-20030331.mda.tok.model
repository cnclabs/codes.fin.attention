mutual exited most of the same classes of commercial insurance at the same time and in the same jurisdictions as the company 
the company believes that a portion of the decrease in voluntary commercial lines direct premiums written was due in part to some commercial business  other than in exited classes and related policies  moving to other insurance carriers 
as a result of the withdrawal from certain classes of commercial insurance  the company expects its commercial business to continue to decline during the first half of involuntary direct premiums written  primarily involuntary private passenger automobile insurance  which comprised and of total direct premiums written in and  respectively  were  for compared to  in  an increase of  or 
this increase resulted primarily from increased assignments from the nyaip  which provides coverage for individuals who are unable to obtain auto insurance in the voluntary market 
assignments from the nyaip vary depending upon a company s private passenger automobile market share and the size of the nyaip 
the company believes it is likely that  due to a decrease in the willingness of several major competitors to insure non standard business voluntarily  the number of policies written by the nyaip may continue to increase and therefore the amount of the company s involuntary direct written premiums may also continue to increase 
however  the company is unable to predict the volume of future assignments from the nyaip 
in order to minimize the adverse impact of assignments from the nyaip in  the company has purchased territorial credits from another insurance company pursuant to section a of the new york automobile insurance plan manual 
the credits against nyaip assignments are generated by the other insurance company for writing ppa business in certain localities in new york with ppa market availability problems 
the other insurance company  by nature of its concentration in ppa business in credit territories  generated more credits than it required to offset its nyaip assignments 
the credits purchased will reduce the company s share of the nyaip from february through january the company believes that the costs of the credits purchased will be substantially less than the amount the company would have lost had it written the additional nyaip business

net premiums earned for were  a decrease of  or  from  in the decrease in net premiums earned resulted from the decrease in net premiums written 
the decrease in net premiums earned was smaller than the decrease in net premiums written since the company s insurance policies generally earn over a twelve month policy term 
as a result of the decrease in net premiums written that occurred in  it is likely that net premiums earned will continue to decrease throughout net investment income was  in  a decrease of from  in the average pre tax yield associated with the investment portfolio decreased basis points to for  due to lower available reinvestment rates

the company did not realize any other realized investment losses during other revenues  which are comprised primarily of service fee income reduced by premium receivable charge offs  were  for  a decrease of  or  from  for net losses and lae were  for  a decrease of  or from  for the loss and lae ratio decreased to for from for incurred losses for included  of losses and lae related to the september  terrorist attack in the world trade center wtc event in new york city  which added percentage points to that year s loss and lae ratio

the company recorded decreases to its estimate of losses and lae related to prior accident years of  and  in and  respectively 
these decreases in losses and lae relating to prior accident years reduced the loss and lae ratio in and by and percentage points  respectively 
the decrease recorded in was primarily the result of favorable loss development related to known claims on workers compensation policies

during  both paid and incurred losses and lae emerged at amounts that were less than anticipated when reserves for loss and lae were estimated and recorded at december   particularly for the commercial auto liability and the workers compensation lines of business 
greater than anticipated loss and lae emergence in the company s ppa liability line of business  particularly for accidents occurring in  somewhat offset the favorable emergence noted on other lines of business 
the company made no changes to the key assumptions used in evaluating the adequacy of its reserves for losses and lae during a reasonable possibility exists in any year that relatively minor fluctuations in the estimate of reserves for losses and lae may have a significant impact on the company s net income 
this is due primarily to the size of the company s reserves for losses and lae  at december  relative to its net income 
involuntary automobile insurance business increased the company s calendar year loss and lae ratio by approximately and percentage points for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the combined ratio on involuntary automobile business was greater than the combined ratio on voluntary automobile business

the company recorded all direct underwriting expenses incurred  including commissions with respect to the acquisition of these policies  which were offset by reinsurance commission income 
the company continued to experience higher loss frequency for certain of its commercial lines of business not adequately covered by premiums collected from those lines of business 
in response to these higher losses  the company has filed for and received approval of rate increases in certain lines of business  revised its underwriting guidelines  and removed discretionary pricing credits where warranted 
as a consequence of these actions  voluntary commercial lines direct premiums written for  excluding auto program premiums written  decreased  or  to  from  for direct premiums written for all of the company s commercial lines of business  except commercial package policies  decreased in compared to commercial lines policies in force at december  decreased compared to commercial lines policies in force at december  commercial lines new business units decreased in  compared to involuntary direct premiums written  primarily involuntary private passenger automobile insurance  which comprised and of total direct premiums written during and  respectively  were  for compared to  in  an increase of  or

net premiums written decreased  or less than to  for from  for net premiums earned for were  a decrease of  or less than  from  in this decrease in net premiums earned resulted primarily from a decrease in assumed premiums earned and is consistent with the decrease in net written premiums 
net investment income was  in  a decrease of from  in  primarily due to a decrease in average portfolio yield

net realized investment losses were  for compared to net realized investment gains of  for net realized investment losses for included  of unrealized losses related to the company s fixed maturity investment in a commercial finance company 
the company believes that the decline in fair value of this investment is other than temporary and has therefore recorded a realized loss 
other revenues were  for  an increase of  or  from  for this increase resulted from an increase in premium installment fee income and a decrease in charge offs related to uncollectible premiums receivable 
the reduction in charge offs resulted from a decline in the average age of the company s premium receivable 
net losses and lae were  for  an increase of  or from  for the loss and lae ratio increased to for from for losses and lae include  related to the september  terrorist attack on the world trade center wtc in new york city 
the wtc event added percentage points to the company s loss and lae ratio for excluding the effect of the wtc event  the increase in the loss and lae ratio resulted primarily from the increase in involuntary automobile insurance business which increased the company s net loss and lae ratio by percentage points in  compared to percentage points in the ratio of amortized deferred policy acquisition costs and other underwriting expenses to net premiums earned increased to in from in  primarily due to higher agency incentive commissions and lower commissions earned on ceded reinsurance 
expenses that vary directly with the company s premium volume  primarily commissions  premium taxes and state assessments  represented and of net premiums earned in and  respectively 
certain other underwriting expenses  such as salaries  employee benefits and other operating expenses vary indirectly with volume and comprise the remainder of the company s underwriting expenses 
the company s effective income tax rate was for compared to for critical accounting policies reserve for losses and lae the company establishes reserves for losses and lae  which are estimates of future payments to be made to settle all insurance claims for reported losses and estimates of incurred but not reported losses based upon past experience modified for current trends 
with the exception of workers compensation losses  loss reserves are not discounted 
estimated amounts of salvage and subrogation on paid and unpaid losses are deducted from the liability for unpaid claims 
the estimated liabilities may be more or less than the amount ultimately paid when the claims are settled 
management and the company s independent consulting actuary regularly review the estimates of reserves needed and any changes are reflected in current operating results 
loss reserves are established for known claims based on the type and circumstance of the loss and the results of similar losses 
for claims not yet reported to the company  loss reserves are based on statistical information from previous experience periods adjusted for inflation  trends in court decisions and economic conditions 
lae reserves are intended to cover the ultimate cost of investigating all losses that have occurred and defending lawsuits  if any  arising from these losses 
lae reserves are evaluated periodically using statistical techniques which compare current costs with historical data 
inflation is implicitly reflected in the reserving process through analysis of cost trends and review of historical reserve results 
the company s reserving process is based on the assumption that past experiences  adjusted for the effect of current developments and trends  are relevant in predicting future events 
in the absence of specific developments  the process also assumes that the legal climate regarding the claims process and underlying liabilities remains constant 
other assumptions employed by the company or its actuarial firm change from time to time as circumstances change 
in estimating loss and lae reserves  the company employs a number of actuarial methods  depending on their applicability to each line of business  in order to balance the advantages and disadvantages of each method 
therefore  a range of estimates is developed for each line of business 
however  the company does not believe it is appropriate to sum the high and low values developed using different actuarial methods for each line of business to determine a range for the company s total loss and lae reserves 
therefore the company s actuary and its consulting actuary only provide the company with their respective best estimates of total loss and lae reserves by summing their best estimate for each line of business 
due to the company s small size  the presence or absence of a limited number of moderate losses  as well as the timing of the reporting of such losses to the company by claimants could result in changes in actuarial estimates that are significant to the company s net income for a quarter or a year 
as such  management recognizes that the best estimate may not be more accurate than other amounts within a few percentage points of total loss and lae reserves 
the company has recorded changes in reserves for prior accident year losses in most years 
in  the company increased its reserves for prior years by  primarily due to higher than anticipated frequency and severity of losses related to personal automobile  commercial automobile and workers compensation policies 
in and  the company decreased its reserves for prior years by  and  respectively  primarily due to favorable loss experience related to workers compensation policies 
the total reserves for losses and lae were  and  at december  and  respectively 
liquidity and capital resources in developing its investment strategy  the company determines a level of cash and short term investments which  when combined with expected cash flow  is estimated to be adequate to meet expected cash obligations 
historically  the excess of premiums collected over payments on claims  combined with cash income from investments  has provided the company with short term funds in excess of normal operating demands for cash 
in and  however  the company s operating activities used cash totaling  and  respectively 
this increase in cash used by operations was primarily the result of a  decrease in premiums collected somewhat offset by a  decrease in loss and lae payments and a  decrease in underwriting expense payments 
the company s intention to continue to reduce direct premiums written in business segments where returns are unsatisfactory will likely result in future negative cash flows from operations 
the company believes that careful management of the relationship between assets and liabilities will minimize the likelihood that investment portfolio sales will be necessary to fund insurance operations  and that the effect of any such sale on the company s stockholders equity will not be material 
the company s objectives with respect to its investment portfolio include maximizing total return within investment guidelines while protecting policyholders surplus and maintaining flexibility 
like other property and casualty insurers  the company relies on premiums as a major source of cash  and therefore liquidity 
cash flows from the company s investment portfolio  either in the form of interest or principal payments  are an additional source of liquidity 
because the duration of the company s investment portfolio relative to the duration of its liabilities is closely managed  increases or decreases in market interest rates are not expected to have a material effect on the company s liquidity  or its results of operations 
at december   the company owned investment securities of which had unrealized losses 
as of december  all of the company s fixed maturity investments were exchange traded and had an active secondary market 
the company did not record any other than temporary investment impairments during the total potential impact on the company s future earnings and on its financial position if the unrealized losses associated with its investment portfolio at december  were to become other than temporary would be  or  after taxes 
at december    or of the company s investment portfolio was invested in non investment grade securities  including three fixed maturity securities included in the totals above with an aggregate market value of  and aggregate unrealized losses of  at december    or of the company s investment portfolio was invested in non investment grade securities 
the company generally designates newly acquired fixed maturity investments as available for sale and carries these investments at fair value 
unrealized gains and losses related to these investments are recorded as accumulated other comprehensive income within stockholders equity 
at december   the company recorded as accumulated other comprehensive income in its consolidated balance sheet  of net unrealized gains  net of taxes  associated with its investments classified as available for sale 
at december   the company s portfolio of fixed maturity investments represented of invested assets 
management believes that this level of bond holdings is consistent with the company s liquidity needs because it anticipates that cash receipts from net premiums written  investment income and maturing securities will enable the company to satisfy its cash obligations 
furthermore  a portion of the company s bond portfolio is invested in mortgage backed and other asset backed securities which  in addition to interest income  provide monthly paydowns of bond principal 
at december    or  of the company s fixed maturity portfolio was invested in mortgage backed and other asset backed securities 
the company invests in a variety of collateralized mortgage obligation cmo products but has not invested in the derivative type of cmo products such as interest only  principal only or inverse floating rate securities 
all of the company s cmo investments have a secondary market and their effect on the company s liquidity does not differ from that of other fixed maturity investments 
during the company repurchased  shares of its common stock at an average price of and was holding  shares in treasury as of december  the company maintains a  unsecured credit facility from a bank in the form of a master grid note 
any borrowings under this facility are payable on demand and carry an interest rate which can be fixed or variable and is negotiated at the time of each advance 
this facility is available for general working capital purposes and for repurchases of the company s common stock 
no amounts were outstanding related to this loan at december  as a holding company  the company is dependent upon cash dividends from mnh to meet its obligations and to pay any cash dividends 
mnh is subject to new hampshire insurance laws which place certain restrictions on its ability to pay dividends without the prior approval of state regulatory authorities 
these restrictions limit dividends to those that  when added to all other dividends paid within the preceding twelve months  would not exceed of the insurer s policyholders surplus as of the preceding december st 
the maximum amount of dividends that mnh could pay during any twelve month period ending in without the prior approval of the new hampshire insurance commissioner is  mnh paid  of dividends to the company in dividends were paid in february  may and november  of   and  respectively 
the company paid a quarterly cash dividend to its common stockholders of

federal legislation the terrorism risk insurance act of tria  signed into law on november   provides a federal backstop for losses related to the writing of the terrorism peril in property and casualty insurance policies 
under the tria  the company had until february   to notify commercial policyholders about requirements of the law  let them know that the company was required to offer terrorism coverage and let them know how the coverage would be priced 
the company has distributed disclosure notices to its commercial policyholders 
the notices explained the tria and notified them of their coverage 
except for a few select cases  full policy limit coverage has been provided for terrorism for policyholders 
the terrorism rating plan  with rates that vary based on geographical and risk type factors  will go into effect in the near future 
the plan will charge all commercial policies a nominal terrorism premium to encourage them to accept coverage while minimizing the company s administrative costs 
environmental claims mnh  like many other property and casualty insurance companies  is subject to environmental damage claims asserted by or against its insureds 
management of the company is of the opinion that based on various court decisions throughout the country  certain of these claims should not be recoverable under the terms of mnh s insurance policies because of either specific or general coverage exclusions contained in the policies 
however  there is no assurance that the courts will agree with mnh s position in every case  nor can there be assurance that material claims will not be asserted under policies which a court will find do not explicitly or implicitly exclude claims for environmental damages 
management  however  is not aware of any pending claim or group of claims which would result in a liability that would have a material adverse effect on the financial condition of the company or mnh 
inflation inflation affects the company  like other companies in the property and casualty insurance industry  by contributing to higher losses  lae and operating costs  as well as greater investment income resulting from the higher interest rates which can prevail in an inflationary period 
premium rates  however  may not keep pace with inflation since competitive forces may limit the company s ability to increase premium rates 
the company considers inflationary trends in estimating its reserves for claims reported and for incurred but not reported claims 
relationship with mutual the company s and mnh s business and day to day operations are closely aligned with those of mutual 
this is the result of a combination of factors 
mutual has had a historical ownership interest in the company and mnh 
prior to november mnh was a wholly owned subsidiary of mutual 
following the company s initial public offering in november and until a secondary stock offering in july the company was a majority owned subsidiary of mutual 
at december  mutual owned of the company s common stock 
under the management agreement  mutual provides the company and mnh with all facilities and with personnel to operate their business 
with the exception of the chief operating officer of mnh  the only officers of the company or mnh who are paid full time employees are employees of mutual whose services are purchased under the management agreement 
also  the operation of mnh s insurance business  which offers substantially the same lines of insurance as mutual through the same independent insurance agents  creates a very close relationship among the companies 
during  mutual initiated discussions with the company concerning proposals for the acquisition of the company by mutual 
the company determined that the terms proposed by mutual were inadequate 
the company also determined that the management agreement  as currently written  creates a conflict of interest between the company and mutual in their joint operation and prevents the company s shareholders from realizing the company s fair value in a sale or merger 
accordingly  on july  the company gave notice to mutual of its intention to terminate the management agreement effective july  the boards of directors of the company  mnh and mutual have agreed in principle for mutual to continue to provide administrative and management services to mgi and to manage the traditional property and casualty insurance business of mnh under a new services agreement 
the new arrangement between mutual and mnh is intended to be effective as of january   thereby superceding the management agreement as of that date  and also provides for the pooling of the insurance business traditionally written by each company  in order to achieve common underwriting results 
the proposed services agreement and reinsurance pooling arrangements are subject to the approvals of the new hampshire and new york insurance departments  which presently are being sought 
in order to ensure uninterrupted service to policyholders and agents pending regulatory approval of the proposed agreements  the boards of directors of the company  mnh and mutual have agreed to extend the effective date of termination of the existing management agreement until the earlier of the effective date of the proposed services agreement or january  see part  item business

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk market risk represents the potential for loss due to changes in the fair value of financial instruments 
the market risk related to the company s financial instruments primarily relates to its investment portfolio 
the value of the company s investment portfolio of  at december  is subject to changes in interest rates and to a lesser extent on credit quality 
further  certain mortgage backed and asset backed securities are exposed to accelerated prepayment risk generally caused by interest rate movements 
as interest rates decline  mortgage holders are more likely to refinance existing mortgages at lower rates 
acceleration of future repayments could adversely affect future investment income  if reinvestment of the accelerated receipts was made in lower yielding securities
