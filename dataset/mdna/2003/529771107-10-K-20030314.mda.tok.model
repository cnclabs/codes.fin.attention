item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto overview lexmark international  inc international  and together with its subsidiaries  the company or lexmark is a leading developer  manufacturer and supplier of printing solutions including laser and inkjet printers  multifunction products  associated supplies and services for offices and homes 
the company also sells dot matrix printers for printing single and multi part forms for business users and develops  manufactures and markets a broad line of other office imaging products 
in the past five years  the worldwide printer industry has seen growth in laser and inkjet printers as a result of the increasing penetration of personal computers and local area networks into home and office markets 
during this period  the company s own product mix has evolved  with its laser and inkjet printers and associated supplies representing an increasing percentage of its sales volume and revenue  particularly as the increasing base of installed lexmark printers generates additional revenue from recurring sales of supplies for those printers primarily laser and inkjet cartridges 
lexmark believes that its total revenue will continue to grow due to projected overall market growth for to in recent years  the company s growth rate in sales of printer units has generally exceeded the growth rate of its printer revenue due to sales price reductions and the introduction of new lower priced products in both the laser and inkjet printer markets 
in the laser printer market  unit price reductions are partially offset by the tendency of customers to add higher profit margin optional features including network adapters  document management software  additional memory  paper handling and multifunction capabilities 
in the inkjet printer market  advances in color inkjet technology have resulted in printers with higher resolution and improved performance while increased competition has led to lower prices 
the greater affordability of color inkjet printers  as well as the growth in the all in one category  have been important factors in the growth of this market 
as the installed base of lexmark laser and inkjet printers continues to grow  management expects the market for supplies will grow as well  as such supplies are routinely required for use throughout the life of the printers 
while profit margins on printer hardware have been negatively affected by competitive pricing pressure  the supplies are a higher margin  recurring business  which the company expects to contribute to the stability of its earnings over time 
the company s dot matrix printers and other office imaging products include many mature products such as supplies for ibm printers  typewriter supplies and other impact technology supplies that require little ongoing investment 
the company expects that the market for these products will continue to decline rapidly  and has implemented a strategy to continue to offer high quality products while managing cost to maximize cash flow and profit 
critical accounting policies and estimates lexmark s discussion and analysis of its financial condition and results of operations are based upon the company s consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of consolidated financial statements requires the company to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenue and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an ongoing basis  the company evaluates its estimates  including those related to customer programs and incentives  product returns  doubtful accounts  inventories  intangible assets  income taxes  warranty obligations  restructurings  pension and other postretirement benefits  and contingencies and litigation 
the company bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
the company believes the following critical accounting policies affect its more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition the company records estimated reductions to revenue at the time of sale for customer programs and incentive offerings including special pricing agreements  promotions and other volume based incentives 
estimated reductions in revenue are based upon historical trends and other known factors at the time of sale 
in addition  the company provides price protection to reseller customers 
the company records reductions to revenue for the estimated impact of price protection when price reductions are announced to resellers 
if market conditions were to decline  the company may take actions to increase customer incentive offerings  possibly resulting in an incremental reduction of revenue at the time the incentive is offered 
allowances for doubtful accounts the company maintains allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of its customers to make required payments 
the company determines the estimate of the allowance for doubtful accounts based on a variety of factors including the length of time receivables are past due  the financial health of customers  unusual macroeconomic conditions  and historical experience 
if the financial condition of the company s customers were to deteriorate or other circumstances occur that result in an impairment of customers ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
warranty reserves the company provides for the estimated cost of product warranties at the time revenue is recognized 
the reserve for product warranties is based on the quantity of units sold under warranty  estimated product failure rates  and material usage and service delivery costs 
the estimates for product failure rates and material usage and service delivery costs are periodically adjusted based on actual results 
to minimize warranty costs  the company engages in extensive product quality programs and processes  including actively monitoring and evaluating the quality of its component suppliers 
should actual product failure rates  material usage or service delivery costs differ from the company s estimates  revisions to the estimated warranty liability may be required 
inventory reserves the company writes down its inventory for estimated obsolescence or unmarketable inventory equal to the difference between the cost of inventory and the estimated market value 
the company estimates the difference between the cost of obsolete or unmarketable inventory and its market value based upon product demand requirements  product life cycle  product pricing  and quality issues 
also  the company records an adverse purchase commitment liability when anticipated market sales prices are lower than committed costs 
if actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management  additional inventory write downs and adverse purchase commitment liabilities may be required 
long lived assets management considers the potential impairment of both tangible and intangible assets when circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
an asset impairment review estimates the fair value of an asset based upon the future cash flows that the asset is expected to generate 
such an impairment review incorporates estimates of forecasted revenue and costs that may be associated with an asset  expected periods that an asset may be utilized  and appropriate discount rates 
pension and postretirement benefits the company accounts for its defined benefit pension plans and its non pension postretirement benefit plans using actuarial models required by statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 employers accounting for pensions  and sfas no 
 employers accounting for postretirement benefits other than pensions  respectively 
these models use an attribution approach that generally spreads the expected liability for projected benefits over the service lives of the employees in the plan and require that explicit assumptions be used to estimate future events 
examples of assumptions the company must make include selecting the following expected long term rate of return on plan assets  a discount rate that reflects the rate at which pension benefits could be settled  and the anticipated rates of future compensation increases 
the assumed long term rate of return on plan assets and the market related value of plan assets are used to calculate the expected return on plan assets 
the required use of an expected versus actual long term rate of return on plan assets may result in recognized pension income that is greater or less than the actual returns of those plan assets in any given year 
over time  however  the expected long term returns are designed to approximate the actual long term returns and therefore result in a pattern of income and expense recognition that more closely matches the pattern of the services provided by the employees 
for the market related value of plan assets  the company uses a calculated value that recognizes changes in asset fair values in a systematic and rational manner 
a five year moving average value is used for equities and high yield bonds due to the volatility of these types of investments and fair value is used for low yield bonds 
differences between actual and expected returns are recognized in the market related value of plan assets over five years 
the company uses long term historical actual return information  the mix of investments that comprise plan assets and future estimates of long term investment returns by reference to external sources to develop its expected return on plan assets 
the discount rate assumptions used for pension and non pension postretirement benefit plan accounting reflect the rates available on high quality fixed income debt instruments at december each year 
the rate of future compensation increases is determined by the company based upon its long term plans for such increases 
changes in actual asset return experience and discount rate assumptions can impact the company s stockholders equity 
actual asset return experience results in an increase or decrease in the asset base and this effect  in conjunction with a decrease in the pension discount rate  may result in a plan s assets being less than a plan s accumulated benefit obligation abo 
the abo is the present value of benefits earned to date and is based on past compensation levels 
the company is required to show in its statements of financial position a net liability that is at least equal to the abo less the market value of plan assets 
this liability is referred to as an additional minimum liability aml 
an aml  which is recorded and updated on december each year  is reflected as a long term pension liability with the offset in other comprehensive earnings loss in the equity section of the statements of financial position on a net of tax basis and or as an intangible asset to the degree a company has unrecognized prior service costs 
income taxes the company estimates its tax liability based on current tax laws in the statutory jurisdictions in which it operates 
these estimates include judgments about deferred tax assets and liabilities resulting from temporary differences between assets and liabilities recognized for financial reporting purposes and such amounts recognized for tax purposes  as well as about the realization of deferred tax assets 
if the provisions for current or deferred taxes are not adequate  if the company is unable to realize certain deferred tax assets or if the tax laws change unfavorably  the company could experience potential significant losses in excess of the reserves established 
likewise  if the provisions for current and deferred taxes are in excess of those eventually needed  if the company is able to realize additional deferred tax assets or if tax laws change favorably  the company could experience potential significant gains 
restructuring and other charges as of december   the company had substantially completed all restructuring activities and  therefore  reversed approximately million million  net of tax during the fourth quarter of the reversal was primarily due to lower severance costs approximately million and lower other exit costs approximately million associated with the and restructuring plans 
the severance payments were lower than originally estimated due to higher than expected attrition which resulted in the company being able to achieve headcount reductions at a lower cost 
although the restructuring activities were substantially complete at year end and the employees have exited the business  approximately million of severance payments are projected to continue into the first half of  and are accounted for accordingly in the remaining reserve

headcount the and restructurings were intended to result in approximately  employee separations from the company 
employee additions to support other initiatives have partially offset these employee separations resulting in the number of company employees worldwide going from approximately  at december  to approximately  at december  basis of presentation in  the emerging issues task force eitf reached a consensus that consideration from a vendor to a purchaser of the vendor s products should be characterized as a reduction in revenue as stated in eitf  accounting for consideration from a vendor to a retailer in connection with the purchase or promotion of the vendor s products  and clarified in eitf this eitf consensus was effective for annual or interim financial statements beginning after december   with reclassification required for comparative prior periods 
the company adopted this eitf as required in and the adoption of this statement had no impact on the company s net earnings  financial position or cash flows  but did result in a reclassification of certain prior year reported amounts to conform to the current year s presentation

using this process  the company reduced its discount rate assumption in the us from as of december  to as of december  this change  combined with other consistent changes in actuarial assumptions such as the assumed rate of compensation increase  is not expected to have a material effect on net pension plan expense 
the change in the discount rate from as of december  to as of december   did not have a significant impact on the company s results of operations for the year ended december  future effects of retirement related benefits  including the changes noted above  on the operating results of the company depend on economic conditions  employee demographics  mortality rates and investment performance 
liquidity and capital resources lexmark s primary source of liquidity has been cash generated by operations  which totaled million  million and million in  and  respectively 
cash from operations generally has been sufficient to allow the company to fund its working capital needs and finance its capital expenditures during these periods along with the repurchase of approximately million and million of its class a common stock during and  respectively 
the company did not repurchase shares of its class a common stock during management believes that cash provided by operations will continue to be sufficient to meet operating and capital needs 
however  in the event that cash from operations is not sufficient  the company has other potential sources of cash through utilization of its revolving credit facility  accounts receivable financing program or other financing sources  such as the public or private debt markets  which are discussed in greater detail on the following pages 
cash flows from operating activities in were million  compared to million in the increase in was primarily due to favorable cash flow changes in working capital accounts  particularly trade receivables  accrued liabilities and inventories 
the favorable cash flow changes in working capital accounts were principally due to the company s continued focus on cash cycle management 
as part of this focus  the company s days of sales outstanding has declined to days at december   from days at december  the days of sales outstanding is calculated on a day moving average based on gross accounts receivable and is adjusted for certain accounts receivable items which have no corresponding revenue  such as value added taxes 
in  cash provided by operating activities decreased from due to unfavorable changes in working capital accounts  principally related to current liabilities 
cash used for investing activities in was million less than in  principally due to lower capital spending for manufacturing expansion projects 
cash used for financing activities during was million compared to million of cash provided by financing activities during in  the company purchased million of treasury stock compared to no purchases during the company experienced some significant changes in other balance sheet accounts in the increase in prepaid expenses and other current assets was primarily due to prepaid income taxes resulting from estimated tax payments 
other assets increased million during  due to a million funding of the us pension plan and a million increase in a deferred tax asset related to the additional minimum pension liability associated with the us pension plan 
accrued liabilities increased million from to  principally due to increases in income taxes payable million  compensation million and derivative liabilities million 
other long term liabilities increased million from to  primarily due to the additional minimum pension liability 
the company has short term non cancelable purchase commitments with suppliers which arise in the normal course of business and provide the company with continuity of supply and lower product cost 
if the company fails to anticipate customer demand properly  a temporary oversupply of inventory could result in excess or obsolete components which could adversely affect gross margins 
effective may   the company entered into a new million unsecured  revolving credit facility with a group of banks  including a million day portion and a million year portion 
upon entering into the new credit agreement  the company terminated the prior million unsecured  revolving credit facility that was due to expire on january  there were no amounts outstanding under the prior facility upon its termination 
under the new credit facility  the company may borrow in dollars  euros and other optional currencies 
the interest rate ranges from to above the london interbank offered rate libor for borrowings denominated in us dollars  the eurocurrency interbank offered rate euribor for borrowings denominated in euros  or other relevant international interest rate for borrowings denominated in another currency 
the interest rate spread is based upon the company s debt ratings 
in addition  the company is required to pay a facility fee on the million line of credit of to based upon the company s debt ratings 
the interest and facility fees are payable quarterly

a balance of million net of unamortized discount of million was outstanding at december  the company is in compliance with all covenants and other requirements set forth in its debt agreements 
the company does not have any rating downgrade triggers that would accelerate the maturity dates of its revolving credit facility and public debt 
however  a downgrade in the company s credit rating could adversely affect the company s ability to renew existing  or obtain access to new  credit facilities in the future and could increase the cost of such facilities 
in february  the company filed a shelf registration statement with the securities and exchange commission to register million of debt securities 
although the company does not expect to utilize the shelf registration in the near term  if conditions warrant  the net proceeds from a sale of the securities could be used for capital expenditures  reduction of short term borrowings  working capital  acquisitions and other general corporate purposes 
the following table summarizes the company s contractual obligations at december less than after in millions total year years years years long term debt short term borrowings operating leases non cancelable purchase commitments total contractual obligations in october  the company entered into a new agreement to sell its us trade receivables on a limited recourse basis 
the new agreement increased the maximum amount of financing available to million 
as collections reduce previously sold receivables  the company may replenish these with new receivables 
the company bears a risk of bad debt losses on us trade receivables sold  since the company over collateralizes the receivables sold with additional eligible receivables 
the company addresses this risk of loss in its allowance for doubtful accounts 
receivables sold may not include amounts over days past due or concentrations over certain limits with any one customer 
this facility contains customary affirmative and negative covenants as well as specific provisions related to the quality of the accounts receivables sold 
the facility also contains customary cash control triggering events which  if triggered  could adversely affect the company s liquidity and or its ability to sell trade receivables 
a downgrade in the company s credit rating could reduce the company s ability to sell trade receivables 
the facility expires in october  but requires annual renewal of commitments in october and the company renewed the annual commitment in and also expects to renew in at december   the facility had no us trade receivables sold and outstanding 
at december   us trade receivables of million had been sold  and due to the revolving nature of the agreement  million also remained outstanding 
at december  and  the company did not have any relationship with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships  which other companies have established for the purpose of facilitating off balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes 
therefore  the company is not materially exposed to any financing  liquidity  market or credit risk that could arise if the company had engaged in such relationships 
at the company s annual meeting of stockholders on april   the stockholders approved an increase in the number of authorized shares of its class a common stock from million to million shares 
in july  the company received authorization from the board of directors to repurchase an additional million of its class a common stock for a total repurchase authority of billion 
at december   there was approximately million of share repurchase authority remaining 
this repurchase authority allows the company  at management s discretion  to selectively repurchase its stock from time to time in the open market or in privately negotiated transactions depending upon market price and other factors 
during  the company repurchased approximately million shares in the open market at prices ranging from per share to per share for a cost of approximately million 
as of december   the company had repurchased approximately million shares at prices ranging from per share to per share for an aggregate cost of approximately billion 
capital expenditures capital expenditures totaled million  million and million in  and  respectively 
the capital expenditures during were primarily attributable to infrastructure support and new product development 
in and  the capital expenditures were principally for capacity expansion  the support of new products and research and development facilities 
during  the company expects capital expenditures to be approximately million  primarily attributable to infrastructure support and new product development 
the capital expenditures are expected to be funded primarily through cash from operations 
effect of currency exchange rates and exchange rate risk management revenue derived from international sales  including exports from the united states  make up about half of the company s consolidated revenue  with europe revenue accounting for approximately two thirds of international sales 
substantially all foreign subsidiaries maintain their accounting records in their local currencies 
consequently  period to period comparability of results of operations is affected by fluctuations in currency exchange rates 
certain of the company s latin american entities use the us dollar as their functional currency 
lexmark s operations in argentina were adversely impacted by currency devaluation in late and the first six months of this resulted in translation losses of approximately million in and approximately million in during the last six months of  the company did not experience significant translation losses related to the argentina operations 
currency translation has significantly affected international revenue and cost of revenue  and  although it did not have a material impact on operating income for the years and  the operating income was materially adversely impacted by exchange rate fluctuations 
the company acts to reduce its exposure to exchange rate fluctuations through the use of operational hedges  such as pricing actions and product sourcing decisions 
the company s exposure to exchange rate fluctuations generally cannot be minimized solely through the use of operational hedges 
therefore  the company utilizes financial instruments such as forward exchange contracts and currency options to reduce the impact of exchange rate fluctuations on actual and anticipated cash flow exposures and certain assets and liabilities which arise from transactions denominated in currencies other than the functional currency 
the company does not purchase currency related financial instruments for purposes other than exchange rate risk management 
tax matters the company s effective income tax rate was approximately  and for  and  respectively 
the effective income tax rate was significantly impacted by the company s resolution with the internal revenue service on certain adjustments related to the allocation of intercompany profits 
as a result of this resolution  the company reversed previously accrued taxes  reducing the tax provision in the fourth quarter of by million 
excluding the impact of this adjustment  the company s effective income tax rate was for the decrease in the effective income tax rate was primarily due to the effect of lower tax rates on manufacturing activities in certain countries 
the company and its subsidiaries are subject to tax examinations in various us and foreign jurisdictions 
the company believes that adequate amounts of tax and related interest have been provided for any adjustments that may result from these examinations 
as of december   the company had non us tax loss carryforwards of million  which have an indefinite carryforward period 
as of december   the research and development tax credit carryforward available to reduce possible future us income taxes amounted to approximately million  all of which expires in the years recent accounting pronouncements in june  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
sfas no longer permits the amortization of goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets 
instead  these assets must be reviewed at least annually for impairment 
the company adopted sfas as required on january  during the second quarter of  the company completed the initial transitional goodwill impairment test  which did not indicate any goodwill impairment 
since previously reported goodwill amortization was immaterial for the company in the prior periods presented  the discontinuation of goodwill amortization will not have a material impact on the company s financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
pro forma net earnings and earnings per share are not presented because such amounts are not materially different than amounts previously reported for the years ended december  and  respectively 
in july  the fasb issued sfas no

inflation the company is subject to the effects of changing prices and operates in an industry where product prices are very competitive and subject to downward price pressures 
as a result  future increases in production costs or raw material prices could have an adverse effect on the company s business 
however  the company actively manages its product costs and manufacturing processes in an effort to minimize the impact on earnings of any such increases 
factors that may affect future results and information concerning forward looking statements statements contained in this report which are not statements of historical fact are forward looking statements within the meaning of section a of the securities act of and section e of the securities exchange act of forward looking statements are made based upon management s current expectations and beliefs concerning future developments and their potential effects upon the company 
there can be no assurance that future developments affecting the company will be those anticipated by management  and there are a number of factors that could adversely affect the company s future operating results or cause the company s actual results to differ materially from the estimates or expectations reflected in such forward looking statements  including without limitation  the factors set forth below unfavorable global economic conditions may adversely impact the company s future operating results 
since the second quarter of  the company has experienced weak markets for its products 
continued softness in these markets and uncertainty about the timing and extent of the global economic downturn by both corporate and consumer purchasers of the company s products could result in lower demand for the company s products 
weakness in demand may result in excessive inventory for the company and or its reseller channel which may adversely affect sales  pricing  risk of obsolescence and or other elements of the company s operating results 
terrorist attacks and the potential for future terrorist attacks have created many political and economic uncertainties  some of which may affect the company s future operating results 
future terrorist attacks  the national and international responses to such attacks  and other acts of war or hostility may affect the company s facilities  employees  suppliers  customers  transportation networks and supply chains  or may affect the company in ways that are not capable of being predicted presently 
revenue derived from international sales make up about half of the company s revenue 
accordingly  the company s future results could be adversely affected by a variety of factors  including changes in a specific country s or region s political or economic conditions  foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations  trade protection measures and unexpected changes in regulatory requirements 
moreover  margins on international sales tend to be lower than those on domestic sales  and the company believes that international operations in new geographic markets will be less profitable than operations in the us and european markets  in part  because of the higher investment levels for marketing  selling and distribution required to enter these markets 
the company relies more heavily on its international production facilities and international manufacturing partners for the manufacture of its products and key components of its products 
future operating results may be adversely affected by several factors  including  without limitation  if the company s international operations or manufacturing partners are unable to supply products reliably  if there are disruptions in international trade  disruptions at important geographic points of exit and entry  if there are difficulties in transitioning such manufacturing activities among the company  its international operations and or its manufacturing partners  or if there arise production and supply constraints which result in additional costs to the company 
the financial failure or loss of a key supplier could result in a material adverse impact on the company s financial results 
the company depends on its information technology systems for the development  manufacture  distribution  marketing  sales and support of its products and services 
any failure in such systems  or the systems of a partner or supplier  may adversely affect the company s operating results 
furthermore  because vast quantities of the company s products flow through only a few distribution centers to provide product to various geographic regions  the failure of information technology systems affecting those product distribution centers could have a material adverse impact on the company s ability to deliver product and on the company s financial results the company s future operating results may be adversely affected if it is unable to continue to develop  manufacture and market products that are reliable  competitive  and meet customers needs 
the markets for laser and inkjet products and associated supplies are increasingly competitive  especially with respect to pricing and the introduction of new technologies and products offering improved features and functionality 
the company s inability to effectively deal with these competitive issues could have a material adverse effect on the company s financial results 
the company and its major competitors  many of which have significantly greater financial  marketing and or technological resources than the company  have regularly lowered prices on their products and are expected to continue to do so 
in particular  both the inkjet and laser printer markets have experienced and are expected to continue to experience significant price pressure 
price reductions on inkjet or laser products or the inability to reduce costs  including warranty costs  contain expenses or increase sales as currently expected  as well as price protection measures  could result in lower profitability and jeopardize the company s ability to grow or maintain its market share 
the company believes that one of its competitive advantages is its exclusive focus on printing solutions 
the entrance of a competitor that is also exclusively focused on printing solutions could offset this advantage and could have a material adverse impact on the company s strategy and financial results 
the company s performance depends in part upon its ability to successfully forecast the timing and extent of customer demand and manage worldwide distribution and inventory levels to support the demand of its customers 
the company must also be able to address production and supply constraints  particularly delays in the supply of key components necessary for production  which may result in lost revenue or in the company incurring additional costs to meet customer demand 
the company s future operating results and its ability to effectively grow or maintain its market share may be adversely affected if it is unable to address these issues on a timely basis 
the introduction of products by the company or its competitors  or delays in customer purchases of existing products in anticipation of new product introductions by the company or its competitors and market acceptance of new products and pricing programs  the reaction of competitors to any such new products or programs  the life cycles of the company s products  as well as delays in product development and manufacturing  and variations in the cost of component parts  may impact sales  may cause a buildup in the company s inventories  make the transition from current products to new products difficult and could adversely affect the company s future operating results 
the competitive pressure to develop technology and products also could cause significant changes in the level of the company s operating expenses 
although the company is currently the exclusive supplier of new cartridges for its laser and inkjet products  there can be no assurance that other companies will not develop new compatible cartridges for the company s products 
in addition  refill and remanufactured alternatives for some of the company s cartridges are available and compete with the company s supplies business 
the company expects competitive refill and remanufacturing activity to increase 
various legal challenges and governmental activities may intensify competition for the company s aftermarket supplies business 
the company s success depends in part on its ability to obtain patents  copyrights and trademarks  maintain trade secret protection and operate without infringing the proprietary rights of others 
current or future claims of intellectual property infringement could prevent the company from obtaining technology of others and could otherwise adversely affect its operating results or business  as could expenses incurred by the company in obtaining intellectual property rights  enforcing its intellectual property rights against others or defending against claims that the company s products infringe the intellectual property rights of others 
the company markets and sells its products through several sales channels 
the company has also advanced a strategy of forming alliances and oem arrangements with many companies 
the company s future operating results may be adversely affected by any conflicts that might arise between or among its various sales channels  the loss of any alliance or oem arrangement or the loss of retail shelf space 
aggressive pricing on laser and inkjet products and or associated supplies from customers and resellers  including  without limitation  oem customers  could result in a material adverse impact on the company s strategy and financial results 
in addition  the financial failure or loss of a key customer or reseller could have a material adverse impact on the company s financial results 
the company s inability to perform satisfactorily under service contracts for managed print services and other customer services may result in the loss of customers  loss of reputation and or financial consequences that may have a material adverse impact on the company s financial results and strategy 
factors unrelated to the company s operating performance  including the financial failure or loss of significant customers  resellers  manufacturing partners or suppliers  the outcome of pending and future litigation or governmental proceedings  and the ability to retain and attract key personnel  could also adversely affect the company s operating results 
in addition  the company s stock price  like that of other technology companies  can be volatile 
trading activity in the company s common stock  particularly the trading of large blocks and intraday trading in the company s common stock  may affect the company s common stock price 
while the company reassesses material trends and uncertainties affecting the company s financial condition and results of operations in connection with the preparation of its quarterly and annual reports  the company does not intend to review or revise  in light of future events  any particular forward looking statement contained in this report 
the information referred to above should be considered by investors when reviewing any forward looking statements contained in this report  in any of the company s public filings or press releases or in any oral statements made by the company or any of its officers or other persons acting on its behalf 
the important factors that could affect forward looking statements are subject to change  and the company does not intend to update the foregoing list of certain important factors 
by means of this cautionary note  the company intends to avail itself of the safe harbor from liability with respect to forward looking statements that is provided by section a and section e referred to above 
item a 
qualitative and quantitative disclosures about market risk market risk sensitivity the market risk inherent in the company s financial instruments and positions represents the potential loss arising from adverse changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates 
interest rates at december   the fair value of the company s senior notes is estimated at million using quoted market prices and yields obtained through independent pricing sources for the same or similar types of borrowing arrangements  taking into consideration the underlying terms of the debt 
the fair value of the senior notes exceeded the carrying value as recorded in the statements of financial position at december  by approximately million 
market risk is estimated as the potential change in fair value resulting from a hypothetical adverse change in interest rates and amounts to approximately million at december  foreign currency exchange rates the company employs a foreign currency hedging strategy to limit potential losses in earnings or cash flows from adverse foreign currency exchange rate movements 
foreign currency exposures arise from transactions denominated in a currency other than the company s functional currency and from foreign denominated revenue and profit translated into us dollars 
the primary currencies to which the company is exposed include the euro  the canadian dollar  the japanese yen  the british pound and other asian and south american currencies 
exposures are hedged with foreign currency forward contracts  put options  and call options with maturity dates of less than eighteen months 
the potential loss in fair value at december  for such contracts resulting from a hypothetical adverse change in all foreign currency exchange rates is approximately million 
this loss would be mitigated by corresponding gains on the underlying exposures
