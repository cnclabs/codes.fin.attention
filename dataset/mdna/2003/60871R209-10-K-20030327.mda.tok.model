item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations introduction as noted on item a general development of business  recent general business developments  we acquired the carling business subsequently renamed cbl in england and wales from interbrew sa on february  since the acquisition was finalized in  the operating results and financial position of cbl are not included in our results discussed below for any period prior to the acquisition 
this acquisition had a significant impact on our operating results and financial condition 
cbl generated sales volume of approximately million barrels in this acquisition was funded through cash and third party debt as reflected in our consolidated balance sheet 
the borrowings will have a significant impact on our capitalization  interest coverage and cash flow trends 
see further discussion of this impact in the liquidity section below 
critical accounting policies management s discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america  or gaap 
we review the accounting policies we use in reporting our financial results on an on going basis 
the preparation of our consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities 
in many cases  the accounting treatment of a particular transaction is specifically dictated by gaap and does not require our judgment in an application 
there are also areas in which our judgment in selecting among reasonable alternatives would not produce a materially different result 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
by their nature  estimates are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty 
actual results may differ materially from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we have identified the policies below as critical to our financial condition and results of operations allowance for doubtful accounts in the americas segment  our allowance for doubtful accounts and credit risk is insignificant as the majority of the americas accounts receivable balance is generated from sales to independent distributors with whom we have a predetermined collection date arranged through electronic funds transfer 
also  in the americas  we secure substantially all of our credit risk with purchase money security interests in inventory and proceeds  personal guarantees and other letters of credit 
because the majority of cbl sales are directly to retail customers and  because of the policy of making trade loans to customers  our ability to manage our credit risk in this business is critical 
at cbl  we provide allowances for trade receivables and trade loans associated with the ability to collect outstanding receivables from our customers 
generally  provisions are recorded to cover the full exposure to a specific customer total amount of all trade accounts and loans from a specific customer less the amount of security and insurance coverage at the point the account is considered uncollectible 
we record the provision as a bad debt in general and administrative expenses 
provisions are reversed upon recoverability of the account or relieved at the point an account is written off 
we are not able to predict changes in financial condition of our customers and  if circumstances related to our customers deteriorate  our estimates of the recoverability of our trade receivables could be materially affected  and we may be required to record additional allowances 
pension and postretirement benefits cbc and its subsidiaries have defined benefit plans that cover the majority of employees 
as a result of the acquisition of cbl  we have assumed responsibility for a portion of the assets and liabilities of what was the bass brewers pension plan  renamed the coors brewers pension plan 
cbc also has postretirement plans that provide medical benefits and life insurance for retirees and eligible dependents 
the accounting for these plans is subject to the guidance provided in statement of financial accounting standards no 
 employers accounting for pensions sfas no 
and statement of financial accounting standards no 
 employers accounting for postretirement benefits other than pensions sfas no 

both of these statements require that management make certain assumptions relating to the long term rate of return on plan assets  discount rates used to measure future obligations and expenses  salary scale inflation rates  health care cost trend rates and other assumptions 
we believe that the accounting estimates related to our pension and postretirement plans is a critical accounting estimate because it is highly susceptible to change from period to period based on the performance of plan assets  actuarial valuations  and market conditions for further explanation of our assumptions and year end financial results for these plans  see item  footnote  employee retirement plans and footnote  postretirement benefits 
contingencies  environmental and litigation reserves we estimate the range of liability related to environmental matters or other legal actions where the amount and range of loss can be estimated 
we record our best estimate of a loss when the loss is considered probable 
as additional information becomes available  we assess the potential liability related to our pending matter and revise our estimates 
costs that extend the life  increase the capacity or improve the safety or efficiency of company owned assets or are incurred to mitigate or prevent future environmental contamination may be capitalized 
other environmental costs are expensed when incurred 
the most significant estimates that could impact our financial statements relate to the lowry superfund site 
goodwill and other intangible asset valuation we adopted the provisions of statements of financial standards no 
 business combinations sfas no 
on july   and no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets sfas no 
on december  we evaluate the carrying value of our goodwill and other indefinite lived intangible assets annually  and we evaluate our other intangible assets whenever there is evidence that certain events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of these assets may not be recoverable 
significant judgments and assumptions are required in the evaluation of intangible assets for impairment  most significantly the estimated future cash flows to be generated by these assets 
changes in these estimates could have a material adverse effect on the assessment of our goodwill and other intangible assets  thereby requiring us to write down the assets 
as an example  our valuation model for the goodwill associated with our molson usa joint venture assumes certain volume growth and pricing assumptions that  if not ultimately achieved  could result in impairment charges 
trade loans cbl extends loans to retail outlets that sell our brands 
some of these loans provide for no interest to be payable  others provide for payments at below market interest rate 
in return  the retail outlets receive smaller discounts on beer and other beverage products purchased from us  with the net result being cbl attaining a market return on the outstanding loan balance 
consistent with gaap  we have reclassified a portion of the beer revenue into interest income to reflect a market rate of interest on these notes 
for the fiscal year ended december   this amount was million 
we have included this interest income in the european segment since it is so closely related to the european business  even though all other interest income and expense is reflected in the corporate segment 
derivatives we use derivatives in the normal course of business to manage our exposure to fluctuations in production and packaging material prices  interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates 
by policy  we do not enter into such contracts for trading purposes or for the purpose of speculation 
all derivatives held by us are designated as hedges with the expectation that they will be highly effective in offsetting underlying exposures 
we account for our derivatives on the consolidated balance sheet as assets or liabilities at fair value in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities sfas no 
 which we early adopted on january  such accounting is complex  as evidenced by significant interpretations of the primary accounting standard  which continues to evolve  as well as the significant judgments and estimates involved in the estimation of fair value in the absence of quoted market values 
these estimates are based upon valuation methodologies deemed appropriate in the circumstances  however  the use of different assumptions may have a material effect on the estimated fair value amounts 
equity method accounting we generally apply the equity method of accounting to owned investments where we exercise significant influence 
as described below  we have an equity ownership in  and conduct business with various joint ventures  which directly relate to our core activities 
there are no related parties that own interests in our equity method investments 
coors canada is a general partnership that was formed to market cbc products in canada 
we own a interest in this non consolidated joint venture that we account for using the equity method of accounting due to the effective control of the partnership being shared equally by the partners under the operating agreement 
all manufacture  distribution and sale of cbc branded beers are contracted to molson inc molson by the partnership 
the partnership never takes title to the beer 
it is paid an amount equal to the sales proceeds molson receives from third party customers  less the costs incurred by molson for its manufacture  distribution and sale of the cbc branded products 
we reflect this amount in revenue in our consolidated statements of income see
