proforma sales assuming twelve months of were comparable to volumes increased  offsetting the impact on reported sales of an unfavorable product mix shift 
volumes decreased in two of the most profitable products in while increasing in several lower margin products 
margins deteriorated in because wheat prices increased due to high export demand resulting from the weak australian dollar 
additionally  corn costs increased in new zealand due to stronger demand for feed grains in the dairy industry 
the product mix shift also impacted margins 
income from operations improved as lower operating and research and development expenses totaling approximately million offset the foregoing factors

in  penford invested in an early stage technology company in the business of developing data analytics software applications 
penford accounted for its investment on the cost method 
in  with the continuing slowdown in the technology business sector  penford undertook an assessment of the fair value of its investment 
penford considered a number of factors  including the financial health and prospects of the investee  the prospects for receiving a future return on penford s investment  the adverse changes in the funding environment for technology companies and the lack of marketability for the investment 
the assessment indicated that it was unlikely that penford would recover any of its then existing carrying amount and that an other than temporary decline in the fair value of its investment had occurred 
penford recorded an impairment charge of million related to the complete write off of this investment 
in fiscal  the company incurred other charges of  for transaction costs related to terminated joint venture discussions 
in fiscal  the company paid its private placement debt facilities early in connection with a comprehensive refinancing to fund the acquisition of penford australia 
the early repayment of the debt required prepayment fees  which resulted in a loss on early extinguishment of debt of million 
this loss was previously reported as an extraordinary item  net of tax in the consolidated statements of operations 
effective september   penford adopted statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
which  among other things  eliminated the requirement that all gains and losses from the early extinguishment of debt were to be classified as an extraordinary item 
upon adoption of sfas no 
 gains and losses from the early extinguishment of debt are classified as an extraordinary item only if they meet the unusual and infrequent criteria contain in accounting principles board opinion no 
in addition  upon adoption of sfas no 
 all gains and losses from the early extinguishment of debt that had previously been classified as an extraordinary item are to be reassessed to determine if they would have met the unusual and infrequent criteria 
the company has concluded that the previously recognized loss on early extinguishment of debt in fiscal would not have met the criteria for classification as an extraordinary item  and accordingly such loss has been reclassified and reported as a component of income before extraordinary item 
this reclassification had no effect on the company s reported net income in fiscal interest and taxes interest expense was million  million and million in  and  respectively 
all of the company s debt has variable interest rates 
the decline in interest expense over the last three years was driven by a decrease in market interest rates and lower average debt balances 
the effective tax rate for was lower than the overall us federal statutory rate of due to the benefits of the foreign sales corporation and research and development tax credits 
as discussed above  during fiscal  penford recorded a million gain on the sale of certain assets of its hi maize business 
penford determined that  due to changes in australian tax legislation  no income taxes would be payable related to this gain and accordingly  no income taxes have been provided on this gain see notes and to the consolidated financial statements 
the effective tax rate for was lower than the overall statutory rate of due to the benefits of the foreign sales corporation and research and development tax credits 
the effective rate for was higher than the statutory rates due to state taxes and nondeductible goodwill amortization 
see note to the consolidated financial statements 
acquisition of penford australia on september   the company acquired penford australia for million in cash  plus transaction costs of million 
penford australia is the sole producer of corn starch products in australia and new zealand 
competition is from imported products  except in wheat flour based starches where there is one other producer in australia 
the acquisition was recorded using the purchase method of accounting 
accordingly  a portion of the purchase price was allocated to net tangible and intangible assets acquired based on their estimated fair values 
the balance of the purchase price was recorded as goodwill 
see note to the consolidated financial statements 
eleven months of penford australia s results of operations  from the september  date of acquisition  are included in the consolidated financial statements for the year ended august  liquidity and capital resources at august   penford had working capital of million  excluding current portion of debt  and million outstanding under its revolving credit and inventory financing credit facilities 
cash flow from operations was million  million and million in fiscal  and  respectively 
the increase in operating cash flows in over is due primarily to favorable changes in working capital and improved profitability 
capital expenditures were million  million and million in fiscal  and  respectively 
in the past two years  capital expenditures have been constrained by the limitations of the financial covenants in the company s then existing credit agreement 
in fiscal  subsequent to the refinancing discussed below  penford expects to spend approximately million for capital projects  primarily for growth opportunities and to improve asset utilization 
penford maintains two defined benefit pension plans in the us in the last three years  the value of the plans assets has decreased primarily due to poor performance from equity securities 
the combination of negative actual investment returns and declining discount rates have increased the company s underfunded plan status plan assets compared to benefit obligations 
based on the current underfunded status of the plans and the actuarial assumptions being used for  penford estimates that it will be required to make minimum contributions to the pension plans of million during fiscal and million during fiscal penford made term loan payments totaling million during fiscal the company was required to use the net cash proceeds from the national starch transactions and the sale of common stock to reduce debt 
the term loan payments during fiscal included million and million related to the national starch transactions and the sale of common stock  respectively 
on october   penford replaced its existing secured credit and inventory financing credit facilities with a new million secured credit facility with a group of us and australian banks 
the credit facility consists of million in term loans and million in revolving lines of credit 
the revolving lines of credit expire on october  and the term loans expire on october  interest rates under the new credit facility are based on either the london interbank offered rates libor or the australian bank bill rate equivalent or the prime rate  depending on the selection of borrowing options 
all of penford s assets secure the credit facility and the new agreement includes  among other things  financial covenants with limitations on indebtedness and capital expenditures and maintenance of fixed charge and leverage ratios 
on october   penford had approximately million of borrowing availability under its revolving lines of credit 
the company s debt maturities at august  have been classified in the consolidated balance sheets in accordance with the repayment terms of the new bank financing 
in fiscal  penford paid dividends on its common stock of million at a quarterly rate of per share 
on october   the board of directors declared a dividend of per common share payable on december  to shareholders of record as of november  on a periodic basis  the board of directors reviews the company s dividend policy which is impacted by the company s earnings  financial condition and cash and capital requirements 
future dividend payments are at the discretion of the board of directors 
penford has included the continuation of quarterly dividends in the planning for fiscal the company expects to generate sufficient cash from operations and to have sufficient borrowing capacity and ability to fund its cash requirements during fiscal the board of directors has authorized a stock repurchase program for the purchase of up to  shares of penford s outstanding common stock 
repurchases under the program to date have totaled  shares for million in prior years 
the company did not purchase any of its common stock during the last three fiscal years  and does not expect to do so in fiscal critical accounting policies the company s consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
these accounting principles require management to make estimates  judgments and assumptions to fairly present results of operations and financial position 
management believes that its estimates  judgments and assumptions are reasonable based upon information available at the time this report was prepared 
to the extent there are material differences between estimates  judgments and assumptions and the actual results  the financial statements will be affected 
in many cases  the accounting treatment of a particular transaction is significantly dictated by generally accepted accounting principles and does not require judgment or estimates 
there are also areas in which management s judgments in selecting among available alternatives would not produce a materially different result 
management has reviewed the accounting policies and related disclosures with the audit committee 
the notes to the consolidated financial statements contain a summary of the company s accounting policies 
however  the accounting policies that management believes are the most important to the financial statements and that require the most difficult  subjective and complex judgments include the following evaluation of the allowance for doubtful accounts receivable hedging activities benefit plans valuation of goodwill a description of each of these follows evaluation of the allowance for doubtful accounts receivable management makes judgments about the company s ability to collect outstanding receivables and provide allowances for the portion of receivables that the company may not be able to collect 
penford records an estimate of accounts that will not be collected based upon a specific review of larger accounts 
for those accounts not specifically reviewed  penford estimates uncollectible amounts based on the age of the receivable compared to the terms offered 
if the estimates do not reflect the company s future ability to collect outstanding invoices  penford may experience losses in excess of the reserves established 
at august  and the allowance for doubtful accounts receivable was  and  respectively 
the majority of the allowance is related to the industrial ingredients business  and reflects the economic downturn in the paper making industry 
hedging activities penford uses derivatives  primarily futures contacts  to reduce exposure to price fluctuations of commodities used in the manufacturing processes in the united states 
penford has elected to designate these activities as hedges 
this election allows the company to defer gains and losses on those derivative instruments until the underlying commodity is used in the production process 
the requirements for the designation of hedges are very complex  and require judgments and analysis to qualify as hedges as defined by sfas these judgments and analysis include an assessment that the derivative instruments used are effective hedges of the underlying risks 
if the company were to fail to meet the requirements of sfas  or if these derivative instruments are not designated as hedges  the company would be required to mark these contracts to market at each reporting date 
penford had deferred losses of  at august  and a gain of  at august   which are reflected in accumulated other comprehensive income loss in both years 
benefit plans penford has stock option plans for its employees and directors 
because the company grants options to employees at the market price on date of grant  penford follows the policy of recording no compensation expense for those option grants 
an alternative financial reporting standard  sfas  provides a methodology for estimating the hypothetical compensation expense associated with stock option grants  which expense is then amortized over the vesting period 
as required by sfas  the company has disclosed the pro forma impact of this alternative accounting treatment in note to the consolidated financial statements 
penford has defined benefit plans for its employees providing retirement benefits and coverage for retiree health care 
qualified actuaries determine the estimated cost of these plans annually 
these actuarial estimates are based on assumptions of the discount rate used to calculate the present value of future payments  the expected investment return on plan assets  the estimate of future increases in compensation rates and the estimate of increases in the cost of medical care 
the company makes judgments about these assumptions based on historical investment results and experience as well as available historical market data and trends 
however  if these assumptions are wrong  it could materially affect the amounts reported in the financial statements 
disclosure about these estimates and assumptions are included in note to the consolidated financial statements 
see defined benefit plans in this item valuation of goodwill penford is required to assess whether the value of goodwill reported on the balance sheet has been impaired on an annual basis  or more often if conditions exist that indicate that there might be an impairment 
these assessments require extensive and subjective judgments to assess the fair value of goodwill 
while the company engages qualified valuation experts to assist in this process  their work is based on the company s estimates of future operating results and allocation of goodwill to the business units 
if future operating results differ materially from the estimates  the value of goodwill could be adversely impacted 
see note to the consolidated financial statements 
contractual obligations as more fully described in notes and to the consolidated financial statements  the company is a party to various debt and lease agreements at august  that contractually commit the company to pay certain amounts in the future 
subsequent to august   penford obtained bank financing on a long term basis for the purpose of refinancing its short term obligations under its existing secured credit and inventory financing credit facilities 
accordingly  the contractual commitments below are presented in accordance with the repayment terms of the new bank financing 
the following table summarizes such contractual commitments after total indebtedness      operating leases      defined benefit pension plans penford maintains two defined benefit pension plans in the us the most significant assumptions used to determine pension expense and pension obligations are the discount rate and the expected return on assets assumption 
the discount rate used by penford in determining pension expense and pension obligations is based on a review of high quality baa to aaa corporate annualized bond yields maturities of or more years and year us treasury rates 
the expected long term return on assets assumption used in determining pension expense is based on penford s evaluation of historical market rates of return and asset class return expectations 
penford s independent actuaries provided the company with projected returns  which were forward looking  were not based on historical returns and considered returns from active management and fees paid from the plans 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for the assumptions used by penford 
penford recorded pension expense income of million  million and million in  and  respectively 
penford expects pension expense to be approximately million in fiscal the company made no cash contributions to the pension plans during fiscal or cash contributions of million were made to the plans in fiscal penford estimates that it will be required to make minimum contributions to the pension plans of million during fiscal and million during fiscal the expected return on assets assumption was reduced by to for pension expense for fiscal a decrease increase in the expected return on assets assumption would increase decrease pension expense by approximately million based on the plans assets at august  the discount rate used to determine pension expense reflects the decline in bond yields over the past several years 
penford has lowered its discount rate from in fiscal to for fiscal lowering the discount rate by would increase pension expense by approximately million 
penford bases its determination of pension expense on the fair value of plan assets as well as the expected long term return on those assets 
the difference between actual investment earnings and those assumed is recognized in pension expense through amortization over the expected future working lifetime of active employees 
as of august   unrecognized losses from all sources assets and liabilities were million 
the estimated increase in future expense as a result of the amortization of these losses is approximately million

item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk sensitive instruments and positions penford is exposed to market risks that are inherent in the financial instruments that are used in the normal course of business 
penford may use various hedge instruments to manage or reduce market risk  but the company does not use derivative financial instrument transactions for speculative purposes 
the primary market risks are discussed below 
interest rate risk the company s exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates to its variable rate borrowings 
all of penford s long term debt has variable interest rates  which are set for periods of one to six months 
the company has managed interest rates using interest rate swaps in the past  but there are no such instruments outstanding as of august  if market interest rates for the company s debt had averaged more than they did in fiscal  the company s interest expense would have increased  and income before taxes would have decreased by million 
foreign currency exchange rates the company has us australian and australian new zealand dollar currency exchange rate risks due to revenues and costs denominated in australian and new zealand dollars with the company s foreign operation  penford australia 
currently  cash generated by penford australia s operations is used for capital investment in australia and payment of debt denominated in australian dollars 
at august   approximately of total debt was denominated in australian dollars 
the company has not maintained any derivative instruments to mitigate the us australian dollar currency exchange translation exposure 
this position is reviewed periodically  and based on the company s review  may result in the incorporation of derivative instruments in the company s hedging strategy 
the currency exchange rate risk between penford s australian and new zealand operations is not significant 
the impact of a change in the foreign currency exchange rates compared with the us dollar would not have a significant impact on reported net income for the year ended august  from time to time  penford enters into foreign exchange forward contracts to manage exposure to receivables and payables denominated in currencies different from the functional currencies of the selling entities

at that date  the company had trade receivables of us million at penford australia 
commodities the availability and price of corn  penford s most significant raw material  is subject to fluctuations due to unpredictable factors such as weather  plantings  domestic and foreign governmental farm programs and policies  changes in global demand and the worldwide production of corn 
to reduce the price risk caused by market fluctuations  penford generally follows a policy of using exchange traded futures and options contracts to hedge exposure to corn price fluctuations in north america 
these futures and options contracts are designated as hedges 
the changes in market value of these contracts have historically been  and are expected to continue to be  highly effective in offsetting the price changes in corn 
penford s net corn position in the us consists primarily of inventories  purchase contracts and exchange traded futures and options contracts that hedge penford s exposure to commodity price fluctuations 
the fair value of the position is based on quoted market prices 
the company has estimated its market risk as the potential loss in fair value resulting from a hypothetical adverse change in prices 
as of august  and  the fair value of the company s net corn position was approximately million and million  respectively 
the market risk associated with a adverse change in corn prices at august  and  is estimated at  and  respectively 
over the past three years  prices for natural gas have increased over historic levels 
prices for natural gas fluctuate due to anticipated changes in supply and demand and movement of prices of related or alternative fuels 
to reduce the price risk caused by market fluctuations  penford generally enters into short term purchase contracts or uses exchange traded futures and options contracts to hedge exposure to natural gas price fluctuations 
these futures and options contracts are designated as hedges 
the changes in market value of these contracts have historically been  and are expected to continue to be  highly effective in offsetting the price changes in natural gas 
penford s exchange traded futures and options contracts hedge production requirements 
the fair value of these contracts is based on quoted market prices 
the company has estimated its market risk as the potential loss in fair value resulting from a hypothetical adverse change in prices
