item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
general since its incorporation in  camco has evolved into a full service provider of financial products to the communities served by advantage bank 
utilizing a common marketing theme based on camco s commitment to personalized customer service  camco and its affiliates have grown from million of consolidated assets in to billion of consolidated assets at december  camco s rate of growth is largely attributable to its acquisitions of marietta savings  first savings  first bank for savings  germantown federal  westwood homestead and columbia savings and its continued expansion of product lines from the limited deposit and loan offerings which the bank could offer in the heavily regulated environment of the s to the wider array of financial service products that commercial banks traditionally offered 
additionally  camco has enhanced its operational growth by integrating its residential lending function through establishing mortgage banking operations in the bank s primary market areas and  to a lesser extent  by chartering a title insurance agency 
management believes that continued success in the financial services industry will be achieved by those institutions with a rigorous dedication to building value added customer oriented organizations 
toward this end  each of the bank s divisions have the ability to make local decisions for customer contacts and services  however back office operations are consolidated and centralized 
based on consumer preferences  the bank s management designs financial service products with a view towards differentiating each of the constituent divisions from its competition 
management believes that the bank divisions ability to rapidly adapt to consumer needs and preferences is essential to them as community based financial institutions competing against the larger regional and money center bank holding companies 
camco s profitability depends primarily on its level of net interest income  which is the difference between interest income on interest earning assets  principally loans  mortgage backed securities and investment securities  and interest expense on deposit accounts and borrowings 
in recent years  camco s net earnings have also been heavily influenced by its level of other income  including mortgage banking income and other fee income 
camco s operations are also affected by general  administrative and other expenses  including employee compensation and benefits  occupancy expense  data processing  franchise taxes  advertising  other operating expenses and federal income tax expense 
discussion of financial condition changes from december  to december  at december   camco s consolidated assets totaled billion  a decrease of million  or  from the december  total 
the decrease in total assets was comprised primarily of a decrease in loans receivable and a decrease in cash and cash equivalents  which were partially offset by increases in investment securities and mortgage backed securities 
during  camco continued to experience a high rate of loan refinance activity as the interest rate environment remained at almost unprecedented lows 
management elected to invest proceeds from loan repayments generally into investment and mortgage backed securities designated as available for sale  which offered higher yields than short term alternatives 
cash and interest bearing deposits in other financial institutions totaled million at december   a decrease of million  or  from december  levels 
investment securities totaled million at december   an increase of million  or  over the total at december  investment securities purchases were comprised of million of intermediate term us government agency obligations  million of which were callable  with an average yield of  and million in municipal securities 
such purchases were partially offset by million of maturities of securities during the year 
mortgage backed securities totaled million at december   an increase of million  or  over december  mortgage backed securities purchases totaled million  while principal repayments totaled million during the year ended december  purchases of mortgage backed securities during the year were comprised primarily of balloon and ten year amortizing us government agency securities yielding  which were classified as available for sale 
purchases of investment and mortgage backed securities were funded primarily with proceeds from loan principal repayments and excess liquidity 
loans receivable and loans held for sale totaled million at december   a decrease of million  or  from the total at december  the decrease resulted primarily from loan sales of million and principal repayments of million  which were partially offset by loan disbursements of million and purchases of million 
loan origination volume  including purchases of loans  during exceeded volume by million  or  which was primarily attributable to an increase in refinancing activity following the decreases in the overall level of long term interest rates during the two year period ended december  the allowance for loan losses totaled million and million at december  and  respectively  representing and of nonperforming loans at those dates 
nonperforming loans days or more delinquent plus nonaccrual loans totaled million and million at december  and  respectively  constituting and 
of total net loans  including loans held for sale  at those dates 
at december   nonperforming loans were comprised of million of loans secured by one to four family residential real estate  million of loans secured by multi family and nonresidential real estate   of commercial loans and  of consumer and other loans 
although management believes that its allowance for loan losses at december   is adequate based upon the available facts and circumstances  there can be no assurance that additions to such allowance will not be necessary in future periods  which could adversely affect camco s results of operations 
deposits totaled million at december   a decrease of million  or  from december  levels 
the decrease resulted primarily from management s decision not to aggressively bid on certificates of deposit which matured during  due to the current low interest rate environment 
while management has generally pursued a strategy of moderate growth in the deposit portfolio  advantage has not historically engaged in sporadic increases or decreases in interest rates offered  nor has it offered the highest interest rates available in its market areas 
advances from the federal home loan bank fhlb increased by million  or  to a total of million at december  stockholders equity totaled million at december   a million  or  increase over december  the increase resulted primarily from net earnings of million  proceeds from the exercise of stock options of million and a million increase in the unrealized gains on available for sale securities  which were partially offset by dividends of million and purchases of treasury shares totaling million 
the bank is required to maintain minimum regulatory capital pursuant to federal regulations 
during  management was notified by its supervisory regulators that advantage was categorized as well capitalized under the regulatory framework for prompt corrective action 
at december   the bank s regulatory capital exceeded all regulatory capital requirements 
comparison of results of operations for the years ended december  and december  general 
camco s net earnings for the year ended december   totaled million  an increase of million  or  over the million of net earnings reported in the increase in earnings was primarily attributable to a one time charge of  in pre tax expense related to the consolidation of the bank charters in the period and the recognition of a  reversal of this restructuring charge during the period 
additionally  net interest income increased by million and other income increased by million  while the provision for losses on loans increased by  general  administrative and other expense increased by million excluding the effects of the restructuring charge and the provision for federal income taxes increased by  income and expenses for include the effects of the acquisition of columbia financial  which was acquired by camco in november in a transaction accounted for using the purchase method of accounting

provision for losses on loans 
a provision for losses on loans is charged to earnings to bring the total allowance for loan losses to a level considered appropriate by management based on historical experience  the volume and type of lending conducted by the bank  the status of past due principal and interest payments  general economic conditions  particularly as such conditions relate to the bank s market areas  and other factors related to the collectibility of the bank s loan portfolio 
based upon an analysis of these factors  management recorded a provision for losses on loans totaling million for the year ended december   an increase of  or  over the provision recorded in the provision generally reflects the million increase in the level of nonperforming loans 
the provision also reflects the increasing percentage of loans secured by nonresidential real estate and consumer loans in relation to total loans during management believes all nonperforming loans are adequately collateralized  however  there can be no assurance that the loan loss allowance will be adequate to absorb losses on known nonperforming assets or that the allowance will be adequate to cover losses on nonperforming assets in the future

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the objective of the bank s asset liability management function is to maintain consistent growth in net interest income within the bank s policy limits 
this objective is accomplished through management of the bank s balance sheet composition  liquidity  and interest rate risk exposures arising from changing economic conditions  interest rates and customer preferences 
the goal of liquidity management is to provide adequate funds to meet changes in loan demand or unexpected deposit withdrawals 
this is accomplished by maintaining liquid assets in the form of investment securities  maintaining sufficient unused borrowing capacity and achieving consistent growth in core deposits 
management considers interest rate risk the bank s most significant market risk 
interest rate risk is the exposure to adverse changes in net interest income due to changes in interest rates 
consistency of the bank s net interest income is largely dependent upon the effective management of interest rate risk 
to identify and manage its interest rate risk the bank employs an earnings simulation model to analyze net interest income sensitivity to changing interest rates 
the model is based on actual cash flows and repricing characteristics and incorporates market based assumptions regarding the effect of changing interest rates on the prepayment rates of certain assets and liabilities 
the model also includes senior management projections for activity levels in each of the product lines offered by the bank 
assumptions based on the historical behavior of deposit rates and balances in relation to changes in interest rates are also incorporated into the model 
assumptions are inherently uncertain and the measurement of net interest income or the impact of rate fluctuations on net interest income cannot be precisely predicted 
actual results may differ from simulated results due to timing  magnitude  and frequency of interest rate changes as well as changes in market conditions and management strategies 
the bank s asset liability management committee alco  which includes senior management representatives and reports to the board of directors  monitors and manages interest rate risk within board approved policy limits 
the bank s current interest rate risk position is determined by measuring the anticipated change in net interest income over a month horizon assuming a basis point bp instantaneous and parallel shift linear increase or decrease in all interest rates 
given the current federal funds rate of at december   a linear bp decrease was modeled in the estimated earnings sensitivity profile in place of the linear bp decrease in accordance with the bank s interest rate risk policy 
current policy limits this exposure to plus or minus of net interest income for a month horizon 
the following table shows the bank s estimated earnings sensitivity profile as of december  change in percentage change in interest rates net interest income basis points months given a bp linear increase in the yield curve used in the simulation model  it is estimated net interest income for the bank would increase by over one year 
a bp linear decrease in interest rates would decrease net interest income by over one year 
all of these estimated changes in net interest income are within the policy guidelines established by the board of directors 
management does not expect any significant adverse effect on net interest income in based on the composition of the portfolio and anticipated upward trends in rates 
in order to reduce the exposure to interest rate fluctuations and to manage liquidity  the bank has developed sale procedures for several types of interest sensitive assets 
generally  all long term  fixed rate single family residential mortgage loans underwritten according to federal home loan mortgage corporation or federal national mortgage association guidelines are sold for cash upon origination 
in and  a total of million and million of such loans  respectively  were sold
