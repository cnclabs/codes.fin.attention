impact of inflation the primary inflationary factors affecting the company s operation s include food and labor costs 
a number of the company s restaurant personnel ar e paid at the federal and state established minimum wage levels and  accordingly changes in such wage levels affect the company s labor costs 
however  since th e majority of personnel are tipped employees  minimum wage changes generally hav e little effect on overall labor costs 
historically  as food and labor hav e increased  the company has been able to offset these increases through men u price increases and economies of scale  however  there may be delays in th e implementation of such menu price increases or in effecting timely economies o f scale  as well as  competitive pressures which may limit the company s abilit y to recover any cost increases in its entirety 
to date  inflation has not had a material impact on operating margins

realize d and unrealized changes in the fair values of the derivative instruments ar e recognized in income in the period in which the change occurs 
realized an d unrealized gains and losses for the period were not significant 
as of decembe r   the company had no positions in futures contracts 
impact of recently issued financial standards in june  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for cost s associated with exit or disposal activities 
this statement requires that a liability for a cost associated with an exit or disposal activity be recognize d only when the liability is incurred and measured at fair value 
sfas no 
i s effective for exit or disposal activities that are initiated after december the company does not expect the initial adoption of this statement wil l have a material impact on its results of operations or financial position 
risk factors fiscal results may not be indicative of results 
our fiscal consisted of a week period which included sales for tw o new year s eves 
in contrast  fiscal will be a week period with no ne w year s eve sales 
this change will impact comparability for sales and net income for the first and fourth quarters of fiscal year we estimate tha t the extra week in fiscal added  in revenues   or 
per share 
diluted to net income 
accordingly  our results for fiscal may not be indicative of our results for fiscal if we are unable to compete effectively with our competitors  we will not b e able to increase revenues or generate profits 
our inability to increase revenues is directly related to our ability t o compete effectively with our competitors 
key competitive factors include o the quality and numbers of employees needed to adequately staff ou r restaurants  o the quality and value of the food products offered  o the quality of service  o the cost of our raw products  o the price of the food products offered  o the restaurant locations  and o the ambiance of facilities 
we compete with other steakhouse restaurants specifically and with al l other restaurants generally 
we compete with national and regional chains  a s well as individually owned restaurants 
the restaurant industry has fe w non economic barriers to entry  and as our competitors expand operations competition from steakhouse restaurants with concepts similar to ours can b e expected to intensify 
many of our competitors are well established in th e upscale and mid scale steak segments and certain competitors have substantiall y greater financial  marketing and other resources than us 
such increase d competition could adversely affect our revenues 
changing consumer preferences and discretionary spending patterns  potentia l outbreaks of mad cow disease or foot mouth disease and other factor s affecting the availability of beef could force us to modify our restaurants concept and menu and could result in a reduction in our revenues 
even if we are able to successfully compete with other restauran t companies with similar concepts  we may be forced to make changes in one or mor e of our concepts in order to respond to changes in consumer tastes or dinin g patterns 
consumer preferences could be affected by health concerns about th e consumption of beef  the primary item on our menus  or by specific events suc h as the outbreak of mad cow disease or foot mouth disease which occurred i n the united kingdom 
in addition  these events could reduce the available suppl y of beef or significantly raise the price of beef 
if we change a restauran t concept  we may lose additional customers who do not prefer the new concept an d menu  and we may not be able to attract a sufficient new customer base t o produce the revenue needed to make the restaurant profitable 
in addition  w e may have different or additional competitors for our intended customers as a result of such a concept change and may not be able to successfully compet e against such competitors 
our success also depends on numerous factors affectin g discretionary consumer spending  including economic conditions  the cost o f gasoline  disposable consumer income and consumer confidence 
adverse changes i n these factors could reduce guest traffic or impose practical limits on pricing either of which could reduce revenues and operating income 
unforeseen cost increases could adversely affect our profitability 
our profitability is highly sensitive to increases in food  labor an d other operating costs 
our dependence on frequent deliveries of fresh foo d supplies means that shortages or interruptions in supply could materially an d adversely affect our operations 
in addition  unfavorable trends or development s concerning the following factors could adversely affect our results o inflation  food  labor  energy and utilities and employee benefi t costs  and o rent increases resulting from rent escalation provisions in ou r leases 
we may be unable to anticipate or react to changing prices 
if we ar e unable to modify our purchasing practices or quickly or readily pass o n increased costs to customers  our business could be materially affected 
failure to comply with government regulations could adversely affect ou r operating performance 
our restaurant operations are subject to certain federal  state and loca l laws and government regulations  such as o obtaining of licenses for the sale of food and alcohol beverages  o national and local health sanitation laws and regulations  o national and local employment and safety laws and regulations  and o local zoning  building code and land use regulations 
while we have never experienced any significant difficulties in obtainin g necessary governmental approvals  the failure to obtain or retain food an d liquor licenses or any other governmental approvals could have a materia l adverse effect on our operating results 
we may be subjected to dram shop liability  which generally provides a person injured by an intoxicated person with the right to recover damages fro m an establishment that wrongfully served alcoholic beverages to the intoxicate d person 
although we carry liquor liability coverage as part of our comprehensiv e general liability insurance  if we lost a lawsuit related to this liability  ou r business could be materially harmed 
the restaurant industry is affected by a number of trends  as well as b y competition 
the restaurant industry is affected by changes in consumer tastes and b y national  regional  and local economic conditions and demographic trends 
th e performance of individual restaurants may be affected by factors such as traffi c patterns  demographic considerations and the type  number and location o f competing restaurants 
in addition  factors such as inflation  increased food labor and employee benefit costs and the availability of experienced managemen t and hourly employees to successfully operate the restaurants may also adversel y affect the restaurant industry in general and our restaurants in particular 
our business depends on a limited number of key personnel  the loss of who m could adversely affect us 
some of our senior executives are important to our success because the y have been instrumental in setting the strategic direction of our company operating our business  identifying  recruiting and training key personnel identifying areas for expansion and arranging necessary financing 
these ke y personnel include jamie b 
coulter  our chief executive officer  td o connell our senior vice president of operations  and certain of our other executiv e officers 
although we believe there is a significant pool of talented personne l in the restaurant industry  if these members of our senior management tea m become unable or unwilling to continue in their present positions  it coul d adversely affect our business and development 
shareholders may not be able to resell their stock or may have to sell at a price substantially lower than the price they paid for it 
the trading price for our common stock has been highly volatile and coul d continue to be subject to significant fluctuations in response to variations i n our quarterly operating results  general conditions in the restaurant industr y or the general economy  and other factors 
in addition  the stock market i s subject to price and volume fluctuations affecting the market price for publi c companies generally  or within broad industry groups  which fluctuations may b e unrelated to the operating results or other circumstances of a particula r company 
such fluctuations may adversely affect the liquidity of our commo n stock  as well as price that holders may achieve for their shares upon an y future sale staggered board  blank check preferred stock 
our current certificate of incorporation and bylaws provide for thre e classes of directors to be elected on a staggered basis 
this enables existin g directors to exercise significant control over our affairs  and may act as a n impediment to any future attempts by third parties to take control of our boar d of directors 
in addition  our board of directors has the authority withou t further action by the stockholders to issue shares of preferred stock in one o r more series and to fix the rights  preferences  privileges and restriction s thereof 
the exercise of this authority may act as a further impediment to an y future attempts by third parties to take control of our board of directors 
a single vendor distributes most of our consumable products 
approximately of the consumable products used in our restaurants ar e distributed through and delivered by a single vendor 
while we believe we coul d replace this vendor  any disruption of services by this vendor or any change t o a new vendor could adversely affect our restaurants 
we are uncertain as to the future of our australian operations 
the sales and operating margins of our australian restaurants have bee n negatively impacted by the effects of the national general sales tax implemente d by the australian government in july and the weakening of the overal l australian economy 
we closed nine australian restaurants in  six in five in  and additional units may need to be closed in the future  due to among other things  the failure of the market trade area surrounding variou s locations to develop as originally anticipated  thus  such market areas may no t achieve sufficient demographics to support a profitable level of business 
w e also incurred a pre tax charge for impaired assets in each of fiscal an d fiscal for the write down of impaired assets at certain under performin g australian restaurants 
these write downs require the use of estimates an d projections which are subject to a high degree of judgment and complexity 
i f consumer spending in restaurants continues to be negatively impacted  we may b e required to make additional write downs of impaired assets in australia 
w e continue to evaluate our investment strategies in australia  however  there i s no assurance that we can achieve acceptable operating results in the future 
the risk of future terrorist attacks may adversely impact our revenue 
as a result of the terrorist attacks on the united states on september  a number of our restaurants  particularly our del frisco s and sullivan s restaurants  were negatively affected 
additionally  recent terrorist warnings both in the united states and internationally  suggest the possibility of futur e terrorist attacks  which together with the unpredictability of future militar y action and other responses to such terrorist attacks has resulted in economi c uncertainty 
the occurrence of future terrorist attacks may adversely affect ou r business and make it more difficult to forecast our future results of operation item a
