item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion should be read in conjunction with selected financial data item and our consolidated financial statements  which are included elsewhere in this form k 
general conmed corporation is a medical technology company specializing in instruments  implants and video equipment for arthroscopic sports medicine and powered surgical instruments  such as drills and saws  for orthopedic  ent  neuro surgery and other surgical specialties 
we are a leading developer  manufacturer and supplier of rf electrosurgery systems used routinely to cut and cauterize tissue in nearly all types of surgical procedures worldwide  endoscopy products such as trocars  clip appliers  scissors and surgical staplers and a full line of ecg electrodes for heart monitoring and other patient care products 
we also offer integrated operating room systems and intensive care unit service managers 
our products are used in a variety of clinical settings  such as operating rooms  surgery centers  physicians offices and critical care areas of hospitals 
critical accounting estimates preparation of our financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses 
note to the consolidated financial statements describes the significant accounting policies used in preparation of the consolidated financial statements 
the most significant areas involving management judgments and estimates are described below and are considered by management to be critical to understanding the financial condition and results of operations of conmed corporation 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue upon shipment of product and passage of title to our customers 
factors considered in our revenue recognition policy are as follows o sales to customers are evidenced by firm purchase orders 
title and the risks and rewards of ownership are transferred to the customer when product is shipped 
o payment by the customer is due under fixed payment terms 
even when the sale is to a distributor  payment to us is not contractually or implicitly delayed until the product is resold by the distributor 
o we place certain of our capital equipment with customers in return for commitments to purchase disposable products over time periods generally ranging from one to three years 
in these circumstances  no revenue is recognized upon capital shipment and we recognize revenue upon the disposable product shipment 
o product returns are only accepted at the discretion of the company and in keeping with our returned goods policy 
product returns have not been significant historically 
we accrue for sales returns  rebates and allowances based upon analysis of historical data 
o the terms of the company s sales to customers do not involve any obligations for the company to perform future services 
limited warranties are generally provided for capital equipment sales and provisions for warranty are provided at the time of product shipment 
o amounts billed to customers related to shipping and handling are included in net sales 
shipping and handling costs of million  million and million for the years ended  and  respectively are included in selling and administrative expense 
o we sell to a diversified base of customers around the world and  therefore  believe there is no material concentration of credit risk 
o we assess the risk of loss on accounts receivable and adjust the allowance for doubtful accounts based on this risk assessment 
historically  losses on accounts receivable have not been material 
management believes the allowance for doubtful accounts of 
million at december  is adequate to provide for any probable losses from accounts receivable 
business acquisitions we completed acquisitions in with purchase prices totaling approximately million and have a history of growth through acquisitions 
the assets and liabilities of acquired businesses are recorded under the purchase method at their estimated fair values at the dates of acquisition 
goodwill represents costs in excess of fair values assigned to the underlying net assets of acquired businesses 
other intangible assets primarily represent allocations of purchase price to identifiable intangible assets of acquired businesses 
we have accumulated goodwill of million and other intangible assets of million at december  in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  sfas  goodwill and intangible assets deemed to have indefinite lives are not amortized  but are subject to annual impairment testing 
the identification and measurement of goodwill impairment involves the estimation of the fair value of our business 
the estimates of fair value are based on the best information available as of the date of the assessment  which primarily incorporate management assumptions about expected future cash flows and contemplate other valuation techniques 
future cash flows can be affected by changes in industry or market conditions or the rate and extent to which anticipated synergies or cost savings are realized with newly acquired entities 
intangible assets with a finite life are amortized over the estimated useful life of the asset 
intangible assets which continue to be subject to amortization are also evaluated on an annual basis to determine whether events and circumstances warrant a revision to the remaining period of amortization 
an intangible asset is determined to be impaired when estimated future cash flows indicate the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable 
although no goodwill or other intangible asset impairment has been recorded to date  there can be no assurances that future impairment will not occur 
see note and note to the consolidated financial statements 
pension plans we sponsor defined benefit pension plans for the company and its subsidiaries 
major assumptions used in the accounting for these plans include the discount rate  expected return on plan assets and rate of increase in employee compensation levels 
assumptions are determined based on company data and appropriate market indicators  and are evaluated each year as of the plans measurement date 
a change in any of these assumptions would have an effect on net periodic pension costs reported in the consolidated financial statements 
lower market interest rates and plan asset returns have resulted in declines in pension plan asset performance and funded status 
the discount rate was lowered from to reflecting current economic conditions 
pension expense in is expected to be negatively impacted by these changes 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion 
income taxes the recorded future tax benefit arising from net deductible temporary differences and tax carryforwards is million at december  management believes that our earnings during the periods when the temporary differences become deductible will be sufficient to realize the related future income tax benefits 
in assessing the need for a valuation allowance  we estimate future taxable income  considering the feasibility of ongoing tax planning strategies and the realizability of tax loss carryforwards 
valuation allowances related to deferred tax assets can be impacted by changes to tax laws  changes to statutory tax rates and future taxable income levels 
in the event we were to determine that we would not be able to realize all or a portion of our deferred tax assets in the future  we would reduce such amounts through a charge to income in the period that such determination was made 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion 
results of operations compared to the following table presents  as a percentage of net sales  certain categories included in our consolidated statements of income for the periods indicated year ended december  net sales cost of sales gross margin selling and administrative expense research and development expense income from operations interest expense  net income before income taxes and extraordinary loss provision for income taxes income before extraordinary loss sales for were million  an increase of compared to sales of million in excluding our acquisition of certain product lines from imagyn in july the second imagyn acquisition and adjusting for constant foreign currency exchange rates  sales would have grown by approximately 
o sales in our orthopedic businesses grew to million in from million in adjusted for constant foreign currency exchange rates  orthopedic sales growth in would have been approximately compared with  as the value of the euro strengthened in comparison with the dollar 
o arthroscopy sales  which represented approximately of total orthopedic revenues  grew in to million from million in  on strength in sales of disposable products and video equipment 
o powered surgical instrument sales  which represented approximately of total orthopedic revenues  remained flat at million in and we believe the weakness in sales in the powered surgical instrument product line was a result of our aging battery powered product offering which was replaced in march with our new powerpro r battery powered instrument product line 
we believe that once powerpro r becomes established in the marketplace  it will enable us to resume overall growth in powered surgical instrument sales 
additionally  during we entered into a distribution agreement with depuy orthopaedics  depuy  a johnson johnson company  which will enable the depuy sales force to also sell powerpro r which should aid sales growth in this product line 
o patient care sales for were million  a 
increase from million in as modest increases in sales of our ecg and other patient care product lines more than offset declines in sales of our surgical suction product lines which continue to face significant competition and pricing pressures 
o electrosurgery sales for were million  an increase of from million in  driven by increases in disposable product sales 
o endoscopy sales for were million  an increase of from million in excluding the impact of the second imagyn acquisition in july  as described in note to our consolidated financial statements  the increase in endoscopy sales was approximately 
o integrated operating room systems sales for were 
million as a result of two acquisitions discussed in note to our conso lidated financial statements 
cost of sales increased to million in compared to million in  primarily as a result of the increased sales volumes described above 
as discussed in notes and to our consolidated financial statements  during  we incurred various non recurring charges in connection with the july imagyn acquisition 
these costs were primarily related to the transition in manufacturing of the imagyn product lines from imagyn s richland  michigan facility to our manufacturing plants in utica  new york 
such costs totaled approximately million and are included in cost of sales 
excluding the impact of these non recurring expenses  cost of sales for was million 
gross margin percentage for  excluding the imagyn related charges  was  slightly better than the  experienced in the decrease in gross margin percentage in is a result of sales of sample powerpro r product to the depuy sales force  pursuant to a distribution agreement as discussed above  which were at gross margins lower than the margins realized for units sold to end user customers  as well as certain unfavorable production variances experienced in selling and administrative expense increased to million in as compared to million in as a percentage of sales  selling and administrative expense totaled in compared to in during  selling and administrative expense decreased by approximately million  before income taxes  as a result of the adoption of sfas as discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements  we settled a patent infringement case which resulted in a fourth quarter charge to selling and administrative expense of million  before income taxes 
excluding the impacts of the adoption of sfas and the patent litigation charge  selling and administrative expense in would have been approximately million or as a percentage of sales  the same as in research and development expense totaled million in compared to million in this increase represents continued research and development efforts primarily focused on product development in the electrosurgery and orthopedic product lines 
as a percentage of sales  research and development was  consistent with in interest expense in was million compared to million in the decrease in interest expense is primarily a result of lower total borrowings outstanding during as compared to the same period a year ago  as borrowings have declined to million at december  as compared to million at december  the weighted average interest rates on our borrowings increased slightly to at december  as compared to at december  as borrowings under our senior credit facility were reduced while borrowings under our senior subordinated notes remained at million 
during  we terminated our former senior credit agreement and entered into a new senior credit agreement 
accordingly  we recorded an extraordinary charge on the early extinguishment of debt  of approximately 
million  net of income taxes  to write off the remaining unamortized deferred financing costs associated with the approximately three years remaining on the old senior credit agreement

o sales in our orthopedic businesses grew to million in from million in adjusted for constant foreign currency exchange rates  orthopedic sales growth in would have been approximately compared with  as the value of the canadian dollar and certain european currencies weakened in comparison with the dollar 
o arthroscopy sales  which represented approximately of total orthopedic revenues  grew in to million from million in  on strength in sales of disposable products and video equipment 
o powered surgical instrument sales  which represented approximately of total orthopedic revenues  grew to million in from million in we believe the weakness in sales in the powered surgical instrument product line was a result of our aging battery powered product offering which has been replaced by our new powerpro r battery powered instrument product line  as we describe above 
o patient care sales for were million  a increase from million in  as modest increases in sales of our ecg and other patient care product lines more than offset declines in sales of surgical suction product lines which occurred as a result of significant competition and pricing pressures 
o electrosurgery sales for were million  an increase of from million in  driven by increases in electrosurgical pencil and other disposable product sales 
o endoscopy sales for were million  an increase of from million in excluding the impact of the imagyn acquisitions in november and july  as described in note to our consolidated financial statements  the increase in endoscopy sales was approximately 
cost of sales increased to million in compared to million in  primarily as a result of the increased sales volumes described above 
as discussed in notes and to our consolidated financial statements  during  we incurred various non recurring charges in connection with the july imagyn acquisition 
these costs were primarily related to the transition in manufacturing of the imagyn product lines from imagyn s richland  michigan facility to our manufacturing plants in utica  new york 
such costs totaled approximately million and are included in cost of sales 
excluding the impact of these non recurring expenses  cost of sales for was million 
gross margin percentage for  excluding the imagyn related charges  was  a slight improvement as a result of increased sales volumes  compared with in including the imagyn related charges  gross margin percentage for was selling and administrative expenses increased to million in as compared to million in as a percentage of sales  selling and administrative expenses totaled in compared to in excluding a non recurring severance charge of million recorded in related to the restructuring of our orthopedic direct sales force  as described in note to our consolidated financial statements  selling and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales were in this restructuring involved replacing our orthopedic direct sales force with non stocking exclusive sales agent groups in certain geographic regions of the united states 
this plan resulted in greater sales force coverage in the affected geographic regions 
the increase in selling and administrative expense in as compared to is a result of higher commission and other costs in as compared to associated with the change to exclusive sales agent groups as well as increased spending on sales and marketing programs 
research and development expense totaled million in  consistent with million in as a percentage of sales  research and development expense decreased to in compared to in  as a result of higher sales levels 
our research and development efforts are focused primarily on new product development in the orthopedic product lines 
interest expense in was million compared to million in the decrease in interest expense is primarily a result of lower weighted average interest rates on our borrowings outstanding which have declined to at december  as compared to at december  liquidity and capital resources cash generated from our operations and borrowings under our revolving credit facility have traditionally provided the working capital for our operations  debt service under our credit facility and the funding of our capital expenditures 
in addition  we have used term borrowings  including o borrowings under our senior credit agreement  o senior subordinated notes issued to refinance borrowings under our senior credit agreement  in the case of the acquisition of linvatec corporation in  o borrowings under separate loan facilities  in the case of real property acquisitions  to finance our acquisitions 
on may   we completed a public offering of million shares of our common stock 
net proceeds to the company related to the sale of the shares approximated million and were used to reduce indebtedness under our former senior credit agreement 
we expect to continue to use cash flow from our operations and borrowings under our revolving credit facility to finance our operations  our debt service under our new senior credit facility and term borrowings and the funding of our capital expenditures 
during  we entered into a new million senior credit agreement the new senior credit agreement 
the new senior credit agreement consists of a million revolving credit facility and a million term loan 
the proceeds of the term loan portion of the new senior credit agreement were used to eliminate the term loans and borrowings on the revolving credit facility under the previously existing senior credit agreement the former senior credit agreement 
the new senior credit agreement calls for both components to extend for approximately five years  with the revolving credit facility terminating on august  and the term loan expiring on december  the term loan portion of the facility can be extended an additional two years  provided our currently outstanding million in senior subordinated notes are refinanced or repaid by december  the scheduled principal payments on the term loan portion of the new senior credit agreement are million annually with the remaining balance outstanding due and payable on december  we may also be required  under certain circumstances  to make additional principal payments based on excess cash flow as defined in the new senior credit agreement 
we are not required to make an excess cash flow payment based on the application of these tests to interest rates on the term loan and revolving credit facility components of the new senior credit agreement are libor plus basis points and libor plus basis points  respectively  or an alternative base interest rate 
the weighted average interest rates at december  on the term loan and revolving credit facility were and  respectively 
in addition  we are obligated to pay a fee of 
per annum on the unused portion of the revolving credit facility million at december  the new senior credit agreement is collateralized by substantially all of our personal property and assets  except for our accounts receivable and related rights which are pledged in connection with our accounts receivable sales agreement 
the new senior credit agreement contains covenants and restrictions which  among other things  require maintenance of certain working capital levels and financial ratios  prohibit dividend payments and restrict the incurrence of certain indebtedness and other activities  including acquisitions and dispositions 
the new senior credit agreement contains a material adverse effect clause that could limit our ability to access additional funding under our senior credit agreement should a material adverse change in our business occur 
we are also required  under certain circumstances  to make mandatory prepayments from net cash proceeds from any issue of equity and asset sales 
the senior subordinated notes the notes are in aggregate principal amount of million  have a maturity date of march  and bear interest at per annum which is payable semi annually 
the notes are redeemable for cash at anytime on or after march   at our option  in whole or in part  at the redemption prices set forth therein  plus accrued and unpaid interest to the date of redemption 
on march   we served notice to the trustee for the notes that we would redeem million par value of the notes  on may   at the redemption price of  for a total redemption price of million  plus accrued and unpaid interest 
we intend to redeem the notes through borrowings under our revolving credit facility 
the premium paid on the notes will be recorded as a charge to operating income in the second quarter of we used term loans to purchase the property in largo  florida utilized by our linvatec subsidiary 
the term loans consist of a class a note bearing interest at per annum with semiannual payments of principal and interest through september  a class c note bearing interest at per annum compounded semiannually through june  after which semiannual payments of principal and interest will commence  continuing through june and a seller financed note bearing interest at per annum with monthly payments of principal and interest through july the principal balances outstanding on the class a note  class c note and seller financed note aggregate million  million and million  respectively  at december  our net working capital position was million at december  as compared to million at december  included in net working capital at december  was million owed on our revolving credit facility which was due to expire on december  as discussed above  during  we entered into a new million senior credit agreement 
the proceeds of the new senior credit agreement were used to eliminate the existing term loans and borrowings on the revolving credit facility under the former senior credit agreement 
accordingly  balances outstanding on the former revolving credit facility have been reclassified from current to long term obligations 
we have a five year accounts receivable sales agreement pursuant to which we and certain of our subsidiaries sell on an ongoing basis certain accounts receivable to conmed receivables corporation  crc  a consolidated wholly owned special purpose subsidiary of conmed corporation 
crc may in turn sell up to an aggregate million undivided percentage ownership interest in such receivables the asset interest to a commercial paper conduit the conduit purchaser 
the conduit purchaser s share of collections on accounts receivable are calculated as defined in the accounts receivable sales agreement 
effectively  collections on the pool of receivables flow first to the conduit purchaser and then to crc 
to the extent that the conduit purchaser s share of collections were less than the amount of the conduit purchaser s asset interest  there is no recourse to conmed or crc for such shortfall 
for receivables that have been sold  conmed corporation and its subsidiaries retain collection and administrative responsibilities as agent for the conduit purchaser 
as of december  and  the undivided percentage ownership interest in receivables sold by crc to the conduit purchaser aggregated million and million  respectively  which has been accounted for as a sale and reflected in the balance sheet as a reduction in accounts receivable 
there are certain statistical ratios  primarily related to sales dilution and losses on accounts receivable  which must be calculated and maintained on the pool of receivables in order to continue selling to the conduit purchaser 
the pool of receivables is in full compliance with these ratios 
management believes that additional accounts receivable arising in the normal course of business will be of sufficient quality and quantity to qualify for sale under the accounts receivable sales agreement 
in the event that new accounts receivable arising in the normal course of business do not qualify for sale  then collections on sold receivables will flow to the conduit purchaser rather than being used to fund new receivable purchases 
if this were to occur  we would need to access an alternate source of working capital  such as our million revolving credit facility 
our accounts receivable sales agreement also requires us to enter into a liquidity agreement with certain banks under which the banks agree to commit to fund the conduit s purchase of our accounts receivable in the event that the conduit is unable to fund such purchases through the sale of commercial paper 
these liquidity agreements are typically for a period of days which requires us to renew our liquidity agreement on an annual basis 
in the event we were unable to renew our liquidity agreement  we would need to access an alternate source of working capital  such as our million revolving credit facility 
net cash provided by operations  which we also refer to as operating cash flow  was million in compared to million in excluding the effects of the sale of accounts receivable  operating cash flow increased to million in compared to million in in reconciling net income to operating cash flow  operating cash flow in was positively impacted by depreciation  amortization and increases in accounts payable  income taxes payable and deferred income taxes and negatively impacted primarily by increases in accounts receivable and inventory and decreases in accrued compensation and accrued interest 
the increases in accounts receivable and inventory are primarily related to an increase in sales 
the increases in accounts payable  income taxes payable and deferred income taxes and decreases in accrued compensation and interest are primarily related to the timing of the payment of these liabilities 
capital expenditures in were million 
these capital expenditures represent the ongoing capital investment requirements of our business and are expected to continue at approximately this same rate annually 
net cash used by investing activities in also included million related to the purchase of several businesses as discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements 
financing activities in consist primarily of the completion of a public offering of million shares of our common stock and the completion of a new million senior credit facility as discussed above 
the million in proceeds from the stock offering were used to repay term loans under our former senior credit agreement 
net repayments on our debt as a result of the stock offering and cash generated from operations totaled million in concurrent with the stock offering  we repurchased for million from bristol myers squibb company a warrant exercisable for million shares of our common stock 
proceeds from the exercise of stock options totaled million in on january   we entered into an agreement to acquire bionx implants  inc the bionx acquisition in a cash transaction valuing bionx at per share 
we completed the acquisition on march   paying million in cash which we financed through borrowings under our revolving credit facility 
on march   we entered into an agreement with bristol myers squibb company bms and zimmer  inc  zimmer to settle a contractual dispute related to the sale by bms and its then subsidiary  zimmer  of linvatec corporation to conmed corporation 
as a result of the agreement  bms has paid us million in cash  which will be recorded as a gain to operating income in the first quarter of net of legal costs 
on march   we agreed to settle a patent infringement case filed by ludlow corporation  a subsidiary of tyco international ltd 
in return for a one time million payment  conmed has been granted a nonexclusive license to the disputed patents used to manufacture the gels used in certain of our ecg product lines 
accordingly  we recorded a charge to income in the fourth quarter of for the million plus legal costs of approximately 
million 
management believes that cash generated from operations  our current cash resources and funds available under our new senior credit agreement will provide sufficient liquidity to ensure continued working capital for operations  debt service and funding of capital expenditures in the foreseeable future 
contractual obligations there were no capital lease obligations or unconditional purchase obligations as of december  the following table summarizes our contractual obligations related to operating leases and long term debt as of december  amounts in thousands thereafter long term debt       operating lease obligations       total contractual cash obligations       stock based compensation we have reserved shares of common stock issuance to employees and directors under four shareholder approved stock option plans 
the exercise price on all outstanding options is equal to the quoted fair market value of the stock at the date of grant 
stock options are non transferable other than on death and generally become exercisable over a five year period from date of grant and expire ten years from date of grant 
new accounting pronouncements in august  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  which addresses financial accounting and reporting for the impairment of long lived assets to be held and used and for long lived assets to be disposed of 
this statement supersedes sfas  accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of 
sfas retains the fundamental provisions of statement for a recognition and measurement of the impairment of long lived assets to be held and used  and b measurement of long lived assets to be disposed of by sale

 and technical corrections  which updates  clarifies  and simplifies certain existing accounting pronouncements beginning at various dates in and this statement rescinds sfas and sfas  which required net gains or losses from the extinguishment of debt to be classified as an extraordinary item in the income statement 
these gains and losses will now be classified as extraordinary only if they meet the criteria for such classification as outlined in accounting principles board apb opinion  which allows for extraordinary treatment if the item is material and both unusual and infrequent in nature 
we will adopt this pronouncement during as a result we expect to reclassify the extraordinary loss recognized in the third quarter of related to the refinancing of debt to ordinary income in the annual and interim financial statements 
in july  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities  which addresses financial accounting and reporting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities

eitf  recognition of customer relationship intangible assets acquired in a business combination which addresses certain customer related intangible assets acquired in a business combination in accordance with sfas no  business combinations 
sfas requires that an identifiable intangible asset acquired in a business combination be recorded apart from goodwill 
eitf requires a customer related intangible asset acquired in a business combination to be recorded apart from goodwill and amortized over its estimated useful life 
this eitf is to be applied to all business combinations consummated after october  we are reviewing the effect of eitf on the accounting for our acquisitions during the fourth quarter of the existing customer relationship intangible asset recorded by the company will continue to be accounted for as a separate indentifiable intangible asset subject to amortization 
in november  fasb interpretation fin no 
 guarantor s accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees  including indirect guarantees of indebtedness of others was issued 
the interpretation provides guidance on the guarantor s accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees  including indirect guarantees of indebtedness of others 
we have adopted the disclosure requirements of the interpretation as of december  the accounting guidelines are applicable to guarantees issued after december  and require that we record a liability for the fair value of such guarantees in the balance sheet 
we are reviewing fin to determine its impact  if any  on future reporting periods  and do not currently anticipate any material accounting impact on our financial condition or results of operations 
in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure  which provides alternative methods of transition for a voluntary change to the fair value based method of accounting for stock based employee compensation

to determine its impact  if any  on future reporting periods  and do not currently anticipate any material accounting or disclosure requirement under the provisions of the interpretation 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our principal market risks involve foreign currency exchange rates  interest rates and credit risk 
foreign currency risk we manufacture our products primarily in the united states and distribute our products throughout the world 
as a result  our financial results could be significantly affected by factors such as changes in foreign currency exchange rates or weak economic conditions in foreign markets 
as of december   we have not entered into any forward foreign currency exchange contracts to hedge the effect of foreign currency exchange fluctuations 
we have mitigated and will continue to mitigate our foreign currency exposure by transacting the majority of our foreign sales in united states dollars 
during  changes in foreign currency exchange rates increased our sales and income before income taxes by approximately million 
we will continue to monitor and evaluate our foreign currency exposure and the need to enter into a forward foreign currency exchange contract or other hedging arrangement 
interest rate risk our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates to our borrowings 
interest rate swaps  a form of derivative  are used to manage interest rate risk 
as of december  we had entered into an interest rate swap with a million notional amount expiring in june which converted million of the approximate million of floating rate borrowings under our credit facility into fixed rate borrowings with a base interest rate of 
we amended this swap effective february  to lower the base rate on the million in floating rate borrowings to and extend the expiration date to june if market interest rates for similar borrowings average more in than they did in  our interest expense  after considering the effects of our interest rate swap  would increase  and income before income taxes would decrease by million 
comparatively  if market interest rates averaged less in than they did during  our interest expense  after considering the effects of our interest rate swap  would decrease  and income before income taxes would increase by million 
these amounts are determined by considering the impact of hypothetical interest rates on our borrowing cost and interest rate swap agreement and does not consider any actions by management to mitigate our exposure to such a change 
credit risk a substantial portion of our accounts receivable are due from hospitals and other healthcare providers 
we generally do not receive collateral for these receivables 
although the concentration of these receivables with customers in a similar industry poses a risk of non collection  we believe this risk is mitigated somewhat by the large number and geographic dispersion of these customers and by frequent monitoring of the creditworthiness of the customers to whom credit is granted in the normal course of business 
exposure to credit risk is controlled through credit approvals  credit limits and monitoring procedures  and we believe that reserves for losses are adequate 
there is no significant net exposure due to any individual customer or other major concentration of credit risk
