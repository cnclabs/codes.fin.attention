item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with item selected financial data and our consolidated financial statements and related notes contained in this annual report on form k 
references contained herein to  and mean the fiscal years ended december   december  and january  respectively 
general as of december   we operated high end  high volume restaurants in the united states 
we believe that the particularly large size of the markets we entered warranted investment in restaurants with seating capacities ranging from to in march  we opened a seat smith wollensky in dallas  texas 
we expect to open another smith wollensky restaurant in the fourth quarter of in houston  texas 
we expect the restaurant in houston  texas to have approximately seats on two levels 
although we expect to open two new smith wollensky restaurants in and two to three per year starting in  we plan to move ahead cautiously with our future expansion as management evaluates and monitors economic and security conditions 
we expect additional locations to have seating capacities ranging from to seats  but would consider locations with larger seating capacities where appropriate 
we believe these new restaurants will require  on average  a total cash investment of million to million net of landlord contributions and excluding pre opening expenses 
this range assumes that the property on which the new unit is located is being leased 
as a result of our recent expansion  period to period comparisons of our financial results may not be meaningful 
when a new restaurant opens  we typically incur higher than normal levels of food and labor costs as a percentage of sales during the first year of its operation 
average sales for our nine owned units open for all of were million 
in calculating comparable restaurant sales  we introduce a restaurant into our comparable restaurant base once it has been in operation for months 
pursuant to management contracts and arrangements  we operate  but do not own  the original smith wollensky  maloney porcelli  the post house and onecps restaurants in new york and the mrs 
parks tavern in chicago 
the park avenue caf in chicago was closed by its owner in december owned restaurant sales include gross sales less sales taxes and other discounts

restaurant operating expenses include operating supplies  utilities  maintenance and repairs and other operating expenses 
occupancy and related expenses include rent  real estate taxes and other occupancy costs

these fees are based on a percentage of sales from the managed units  ranging from to 
management fee income also includes fees from maloney porcelli equal to of the unit s net operating cash flow generated during each fiscal year  provided that the maloney porcelli owner receives a minimum amount of operating cash flow per year ranging from  to  we had been receiving a management fee of of restaurant sales for the park avenue caf and mrs 
parks tavern restaurants in chicago and a share of the profits for managing the food and beverage service for the doubletree hotel in chicago 
during december  the owners of the park avenue caf in chicago closed the restaurant and discontinued our requirement to provide other food and beverage department services for the doubletree hotel in chicago 
as a result we are no longer receiving the fees described above 
we are currently negotiating a termination of the sub management agreement and structuring a new management arrangement with chicago hsr limited partnership and doubletree partners  and we anticipate that we will continue to manage mrs 
parks tavern for an annual fee of  management fee income from onecps is equal to of the restaurant s operating cash flows  as reduced by the repayment of project costs and working capital contributions 
after all the project costs and working capital contributions have been repaid  the fee will increase to of the restaurant s operating cash flows 
general and administrative expenses include all corporate and administrative functions that support existing owned and managed operations and provide infrastructure to facilitate our growth 
general and administrative expenses are comprised of management  supervisory and staff salaries and employee benefits  travel costs  information systems  training costs  corporate rent  corporate insurance and professional and consulting fees 
pre opening costs incurred in connection with the opening of new restaurants are expensed as incurred and are included in general and administrative expenses 
general and administrative expenses also include the depreciation of corporate level property and equipment and the amortization of corporate intangible assets  such as goodwill  licensing agreements and management contracts 
royalty expense represents fees paid pursuant to a licensing agreement with st 
james associates  based upon of sales for restaurants utilizing the smith wollensky name 
wherever we refer to a particular year  we refer to our or week fiscal year ending on the monday nearest december  unless otherwise noted 
fiscal years ended december   december  and january  each consisted of week periods 
critical accounting policies and estimates the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements require us to make significant estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates and assumptions  including those related to revenue recognition  allowance for doubtful accounts  valuation of inventories  valuation of long lived assets  goodwill and other intangible assets  income taxes  income tax valuation allowances and legal proceedings 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that can not readily be determined from other sources 
there can be no assurance that actual results will not differ from those estimates 
we believe the following is a summary of our critical accounting policies revenue recognition sales from owned restaurants are recognized as revenue at the point of the delivery of meals and services 
management fee income is recognized as the related management fee is earned pursuant to the respective agreements 
allowance for doubtful accounts substantially all of our accounts receivable are due from companies or individuals with good historical track records of payment 
accounts receivable are reduced by an allowance for amounts that may become uncollectible in the future 
such allowance is established through a charge to the provision for bad debt expenses 
we increased our allowance for doubtful accounts by  from to our owned restaurant sales and income derived from managed restaurant sales decreased significantly due to a general economic slowdown in the new york metropolitan area and across the country at the time of the write off  as well as from a disruption of our business resulting from the tragic events of september  the terrorist event and its subsequent impact on the new york and washington  dc area had an effect on our ability to collect certain accounts receivable 
those receivables included both an amount receivable under our management agreement to operate and manage one of our properties  as well as certain house accounts that customers had at our various restaurants 
the increase consisted of a  reserve in connection with the expected collections of the receivable we had relating to our management contract and a  net increase for additional uncollectible house accounts determined by conducting a specific review of major account balances and by applying statistical experience factors to the various aging categories of receivable balances 
we decreased the allowance for doubtful accounts by  from to the decrease consisted of a direct write off of the  reserve relating to our management contract  partially offset by a  net increase for additional uncollectible house accounts 
long lived assets we review long lived assets to be held and used or to be disposed of for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by restaurant comparing the carrying amount of the restaurant s assets to undiscounted future net cash flows expected to be generated by such assets 
we limit assumptions about such factors as sales and margin improvements to those that are supportable based upon our plans for the unit and actual results at comparable restaurants 
if such assets are considered to be impaired  the impairment to be recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceeds the fair value of the assets 
fair value would be calculated on a discounted cash flow basis 
goodwill goodwill represents the excess of fair value of certain reporting units acquired in the formation of the company over the book value of those reporting units identifiable net assets 
goodwill is tested for impairment at least annually in accordance with the provisions of sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
sfas no 
also requires that intangibles assets with estimable useful lives be amortized over their respective estimated useful lives to their estimated residual values  and reviewed for impairment in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
we assess the recoverability of goodwill through a fair value evaluation performed for each reporting unit that has goodwill 
the fair value valuation is calculated using various methods  including an analysis based on projected discounted future operating cash flows of each reporting unit using a discount rate reflecting our average cost of funds 
we limit assumptions about such factors as sales and margin improvements to those that are supportable based upon our plans for the unit and actual results at comparable restaurants 
the assessment of the recoverability of goodwill will be impacted if estimated future operating cash flows are negatively modified by us as a result of changes in economic conditions  significant events that occur or other factors arising after the preparation of any previous analysis 
we recorded an impairment of goodwill of  during related to our mrs 
parks management company reporting unit 
this impairment related to lower than anticipated future cash flow for us from the closing by the hotel owner of the park avenue caf restaurant in chicago 
for the remainder of our reporting units with goodwill  the fair value is in excess of the recorded carrying value 
the net carrying value of goodwill as of december  and december  was million and million  respectively 
other intangible assets we review other intangible assets  which include costs attributable to a sale and licensing agreement and the cost of the acquisition of management contracts  for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable 
recoverability of our intangible assets will be assessed by comparing the carrying amount of the asset to the undiscounted expected net cash flows to be generated by such assets 
an intangible asset would be considered impaired if the sum of undiscounted future cash flows is less than the book value of the assets generating those cash flows 
we limit assumptions about such factors as sales and margin improvements to those that are supportable based upon our plans for the unit and actual results at comparable restaurants 
if intangible assets are considered to be impaired  the impairment to be recognized will be measured by the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the fair value of the assets 
fair value would be calculated on a discounted cash flow basis 
the assessment of the recoverability of these intangible assets will be impacted if estimated future operating cash flows are negatively modified by us as a result of changes in economic conditions  significant events that occur or other factors arising after the preparation of any previous analysis 
during  we determined that the carrying amount of the management contract and receivable from the onecps restaurant was not recoverable and an impairment had occurred 
we recorded a one time charge for investment in managed restaurants of  in the third quarter of  which consisted of a  charge against the net investment in the management contract and a  charge against the receivable 
for the remainder of our other intangible assets  the fair value is in excess of the recorded carrying value 
the net carrying value of these intangible assets as of december  and december  was million and million respectively 
artwork we occasionally purchase artwork and antiques for display in our restaurants 
we do not depreciate artwork and antiques since these assets have cultural  aesthetic or historical value that is worth preserving perpetually and we have the ability and intent to protect and preserve these assets 
such assets are recorded at cost and are included in other assets in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets 
self insurance liability we are self insured for our employee health program 
we maintain stop loss insurance to limit our total exposure and individual claims 
the liability associated with this program is based on our estimate of the ultimate costs to be incurred to settle known claims and claims incurred but not reported as of the balance sheet date 
our estimated liability is not discounted and is based on a number of assumptions and factors  including historical medical claim patterns and known economic conditions 
if actual trends  including the severity or frequency of claims  differ from our estimates  our financial results could be impacted 
however  we believe that a change in our current accrual requirement of or less would cause an immaterial change to our financial results 
legal proceedings we are involved in various claims and legal actions  the outcomes of which are not within our complete control and may not be known for prolonged periods of time 
in some actions  the claimants seek damages  which  if granted  would require significant expenditures 
we record a liability in our consolidated financial statements when a loss is known or considered probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated 
if the reasonable estimate of a known or probable loss is a range  and no amount within the range is a better estimate  the minimum amount of the range is accrued 
if a loss is not probable or cannot be reasonably estimated  a liability is not recorded in the consolidated financial statements 
income taxes and income tax valuation allowances we estimate certain components of our provision for income taxes 
these estimates include  but are not limited to  effective state and local income tax rates and estimates related to depreciation expense allowable for tax purposes 
our estimates are made based on the best available information at the time that we prepare the provision 
we usually file our income tax returns several months after our fiscal year end 
all tax returns are subject to audit by federal and state governments  usually years after the returns are filed and could be subject to differing interpretations of the tax laws 
at december   we have recorded a valuation allowance of million to reduce our net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards of million and other timing differences of million to an amount that will more likely than not be realized 
these net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards exist in federal and certain state jurisdictions and have varying carryforward periods and restrictions on usage 
the estimation of future taxable income for federal and state purposes and our resulting ability to utilize net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards can significantly change based on future events and operating results 
thus  recorded valuation allowances may be subject to material future changes

owned restaurant sales increased million  or  to million in from million in the increase in restaurant sales was due to million in sales relating to the opening of the smith wollensky unit in columbus  ohio combined with a million  or  net increase in sales for our comparable owned units open for these entire periods 
this was partially offset by a decrease in sales of  from the maloney porcelli unit in washington  dc  which closed in january the increase in comparable owned unit sales was due in part to a net increase in sales of million from our owned smith wollensky units open for the entire period and  to a lesser extent  an increase in sales of  from our three owned new york units 
the improvement is a result of a modest increase in both tourist and business travel and in banquet sales as compared to  which included the tragic events of september  and the related aftermath  and limited price increases in the last part of the fourth quarter in both years 
food and beverage costs 
food and beverage costs increased million to million in from million in this increase was primarily due to the food and beverage costs relating to the opening of the smith wollensky unit in columbus  ohio 
food and beverage costs as a percentage of owned restaurant sales decreased to in from in  primarily due to lower beef and seafood costs in the first three quarters of combined with the continued effort to buy commodities in volume  and continued cost efficiencies at the units 
we incurred higher beef and seafood costs in the fourth quarter of and we anticipate these higher costs to continue through the beginning of these improvements were partially offset by the new smith wollensky unit in columbus  ohio  which experienced higher than normal food and beverage costs as a percentage of sales as result of initial startup inefficiencies and a lower revenue base 
it is common for new restaurants to experience this in the first six months of operations 
generally  as the unit matures and revenues increase  operating efficiency is expected to improve and the food and beverage costs as a percentage of sales for that unit are expected to decrease 
salaries and related benefits 
salaries and related benefits increased million to million in from million in this increase was primarily due to the salaries and related benefits relating to the opening of the smith wollensky unit in columbus  ohio and  to a lesser extent  the additional personnel required to service the increase in volume at the units open for the entire period and an increase in the cost per employee of health insurance 
salaries and related benefits as a percentage of owned restaurant sales decreased to in from in the decrease in salaries and related benefits as a percentage of owned restaurant sales was primarily due to the leveraging effect of sales increases on the fixed portion of restaurant salaries and related benefits 
this decrease was partially offset by the additional staffing required at the new smith wollensky unit in columbus  ohio during the first six months of operations 
generally  as the unit matures  we expect that staffing will be reduced through efficiencies and salaries and related benefits as a percentage of sales for that unit will decrease due to the lower staffing requirement and higher revenue base 
restaurant operating expenses 
restaurant operating expenses increased million to million in from million in restaurant operating expenses as a percentage of owned restaurant sales increased to for from in primarily due to the opening of the smith wollensky unit in columbus  ohio and  to a lesser extent  an increase in operating supplies and repair and maintenance expenditures at the units open the entire period 
this increase was partially offset by an insurance claim in for one of our units 
occupancy and related expenses 
occupancy and related expenses increased  to million in from million in occupancy and related expenses as a percentage of owned restaurant sales increased to in from in primarily due to the rent associated with the new smith wollensky unit in columbus  ohio  as well as a one time payment resulting from an assessment of property taxes for one of our units combined with a negotiated increase for additional space at another unit and a non recurring credit for percentage of sales rent and common area maintenance credit at another location in marketing and promotional expenses 
marketing and promotional expenses decreased to million in from million in marketing and promotional expenses as a percentage of owned restaurant sales decreased to in from in  primarily due to a decrease in print advertisements and a reduction in advertising rates 
this decrease was partially offset by promotional costs related to the opening of the new smith wollensky unit in columbus  ohio and to a general increase in the number of promotional events at the units that were open the entire period 
depreciation and amortization 
depreciation and amortization increased  to million in from million in  primarily due to the increase in depreciable fixed assets relating to the new smith wollensky unit in columbus  ohio and  to a lesser extent  a full year of depreciation on the banquet facility built at the end of at the smith wollensky unit in washington  dc management fee income 
management fee income remained constant at million in and  respectively 
reserve on receivable from managed restaurants 
in  due to the economic uncertainties that existed  we established a reserve of  against receivables related to a managed restaurant we deemed might be uncollectable 
charge for investment in managed restaurant 
the charge for investment in managed restaurants of  in represents the costs associated with an unsettled contractual dispute relating to onecps and management s belief that its initial investment in this managed property is impaired 
general and administrative expenses 
general and administrative expenses increased  to million in from million in general and administrative expenses as a percentage of owned restaurant sales remained constant at in and  respectively 
general and administrative expenses include corporate payroll and other expenditures that benefit both owned and managed units

royalty expense 
royalty expense increased  to million in from  in  primarily due to a net increase in sales from the smith wollensky units of million 
goodwill impairment 
in accordance with sfas no 
goodwill and other intangible assets  which we adopted on january   we are no longer required to amortize goodwill 
instead  we must test goodwill at least annually for impairment 
during the fourth quarter of  we had goodwill impairment of  that related to our mrs 
parks management company reporting unit 
this impairment related to a change in the management contract resulting from the closing by the owner of the park avenue caf restaurant in chicago 
interest expense net of interest income 
interest expense  net of interest income  decreased million to  in from million in  primarily due to the repayment of the senior credit facility  the million senior subordinated note and the million senior revolving credit facility in may provision for income taxes 
the income tax provisions for and represent certain state and local tax rates 
extraordinary loss on early retirement of debt 
for  in connection with the ipo and the retirement of outstanding debt  we recorded an extraordinary charge of  net of  of income tax benefits  to write off the remaining unamortized debt issuance costs and premiums associated with the repayment of our senior credit facility and the repurchase of the senior subordinated note described below 
compared to owned restaurant sales 
owned restaurant sales decreased million  or  to million in from million in the decrease in restaurant sales was due to a million decrease in sales from the maloney porcelli in washington  dc which closed in january  and a million or decrease in sales for our comparable owned units open for these entire periods 
this decrease was primarily a result of a decrease in sales for our three owned new york units  resulting from a significant economic slowdown  and the smith and wollensky restaurant in chicago  whose sales were affected by major road construction that was in close proximity to the property 
to a lesser extent  our other smith wollensky locations were impacted by the national economic slowdown  and a company wide business disruption caused by the tragic events of september  the decrease in total sales for the year was partially offset by the increase in sales of million at the smith wollensky in philadelphia  which opened in june food and beverage costs 
food and beverage costs decreased million to million in from million in food and beverage costs as a percentage of owned restaurant sales decreased to in from in  primarily due to cost efficiencies achieved at the two newer units  the smith wollensky restaurants in washington dc and philadelphia  resulting in food and beverage costs as a percentage of owned restaurant sales that are more comparable to mature unit results  and to a lesser extent  the reduction in costs due to the closing of the maloney porcelli restaurant in washington  dc in january salaries and related benefits 
salaries and related benefits decreased million to million in from million in salaries and related benefits as a percentage of owned restaurant sales decreased to in from in the decrease in salaries and related benefits was due to a million decrease resulting from the closing of the maloney porcelli restaurant in washington  dc in january  from the cost efficiencies achieved at several of the units for and the absence of the additional staffing required to support the june opening of the smith wollensky unit in philadelphia 
restaurant operating expenses 
restaurant operating expenses decreased million to million in from million in the decrease primarily related to the decrease in certain restaurant operating expenses  including operating supplies and credit card charges that related to the reduction in sales volume  and to a lesser extent  the absence of the higher operating costs associated with the opening of two units in this decrease was partially offset by an increase in utility costs in restaurant operating expenses as a percentage of owned restaurant sales increased to for from in as a result of the overall decrease in sales volume 
occupancy and related expenses 
occupancy and related expenses decreased  to million in from million in the decrease was primarily due to the closing of the maloney porcelli restaurant in washington  dc in january and a reduction in percentage of sales rent at certain locations

charge to close owned restaurant 
in the fourth quarter of  we closed the maloney porcelli unit in washington  dc and recorded a pretax charge of million  which included an accrual of  relating to lease exit costs associated with the closure 
in the third quarter of  as a result of the difficult economic conditions  exacerbated by the terrorist acts on september  in new york and washington  dc we concluded that we would not be able to exit our lease obligation by the end of the year 
at that time  we recorded an additional charge of  assuming a new tenant would not be identified until approximately june  prior to the end of  we began negotiations to terminate the remaining lease term with the landlord 
on january   we were able to sign a lease termination agreement with the landlord of the maloney and porcelli property in washington dc reducing the remaining obligation under the terms of the lease to january  we adjusted the accrual to record the remaining costs to be incurred under the terms of the agreement  as well as to write off the remaining value of the property that we were now abandoning 
as a result  we reversed approximately  in the fourth quarter of write off of site development costs 
in  based on the tragic events relating to the september  terrorist attacks and overall economic conditions  management made a decision to terminate a lease that we had entered into to open a new restaurant in boston 
in connection with our decision to terminate the lease  we wrote off the development costs primarily architectural and legal fees associated with a proposed smith wollensky restaurant site 
the write off of costs incurred amounted to management fee income 
management fee income decreased  to million in from million in  primarily due to a general economic slowdown in the new york metropolitan area  and a company wide disruption of business resulting from the tragic events of september  this was partially offset by the increase in fees received relating to the management agreement for onecps that began operating in the third quarter of the economic slowdown and the september attacks caused our managed restaurants to have a decrease in their overall sales volume when comparing to reserve on receivable from managed restaurants 
in  due to the current economic uncertainties  we established a reserve of  against receivables related to a managed restaurant we deem may be uncollectable

the property  which is located in the north dallas area  has an approximately  square foot building with a seating capacity of we opened the new restaurant on march  total capital expenditures are expected to be approximately million in in march we opened a seat smith wollensky in dallas  texas 
we expect to open another smith wollensky restaurant in the fourth quarter of in houston  texas 
we expect the restaurant to have approximately seats on two levels 
although we plan to open two new smith wollensky restaurants in and two to three per year starting in  we plan to move ahead cautiously with our future expansion as management evaluates and monitors economic and security conditions 
we expect additional locations to have seating capacities ranging from to seats  but would consider locations with larger seating capacities where appropriate 
we intend to develop restaurants that will require  on average  a total cash investment of million to million net of landlord contributions and excluding pre opening costs 
this range assumes that the property on which the new unit is located is being leased 
the average cost of opening the last three smith wollensky restaurants  net of landlord contributions  has been approximately million  excluding pre opening costs

in connection with the magnetite financing  we issued magnetite warrants to purchase up to  shares of our common stock at an exercise price of 
per share 
magnetite exercised its warrant on june  in connection with the exercise  we wrote off the remaining unamortized fair value of these warrants to additional paid in capital 
proceeds from our ipo were used to retire this note in in  we assumed certain liabilities from two bankrupt corporations in connection with the acquisition of our lease for the smith wollensky in miami 
pursuant to the terms of the bankruptcy resolution  we are obligated to make quarterly and annual payments over a six year period
