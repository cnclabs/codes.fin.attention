overview we are a leading provider of software that allows users to incorporate documents  images and speech into digital applications 
our products and technologies automate manual processes and help enterprises  professionals and consumers increase productivity  reduce costs and save time 
our products are built upon digital capture and speech technologies  and are sold as solutions into the financial  legal  healthcare  government  telecommunications and automotive industries 
we focus on markets where we can exercise market leadership  where significant barriers to entry exist and where we possess competitive advantages  because of the strength of our technologies  products  channels and business processes 
on december   we acquired substantially all of the speech and language technologies operations of l h 
consideration for the transaction comprised million in cash  a million note that was satisfied on january  and million shares of our common stock having a value of million 
the operations acquired include speech recognition and dictation  text to speech  and voice control technologies 
as of october   we entered into a loan and security agreement with silicon valley bank for a revolving loan in a principal amount not to exceed million  collateralized by substantially all of our personal property  but not our intellectual property 
at the date of this annual report on form k  no amounts have been drawn under the terms of this agreement 
in september of  the company repurchased  shares of common stock from l h holdings usa  inc and lernout hauspie speech products nv collectively  l h and certain other parties at per share for a total consideration of million 
the price per share was based on the greater of or the twenty day trading average beginning august   which was 
these shares represented a portion of the common shares that were issued to l h in connection with the december  acquisition of certain of l h s speech and language technology operations and the march  acquisition of the audiomining assets of l h holdings usa  inc on january   we paid million in full settlement of all principal and accrued interest on the promissory note issued in connection with the l h acquisition on december  additionally  on december   we issued  and  shares of our common stock to lernout hauspie speech products nv and l h holdings usa  inc  respectively 
these shares were issued in accordance with the terms and conditions of the share repurchase agreement entered into with l h in september on january   we completed the acquisition of the speech processing telephony and voice control business units of royal philips electronics nv philips  and related intellectual property  on the terms set forth in the purchase agreement dated october   as amended

the voice control business unit offers a product portfolio including small footprint speech recognition engines for embedded applications such as voice controlled climate  navigation and entertainment features in automotive vehicles  as well as voice dialing for mobile phones 
as consideration for these business units and intellectual property  we paid million euros million in cash at closing  subject to adjustment in accordance with the provisions of the purchase agreement  as amended  and agreed to pay an additional million euros in cash prior to december   issued a million euro note due december  and bearing interest per annum and issued a million three year  zero interest subordinated debenture  convertible at any time at philips option into shares of our common stock at per share 
we anticipate that all related adjustments will be completed no later than december  the technology acquired includes several speech recognition and voice control products 
in conjunction with the acquisition  the business operations were significantly restructured which has caused disruption in the employee and customer base 
the philips operations had consisted of approximately employees of which we only hired based on our prior acquisition experience  we expect revenue and earnings to be weighted toward the second half of the year as we complete the integration of our sales team and re engage philip customers  partners and channels 
additionally  as we complete the philips integration process  we expect to incur a restructuring charge of million to million in the first quarter ended march  on february   the company completed an underwritten public offering of  shares of the company s common stock at per share 
of the total shares sold   shares were sold on behalf of lernout hauspie speech products nv  and l h holdings usa  inc the company sold  common shares and received gross proceeds of million

general we derive our revenue from sales of our software products to customers through distribution partners and value added resellers  royalty revenues from oem partners  license fees from sales of our products to customers and from services  primarily maintenance associated with software license transactions 
cost of revenue consists primarily of material and fulfillment costs  third party royalties  salaries for product support personnel  and engineering costs associated with certain contracts which are accounted for under the percentage of completion method of accounting 
currently  most of our software products are manufactured  packaged and shipped by globalware solutions on a worldwide basis 
we believe that  if necessary  we could transition the services provided by globalware to another third party provider with minimal disruption to our operations 
cost of revenue from amortization of intangible assets includes the amortization of acquired patents and core and completed technology 
research and development expense consists primarily of salary and benefits costs of engineers 
we believe that the development of new products and the enhancement of existing products are essential to our success 
accordingly  we plan to continue to invest in research and development activities 
to date  we have not capitalized any internal development costs as the cost incurred after technological feasibility but before release of product has not been significant 
selling expenses include salaries  commissions  advertising  direct mail  public relations  trade shows  travel and other related sales and marketing expenses 
general and administrative expenses include personnel costs for administration  finance  human resources  information systems and general management  in addition to legal and accounting expenses and other professional services 
we attempt to control selling  general and administrative expense  however  if revenue continues to grow  we expect selling  general and administrative expense to increase to support our growing operations 
in addition  we may increase selling  general and administrative expenses in advance of revenue to support expected future revenue growth in specific product lines or geographic regions 
amortization of goodwill and other intangible assets excludes amortization of acquired patents and core and completed technology which is included in cost of revenue from amortization of intangible assets 
critical accounting policies general the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the dates of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting periods 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates and judgments  including those related to revenue recognition  including estimating valuation allowances specifically sales returns and other allowances  the recoverability of intangible assets  including goodwill  and valuation allowances for deferred tax assets 
actual amounts could differ significantly from these estimates 
we base our estimates and judgments on historical experience and various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities and the amounts of revenue and expenses that are not readily apparent from other sources 
we believe the following critical accounting policies most significantly affect the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations and require our most difficult and subjective judgments 
revenue recognition we derive revenue from the sale of our software products to end users through distribution partners and value added resellers vars  royalties received from oem partners  license fees from sales of our products to end users and from services  primarily maintenance associated with software license transactions 
provided that the fee is fixed or determinable and collection of the receivable is reasonably assured  we generally recognize revenue from sales of our software products upon receipt of evidence of the arrangement and upon product shipment or deployment  except for shipments to a distributor or reseller 
sales of our software products through distributors and value added resellers provide rights of return for as long as the distributors or resellers hold the inventory 
as a result  we recognize revenues from sales to distributors and resellers only when products have been sold by the distributors or resellers to retailers or end users 
title and risk of loss pass to the distributor or reseller upon shipment  at which time the transaction is invoiced and payment is due 
based on reports from distributors and resellers of their inventory balances at the end of each period  we record an allowance against accounts receivable for the sales price of all inventory subject to return 
if we experience significant returns from distributors or resellers  our liquidity may be adversely impacted 
we make an estimate of sales returns by retailers or end users to us directly or through our distributors or resellers based on historical returns experience 
the provision for these estimated returns is recorded as a reduction of revenue at the time that the related revenue is recorded 
historically  we have not experienced significant returns from retailers or end users 
if actual returns differ significantly from our estimates  such differences could have a material impact on our results of operations for the period in which the actual returns become known 
our accounts receivable balance  including accounts receivable from a related party  was million and million at december  and december   respectively 
these balances are net of sales returns and other allowances of million and million and allowances for doubtful accounts of million and million as of december  and december   respectively 
royalty revenue derived from sales to oem customers is recognized when software copies are deployed based upon reports of actual deployments received from oem customers and payment is due 
we may enter into software license agreements that require significant modification of our software 
we recognize revenue with respect to these agreements under the percentage of completion method 
we determine progress toward completion based upon costs incurred to date as compared with total estimated costs at the contract completion date 
if our total costs significantly differ from our estimates  or we incur losses on these contracts  our results of operations may be materially impacted 
we did not have any significant contracts requiring customization or modification of our software at december  in accordance with eitf  accounting for consideration given by a vendor to a customer including a reseller of the vendor s products  we account for amounts paid to customers as a reduction of revenue  unless the consideration relates to an identifiable benefit and the benefit s fair value can be established  in which case we record the consideration as an operating expense 
in order to determine the appropriate classification of the marketing program costs  we review the nature of the program  the documentation supporting the fair value of the program  and whether the programs could be provided independent of the sale of the goods and services 
we evaluate our marketing programs quarterly to determine whether costs meet the criteria for expense classification 
generally  our programs meet the criteria  therefore  we do not report any material costs as a reduction of revenue 
if in the future  the nature of our marketing programs change or could not be provided independent of the sale of the related goods or services it may require reclassification of these programs in our statement of operations 
valuation of long lived and intangible assets and goodwill we have significant long lived tangible and intangible assets and goodwill  which are susceptible to valuation adjustments as a result of changes in various factors or conditions 
the most significant long lived tangible and intangible assets are fixed assets  patents  core technology  and trademarks which are amortized using the straight line method over their estimated useful lives 
the values of intangible assets  with the exception of goodwill  were initially determined by a risk adjusted  discounted cash flow approach 
we assess the potential impairment of identifiable intangible assets and fixed assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
factors we consider important  which could trigger an impairment of such assets  include the following significant underperformance relative to historical or projected future operating results  significant changes in the manner of or use of the acquired assets or the strategy for our overall business  significant negative industry or economic trends  significant decline in our stock price for a sustained period  and a decline in our market capitalization below net book value 
future adverse changes in these or other unforeseeable factors could result in an impairment charge that would impact future results of operations and financial position in the reporting period identified 
effective january   we adopted statement of financial accounting standards no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets or sfas sfas requires  among other things  the discontinuance of goodwill amortization 
the standard also includes provisions for the reassessment of the useful lives of existing recognized intangible assets and the identification of reporting units for purposes of assessing potential future impairments of goodwill 
sfas required us to complete a transitional impairment test of goodwill within six months of the date of adoption 
we have reassessed the useful lives of our existing intangible assets  other than goodwill  and believe that the original useful lives remain appropriate 
in addition  we have determined that we operate in one reporting unit and  therefore  have completed our transitional goodwill impairment test on an enterprise wide level 
based on this analysis  we have determined that goodwill recorded was not impaired  and no impairment charge has been recorded 
we will complete additional goodwill impairment analyses at least annually  or more frequently when events and circumstances occur indicating that the recorded goodwill might be impaired 
we performed the annual assessment during the fourth quarter of and no impact had occurred 
significant judgments and estimates are involved in determining the useful lives of our intangible assets  determining what reporting units exist and assessing when events or circumstances would require an interim impairment analysis of goodwill or other long lived assets to be performed 
changes in events or circumstances  including but not limited to technological advances or competition which could result in shorter useful lives  additional reporting units which may require alternative methods of estimating fair value  or economic or market conditions which may affect previous assumptions and estimates  could have a significant impact on our results of operations or financial position through accelerated amortization expense or impairment charges 
accounting for acquisitions we have completed five significant business acquisitions  including the philips acquisition on january   which have resulted in significant goodwill and other intangible asset balances 
our future business strategy contemplates that we may continue to pursue additional acquisitions in the future 
our accounting for acquisitions involves significant judgments and estimates primarily  but not limited to the fair value of certain forms of consideration  the fair value of acquired intangible assets  which involve projections of future revenues and cash flows  the fair value of other acquired assets and assumed liabilities  including potential contingencies  and the useful lives and  as applicable  the reporting unit  of the assets 
the impact of prior or future acquisitions on our financial position or results of operations may be materially impacted by the change in or initial selection of assumptions and estimates 
additionally  under sfas  we determine the fair value of the reporting unit  for purposes of the first step in our annual goodwill impairment test  based on our stock price 
if prior or future acquisitions are not accretive to our results of operations as expected  or our stock price declines dramatically  we may be required to complete the second step which requires significant judgements and estimates and which may result in material impairment charges in the period in which they are determined 
income taxes at december   we had gross deferred tax assets of million  which have been offset by a full valuation allowance as a result of cumulative historical losses 
our income tax provision reflects state and foreign withholding and income taxes 
we have not incurred any federal income tax provision in the years ended december   or because of the ability to fully utilize our net operating loss carry forwards or because we did not generate taxable income 
a significant portion of our gross deferred tax assets relate to net operating loss carry forwards  the full utilization of which is based on a number of factors  including future profitability  if any  and potential limitations resulting from tax laws 
our income tax provisions and our assessment of the realizability of our deferred tax assets involve significant judgments and estimates 
if we continue to generate taxable income through profitable operations in future years  we will be required to recognize these deferred tax assets through the reduction of the valuation allowance  which would result in a material benefit to our results of operations in the period in which the benefit is determined 
december  compared to december  total revenue total revenue for increased by million or compared to the growth in revenue for the year ended december  was primarily the result of revenue generated from our speech products 
revenue from our speech products was million and million for and  respectively 
the increase in speech revenue was due to the l h acquisition  which occurred in december revenue from our digital capture products was million and million for and  respectively 
the net increase of million in revenue from our digital capture products from was due primarily to an increase of million in sales of digital capture products through the channel network  partially offset by a decrease in revenue of million from xerox  a related party  due to the cancellation of its retail multi function product line in late geographic revenue classification is based on the country in which the sale is invoiced 
revenue for was north america and international  versus north america and international for a number of our oem partners distribute their products throughout the world and do not provide us with the geographical dispersion of their products 
we believe that  if we were provided with this information  our geographical revenue classification would indicate a higher international percentage 
based on an estimate that factors our oem partners geographical revenue mix to our revenues generated from these oem partners  revenue for was approximately north america and international versus north america and international for the increase in our international revenue percentage for was driven primarily from europe and asia and was the result of increased sales and marketing efforts and additional resellers 
the following table presents the breakdown of our total revenue by distribution channel year ended december  var retail direct oem the increase in oem  and the corresponding decrease in var retail  as a percent of revenue  for as compared to was due to the addition of speech products in oems represent a higher percentage of revenue for our speech products than for our digital capture products 
effective january   we implemented eitf  accounting for consideration given by a vendor to a customer including a reseller of the vendor s products 
the implementation resulted in a million reduction to total revenue and a corresponding reduction of selling  general and administrative expense for additionally  it resulted in the reclassification of million from selling  general and administrative expense to net revenue for cost of revenue cost of revenue for was million or of revenue  compared to million or for the increase in cost of revenue in absolute dollars for was directly attributable to the increase in the volume of product sales to var retail customers as well as increased embedded text to speech revenue which bears a higher cost of revenue than our traditional software products 
the decrease in cost of revenue as a percentage of total revenue for  as compared to  was due to lower supply chain logistics and fulfillment costs  partially offset by the higher cost of embedded text to speech revenue 
cost of revenue from amortization of intangible assets cost of revenue from amortization of intangible assets for was million compared to million for the decrease in cost of revenue from amortization of intangible assets of million was due to million of intangible assets that became fully amortized in the first quarter of this reduction was partially offset by million of amortization recorded for the acquired l h and audiomining assets 
research and development expense research and development costs for were million or of total revenue  compared to million or of total revenue for the increase in research and development expenses of million for was primarily the result of increased headcount of employees associated with the l h acquisition 
cost savings from the restructuring actions taken in for was approximately million 
due to our acquisition of the core r d of philips speech business units  we expect research and development expenses as a percentage of revenue to increase over initially  but decline by the end of the year  as revenue from the philips products grow and research and development spending is held flat  ending the year slightly better than as a percentage of revenue 
selling  general and administrative expense selling  general and administrative expense for was million or of total revenue  compared to million or for the increase in selling  general and administrative expense in absolute dollars for was primarily the result of increased headcount costs of million resulting from the addition of employees  primarily in sales and marketing  as well as million of increased marketing programs in support of the higher revenue 
these increases were largely attributable to the l h acquisition and expanded focus on international sales and marketing 
as a percentage of revenue  we expect selling  general and administrative expenses to remain consistent on an annual basis with even after consideration of the philips acquisition 
amortization of goodwill and other intangible assets amortization of goodwill and other intangible assets for was million compared to million for the decrease in amortization expense is directly attributable to the adoption of sfas  as a result of which we ceased the amortization of goodwill and acquired workforce of approximately million per quarter 
additionally  amortization expense decreased million in  due to intangible assets that became fully amortized in the first quarter of this reduction was partially offset by additional amortization of approximately million for from the l h and audiomining acquisitions 
restructuring and other charges  net in january  we announced  and in march completed  a restructuring plan to consolidate facilities  worldwide sales organizations  research and development teams and other personnel following the l h acquisition on december  as a result  we exited certain facilities in both north america and europe  eliminating employee positions  including in research and development and in selling  general and administrative functions 
in the first quarter of  we recorded a restructuring charge in the amount of million for severance payments to these employees and a charge of million for certain termination fees to be incurred as a result of exiting the facilities  including the write off of previously recorded assembled workforce of million 
during  the company paid a total of million in severance payments  of which million related to the march restructuring and million related to severance paid to the former caere president and ceo  pursuant to a restructuring 
at december   the remaining restructuring accrual from the current and prior restructuring activities amounted to million 
this balance is comprised of million of lease exit costs resulting from the restructuring and million of severance to the former caere president and ceo 
the lease exit costs and severance due to the former caere president and ceo will be paid through january and march  respectively 
income loss from operations as a result of the above factors  income from operations was million for compared with a loss of million for other income expense  net interest income was million and million for and  respectively 
the increase in interest income from to was a result of higher cash and cash equivalent balances  which grew from million at december  to million at december  interest expense consists primarily of interest related to the million note resulting from the acquisition of l h 
interest expense was million and million for and  respectively 
other expense in consists primarily of foreign exchange losses of  other expenses of  partially offset by a gain on the disposal of assets of  other expense in consists primarily of foreign exchange losses of million and the write off of an investment of million recorded under the cost method  which was deemed to be impaired  partially offset by other income of million 
income loss before income taxes income before income taxes was million for  compared with a loss of million for income taxes the provision for income taxes of million for consisted of foreign and state tax provisions of million  offset by a federal tax benefit of million  related to a refund of taxes paid by caere corporation prior to its acquisition by us 
the benefit from income taxes of million for consisted of foreign and state tax provisions of million offset by the state tax benefit of million 
at december   we had federal net operating loss carryforwards of approximately million  of which approximately million relate to tax deductions from stock compensation 
the tax benefit related to the stock compensation  when realized  will be accounted for as additional paid in capital rather than as a reduction of the provision for income tax 
at december  we had federal and state research and development credit carryforwards of approximately million 
the net operating loss and credit carryforwards will expire at various dates through  if not utilized 
utilization of the net operating losses and credits may be subject to a substantial annual limitation due to the ownership change limitations provided by the internal revenue code of and similar state provisions 
the annual limitation may result in the expiration of net operating losses and credits before utilization 
at december   gross deferred tax assets amounted to million 
a full valuation allowance has been provided against the deferred tax assets due to the uncertainty of their realization as a result of our cumulative historical losses 
during  we generated income before income taxes of million 
if we continue to generate taxable income through profitable operations in future years we may be required to recognize these deferred tax assets through the reduction of the valuation allowance which would result in a material benefit to our results of operations in the period in which the benefit is determined 
net income loss as a result of all these factors  net income totaled million for  compared with a net loss of million for december  compared to december  total revenue total revenue of million for increased by million or from the comparable period in the primary factors responsible for this growth include a million revenue increase from our document and pdf conversion product line driven primarily by our release of omnipage which contained significant enhancements over the prior version and secondarily by an increased usage of our document conversion tool kits by software vendors  integrators and in house developers  million revenue increase in our digital paper management product line  also driven by the release of a significantly improved new version of our paperport product  and a million revenue increase driven by a contract with an oem customer 
we also generated additional revenue in the amount of million from our speech products as a result of the l h acquisition on december  north america accounted for and international accounted for of total revenue  versus and  respectively  for the comparable period in the release of international versions for two of our digital capture products and additional sales and marketing resources in europe expanded the market opportunity for our digital capture products  thereby contributing to the revenue growth in europe for the following table presents the breakdown of our total revenue by distribution channel year ended december  var retail direct oem during  our distribution and fulfillment partners  ingram micro and digital river  accounted for and of our total revenue  respectively 
in addition xerox  an oem customer  accounted for of our total revenue 
during  ingram micro  digital river and xerox accounted for  and of our total revenue  respectively 
cost of revenue cost of revenue in was million  or  of revenue compared to million  or  of revenue in the comparable period of the decrease in cost of revenue as a percentage of total revenue from the comparable period in is directly attributed to the consolidation of our worldwide manufacturing fulfillment activities and cost savings initiatives we introduced in the second quarter of this decrease was partially offset by an increase of million in the cost of revenue in the second half of  as a result of costs associated with engineering efforts under an oem contract 
cost of revenue from amortization of intangible assets cost of revenue from amortization of intangible assets for was million compared to million for the same period in the increase in cost of revenue from amortization of intangible assets of million was primarily attributable to a full year in of amortization expense for patents and core and completed technology acquired from caere late in the first quarter of research and development expense research and development costs were million  or  of revenue in compared to million  or  of revenue in the decrease in research and development expense as a percentage of total revenue is a result of million of expenses associated with engineering efforts on an oem contract being charged to cost of revenues as well as increased revenues of million compared to the prior period 
additionally  during  we transferred certain digital capture development activities from los gatos  california to budapest  hungary 
selling  general and administrative expense selling  general and administrative expenses were million  or  of total revenue in compared to million  or  of total revenue for the same period in the absolute dollar decrease in selling  general and administrative expense from the same period in was a result of cost reduction efforts undertaken during the first and second quarters of additionally  we realized a gain of approximately million primarily due to the favorable settlement of investment banking fees associated with the caere acquisition 
the decrease in selling  general and administrative expense as a percentage of revenue from the same period in is a result of the decreased expenses as noted above  the realized gain and increased revenues compared to the prior period 
amortization of goodwill and other intangible assets and acquired in process research and development amortization of goodwill and other intangible assets for was million compared to million for the same period in the increase in amortization of intangible assets of million compared to the same period in resulted from a full months of amortization for the caere acquisition being taken during versus approximately nine months in due to the timing of the caere acquisition which was completed on march  in connection with the caere acquisition  million was charged to operations upon consummation of the acquisition  which represented acquired in process research and development on development projects that had not yet reached technological feasibility and had no alternative future use 
restructuring and other charges  net there were no restructuring or other charges in  compared with approximately million in in connection with the acquisition of caere in the first quarter of  we identified employees of caere whose positions were eliminated upon consummation of the acquisition 
these positions included in research and development  in general and administrative functions  and in sales and marketing 
additionally  the caere president and ceo position was eliminated 
as a result  we established  as part of the purchase price allocation  a restructuring reserve of million for severance payments to employees  and a restructuring reserve of million for severance to the caere former president and ceo  the payments of which will continue through march in june  we implemented a restructuring plan to strategically refocus our business and bring operating expenses in line with net revenues 
as a result  we eliminated employee positions  including in research and development  in general and administrative functions and in support and marketing 
we recorded a restructuring charge in the amount of million for severance payments to these employees and a restructuring charge of million for certain termination fees to be incurred as a result of exiting the los gatos  california facility 
additionally  we wrote off million of net intangible assets acquired as part of the caere acquisition  including the acquired work force of million and the favorable building lease of million  which were impaired as a result of the restructuring action 
at the time of the restructuring  management expected these restructuring actions to reduce operating expenses by approximately million on an annualized basis 
annualized cost savings realized from these actions amounted to million 
for the years ended december  and  we paid million and million  respectively in severance payments related to these restructuring actions 
the remaining severance balance of million primarily relates to severance for the former caere president and ceo and will be paid through march loss from operations as a result of the above factors  loss from operations totaled approximately million in compared to loss from operations of approximately million in other income expense interest income was million and million for and  respectively 
the increase in interest income from to was a result of significantly higher cash and cash equivalent balances  which grew from million at december  to million at december  and short term investments  which were generated from operations 
interest expense consists of interest incurred for borrowings under credit facilities and short term notes 
interest expense was million and million for and  respectively 
the decrease in interest expense from to resulted from the repayment of all bank borrowings  including accrued interest  of million  under the bank credit facility during may other expense in consists primarily of foreign exchange losses of million and the write off of an investment of million recorded under the cost method  which was deemed to be impaired  partially offset by other income of million 
loss before income taxes as a result of the above factors  loss before income taxes was approximately million in compared to a loss before income taxes of approximately million in income taxes the benefit from income taxes of million for the year ended december  reflects a reduction of approximately million in amounts accrued for income taxes upon favorable completion of a state tax audit of caere for and this benefit was offset by tax provisions of million for foreign and state jurisdictions for which net operating losses were limited or for which no net operating loss carryforwards were available

net loss as a result of all these factors  net loss totaled approximately million in  compared to a net loss of approximately million in liquidity and capital resources as of december   we had cash and cash equivalents of million and net working capital of million as compared to million in cash and cash equivalents and net working capital of million at december  net cash provided by operating activities for the fiscal year ended december  was million compared to million for the same period in cash provided by operations in the period came primarily from operating income  net of non cash adjustments  offset primarily by the net impact of higher balances in accounts receivable  prepaid expenses and other assets  and accrued expenses and lower deferred revenue due to the recognition of revenue on a long term contract that was classified as deferred revenue at december   for which cash was collected in a prior period 
the increase in accounts receivable of million at december   as compared to december  was the result of significantly higher revenue  partially offset by improvement in days sales outstanding 
historically  we have not incurred any significant losses on our accounts receivable balances 
net cash used in investing activities for was million compared to million for net cash used in investing activities during the period consisted of million in capital expenditures  which included costs to build out facilities in both north america and europe and million of payments associated with acquisitions

net cash provided by financing activities during the comparable period in included proceeds of million from a private placement of our common stock  proceeds of million from the exercise of stock options partly offset by payments of million to repay in full our prior line of credit and payments of million to repurchase shares of our stock on the open market 
on january   we completed the acquisition of the philips speech processing telephony and voice control business units and related intellectual property on the terms set forth in the purchase agreement dated october   as amended

borrowings under this credit facility will bear interest at the bank s prime rate plus or  depending on our fixed charge coverage ratio  as defined in the loan and security agreement 
the maximum aggregate amount of borrowings outstanding at any one time will be limited to the lesser of million or a borrowing base equal to either or of eligible accounts receivable  as defined in the loan and security agreement depending on our fixed charge coverage ratio 
pursuant to the loan and security agreement  we will be required to maintain various financial and non financial covenants  the most restrictive of which is a quarterly minimum fixed charge coverage ratio of to

we also agreed to register l h s remaining holdings of our common stock in an underwritten public offering 
our agreement to register these shares for l h contained provisions requiring us to issue additional shares to l h if the registration was not completed by certain deadlines 
because we did not meet one of these deadlines  on december   we issued  shares to lernout hauspie speech products nv and  shares to l h holdings usa  inc additionally  since we did not complete the underwritten public offering by january   all of the outstanding principal and accrued interest under the million promissory note  dated december   that we issued in connection with the l h acquisition became immediately due and payable

the underwritten offering of the l h shares was completed on february  and no further payments or issuances are due to l h 
as part of the underwritten offering completed for l h  we sold  shares and raised approximately million in gross proceeds 
after considering offering costs  the estimated net proceeds equaled approximately million 
on march   the company received approximately million of net proceeds from the exercise of the over allotment option of  shares granted to the underwriters as part of the underwritten offering 
the following table outlines our contractual payment obligations as of december  payments due by period contractual within within obligations total year years thereafter in thousands notes payable including interest   operating leases     caere acquisition related costs   total contractual cash obligations     excludes the impact of the philips acquisition 
in connection with the philips acquisition  we agreed to pay million euros in cash prior to december   issued a million euro note due december  and bearing interest per annum and issued a million three year  zero interest subordinated debenture  convertible at any time at philips option into shares of our common stock at per share 
through december   we have not entered into any off balance sheet arrangements or transactions with unconsolidated entities or other persons 
historically and through december  we sustained recurring losses from operations in each reporting period 
we reported net income of approximately million for and had an accumulated deficit of million at december  we believe that operating expense levels  including the integration of the philips acquisition and the anticipated restructuring charge from the philips integration process  in combination with expected future revenues will continue to result in positive cash flows from operations for we also believe that we have the ability to maintain operating expenses at levels commensurate with revenues to maintain positive cash flows from operations 
therefore  we believe that cash flows from future operations in addition to cash on hand and cash available from our credit facility will be sufficient to meet our working capital  investing  financing and contractual obligations  including the debt obligations issued in connection with the philips acquisition  as they become due  for at least the next twelve months 
foreign operations we develop and sell our products throughout the world 
as a result of the caere acquisition in march  the l h acquisition in december and our recent acquisition of certain assets of philips  we significantly increased our presence in europe and added operations in asia 
with our increased international presence in a number of geographic locations and with international revenues projected to increase in  we are exposed to changes in foreign currencies including the euro  japanese yen and the hungarian forint 
changes in the value of the euro or other foreign currencies relative to the value of the united states dollar could adversely affect future revenues and operating results 
we do not generally hedge any of our foreign currency denominated transactions or expected cash flows 
however  in connection with the philips acquisition on january   we entered into a forward hedge in the amount of million to meet our obligation to pay the million euro promissory note issued as part of the acquisition 
recently issued accounting pronouncements on december   the fasb issued fasb statement no 
sfas  accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure  amending fasb statement no 
sfas  accounting for stock based compensation 
this statement amends sfas to provide alternative methods of transition for an entity that voluntarily changes to the fair value based method of accounting for stock based employee compensation 
it also amends the disclosure provisions of that statement to require prominent disclosure about the effects on reported net income of an entity s accounting policy decisions with respect to stock based employee compensation 
finally  sfas amends apb opinion no 
 interim financial reporting  to require disclosure about those effects in interim financial information 
for entities that voluntarily change to the fair value based method of accounting for stock based employee compensation  the transition provisions are effective for fiscal years ending after december  for all other companies  the disclosure provisions and the amendment to apb no 
are effective for interim periods beginning after december  sfas did not have any effect on our financial position  results of operations or cash flows as we have elected to continue to follow the recognition provisions of apb no 
on november   the fasb issued fasb interpretation no 
fin  guarantor s accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees  including indirect guarantees of indebtedness of others  an interpretation of fasb statements no 
  and and rescission of fasb interpretation no 
fin clarifies the requirements of fasb statement no 
 accounting for contingencies sfas  relating to the guarantor s accounting for  and disclosure of  the issuance of certain types of guarantees 
fin requires that upon issuance of a guarantee  the guarantor must recognize a liability for the fair value of the obligation it assumes under that guarantee 
fin covers guarantee contracts that have any of the following four characteristics a contracts that contingently require the guarantor to make payments to the guaranteed party based on changes in an underlying that is related to an asset  a liability  or an equity security of the guaranteed party eg  financial and market value guarantees  b contracts that contingently require the guarantor to make payments to the guaranteed party based on another entity s failure to perform under an obligating agreement performance guarantees  c indemnification agreements that contingently require the indemnifying party guarantor to make payments to the indemnified party guaranteed party based on changes in an underlying that is related to an asset  a liability  or an equity security of the indemnified party  such as an adverse judgment in a lawsuit or the imposition of additional taxes due to either a change in the tax law or an adverse interpretation of the tax law  and d indirect guarantees of the indebtedness of others 
fin specifically excludes certain guarantee contracts from its scope 
additionally  certain guarantees are not subject to fin s provisions for initial recognition and measurement but are subject to its disclosure requirements 
the initial recognition and measurement provisions are effective for guarantees issued or modified after december  we have evaluated the impact of fin on our financial statements and determined that the recognition provision will not have an impact on our financial position or results of operations for in june  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities  or sfas this statement addresses financial accounting and reporting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities and nullifies eitf issue  liability recognition for certain employee termination benefits and other costs to exit an activity including certain costs incurred in a restructuring  or eitf sfas requires that a liability for a cost associated with an exit or disposal activity be recognized when the liability is incurred 
eitf allowed for an exit cost liability to be recognized at the date of an entity s commitment to an exit plan 
sfas also requires that liabilities recorded in connection with exit plans be initially measured at fair value 
the provisions of sfas are effective for exit or disposal activities that are initiated after december   with early adoption encouraged 
we do not expect the adoption of sfas will have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations 
risk factors you should carefully consider the risks described below when evaluating our company 
the risks described below are not the only ones facing us 
additional risks not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also impair our business operations and financial situation 
our business  financial condition and results of operations could be seriously harmed by any of these risks 
our quarterly operating results are subject to fluctuations and seasonality 
if we fail to meet the expectations of securities analysts or investors  our share price may decrease significantly 
our revenue and operating results have fluctuated in the past and may not meet the expectations of securities analysts or investors in the future 
if this occurs  the price of our stock would likely decline 
factors that may cause fluctuations in our operating results include the following slowing sales by our distribution and fulfillment partners to their customers  which may place pressure on these partners to reduce purchases of our products  volume  timing and fulfillment of customer orders  customers delaying their purchase decisions in anticipation of new versions of products  customers delaying  canceling or limiting their purchases as result of the threat or results of terrorism or military actions taken by the united states or its allies  introduction of new products by us or our competitors  seasonality  reduction in the prices of our products in response to competition or market conditions  returns and allowance charges in excess of recorded amounts  timing of significant marketing and sales promotions  increased expenditures incurred pursuing new product or market opportunities  inability to adjust our operating expenses to compensate for shortfalls in revenue against forecast  demand for products  and general economic trends as they affect retail and corporate sales 
due to the foregoing factors  among others  our revenue and operating results are difficult to forecast 
our expense levels are based in significant part on our expectations of future revenue 
therefore  our failure to meet revenue expectations would seriously harm our business  operating results  financial condition and cash flows 
further  an unanticipated decline in revenue for a particular quarter may disproportionately affect our profitability because a relatively small amount of our expenses are intended to vary with our revenue in the short term 
we have a history of losses 
we may incur losses in the future 
we sustained recurring losses from operations in each reporting period through december  we reported net income of approximately million for the fiscal year ended december  and had an accumulated deficit of million at december  if we do not maintain profitability  the market price for our stock may decline  perhaps substantially 
our business could be harmed if we do not successfully manage the integration of the businesses that we acquire  including our purchase of the speech processing telephony and voice control business units from philips 
as part of our business strategy  we have in the past acquired  and expect to continue to acquire  other businesses and technologies 
our recent acquisition of the speech and language technology operations of lernout hauspie speech products nv and certain of its affiliates  including l h holdings usa  inc collectively  l h required substantial integration and management efforts 
our purchase of the speech processing telephony and voice control business units from philips will pose similar challenges 
acquisitions involve a number of risks  including difficulty in transitioning and integrating the operations and personnel of the acquired businesses  potential disruption of our ongoing business and distraction of management  difficulty in incorporating acquired technology and rights into our products and technology  unanticipated expenses and delays in completing acquired development projects and technology integration  management of geographically remote units both in the united states and internationally  impairment of relationships with partners and customers  entering markets or types of businesses in which we have limited experience  and potential loss of key employees of the acquired company 
as a result of these and other risks  we may not realize anticipated benefits from our acquisitions 
any failure to achieve these benefits or failure to successfully integrate acquired businesses and technologies could seriously harm our business 
a large part of our revenue is dependent on continued demand for our products from oem partners 
a significant reduction in oem revenue would seriously harm our business  results of operations  financial condition and stock price 
many of our technologies are licensed to partners that incorporate our technologies into solutions that they sell to their customers 
the commercial success of these licensed products depends to a substantial degree on the efforts of these licensees in developing and marketing products incorporating our technologies 
the integration of our technologies into their products takes significant time  effort and investment  and products incorporating our technologies may never be successfully implemented or marketed by our licensees 
oem revenue represented and of our consolidated revenue for the years ended december  and december   respectively 
one of our partners  xerox corporation  accounted for and of our consolidated revenue during the years ended december  and december   respectively 
our partners are not required to continue to bundle or embed our software  and they may choose the software products of our competitors in addition to  or in place of  our products 
a significant reduction in oem revenue would seriously harm our business  results of operations  financial condition and our stock price 
speech technologies may not achieve widespread acceptance by businesses  which could limit our ability to grow our speech business 
the market for speech technologies is relatively new and rapidly evolving 
our ability to increase revenue in the future depends in large measure on acceptance by both our customers and the end users of speech technologies in general and our products in particular 
the continued development of the market for our current and future speech solutions will also depend on the following factors widespread deployment and acceptance of speech technologies  consumer demand for speech enabled applications  development by third party vendors of applications using speech technologies  and continuous improvement in speech technology 
sales of our speech products would be harmed if the market for speech software does not continue to develop or develops more slowly than we expect  and  consequently  our business could be harmed 
we have grown  and may continue to grow  through acquisitions  which may result in significant intangible assets  dilution of our existing stockholders  use of cash and other risks 
we have made several significant acquisitions over the last two years  have recently completed the purchase of certain businesses and intellectual property from philips and may acquire additional complementary assets  technologies or businesses in the future 
our past acquisitions have given rise to  and future acquisitions may result in  substantial levels of intangible assets that will be amortized or subject to impairment analyses in future years  and our future results will be adversely affected if we do not achieve benefits from these acquisitions commensurate with amortization and potential impairment charges 
for example  our acquisition of caere corporation included a substantial write off of acquired in process research and development costs  and this also may occur as a result of other acquisitions 
in connection with the caere and the l h acquisitions  we issued million and million shares of our common stock  respectively 
we may continue to issue equity securities for future acquisitions and working capital purposes that could dilute our existing stockholders 
in connection with the l h acquisition  we issued a promissory note for million 
under the terms of the philips acquisition  we paid million euros in cash at closing  subject to adjustment in accordance with the provisions of the purchase agreement  as amended  and agreed to pay an additional million euros in cash prior to december   issued a million euro note due december  and bearing interest per annum and issued a million three year  zero interest subordinated debenture  convertible at any time at philips option into shares of our common stock at per share 
future acquisitions may also require us to expend significant funds or incur debt 
if we expend funds or incur additional debt  our ability to obtain financing for working capital or other purposes could decrease 
sales of our document and pdf conversion products and our digital paper management products represented of our revenue for the year ended december  and for the year ended december  any reduction in revenue from these product areas could seriously harm our business 
historically  a substantial portion of our revenue has been generated by a few product areas 
for the year ended december   our document and pdf conversion products represented of our revenue and our digital paper management products represented of our revenue 
for the year ended december   our document and pdf conversion products represented approximately of our revenue  and our digital paper management products represented approximately of our revenue 
although the relative share of our revenue derived from these products decreased during due to the inclusion of sales of our speech products after the l h acquisition  a reduction in the revenue contribution from these product areas could seriously harm our business  results of operations  financial condition  cash flows and stock price 
the protection of our proprietary technology and intellectual property is key to our success 
we rely heavily on our proprietary technology  trade secrets and other intellectual property 
unauthorized parties may attempt to copy aspects of our products or to obtain and use information that we regard as proprietary 
policing unauthorized use of our products is difficult and we may not be able to protect our technology from unauthorized use 
additionally  our competitors may independently develop technologies that are substantially the same or superior to ours 
in addition  the laws of some foreign countries do not protect our proprietary rights to the same extent as the laws of the united states 
although the source code for our proprietary software is protected both as a trade secret and as a copyrighted work  litigation may be necessary to enforce our intellectual property rights  to protect our trade secrets  to determine the validity and scope of the proprietary rights of others  or to defend against claims of infringement or invalidity 
litigation  regardless of the outcome  can be very expensive and can divert management efforts 
third parties have claimed and may claim in the future that we are infringing their intellectual property 
we could be exposed to significant litigation or licensing expenses or be prevented from selling our products if such claims are successful 
like other technology companies  from time to time  we are subject to claims that we or our customers may be infringing or contributing to the infringement of the intellectual property rights of others 
we may be unaware of intellectual property rights of others that may cover some of our technologies and products 
if it appears necessary or desirable  we may seek licenses for these intellectual property rights 
however  we may not be able to obtain licenses from some or all claimants  the terms of any offered licenses may not be acceptable to us  and we may not be able to resolve disputes without litigation 
any litigation regarding intellectual property could be costly and time consuming and could divert the attention of our management and key personnel from our business operations 
in the event of a claim of intellectual property infringement  we may be required to enter into costly royalty or license agreements 
third parties claiming intellectual property infringement may be able to obtain injunctive or other equitable relief that could effectively block our ability to develop and sell our products 
on november   allvoice computing plc filed an action against us in the united states district court for the southern district of texas claiming patent infringement 
in the lawsuit  allvoice alleges that we are infringing united states patent no 
 entitled automated proofreading using interface linking recognized words to their audio data while text is being changed the patent 
the patent generally discloses techniques for manipulating audio data associated with text generated by a speech recognition engine 
although we have several products in the speech recognition technology field  we believe that these products do not infringe the patent because our products do not use the claimed techniques 
we believe this claim has no merit  and we intend to defend the action vigorously 
in december  we were sued for patent infringement initiated by the massachusetts institute of technology and electronics for imaging  inc we were one of more than defendants named in this suit 
damages are sought in an unspecified amount 
we filed an answer and counterclaim on july  we believe this claim has no merit  and we intend to defend the action vigorously 
on august   we were sued by horst froessl for patent infringement 
damages are sought in an unspecified amount 
we filed an answer and counterclaim on september  we believe this claim has no merit  and we intend to defend the action vigorously 
we believe that the final outcome of the current litigation matters described above will not have a significant adverse effect on our financial position and results of operations and we believe that we will not be required to expend a significant amount of resources defending such claims 
however  should we not prevail in these litigation matters or if we are required to expend a significant amount of resources defending such claims  our operating results  financial position and cash flows could be adversely impacted 
if any third parties are successful in intellectual property infringement claims against us  we may be subject to significant damages or injunctions and our operating results and financial position could be harmed 
the markets in which we operate are highly competitive and rapidly changing 
we may be unable to compete successfully against new entrants and established companies with greater resources 
there are a number of companies that develop or may develop products that compete in our targeted markets  however  there is no one company that competes with us in all of our product areas 
the individual markets in which we compete are highly competitive  and are rapidly changing 
within digital capture  we compete directly with abbyy  iris and newsoft 
within speech  we compete with at t  ibm  nuance communications and speechworks international 
vendors such as adobe and microsoft offer solutions that can be considered alternatives to some of our solutions 
in addition  a number of smaller companies produce technologies or products that are in some markets competitive with our solutions 
current and potential competitors have established  or may establish  cooperative relationships among themselves or with third parties to increase the ability of their technologies to address the needs of our prospective customers 
the competition in these markets could adversely affect our operating results by reducing the volume of the products we sell or the prices we can charge 
some of our current or potential competitors have significantly greater financial  technical and marketing resources than we do 
these competitors may be able to respond more rapidly than we can to new or emerging technologies or changes in customer requirements 
they may also devote greater resources to the development  promotion and sale of their products than we do 
the price and performance of our products and technologies may not be superior relative to the products of our competitors 
as a result  we may lose competitive position that could result in lower prices  fewer customer orders  reduced revenue  reduced gross margins and loss of market share 
our products and technologies may not achieve market acceptance or sell at favorable prices  which could hurt our revenue  results of operations and the price of our common stock 
some of our customers  such as microsoft  have developed or acquired products or technologies that compete with our products and technologies 
these customers may give higher priority to the sale of these competitive products or technologies 
to the extent they do so  market acceptance and penetration of our products  and therefore our revenue  may be adversely affected 
our success will depend substantially upon our ability to enhance our products and technologies and to develop and introduce  on a timely and cost effective basis  new products and features that meet changing customer requirements and incorporate technological advancements 
if we are unable to develop new products and enhance functionalities or technologies to adapt to these changes  or are unable to realize synergies among our acquired products and technologies  our business will suffer 
our software products may have bugs  which could result in delayed or lost revenue  expensive correction  liability to our clients and claims against us 
complex software products such as ours may contain errors  defects or bugs 
defects in the solutions or products that we develop and sell to our customers could require expensive corrections and result in delayed or lost revenue  adverse client reaction and negative publicity about us or our products and services 
customers who are not satisfied with any of our products could bring claims against us for damages  which  even if unsuccessful  would likely be time consuming to defend  and could result in costly litigation and payment of damages 
such claims could harm our financial results and competitive position 
we rely on a small number of distribution and fulfillment partners  including  digital river  ingram micro and tech data  to distribute many of our products 
any disruption in these channels could harm our results of operations 
our products are sold through  and a substantial portion of our revenue is derived from  a network of over channel partners  including value added resellers  computer superstores  consumer electronic stores  mail order houses  office superstores and ecommerce web sites 
we rely on a small number of distribution and fulfillment partners  including  digital river  ingram micro and tech data to serve this network of channel partners 
for the year ended december   two distribution and fulfillment partners  ingram micro and digital river  accounted for and of our consolidated revenue  respectively 
during the year ended december   ingram micro and digital river accounted for and of our consolidated revenue  respectively 
a disruption in these distribution and fulfillment partner relationships could negatively affect our results of operations in the short term 
any disruption for which we are unable to compensate could have a more sustained impact on our results of operations 
a significant portion of our accounts receivable is concentrated among our three largest distribution and fulfillment partners  ingram micro  inc  tech data corporation  and digital river  inc 
our products are sold through  and a substantial portion of our accounts receivable is derived from  three distribution and fulfillment partners 
at december   ingram micro  tech data and digital river represented  and of our net accounts receivable  respectively 
at december   ingram micro  tech data and digital river represented  and  of our net accounts receivable  respectively 
in addition  although we perform ongoing credit evaluations of our distribution and fulfillment partners financial condition and maintain reserves for potential credit losses  we do not require collateral 
while  to date  such losses have been within our expectations  we cannot assure you that these actions will be sufficient to meet future contingencies 
if any of these distribution and fulfillment partners were unable to pay us in a timely fashion or if we were to experience significant credit losses in excess of our reserves  our results of operations  cash flows and financial condition would be seriously harmed 
a significant portion of our revenue is derived from sales in europe and asia 
our results could be harmed by economic  political  regulatory and other risks associated with these and other international regions 
since we sell our products worldwide  our business is subject to risks associated with doing business internationally 
we anticipate that revenue from international operations will represent an increasing portion of our total revenue 
reported international revenue for the years ended december  and december   represented and of our consolidated revenue for those periods  respectively 
most of these international revenues are produced by sales in europe and asia 
a number of our oem partners distribute their products throughout the world and do not provide us with the geographical dispersion of their products 
however  based on an estimate that factors our oem partners geographical revenue mix to our revenue generated from these oem partners  international revenue would have represented approximately and of our consolidated revenue for the years ended december  and december   respectively 
therefore  in addition to risks to our business based on a potential downturn in the world economy  a region specific downturn affecting countries in western europe and or asia could have a negative effect on our future results of operations 
in addition  some of our products are developed and manufactured outside the united states 
a significant portion of the development and manufacturing of our speech products are completed in belgium  and a significant portion of our digital capture research and development is conducted in hungary 
in addition  in connection with the philips acquisition  we have added an additional research and development location in germany 
our future results could be harmed by a variety of factors associated with international sales and operations  including changes in a specific country s or region s political or economic conditions  trade protection measures and import or export licensing requirements imposed by the united states or by other countries  negative consequences from changes in applicable tax laws  difficulties in staffing and managing operations in multiple locations in many countries  difficulties in collecting trade accounts receivable in other countries  and less effective protection of intellectual property 
we are exposed to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates 
because we have international subsidiaries and distributors that operate and sell our products outside the united states  we are exposed to the risk of changes in foreign currency exchange rates or declining economic conditions in these countries 
we generally do not engage in hedging transactions to manage our exposure to currency fluctuations 
our exposure to currency rate fluctuations could affect our results of operations and cash flows 
if we are unable to attract and retain technical and operational personnel  our business could be harmed 
if any of our key employees were to leave us  we could face substantial difficulty in hiring qualified successors and could experience a loss in productivity while any successor obtains the necessary training and experience 
our employment relationships are generally at will and we have had key employees leave us in the past 
we cannot assure you that one or more key employees will not leave us in the future 
we intend to continue to hire additional highly qualified personnel  including software engineers and operational personnel  but we may not be able to attract  assimilate or retain qualified personnel in the future 
any failure to attract  integrate  motivate and retain these employees could harm our business 
the stockholdings of our two largest stockholders may enable them to influence matters requiring stockholder approval 
as of december   xerox beneficially owned approximately of our outstanding common stock  including warrants exercisable for up to  shares of our common stock and  shares of our outstanding series b preferred stock  each of which is convertible into one share of our common stock 
the number of shares of common stock issuable upon exercise of the xerox warrant may increase in accordance with a formula defined in the warrant agreement 
the state of wisconsin investment board swib is our second largest stockholder  owning approximately of our common stock as of december  because of their large holdings of our capital stock relative to other stockholders  xerox and swib  acting individually or together  could have a strong influence over matters requiring approval by our stockholders 
the market price of our common stock has been and may continue to be subject to wide fluctuations 
our stock price historically has been and may continue to be volatile 
various factors contribute to the volatility of our stock price  including  for example  quarterly variations in our financial results  new product introductions by us or our competitors and general economic and market conditions 
while we cannot predict the individual effect that these factors may have on the market price of our common stock  these factors  either individually or in the aggregate  could result in significant volatility in our stock price during any given period of time 
moreover  companies that have experienced volatility in the market price of their stock often are subject to securities class action litigation 
if we were the subject of such litigation  it could result in substantial costs and divert management s attention and resources 
we have implemented anti takeover provisions  which could discourage or prevent a takeover  even if an acquisition would be beneficial to our stockholders 
provisions of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation  bylaws and delaware law could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us  even if doing so would be beneficial to our stockholders 
these provisions include a classified board of directors  a preferred shares rights agreement  authorized blank check preferred stock  prohibiting cumulative voting in the election of directors  limiting the ability of stockholders to call special meetings of stockholders  requiring all stockholder actions to be taken at meetings of our stockholders  and establishing advance notice requirements for nominations of directors and for stockholder proposals 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we develop our products in the united states  belgium and hungary 
we sell our products globally  primarily through an indirect reseller channel 
as a result  our financial results are affected by factors such as changes in foreign currency exchange rates and weak economic conditions in foreign markets 
we collect a portion of our revenue and pay a portion of our operating expenses in foreign currencies 
as a result  changes in currency exchange rates from time to time may affect our operating results 
currently  we do not generally engage in hedging transactions to reduce our exposure to changes in currency exchange rates  although we may do so in the future
