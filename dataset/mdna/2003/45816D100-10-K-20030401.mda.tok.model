item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations and notes to consolidated financial statements for a discussion of material acquisitions or dispositions that may affect the comparability of this financial information 
item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations results of operations the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and the notes to consolidated financial statements presented in this annual report 
overview our consolidated subsidiaries during and operate in two industry segments information technology and industrial products 
included in the information technology sector are qs technologies  inc software for public health and human services  visaer  inc software for maintenance  repair and overhaul operations in the commercial aviation industry and corecard software  inc software for managing credit and debit cards 
the industrial products segment includes chemfree corporation bio remediating parts washers 
in  we had a health care segment consisting of our psycare america subsidiary  but we discontinued these operations in november period to period comparisons of results of operations may not be meaningful or indicative of future results for a number of reasons 
in  we acquired a controlling interest in corecard software and in mid  we acquired a controlling interest in visaer 
consequently  we consolidated the results of operations of those companies from the dates of acquisition but not for prior periods 
also  from time to time  we may derive income from sales of holdings in affiliate and other minority owned companies or record a charge if we believe the value of such non consolidated companies is impaired 
we also recognize on a regular basis our pro rata share of the income or losses of affiliate companies accounted for by the equity method 
the timing and amount of gain or loss recognized as a result of a sale or the amount of equity in the income or losses of affiliates generally are not under our control and are not necessarily indicative of future results  either on a quarterly or annual basis 
compared to sales total revenue for the year ended december  was million  an increase of percent compared to the same period in revenue from product sales  which includes sales of equipment in our industrial products segment as well as software license fees intelligent systems corporation related to the information technology segment  increased percent year to year whereas revenue from services billed by the information technology segment increased percent year to year 
the increase in product revenue is mainly due to a greater number of units sold by the chemfree subsidiary due to an increase in domestic demand for its products 
the increase in service revenue year to year reflects mainly the fact that we included the results of visaer for the full months in but only for six months in corecard expects to begin generating revenue from software license fees and services in approximately two thirds of our service revenue in was generated by visaer for professional services with the balance coming mainly from software maintenance contracts at the qs technologies subsidiary 
we expect that visaer s software license revenue that is being deferred until the completed software product is delivered will be recognized beginning in late and at december   long term deferred revenue was million  related to visaer s ups contract which it expects to realize beginning in cost of sales in  total cost of sales was percent of revenue compared to percent of revenue in cost of product sales as a percentage of product revenue was percent in compared to percent in  reflecting mainly a reduction in the unit cost of producing chemfree products because fixed production overhead was spread across a higher volume of goods produced 
cost of service sales almost doubled in as compared to and represented percent of services revenue in as compared to percent in approximately million of the year to year increase in costs of service sales is attributed to including visaer costs for the full months in as compared to only six months in typically  costs associated with visaer service revenue involve higher labor costs than do costs associated with qs technologies services 
operating expenses in  marketing expenses increased by  percent compared to of the increase  approximately  is due to the inclusion of visaer expenses for months in   is due to increased expenditures at the chemfree subsidiary to support a direct sales initiative in selected markets  and the balance of  reflects mainly the inclusion of corecard expenses in general and administrative expenses were percent lower in than in  mainly reflecting the fact that expenses included non recurring charges totaling million related to the write down of goodwill associated with the visaer acquisition in excluding these non recurring charges  general and administrative expenses increased by approximately  year to year mainly because we include the expenses of visaer for the full months in as compared to only six months in an increase in legal expenses in at chemfree of approximately  related to intellectual property protection was offset by a reduction in g a personnel expenses at the qs technologies subsidiary 
research and development expense increased by million percent in as compared to approximately one half of the increase is attributable to each of visaer and corecard due to the inclusion for the full year of their respective expenses to support significant new product development initiatives 
we expect new product development expenses to decline in in absolute dollars and as a percentage of revenue as we complete new product releases and increase license and services revenue at our software subsidiaries 
interest income in  we earned  in interest income compared to million in the reduced interest income is because we earned significant interest on a high interest loan to paysys in before paysys was sold and the loan repaid 
in  we also had lower average cash balances and notes receivable balances than in and we earned interest at a lower rate than in investment income loss in  we had a net investment loss of  compared to net investment income of million in  of which million was derived from the sale of our paysys affiliate in in  we recorded investment gains of million on the sale of our holdings in atherogenics stock and  on the sale of our remaining interest in risk laboratories 
offset against these gains were charges totaling million to reduce the carrying value of our investments in nutec sciences  lumenor  and novient  three privately held software companies  and a charge of million to recognize the accumulated loss on our holdings in publicly traded daw technologies  inc and ixalt  inc 
refer to note for more details regarding these write downs 
the timing and amounts of asset sales or writedowns  if any  vary on an annual and quarterly basis and are generally not predictable by us in advance 
equity losses of affiliates on a quarterly basis  we recognize our pro rata share of the earnings or losses of affiliate companies that we record on the equity method 
these companies are typically early stage companies that incur losses during their development and early revenue stages 
in  we recorded equity losses of  related to four affiliate companies compared to equity losses in of million related to seven affiliate companies 
the main difference between years is that we consolidated visaer and corecard for the full year in but in  we consolidated visaer only for the last half of the year and we accounted for corecard under the equity method for the entire year 
other income in  other income consists mainly of  of deferred gain related to a visaer product line sale in july  compared to the recognition of  of deferred gain related to the product line sale in refer to note for detail on the deferred gain 
intelligent systems corporation income taxes in  we recorded an income tax benefit of  reflective of a refund of alternate minimum taxes paid in the difference between our effective and statutory income tax rate is caused by our valuation allowance on our deferred tax assets 
we expect to keep this allowance in place until it becomes more likely than not that we will realize the benefits of these assets 
we currently have net operating loss carryforwards of approximately  which can be used to offset future taxable income 
the loss carryforwards  if unused  expire beginning in in  we incurred a net income tax expense of  representing a tax liability of  for alternative minimum tax on the paysys transaction and a tax benefit of  recorded at the visaer subsidiary 
compared to sales total revenue in was million  an increase of percent compared to revenue of million in revenue from products sold by the information technology and industrial products segments increased percent year to year whereas revenue from services billed by the information technology segment increased percent year to year 
the growth in both revenue categories reflects mainly the benefit of the mid year acquisition of visaer 
cost of sales in  total cost of sales was percent of revenue  compared to percent in cost of product sales as a percentage of product revenue was essentially the same in and cost of service sales in the information technology segment increased in compared to mainly due to the inclusion of visaer costs following the visaer acquisition 
visaer professional services have a higher labor component and cost than do services provided by qs technologies 
operating expenses in  marketing expenses more than doubled to million compared to  in approximately  of the increase reflects the inclusion of visaer expenses for six months in and the balance is mainly due to increased expenditures in the industrial products segment to support new sales and marketing initiatives 
general and administrative expenses increased million over percent in compared to  reflecting mainly non recurring charges totaling million to write down goodwill associated with the visaer acquisition  the inclusion of visaer expenses for six months and  in non recurring management bonuses related to the sale of paysys 
research and development expense in increased by million percent compared to mainly due to the inclusion of visaer product development expenses for six months as well as a non recurring charge of  to record in process research and development projects related to the acquisition of visaer 
interest income in  we recorded million in interest income compared to interest income of  in the increase in compared to is mainly related to interest earned on a million  high interest note through april and significant cash balances for the remainder of the year  both related to our paysys affiliate sale 
investment income investment income related to sales of affiliate companies has been a major source of profits in both and in  the main components of million of investment income are million from the sale of our interest in paysys and a gain of million on several sales involving our interest in risk laboratories 
for  we recorded a gain of million on the sale of part of our ownership in risk laboratories as well as investment gains totaling million related to sales of shares of common stock of primus and s refer to note for additional details of these transactions 
equity losses of affiliates we recorded million of net equity losses in  compared to  in net equity losses in in  the majority of the equity loss relates to corecard software before we began to consolidate the company in whereas most of the equity loss in relates to visaer 
other income other income expense consists of miscellaneous  non recurring sources of income and expense 
included in is  of deferred gain related to a visaer product line sale in july income taxes in  we incurred income tax expense of  representing a tax liability of  for alternative minimum tax on the paysys transaction tax loss carryforwards offset percent of the gain and a tax benefit of  recorded at the visaer subsidiary 
we incurred income tax expense totaling  in relating to operating income at the qs technologies subsidiary and a small amount of investment income related to the risk laboratories sale that could not be sheltered by tax loss carryforwards 
common shares in  we repurchased and retired  shares of our common stock  including one million shares in the self tender offer completed july  in  executive officers exercised options to acquire a total of  shares of common stock and surrendered a total of  shares of common stock in partial payment of the exercise price 
we also repurchased and retired  shares during pursuant to a stock repurchase plan announced in august intelligent systems corporation liquidity and capital resources our cash balance at december  was million  which is million lower than at the prior year end 
during the year ended december   our principal sources of cash were million from sales of our holdings of atherogenics common stock at various times and market prices during and  from the sale of our remaining interest in risk laboratories 
during the year  our principal uses of cash were million for operations  principally to fund significant new product development projects at visaer and corecard and to cover expenses of the corporate office  million for investments  including an investment in horizon software international  inc  and follow on investments in four privately held technology companies  and  for purchases of property and equipment 
cash used for operations in included a percent increase in accounts receivable reflecting higher sales levels at both chemfree and qs technologies as well as contract progress billings at visaer 
we also used cash in operations to increase inventory levels of demonstration products to support a new direct sales initiative by chemfree 
cash provided by increases in accounts payable relates to purchases at chemfree to support forecasted inventory and sales requirements  coupled with longer payment cycles 
as of december   we had cash of million 
in the first quarter of  we received million cash in settlement of the escrow funds related to the sale of paysys international  inc in and we expect to receive approximately  in additional funds pending the finalization of legal expenses 
see note to consolidated financial statements for more details describing the settlement of the paysys escrow fund 
we have other potential sources of cash which include potential sale s of investments 
the amount and timing of such events cannot be predicted with certainty at this time 
our budgeted cash requirements for are substantially lower than for based on new and pending software license contracts at our information technology subsidiaries  anticipated software customer payments based on milestone achievements  and lower product development costs at visaer and corecard 
we believe our cash balances and the escrow funds will be adequate to support our operations and plans during it is unclear what impact  if any  will result from the war against iraq  potential further terrorist attacks either in the united states or abroad  or other general economic conditions  particularly with respect to visaer s and chemfree s international business  which totaled million in approximately percent of consolidated revenue 
we expect the impact to be more severe at visaer  at least in the short term 
unanticipated delays in contract awards and implementations may have a negative impact on results of operations and increase our cash requirements 
we do not have off balance sheet arrangements  relationships  transactions or guarantees with third parties or related parties that would affect our liquidity or results of operations 
critical accounting policies and estimates the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amount of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses 
we consider certain accounting policies related to revenue recognition  valuation of acquired intangibles and impairment of long lived assets  and valuation of investments to be critical policies due to the estimation processes involved in each 
for a detailed description on the application of these and other accounting policies  see note to the consolidated financial statements beginning on page f revenue recognition our product revenue consists of fees from software licenses and sales of equipment and supplies 
our service revenue consists of fees for implementation  consulting  training  maintenance and support for software products 
a portion of our revenue is derived from software contracts that contain significant production  modification and or customization requirements and license fees for such contracts are recognized using contract accounting 
in some situations  we recognize revenue on a percentage of completion basis that involves estimating our progress on the contract based on input measures 
we recognize revenue and the related costs in the same proportion that the amount of labor hours incurred to date bears to the total estimated hours required for contract completion 
if reliable estimates cannot be determined or if there is an acceptance clause in the contract  all revenue is deferred until the customer has accepted the software and any refund rights have expired 
if we do not accurately estimate the resources required or the scope of work to be performed  or we do not manage the contract properly  in future periods we may need to restate revenues or to incur additional cost which would impact our margins and reported results 
valuation of intangibles purchase accounting for an acquisition requires use of accounting estimates and judgments to allocate the purchase price to the fair market value of the assets and liabilities purchased 
our business acquisitions may result in the allocation of a portion of the purchase price to goodwill and other intangible assets 
the determination of the value of such intangible assets requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amount of future period amortization expenses and possible impairment intelligent systems corporation expense that we will incur 
on at least an annual basis  we review the values assigned to long lived assets using an estimate of the undiscounted cash flows of the entity over the remaining life of the asset 
any resulting impairment could require a write down that would have a material adverse impact on our financial condition or results of operations 
valuation of investments we hold minority interests in non publicly traded companies whose values are difficult to determine and are based on management s estimate of realizability of the carrying value of the investment 
future adverse changes in market conditions  poor operating results  lack of progress of the underlying investment or inability to raise capital to support the business plan could result in losses or an inability to recover the current carrying value of the investment 
our policy with respect to minority interests is to record an impairment charge when we believe an investment has experienced a decline in value that is other than temporary 
such charges could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition or results of operations and are not predictable or quantifiable in advance 
long term contractual obligations our long term contractual obligations consist of operating leases as shown below future minimum lease payments year ended december   year ended december   year ended december   factors that may affect future operations future operations in both the information technology and industrial products segments are subject to risks and uncertainties that may negatively impact our results or projected cash requirements 
in addition  the value of our investments are impacted by a number of factors beyond our control 
among the factors that may affect our consolidated results of operations or financial condition are delays in product software development  undetected software errors  competitive pressures including pricing  inability to establish referenceable customers by corecard and visaer  failure of our product specifications and features to achieve market acceptance  changes in customer requirements and preferences  delays in anticipated customer payments  declines in performance  financial condition or valuation of minority owned companies  the war against iraq and its impact on the commercial aviation industry worldwide  and other general economic conditions particularly those which may cause business and government customers to delay or cancel software purchase decisions 
both visaer and corecard will incur operating losses in although their cash requirements are expected to be less than their reported losses because of scheduled customer payments based on milestone achievements in advance of being able to recognize license revenue 
corecard and visaer will require cash to operate in  although at significantly lower levels than in we anticipate that our other subsidiaries and corporate office will be cash neutral in in the aggregate 
if either corecard or visaer is unsuccessful or if we decide to suspend funding  we may not recover our investment 
furthermore  if visaer or corecard fails to meet product development milestones in  cash payments from customers may be delayed until the milestones are met  resulting in increased cash requirements 
we may establish a back up line of credit with a financial institution but do not expect to utilize the line in  based on current plans 
we have certain lease commitments  legal matters and contingent liabilities described in detail in note to consolidated financial statements 
we are not aware presently of any facts or circumstances related to these that are likely to have a material negative impact on our results of operations or financial condition

the amendments to sfas no 
 which provides for additional transition methods  are effective for periods beginning after december   although earlier application is permitted
