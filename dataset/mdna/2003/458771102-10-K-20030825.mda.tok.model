item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations intermagnetics general corporation intermagnetics  company  we or us makes forward looking statements in this document 
typically  we identify forward looking statements with words like believe  anticipate  perceive  expect  estimate and similar expressions 
unless a passage describes a historical event  it should be considered a forward looking statement 
these forward looking statements are not guarantees of future performance and involve important assumptions  risks  uncertainties and other factors that could cause the company s actual results for fiscal year and beyond to differ materially from those expressed in the forward looking statements 
these important factors include  without limitation  the assumptions  risks  and uncertainties set forth in this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  as well as other assumptions  risks  uncertainties and factors disclosed throughout our annual report on form k 
except for our continuing obligations to disclose material information under federal securities laws  we are not obligated to update these forward looking statements  even though situations may change in the future 
we qualify all of our forward looking statements by these cautionary statements 
critical accounting policies and estimates the company s discussion and analysis of its financial condition and results of operations are based upon  in part  the company s consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america gaap 
the preparation of these financial statements requires the company to make estimates and judgments that affect assets  liabilities  revenues  expenses and related disclosure of contingent liabilities 
the company recognizes revenue and profit on long term development contracts based upon actual costs incurred plus earned profit when these costs are less than the milestone value and the milestone has been achieved  or milestone value when the actual costs exceed the milestone value 
these contracts typically provide engineering services to achieve a specific scientific result relating to superconductivity 
some of these contracts require the company to contribute to the development effort 
the customers for these contracts are both commercial customers and various state and federal government agencies 
when government agencies are providing funding we do not expect the government to be a significant end user of the resulting products 
therefore  the company does not reduce internal research and development by the funding received 
when it appears probable that estimated costs will exceed available funding  and the company is not successful in securing additional funding  the company records the estimated additional expense before it is incurred 
in certain instances  the company recognizes revenue in accordance with staff accounting bulletin no 
 on product that is complete and ready to ship for which our customer has requested a delay in delivery 
in these cases  all the criteria for revenue recognition have been met including  but not limited to the customer has a substantial business purpose  there is a fixed delivery date  title and risk of loss has transferred to our customer  the product is complete and ready for shipment  and the product has been segregated and is not available to be used to fill other orders 
upon notification from our customer the product is shipped to the stated destination 
as of may   may  and may  these systems comprised approximately  and of consolidated annual revenue respectively 
the increase in this percentage is reflective of increased sales destined for the north america or asia 
we expect this trend to increase slightly or begin to level off over the next few fiscal years 
the company maintains a reserve for inventory that may become damaged in the manufacturing process or technologically obsolete 
if technology advances more rapidly than expected  manufacturing processes improve substantially or the market for our products declines substantially  adjustments to reserves may be required 
the provision for warranty for potential defects with our manufactured products is based on historical experience for the period the product was under warranty during the fiscal year 
the company believes this reserve is adequate based on the evaluation criteria  procedures in place to control the manufacturing process and pre testing of newly developed products to ensure their manufacturability prior to commercial introduction 
if product quality declines  the company may require additional provisions 
the company maintains a provision for potential environmental remediation for businesses disposed of during fiscal these provisions are based upon in part  the advice from environmental engineers that have visited the sites and understand the scope of the project  should a cleanup be required 
these engineers are experienced in such matters and with the appropriate government rulings in similar circumstances 
we have made our provision based on the estimate provided which did not include any range of loss 
therefore  we are unable to identify or estimate any additional loss that is reasonably possible 
the company believes these provisions are adequate based on estimates from environmental engineers 
if unexpected costs related to the environmental issues are incurred additional provisions will be needed 
the company records an investment impairment charge on available for sale securities when it believes an investment has experienced a decline in value that is other than temporary 
future adverse changes in market conditions or poor operating results of underlying investments could result in losses or an inability to recover the carrying value of the investment 
during fiscal year the company sold all remaining shares of ultralife batteries inc therefore  as of may  the company had no remaining available for sale securities 
company overview we operate in three reportable operating segments magnetic resonance imaging mri  instrumentation  and energy technology 
the mri segment consists primarily of the manufacture and sale of magnet systems by the igc magnet business group and radio frequency coils by igc medical advances inc 
these products are used principally in the medical diagnostic imaging market 
until october  this segment also included the manufacture and sale of low temperature superconducting wire by our igc advanced superconductor division igc as 
the instrumentation segment consists of refrigeration equipment produced by igc polycold systems inc igc polycold 
these systems are used primarily in ultra high vacuum applications  industrial coatings  analytical instrumentation  medical diagnostics and semiconductor processing and testing 
for the first three quarters of fiscal year  this segment also included igc apd cryogenics inc igc apd 
the energy technology segment  operated through superpower  inc is developing second generation  high temperature superconducting materials that we expect to use in devices designed to enhance capacity  reliability and quality of transmission and distribution of electrical power 
we completed two major divestitures in fiscal year on october   we sold the assets and business of igc as to outokumpu copper products oy 
on february   we sold all of the outstanding shares of igc apd to sumitomo heavy industries  ltd 
these transactions are discussed in more detail below 
through february   the company reported its operations in four segments electromagnetics  low temperature superconductors  refrigeration  and energy technology 
the change to these segments reflects our continued focus on commercial market applications of core technology 
the resulting reporting segments are intended to relate to the primary markets which each serve 
prior year segment data has been reclassified to conform to current year presentation 
through october  the refrigeration segment included a refrigerant business that we exited for strategic reasons 
intersegment sales and transfers are accounted for as if the sales or transfers were to third parties  that is  at current market prices 
the company evaluates the performance of its reportable segments based on operating income loss 
the company operates on a week fiscal year ending the last sunday during the month of may 
we also have a foreign sales corporation located in barbados  which remains active until legislation is finalized as a result of the extraterritorial income exclusion act of the act provides for an exclusion from gross income of a percentage of income attributable to certain activities performed outside the united states 
this exclusion is designed to parallel the treatment of foreign sourced income by other countries and contains no requirement for a separate foreign entity to obtain the benefit 
results of operations during the year ended may  sales decreased or million  to million 
divested businesses represent million of the sales decline 
for the year ended may   sales increased by or million  to million  compared with an increase of for the preceding year 
during the year ended may  sales of the mri segment increased million or to million 
offsetting this increase is a decrease of million related to the disposed wire business in the prior year 
the increase in the current year is primarily related to increased demand  by philips medical systems pms  and other customers for higher field strength magnets million  partially offset by a reduced demand for rf coils as a result of industry consolidation million 
during the prior year  sales of the mri segment increased by million  or  primarily a result of increased product demand  by pms as well as other customers million 
this increase more than offset a decline of million in sales of low temperature superconducting wire resulting from the sale of essentially all of the assets of igc as 
during the year ended may   mri segment sales increased by million  or  most of which was a result of strong demand by pms and the transfer of magnet production from our former french joint venture aisa for the entire year  versus only a partial year in fiscal these increases more than offset a decline in sales of low temperature superconducting wire to external customers  as more of the total wire production was devoted to internal needs 
during the fiscal year ended may   sales of the instrumentation segment declined million  or  to million 
a decline in sales of million related to the divesture of igc apd was partially offset by an increase in sales of million  related to increased customer demand for vacuum and imaging products from the pacific rim 
the economic slowdown continues to curtail demand from most other parts of the world 
during the prior year  sales of the instrumentation segment decreased by million  or  to million from million 
approximately million of the total decline from fiscal  resulted from a decrease in product demand for refrigeration equipment caused  in part  by a slow down in the economy 
in addition  we experienced unusually high sales in this segment in the prior fiscal year 
another million of the decline was related to the divestiture of igc apd and the relocation of our san rafael  california plant to a new modern facility in petaluma  california 
during the period ended may   sales of instrumentation products increased by million  or  resulting from a large increase in demand for the company s refrigeration equipment in areas such as optical filters used to increase capacity of the data transmitted on fiber optic cable networks 
this increase was partially offset by a million  or decline in the sale of refrigerants resulting from our decision to exit the refrigerant business 
during the fiscal year ended may   sales in the energy technology segment declined million  or to million 
this decline is primarily related to reduced third party funding for superconducting projects primarily related to hts devices 
in the prior year  sales in the energy technology segment increased by million  or  to million primarily from increased outside funding for superconducting devices 
the company continues to focus its efforts on successfully manufacturing second generation superconductor and first generation devices 
during the year ended may  sales in the energy technology segment were essentially unchanged at million 
the company believes  in general  that first generation conductors consisting of ceramic compounds in a silver matrix will be unable to achieve cost and performance targets necessary to make devices produced with this material economically feasible 
accordingly  we are developing conductors in which the superconducting compounds are deposited on a lower cost substrate 
while they have not yet resulted in increased sales  we have developed important relationships and cooperative agreements for the pursuit of this approach  and we continue to seek additional partners to assist in the development and marketing of these products 
during the year ended may  gross profit decreased million or to million 
included in this decline is million related to businesses which were divested in the prior year 
approximately million of the increase is related to improved magnet mix and nearly  is related to increased customer demand for vacuum products partially offset by decreased sales  and related gross profit of rf coils million and customer funding of research and development projects 
additionally  active cost reduction programs contributed favorably to the gross profit during the fiscal year 
gross profit in fiscal increased million to million 
about million is related to increased customer demand  active cost reduction programs and improved product mix from magnet systems and additional customer funding for research and development 
these increases were offset by a reduction of million resulting from disposed businesses mentioned previously as well as a decrease of about million relating to reduced demand for instrumentation products 
additionally  prior year margin had the benefit of million of inventory recovered from the related restructuring recorded in fiscal as a percent of sales  margins decreased to from 
during fiscal gross profit increased million to million 
this increase included million benefit from the recovery of inventory written off in restructuring 
the remaining increase was due principally to the significant increase in sales  coupled with an improved mix of sales in both rf coils and instrumentation 
in addition  the substantial reduction in refrigerant sales resulting from the previously described decision to exit that business helped improve gross margins  as these were low margin sales 
during fiscal research and development decreased million or to million 
included in this decline is million of research and development related to divested businesses incurred in the prior year 
the remaining decline of  is related primarily to decreased spending  as development programs begin the transition into manufacturing mostly in the mri segment 
most other segments were flat compared to last year 
during fiscal product research and development increased million or to million 
approximately million of this increase was a result of increased efforts of the mri segment relating to new magnet and rf coil designs 
another million is related to our efforts to develop second generation superconductor and first generation devices for the energy technology market 
we view this as a longer term investment that is not expected to generate near term sales 
finally  in fiscal the company increased research and development in the instrumentation segment by about  this effort is dedicated to understanding our customer s needs and creating products to satisfy those needs 
during fiscal product research and development increased by to million  from million in fiscal substantially all of the increase was due to programs to develop new magnet systems  new refrigeration applications to broaden the instrumentation product line and a substantial increase in our high temperature superconductors hts activities in the energy technology segment 
marketing  general and administrative expense declined million or nearly to million 
included in this decline is million related to divested businesses 
the most significant decline came from the mri segment million related to reduced spending for salaries and benefits  consulting and employment related expenses 
instrumentation segment spending declined about  related to costs included in the prior year for relocating to petaluma  california 
finally  the energy technology segment declined about  due to lower market research and business development costs in fiscal during fiscal marketing  general and administrative expenses decreased by about million  or 
the majority of this decrease is related to the divestitures of igc as  and igc apd million 
spending in the mri segment declined  from prior year as a result of reduced selling expenses and legal fees related to patent defense 
these reductions were partially offset by increased spending for information technology  primarily related to increased staffing 
instrumentation spending increased  as a result of re organizing and rebuilding the sales and marketing departments of this segment 
additionally  fiscal did not include spending of about  related to the refrigerant business that was exited in fiscal finally  there was modest increase of about  spending from the energy technology segment in fiscal related to increased staffing 
in fiscal expenses increased by about million or 
in addition to a substantial increase in the level of expenditures devoted to the energy technology segment  we also had higher costs resulting from increased staff levels and other associated expenses 
in addition  we had higher consulting and stock based compensation costs and certain expenditures associated with a termination of the company s traditional defined benefit pension plan and subsequent transition to a fixed  defined contribution plan 
during fiscal amortization of intangible assets declined  primarily due to certain intangibles becoming fully amortized 
during fiscal amortization of intangible assets decreased million as a result of the adoption of statement of accounting standard no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
during fiscal amortization of intangible assets increased by about million resulting from a full year of amortization of the intangible assets acquired in connection with the acquisition of production rights our aisa joint venture 
during fiscal  despite reduced sales  operating income improved to million or from million in fiscal essentially this was achieved by controlling non essential costs and aggressive implementation of product cost reduction strategies 
divested businesses had little effect on operating income between years 
during fiscal  operating income increased about million or to million 
this increase includes the effect of the divestiture of certain businesses  expenses related to the transfer of mixed gas and the move of our san rafael california plant to petaluma california 
during fiscal  operating income more than doubled to million due primarily to the much higher level of sales and gross margins 
during fiscal interest and other income decreased nearly  or to million from nearly million in the previous year 
this decrease is primarily related to the prior year containing  of income from the sale of a product line 
interest income remained relatively consistent with fiscal during fiscal  interest and other income increased about  or to nearly million 
this increase is due primarily to the sale of a product line as well as increased cash 
during fiscal interest and other income increased nearly  or related to increased cash 
interest expense during fiscal decreased  or to nearly  this decrease is related to the divesture of igc apd and its associated mortgage 
during fiscal interest expense decreased million or to  as a result of the conversion of our subordinated debentures in fiscal during fiscal interest expense was essentially the same as the prior year 
on october   we divested our low temperature superconducting lts materials business  igc advanced superconductors of waterbury  connecticut  for more than million 
the purchase price consisted of a million note  payable in october  and the balance in cash 
the agreement between intermagnetics and outokumpu copper products oy  a subsidiary of the outokumpu group of finland  also included a six year strategic supply arrangement that expanded outokumpu s existing superconducting materials business 
intermagnetics will purchase from outokumpu a substantial portion of its internal lts wire requirements  primarily for manufacturing superconducting magnet systems for magnetic resonance imaging systems 
intermagnetics will receive up to an additional million if it attains specified levels of lts wire purchases over the first two years of the agreement 
during the first year of the agreement  we did not attain wire procurement levels sufficient to earn the extra payment 
excluding that payment  the sale resulted in a one time pre tax gain of approximately million in fiscal additionally  the company recorded stock based compensation expense of  related to the sale 
on february   the company sold the stock of its subsidiaries igc apd cryogenics  inc and ig europe  ltd 
the sale was subject to a stock purchase agreement between the company and sumitomo heavy industries shi of japan dated january  the sale to shi included only the helium related assets of these subsidiaries and the assumption of related liabilities 
the purchase consideration was arrived at by arms length negotiation and consisted of million in cash paid on february  the company was also able to withdraw an additional million in cash prior to closing 
the net pretax gain from the sale was  the agreement included a six year strategic supply agreement under which the company will purchase from shi shield coolers it requires internally  primarily for manufacturing superconducting magnet systems 
the mixed gas portion of the refrigeration systems business  previously conducted at igc apd  was transferred and integrated into igc polycold  inc additionally  the company recorded stock based compensation expense of  related to the sale 
in connection with these divestitures the company has established a liability for environmental remediation and penalties of approximately million 
at may  approximately million remains on the company s balance sheet 
in october  fiscal the company sold its remaining  shares of ultralife batteries  inc for total proceeds of approximately million with a gross realized loss of approximately million 
in connection with the sale  net unrealized holding loss of  has been reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive income 
during fiscal the company evaluated the probability of realizing the value of our investments in ultralife batteries inc and kryotech 
as a result  the company determined these investments were impaired and accordingly wrote down ultralife batteries inc to its then current market value as of november  and kryotech to zero  its then estimated value 
the write down amounted to million and was due to a decline in fair market value of these investments  which  in the opinion of management  was other than temporary 
additionally  during fiscal the company received  as a result of a favorable settlement of trade litigation 
during fiscal the company had an effective income tax rate of compared to a rate in fiscal the increase in rate is primarily related to the ability to use certain capital losses to partially offset capital gains associated with the sale of igc as in fiscal the company expects to maintain the rate during fiscal during fiscal the effective income tax rate was compared to a income tax rate in fiscal this decrease in the effective income tax rate is related to the ability of the company to use certain capital losses to partially offset capital gains associated with the sale of igc as in fiscal as well as more effective use of the extraterritorial income regime 
the effective income tax rate during fiscal was essentially the same as fiscal in assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets  management considers whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of our deferred tax assets will not be realized 
the ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income and capital gains during the periods in which those temporary differences become deductible 
management considers projected future taxable income  the character of such income and tax planning strategies in making this assessment 
the company had federal taxable income of approximately  in fiscal   in fiscal and  in fiscal based upon the level of historical taxable income and projections for future taxable income over the periods in which the deferred tax assets are deductible  management believes it is more likely than not that the company will realize the benefits of the remaining deductible differences 
the amount of the deferred tax assets considered realizable  however  could be reduced in the near term if estimates of future taxable income are reduced 
looking forward  during fiscal  we expect to reduce our investment  while significantly advancing the research in energy technology  primarily through additional funding  as we develop products for external market commercialization  which we believe will be about the middle of the decade 
this increase is primarily related to our ability to secure additional funding from outside sources  primarily the united states government 
additionally  the company is seeking partners with enhancing technology to participate in our projects in order to share both costs and technology  as demonstrated in the cable project 
we expect sales to increase slightly  primarily from energy technology and instrumentation segments 
sales from the mri segment are expected to temporarily decline and inventories to slightly increase as a result of changing supply chain management logistics at pms 
additionally  we expect the anticipated abnormally low first quarter will result in the upcoming fiscal year being below our stated long term performance targets  but we anticipate this correction will position the company for above average growth rates in subsequent years 
a portion of this growth is expected to come from sales related to high field t and open magnet systems as well as new products being developed at igc medical advances and igc polycold 
these products are continuously being developed 
our customers are intimately involved in the definition and development of these products 
additionally  the company has an active cost cutting program in each of its divisions to increase earnings 
these expectations are based on the following assumptions  among others o third party funding is available for energy technology to continue its research  o partners are available to help offset some of the unfunded costs related to this research  o the market for mri systems continues to grow  o customer acceptance of the new products being developed throughout the company  o order trends for mri magnets improve towards the second half of the year  o new products achieve the level of growth and market acceptance expected  o the economy doesn t cause any pullback in instrumentation orders  o low cost competitors of our products are unable to gain a substantial share of the market  o the company is able to locate and retain qualified people for various positions  o a continuation of the increased demand from the pacific rim for products of the instrumentation segment  and o we are able to maintain gross margins through continued production cost reductions and manufacturing efficiencies 
liquidity and capital resources for the fiscal year ended may  the company generated million in cash from operations compared to million in the previous year 
this cash was primarily generated from improved operating activities 
the most significant contribution came from the net reduction in inventory  pre paid expenses and other assets of million 
almost all sectors are reporting lower inventory but the largest contributor is the mri sector 
this reduction is the result of an expected slow down in the first quarter of fiscal associated with the supply chain management logistics with pms 
investing activities required million in the current year and generated million in the prior year 
purchases of property  plant and equipment declined about million from the previous year 
the previous year included significant capital expenditures related to production equipment and equipment used in research and development as well as the tenant fit up costs related to our new petaluma  california facility 
additionally  in the prior year  investing activities provided million from the sale of divisions 
in the current year we used million for financing activities compared to cash provided of million in the prior year 
proceeds from the sale of common stock and the exercise of stock options were below last year s million by about million 
this decline is a result of a general downturn in the stock market which negatively affected the company s share price 
in july  approximately million was provided to employees in the form of a loan for the purchase of company stock through the executive stock purchase program 
approximately million was used for the purchase of treasury shares 
principal payments on notes payable declined about million in the current year to  due to the divestiture of igc apd and its associated mortgage during fiscal year for the twelve months ended may  the company had a cash balance of million  an increase of about million from the same period last year 
see the consolidated statement of cash flows  located elsewhere in this report  for further details on sources and uses of cash 
our capital and resource commitments at august  consisted of capital equipment commitments of  we have a million unsecured line of credit with three banks 
borrowings under the line bear interest at the london interbank offered rate libor or prime plus an applicable margin at our option 
the credit line expires in october there are currently no borrowings under the credit line 
we believe we have adequate resources to meet our needs for the short term from our existing cash balances  our expected cash generation in fiscal  and our line of credit 
longer term  with substantial increases in sales volume and or unusually large research and development or capital expenditure requirements to pursue new opportunities in the energy technology segment  or to meet business development opportunities related to acquisitions requiring expansion financing we could need to raise additional funds 
we would expect to be able to do so through additional lines of credit  public offerings or private placements of securities 
however  in the event funds were not available from these sources  or on acceptable terms  we would expect to manage our growth within the financing available 
inflation has not had a material impact on our financial statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative discussions about market risk the company s exposure to market risk through derivative financial instruments and other financial instruments  such as investments in short term marketable securities and long term debt  is not material 
the financial instruments of the company that are interest rate dependent are an unsecured line of credit and a mortgage payable 
the company manages interest rates through various methods within contracts 
on its mortgage payable  the company negotiated an interest rate swap agreement that  in effect  fixes the rate at 
with respect to its unsecured line of credit  the company may elect to apply interest rates to borrowings under the line which relate to either the london interbank offered rate or prime  whichever is most favorable 
see note e of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in response to item for more details regarding these instruments 
the company s objective in managing its exposure to changes in interest rates is to limit the impact of changing rates on earnings and cash flow and to lower its borrowing costs 
additionally  the company makes certain estimates about inventory value  collectability of accounts receivable  warranty expense and market acceptance of new product under development 
we use factors such as probability of use  ability of a customer to pay  historical experience of product repair and customer need and or acceptance of new products in making the associated estimates 
these estimates are believed to be reasonable and based on information available at the time the estimate is made 
the company does not believe that its exposure to commodity and foreign exchange risks are material 
we limit our exposure to these risks by denominating contracts  such as our contract with pms  in us dollars
