item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation general mills is a global consumer foods company 
we compete in markets around the world by developing differentiated food products that consumers recognize as superior to alternative offerings 
we market our value added products under unique brand names  and build the equity of those brands with strong consumer directed advertising and innovative merchandising 
we believe this brand building strategy is the key to winning and sustaining market share leadership 
we believe that our business portfolio  expanded in fiscal with the acquisition of pillsbury  will generate superior financial returns for our shareholders over the long term 
our financial performance is determined by how well we execute the key elements of our business model 
these key business drivers are unit volume growth  which is the single most critical element  productivity initiatives  to mitigate the effects of cost inflation  efficient utilization of capital  and prudent management of risk 
this section of the annual report on form k discusses our critical accounting policies  the results of our operations  our liquidity and financial condition  and our risk management practices 
critical accounting policies for a complete description of our significant accounting policies  please see note one to the consolidated financial statements 
our critical accounting policies are those that have meaningful impact on the reporting of our financial condition and results  and that require significant management judgment and estimates 
these policies include our accounting for a trade and consumer promotion activities  b asset impairments  c income taxes  and d pension and postretirement liabilities 
the amount and timing of expense recognition for trade and consumer promotion activities involve management judgment related to estimated participation and performance levels 
the vast majority of year end liabilities associated with these activities are resolved within the following fiscal year and therefore do not require highly uncertain long term estimates 
we are required to evaluate our long lived assets  including goodwill  for impairment and write down the value of any assets when they are determined to be impaired 
evaluating the impairment of long lived assets involves management judgment in estimating the fair values and future cash flows related to these assets 
although the predictability of long term cash flows may be uncertain  our evaluations indicate fair values for our long lived assets and goodwill that are significantly in excess of stated book values 
therefore  we believe the risk of unrecognized impairment is low 
income tax expense involves management judgment as to the ultimate resolution of any tax issues 
historically  our assessments of the ultimate resolution of tax issues have been reasonably accurate 
the current open tax issues are not dissimilar in size or substance from historical items 
the accounting for pension and other postretirement liabilities requires the estimation of several critical factors 
because changes in these estimates can have a significant impact  we have described them in more detail below in the section titled pension accounting 
results of operations vs 
the acquisition of pillsbury  on october   significantly affected fiscal comparisons for our results of operations  as our fiscal results include only seven months of ownership of the pillsbury businesses 
net earnings including cumulative effect of change in accounting principle  adopted in fiscal  as described in more detail in the section below titled new accounting rules were million  up percent from fiscal diluted earnings per share were compared to in fiscal annual net sales rose percent  to billion  driven by a percent increase in worldwide unit volume for fiscal the balance of the net sales growth was primarily attributable to promotional efficiencies 
on a comparable basis  as if general mills had owned pillsbury for all of fiscal  worldwide unit volume grew percent 
this performance reflects improvement in our us retail segment but was constrained by economic factors limiting growth in our bakeries and foodservice segment and latin american operations in our international segment 
the pillsbury acquisition materially altered our business structure 
our bakeries and foodservice segment and international segment  which now represent larger portions of our sales and earnings  have lower gross margins than general mills historical margins 
these businesses also are generally supported with lower marketing spending as a percent of sales 
cost of goods sold as a percent of sales declined from percent in fiscal to percent in fiscal this reduction reflects the benefit of synergies created from the pillsbury acquisition 
increased operating leverage  defined as increased absorption of fixed operating cost as a result of higher volume levels  was offset by the incremental five months of pillsbury s business structure versus fiscal as discussed in the previous paragraph 
selling  general and administrative costs include certain infrequently occurring items 
in fiscal  we recorded million of costs related to the planning and execution of the integration of pillsbury  including consulting  system conversions  relocation  training and communications  compared to million of similar expenditures in fiscal selling  general and administrative costs as a percent of sales were percent in fiscal compared to percent in the above noted infrequently occurring items increased selling  general and administrative costs as a percent of sales by percent in both fiscal and the two percentage point year over year decrease in selling  general and administrative costs as a percent of sales was primarily generated by synergies 
our fiscal results included restructuring and other exit costs of million as discussed in more detail in note three to the consolidated financial statements 
these were primarily severance costs and asset write downs related to plans established to accomplish the integration of pillsbury 
our fiscal results included restructuring and other exit costs of million  including charges related to the sale of our toledo  ohio plant to international multifoods corporation as required to obtain regulatory clearance for the acquisition of pillsbury  and to severance costs for sales organization and headquarters department realignment 
interest expense increased percent in fiscal due to the full year impact of the additional debt associated with the pillsbury acquisition 
average diluted shares outstanding were million in fiscal  up percent from million in fiscal due to the full year impact of shares issued to diageo as part of the acquisition 
us retail segment 
our us retail segment includes big g cereals  meals  pillsbury usa  baking products  snacks  yoplait colombo and small planet foods 
net sales for these operations totaled billion in fiscal  compared to billion in fiscal operating profits totaled billion  up percent from the prior year 
comparable unit volume grew percent versus fiscal fueled by an increase in product and marketing innovation 
all of our us retail businesses experienced volume growth except baking products  which declined due to significant competitive promotional activity 
bakeries and foodservice segment 
our bakeries and foodservice segment includes sales to wholesale and retail bakeries  foodservice distributors  convenience stores  vending and foodservice operators 
net sales for our bakeries and foodservice operations reached billion in fiscal compared to billion in fiscal  while operating profit was million  up only percent from the prior year in spite of the inclusion of twelve months of pillsbury results in fiscal compared to seven months of results included in fiscal operating profits reflect higher supply chain costs as operations were affected by manufacturing realignments from the pillsbury merger and higher commodity costs which could not be recovered fully through pricing actions 
comparable unit volume was essentially unchanged  reflecting overall weak foodservice industry trends 
international segment 
our international segment includes our business in canada  as well as our consolidated operations in europe  the asia pacific region and latin america 
net sales for our international operations totaled billion in fiscal compared to million in operating profits grew to million  more than double last year s million total 
comparable unit volume declined percent for the year  driven by a percent decline in latin america that was almost offset by strong volumes in canada  europe and the asia pacific region 
pension accounting 
in fiscal  we recorded net pension and postretirement income of million  net of million of curtailments  compared to million  net of million of curtailments  in fiscal as detailed in note fourteen to the consolidated financial statements  key assumptions that determine this income include the discount rate and expected rate of return on plan assets 
our discount rate assumption is determined annually based on the interest rate for long term high quality corporate bonds 
the discount rate used to determine the pension and other postretirement obligations as of the balance sheet date is the rate in effect as of that measurement date 
that same discount rate is also used to determine pension and other postretirement income or expense for the following fiscal year 
the discount rates used in our pension and other postretirement assumptions were percent for the obligation as of may  and for our fiscal income and expense estimate  percent for the obligation as of may  and for our fiscal income and expense estimate  and percent for the obligation as of may  and for our fiscal income and expense estimate 
our expected rate of return on plan assets is determined by our asset allocation  our historical long term investment performance  and our estimate of future long term returns by asset class using input from our actuaries  several consultants and economists as well as long term inflation assumptions 
for fiscal and  we assumed a rate of return of percent on our pension plan assets and percent on our other postretirement plan assets 
for fiscal we have reduced our rate of return assumptions to percent for assets in both plans 
in addition to our assumptions about the discount rate and the expected rate of return on plan assets  we base our determination of pension expense or income on a market related valuation of assets  which reduces year to year volatility in accordance with sfas no 
 employers accounting for pensions 
this market related valuation recognizes investment gains or losses over a five year period from the year in which they occur 
investment gains or losses for this purpose are the difference between the expected return calculated using the market related value of assets and the actual return based on the market related value of assets 
since the market related value of assets recognizes gains or losses over a five year period  the future value of assets will be impacted as previously deferred gains or losses are recorded 
as of may   we had cumulative losses of approximately billion on our pension plans and million on our postretirement plans 
these unrecognized net actuarial losses will result in decreases in our future pension income if they continue to exceed the corridor defined by sfas no 
for our fiscal pension and other postretirement income and expense estimate  we have reduced the discount rate to percent  based on interest rates as of may  we have also reduced the expected rate of return on plan assets to percent 
based on these rates and various other assumptions including the amortization of unrecognized net actuarial losses  we estimate that our net pension and postretirement expense  exclusive of curtailments  if any  will approximate million in fiscal compared to income of million  exclusive of curtailments  in fiscal actual future net pension and postretirement income or expense will depend on future investment performance  changes in future discount rates and various other factors related to the populations participating in our pension and postretirement plans 
lowering the expected long term rate of return on assets by basis points would increase our net pension and postretirement expense for fiscal by approximately million 
lowering the discount rate by basis points would increase our net pension and postretirement expense for fiscal by approximately million 
our pension plans were underfunded by million as of may  based on our actuarial assumptions  we expect required cash contributions of less than million in fiscal  and we made contributions of million in fiscal and million in fiscal our other postretirement benefit plans were underfunded by million as of may  based on our actuarial assumptions  we expect to make cash contributions of approximately million for each of the next three years  which compares to actual cash contributions of million in fiscal and million in fiscal corporate items 
net interest expense rose in fiscal to million  which includes a full year of interest on the additional debt incurred related to the pillsbury acquisition 
during fiscal we issued approximately billion of long term debt securities and used the proceeds to repay short term debt 
we have in place a net amount of interest rate swaps that convert billion of floating rate debt to fixed rates 
these swaps have an average life of one year and have an average fixed rate of percent 
as of may   million of pretax losses from these swap contracts were recorded within accumulated other comprehensive income 
as explained in note seven to the consolidated financial statements  when we issue fixed rate debt  the corresponding interest rate swaps are dedesignated as hedges and the amount related to those swaps within accumulated other comprehensive income will be reclassified into earnings over the life of the interest rate swaps 
taking into account the effect of all of our interest rate swaps  the average interest rate on our total debt is approximately percent 
our effective tax rate in fiscal was percent 
joint ventures 
general mills proportionate share of joint venture net sales grew to million  compared to million in fiscal total after tax earnings from joint venture operations almost doubled to reach million in fiscal  compared with million reported a year earlier 
profits for cereal partners worldwide cpw  our joint venture with nestl  and snack ventures europe sve  our joint venture with pepsico  together grew to million 
in addition  h agen dazs joint ventures contributed a full year of results 
these profit gains were partially offset by continued marketing investment for th continent  the company s soymilk joint venture with dupont 
results of operations vs 
general mills completed the acquisition of the pillsbury company on october  fiscal net sales grew percent to billion including the seven months of pillsbury results 
worldwide volume grew percent  although on a comparable basis  as if general mills had owned pillsbury for all of fiscal and fiscal  volume grew slightly 
earnings after tax declined percent to million 
net earnings per diluted share declined percent to  from in fiscal this significant reduction in general mills earnings was caused by the initial disruption of combining general mills and pillsbury s organizations 
total us retail comparable unit volume declined percent in fiscal volume gains in yoplait colombo  snacks and pillsbury usa were more than offset by volume declines seen in big g cereals  meals and baking products 
the reduced volume resulted from the merger related disruption to our sales force and a reduced level of new products and promotional activity during the integration period 
net sales in the us retail segment grew to billion from billion 
operating profits were flat at billion 
foodservice results in fiscal included comparable unit volume that was essentially unchanged from fiscal net sales more than doubled to billion and operating profit grew percent to reach million 
international comparable unit volume grew percent and net sales nearly tripled to million 
operating profit grew from million to million 
impact of inflation it is our view that changes in the general rate of inflation have not had a significant effect on profitability over the three most recent years 
we attempt to minimize the effects of inflation through appropriate planning and operating practices 
our market risk management practices are discussed later in this section 
cash flows sources and uses of cash in the past three years are shown in the following table 
over the most recent three year period  general mills operations have generated billion in cash 
in  cash flow from operations totaled billion 
that was up from the previous year due primarily to a million increase in operating earnings before depreciation  amortization  restructuring and other exit costs  as well as a million increase from a reduction in working capital 
cash sources uses fiscal year in millions from continuing operations  from discontinued operations purchases of land  building and equipment  net investments in businesses  intangibles and affiliates  net change in marketable securities proceeds from disposition of businesses other investments  net increase decrease in outstanding debt  net  proceeds from minority investors common stock issued treasury stock purchases  dividends paid other increase decrease in cash and cash equivalents in fiscal  capital investment for land  building and equipment and intangibles grew to million  including expenditures for the construction of new facilities at our minneapolis headquarters campus and expenditures associated with the acquisition and integration of pillsbury 
we expect capital expenditures to decrease in fiscal  to approximately million  as integration related activities are completed 
dividends in totaled per share  a payout of percent of diluted earnings per share 
we intend to maintain the prevailing annual dividend rate per share in fiscal  but would expect to increase that rate in the longer term as our earnings increase 
we did not repurchase a significant number of shares in fiscal  nor do we expect to repurchase a significant number of shares in fiscal during fiscal general mills paid diageo million under the contingent value right cvr agreement that was part of the pillsbury transaction 
the cvr required general mills to pay diageo up to million  or per share on million shares  depending on the price of general mills common stock for the trading days prior to april  in fiscal general mills also paid million to diageo for three year call options on million general mills shares 
these options were purchased in conjunction with a general mills convertible bond offering discussed below 
financial condition our notes payable and total long term debt totaled billion as of may  we also consider our leases and deferred income taxes related to tax leases as part of our debt structure  and we use a measurement of adjusted debt plus minority interests  as shown in the table below 
this adjusted debt plus minority interests declined slightly to just over billion  and our stockholders equity grew to billion primarily due to the increase in retained earnings 
the market value of general mills stockholders equity increased as well  due to price appreciation and the increase in shares outstanding 
as of may   our equity market capitalization was billion  based on a price of per share and million basic shares outstanding 
capital structure in millions may  may  notes payable   current portion of long term debt long term debt   total debt   debt adjustments deferred income taxes tax leases leases debt equivalent certain cash and cash equivalents marketable investments  at cost adjusted debt   minority interests adjusted debt plus minority interests   stockholders equity   total capital   in fiscal we refinanced approximately billion of our short term debt through the following issuances million of percent year notes  million of percent year bonds  million of notes at various rates  and billion of zero coupon percent convertible debentures 
the debentures are convertible into a total of million shares of general mills common stock 
see note eight to the consolidated financial statements for further information regarding the debenture issue 
in order to prevent share dilution in the event of conversion  we purchased call options for million shares from diageo 
the purchase price for the call options was million 
if the owners of the debentures exercise their right of conversion  we intend to exercise our options to purchase diageo s shares so that total shares outstanding remain constant 
as discussed earlier  we have entered into interest rate swap contracts to lock in our interest rate on our floating rate debt 
combined  over percent of our debt is now fixed rate 
we consider our leases and deferred income taxes related to tax leases as part of our fixed rate obligations 
the next table  when reviewed in conjunction with the capital structure table  shows the composition of our debt structure including the impact of using derivative instruments 
debt structure in millions may  may  floating rate fixed rate   leases debt equivalent deferred income taxes tax leases adjusted debt plus minority interests   at the end of fiscal  approximately percent of our adjusted debt plus minority interests was long term 
commercial paper is a continuing source of short term financing 
we can issue commercial paper in the united states and canada  as well as in europe  through a program established in fiscal our commercial paper borrowings are supported by billion in committed credit lines 
currently  we have no outstanding borrowings under these credit lines 
additionally  we have million in uncommitted credit lines available 
the following table details the fee paid credit lines we had available as of may  committed credit facilities amount expiration core facilities billion january billion january total credit lines billion our fixed charge coverage in fiscal was times compared to times in fiscal we expect to pay down at least million of debt in  as part of a cumulative billion reduction in adjusted debt planned over the next three years through fiscal our goal is to return to a mid single a rating for our long term debt  and to the top tier short term rating  where we were prior to our announcement of the pillsbury acquisition 
currently  standard and poor s corporation has ratings of bbb on our publicly held long term debt and a on our commercial paper 
moody s investors services  inc has ratings of baa for our long term debt and p for our commercial paper 
fitch ratings  inc rates our long term debt bbb and our commercial paper f dominion bond rating service in canada currently rates general mills as a low 
off balance sheet arrangements and contractual obligations it is not our general business practice to enter into off balance sheet arrangements nor is it our policy to issue guarantees to third parties 
we have  however  issued guarantees of approximately million for the debt and other obligations of unconsolidated affiliates  primarily cpw and sve 
in addition  off balance sheet arrangements are generally limited to the future payments under noncancelable operating leases  which totaled approximately million at may  the following table summarizes our future estimated cash payments under existing contractual obligations  including payments due by period 
the majority of the purchase obligations represent commitments for projected raw material and packaging needs to be utilized in the normal course of business and for consumer directed marketing commitments that support our brands 
in millions  payments due by fiscal year total and thereafter long term debt    operating leases purchase obligations   total     new accounting rules effective the first quarter of fiscal  we adopted statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
the adoption of sfas no 
did not have a material impact on the company s consolidated financial statements 
in november  the financial accounting standard board fasb issued fasb interpretation number fin  guarantor s accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees of indebtedness of others 
fin elaborates on the disclosure requirements of guarantees  as well as requiring the recording of certain guarantees issued or modified after december  we do not believe that the adoption of fin requires any material change in our guarantee disclosures 
see note seventeen to the consolidated financial statements 
we have not entered into any recordable guarantees since december  in july  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities 
sfas no 
requires companies to recognize costs associated with exit or disposal activities when they are incurred rather than at the date of a commitment to an exit or disposal plan 
sfas no 
is to be applied prospectively to exit or disposal activities initiated after december  the adoption of this standard affects the timing of the recognition of future exit or disposal costs  as no exit or disposal activities were initiated after december  on the first day of fiscal  we adopted three new accounting rules 
sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  requires all derivatives to be recorded at fair value on the balance sheet and establishes new accounting rules for hedging 
we recorded the cumulative effect of adopting this accounting change in fiscal  as described in note one o to the consolidated financial statements 
we also adopted sfas no 
 business combinations  which requires use of the purchase method of accounting for all business combinations initiated after june  the third statement we adopted at the start of fiscal was sfas no 
 goodwill and intangible assets 
this statement eliminates the amortization of goodwill and instead requires that goodwill be tested annually for impairment 
goodwill amortization expense in fiscal totaled million pretax  million after tax 
transitional impairment tests of our goodwill did not require adjustment to any of our goodwill carrying values 
the effects on net earnings and earnings per share for the adoption of sfas no 
are described in note one o to the consolidated financial statements 
the fasb s emerging issues task force eitf issue  accounting for consideration given by a vendor to a customer or a reseller of the vendor s products  requires recording certain coupon and trade promotion expenses as reductions of revenues and was effective for us in our fourth quarter of fiscal since adopting this requirement resulted only in the reclassification of certain expenses from selling  general and administrative expense to a reduction of net sales  it did not affect our financial position or net earnings 
in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure 
sfas no 
provides companies with alternative methods of transition to the fair value based method of accounting for stock based employee compensation 
we use the intrinsic value method of accounting  and have not elected the fair value based method of accounting 
sfas no 
also amends the disclosure about the effects on reported net income of an entity s accounting policy decisions with respect to stock based employee compensation  as reflected in note one l to the consolidated financial statements 
finally  sfas no 
requires disclosure about those effects in future interim financial information 
in may  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity 
sfas no 
establishes standards for how an issuer classifies and measures certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity 
many of these instruments were previously classified as equity 
sfas no 
requires that an issuer classify a financial instrument that is within its scope as a liability  or as an asset in some circumstances 
this statement applies to three types of freestanding financial instruments  other than outstanding shares 
one type is mandatorily redeemable shares  which the issuing company is obligated to buy back in exchange for cash or assets  a second type includes put options and forward purchase contracts that require or may require the issuer to buy back some of its shares in exchange for cash or other assets  the third type is obligations that can be settled with shares  the monetary value of which is fixed  ties solely or predominantly to a variable such as a market index  or varies inversely with the value of the issuers shares 
sfas no 
does not apply to features embedded in a financial instrument that is not a derivative in its entirety 
sfas no 
is effective for financial instruments entered into or modified after may   and otherwise is effective at the beginning of the first interim period beginning after june  for us  it will be implemented in our second quarter of fiscal by reporting the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle for financial instruments created before the issuance date of the statement and still existing at the beginning of that period 
restatement is not permitted 
the adoption of this statement is not expected to have a material impact on our financial statements 
market risk management our company is exposed to market risk stemming from changes in interest rates  foreign exchange rates and commodity prices 
changes in these factors could cause fluctuations in our earnings and cash flows 
in the normal course of business  we actively manage our exposure to these market risks by entering into various hedging transactions  authorized under company policies that place clear controls on these activities 
the counterparties in these transactions are highly rated financial institutions 
our hedging transactions include but are not limited to the use of a variety of derivative financial instruments 
we use derivatives only where there is an underlying exposure  we do not use them for trading or speculative purposes 
additional information regarding our use of financial instruments is included in note seven to the consolidated financial statements 
interest rates 
we manage our debt structure and our interest rate risk through the use of fixed and floating rate debt  and through the use of derivatives 
we use interest rate swaps to hedge our exposure to interest rate changes  and also to reduce volatility of our financing costs 
generally under these swaps  we agree with a counterparty to exchange the difference between fixed rate and floating rate interest amounts based on an agreed notional principal amount 
our primary exposure is to us interest rates 
as of may   we had billion of agreed notional principal amounts the principal amount on which the fixed or floating interest rate is calculated outstanding  including amounts that neutralize exposure through offsetting swaps see notes seven and eight to the consolidated financial statements 
foreign currency rates 
foreign currency fluctuations can affect our net investments and earnings denominated in foreign currencies 
we primarily use foreign currency forward contracts and option contracts to selectively hedge our cash flow exposure to changes in exchange rates 
these contracts function as hedges  since they change in value inversely to the change created in the underlying exposure as foreign exchange rates fluctuate 
our primary exchange rate exposures are with the canadian dollar  the euro  the japanese yen and the british pound against the us dollar 
commodities 
certain ingredients used in our products are exposed to commodity price changes 
we manage this risk through an integrated set of financial instruments  including purchase orders  noncancelable contracts  futures contracts  futures options and swaps 
our primary commodity price exposures are to cereal grains  sugar  vegetables  fruits  other agricultural products  vegetable oils  packaging materials and energy costs 
value at risk 
these estimates are intended to measure the maximum potential fair value general mills could lose in one day from adverse changes in market interest rates  foreign exchange rates or commodity prices  under normal market conditions 
a monte carlo var methodology was used to quantify the market risk for our exposures 
the models assumed normal market conditions and used a percent confidence level 
the var calculation used historical interest rates  foreign exchange rates and commodity prices from the past year to estimate the potential volatility and correlation of these rates in the future 
the market data were drawn from the riskmetrics tm data set 
the calculations are not intended to represent actual losses in fair value that we expect to incur 
further  since the hedging instrument the derivative inversely correlates with the underlying exposure  we would expect that any loss or gain in the fair value of our derivatives would be generally offset by an increase or decrease in the fair value of the underlying exposures 
the positions included in the calculations were debt  investments  interest rate swaps  foreign exchange forwards and options  and commodity swaps  futures and options 
the calculations do not include the underlying foreign exchange and commodities related positions that are hedged by these market risk sensitive instruments 
the table below presents the estimated maximum potential one day loss in fair value for our interest rate  foreign currency and commodity market risk sensitive instruments outstanding on may  the amounts were calculated using the var methodology described earlier
