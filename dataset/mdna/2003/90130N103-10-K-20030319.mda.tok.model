item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations financial condition investment grade bonds comprised of the fair value of the fixed maturity portfolio at december  the company has no investments in equity securities as of december  of the company s total investments at december   approximately were invested in tax exempt  fixed income securities  compared to at december  the company has begun shifting its investment focus to investment grade taxable bonds to accelerate the realization of the tax benefit of its net operating loss deduction see critical accounting policies deferred income taxes 
as of december   the pre tax net unrealized gain on investments was million compared to a pre tax net unrealized loss of million at december  this change is primarily due to declining market interest rates 
the company s policy is to investigate on a quarterly basis any investment for possible other than temporary impairment in the event the fair value of the security falls below its amortized cost  based on all relevant facts and circumstances see further discussion under critical accounting policies investments 
premiums receivable were million at december   compared to million at december   with the increase mainly attributable to growth in the company s customer base and higher premium rates 
company policy is to write off receivable balances when they become past due days  and the company historically has not considered an allowance for doubtful accounts to be necessary 
prepaid reinsurance premiums and reinsurance payables were million and million at december   compared to million and million at december   respectively 
the decline in balances is primarily due to the cancellation of the quota share treaty with aig subsidiaries see note to the notes to consolidated financial statements 
increased advertising and other costs through december   associated with increased customer volume  contributed to an increase in deferred policy acquisitions costs dpac of amount shown for is a capital lease obligation see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements

leased property under capital lease and obligation under capital lease increased million and million  respectively  as a result of a sale leaseback transaction the company entered in december see note to the notes to consolidated financial statements 
the purpose of the transaction was to increase the statutory surplus of st century insurance company  the company s primary wholly owned subsidiary 
property and equipment decreased million primarily due to the sale leaseback described above and the write off of certain software in the third quarter of see critical accounting policies property and equipment and note to the notes to consolidated financial statements 
the results of management s fourth quarter recoverability test indicated that the remaining carrying value of the company s software under development is likely to be recoverable from future operations see critical accounting policies property and equipment 
unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses lae increased million for the year ended december  primarily due to the increase in reserves for sb northridge earthquake legal defense costs see further discussion below under underwriting results homeowner and earthquake lines in runoff and note to the notes to consolidated financial statements and increases in auto reserves 
as indicated in the following table  the company s auto reserves  gross of reinsurance  have increased million in the year ended december amounts in thousands december  gross net gross net unpaid losses and lae personal auto lines     homeowner and earthquake     total     the million increase in the gross auto reserves for the year ended december   comprises million due to the consolidation of st of arizona  growth in reserves attributable to the higher number of insured automobiles of approximately million  approximately million relating to the effects of higher average loss costs and approximately million for strengthening of prior accident year reserves see further discussion under critical accounting policies losses and loss adjustment expenses 
the following table summarizes the provision for losses and lae  net of applicable reinsurance  for the periods indicated amounts in thousands years ended december  net losses and lae incurred related to insured events of auto lines current year    prior years    subtotal auto lines    homeowner lines current year    prior years   subtotal homeowner lines    earthquake current year prior years    subtotal earthquake    all lines current year    prior years    total    management believes that  given the inherent variability in the estimates  the company s reserves are within a reasonable and acceptable range of adequacy 
however  because reserve estimates are necessarily subject to the outcome of future events  changes in estimates are unavoidable in the property and casualty insurance business given that loss trends vary and timing is required for changes in trends to be recognized and confirmed 
these changes sometimes are referred to as loss development or reserve development 
the changes in estimates relating to the auto lines in were smaller than in and as the changes in loss trends were identified and reserved for 
the changes in estimates relating to auto lines in for development in prior accident years primarily resulted from the company s assumption that the multi year favorable trend would continue through the company s reported earnings could be significantly different if ending reserves were based on assumptions and estimates different from those used by management see further discussion in part of this report under the heading loss and loss adjustment expense reserves 
during and  the company improved the quality and timeliness of the data available to make initial estimates and periodic changes in estimates and has dedicated more resources to understand better the underlying drivers of the changes in frequency and severity trends as they begin emerging 
management believes the decline in the need for recognition of adverse development in due to prior accident years for the personal auto lines evidences substantial improvement in the accuracy of its estimation processes 
historically  st century actuaries have not projected a range around the carried loss reserves 
rather  they have used several methods and different underlying assumptions to produce a number of point estimates for the required reserves 
management selects the carried reserve after carefully reviewing the appropriateness of the underlying assumptions 
stockholders equity and book value per share decreased to million and at december   compared to million and at december  the decrease for the year ended december   was primarily due to a net loss of million and dividends to stockholders of million  offset in part by the increase in net unrealized investment gains of million and other changes in comprehensive income of million 
liquidity and capital resources holding company 
the parent company s main sources of liquidity historically have been dividends received from its insurance subsidiaries and proceeds from issuance of debt or equity securities 
the parent company currently has no indebtedness for borrowed money outstanding  although it has guaranteed a subsidiary s capital lease obligation 
the parent s only equity security currently outstanding is its common stock  which has no mandatory dividend obligations 
cash and investments at the holding company were million at december   compared to million at december  the decline in the parent s cash and investments is primarily due to the payment of dividends and the repayments of intercompany balances 
on december   the company declared a million dividend to stockholders of record on december   which was paid january  if necessary  the company believes it can access the capital markets should the need arise for additional capital to support its growth and other corporate objectives 
the company s s p claims paying rating currently is a  and its am best rating is a 
the insurance subsidiaries currently have million of statutory unassigned surplus that could be paid as dividends to the parent company without prior written approval from insurance regulatory authorities in however  given the current uncertainty surrounding the taxability of dividends received by holding companies from their insurance subsidiaries see further discussion in item of this report and note of the notes to consolidated financial statements  it is unlikely that the company s insurance subsidiaries will make any dividend payments to the parent in there is no assurance that the related tax issue will be favorably resolved in the near term  in which case the company faces the prospect of raising additional capital at the holding company level  cutting or ceasing dividends to stockholders  or having to pay the additional tax on dividends on the insurance company to the holding company 
insurance subsidiaries 
the company believes it has taken the proper actions to restore underwriting profitability in its core auto insurance operations and has thereby enhanced its liquidity 
in california  the company implemented a auto premium rate increase on may   and has received approval for a auto premium rate increase  which it expects to implement in march average loss costs in have increased at an overall rate of approximately over  although this rate may have been somewhat higher but for the favorable impact on claim frequency of drought conditions that have largely prevailed in southern california over the past months 
there can be no assurance that insurance regulators will grant future rate increases that may be necessary to offset possible future increases in claims cost trends 
also  the company remains exposed to possible upward development in previously recorded reserves for sb claims as previously discussed 
as a result of such uncertainties  underwriting losses could recur in the future 
further  the company could be required to liquidate investments to pay claims  possibly during unfavorable market conditions  which could lead to the realization of losses on sales of investments 
adverse outcomes to any of the foregoing uncertainties would create some degree of downward pressure on the insurance subsidiaries  which in turn could negatively impact the company s liquidity 
as of december   the company s insurance subsidiaries had a combined statutory surplus of million compared to million at december  significant changes in surplus were a decrease in nonadmitted assets of million  primarily due to the sale leaseback of million fixed assets discussed above 
partially offsetting this was a statutory net loss of million and a million decrease in the admitted portion of the statutory deferred tax asset 
the statutory net loss for the year ended december  was million compared to statutory net income of million for the company s ratio of net premiums written to surplus was for the twelve month period ended december   compared to and for the years ended december  and  respectively 
on october   the cdi finalized its examination report on the statutory financial statements for the company s california domiciled insurance subsidiaries 
the report did not require the insurance subsidiaries to restate those financial statements 
the company has not identified any other trends  demands  commitments  events or uncertainties that have or are considered to have a reasonable possibility of having a material impact on the company s liquidity 
obligations  letters of credit  guarantees and transactions with related parties 
the company currently has a capital lease obligation resulting from the sale leaseback transaction discussed earlier 
the lease includes a covenant that if aig ceases to have a majority interest in the company  or if statutory surplus falls below million  or if the net premiums written to surplus ratio is greater than  the company will either deliver a letter of credit to the lessor or pay the lessor the then outstanding balance  including a prepayment penalty of up to 
the company also has operating leases for its office facilities 
future cash payments required under all the company s lease obligations are summarized below in millions capital lease operating for the years ended december  obligation leases total and thereafter the company currently has no unused letters of credit and has issued no guarantees on behalf of others  and has no trading activities involving non exchange traded contracts accounted for at fair value 
the company has entered into no material transactions with related parties other than the reinsurance transactions with aig subsidiaries 
at december  and  reinsurance recoverables  net of payables  from aig subsidiaries were million and million  respectively 
the company has no long term debt obligations  purchase obligations or other long term liabilities on its balance sheet 
in addition  the company has no retained interests in assets transferred to an unconsolidated entity  and no obligations under certain derivative instruments or obligations arising out of variable interests

underwriting results the tables presented in the notes to consolidated financial statements summarize the company s unaudited quarterly results of operations for each of the two years in the period ended december   and the results of operations by line of business for each of the three years then ended 
the following discussion of underwriting results by line of business should be read in conjunction with the information presented in those tables and elsewhere herein 
personal auto 
automobile insurance is the primary line of business written by the company 
vehicles insured outside of california accounted for less than of the company s direct written premium in  and at the end of  the company was licensed to write automobile insurance in states compared to states at the end of the company currently is evaluating opportunities relating to expansion into new states but has not yet adopted definitive plans 
because of the lead times involved  expansion into new states is not expected to materially affect the company s financial results in direct premiums written for the year ended december   increased million to million in compared to million in and million in the increase in included rate increases million and the effects of the consolidation of st of arizona million 
also  the higher number of insured vehicles in caused premiums to be million higher than in the increase in was primarily due to rate increases that more than offset the decline in the number of insured vehicles 
california auto retention was for the year ended december   compared to and for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the improvement in reflects improved service levels and that the company s major competitors have taken significant rate increases in and  therefore  its customers are less likely to find more favorable rates elsewhere 
in response to rising loss costs beginning in november and continuing to date  the company has implemented three base rate increases  made changes in its class plan and adopted stricter underwriting measures 
additionally  as the company upwardly adjusted its rates  it curtailed advertising for new customers throughout and most of during this same period  competitors held rates steady or continued to take decreases 
these actions contributed to the declines in retention in and net premiums earned increased million to million in  compared to million in and million in the increases in and are greater than the proportional increase in the corresponding direct premiums written because of the decrease in the quota share reinsurance arrangement with aig subsidiaries from in to includes changes in estimates relating to insured events of prior years as follows in  in  and in and earlier 
in and from in to in in addition  the company entered into an agreement to cancel future cessions under this treaty as of september  the cancellation resulted in a one time pre tax charge of million 
starting in may  the company began offering motorcycle coverage primarily to its california auto customers 
in august  the company introduced a new private passenger auto policy that does not have certain standard features found in its primary policy 
this limited feature product is similar in most respects to the product offered by many of the company s competitors and is positioned as a lower cost alternative for customers who believe they need less coverage than provided by the company s standard product 
in october  the company enhanced its underwriting guidelines allowing it to provide quotes to certain customers who do not meet california s statutory good driver definition but who are considered to be insurable risks within the company s class plan 
through december   the impact of these new products on the results of operations has been immaterial 
net incurred losses and loss adjustment expenses increased million to million in compared to million and million in and  respectively 
the ratios of loss and loss adjustment expenses to net premiums earned were  and for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the effects on the loss and lae ratios of changes in estimates relating to insured events of prior years were in  in and in these changes in estimates pertained mainly to development in average paid loss severities beyond amounts previously anticipated 
for additional discussion of the factors that led to these changes in estimates  please see item of this report under the heading loss and loss adjustment expense reserves 
in general  changes in estimate are recorded in the period in which new information becomes available indicating that a change is warranted  usually in conjunction with the company s quarterly actuarial review 
the ratios of net underwriting expenses to net premiums earned were  and for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the increase was primarily due to growth in advertising expenditures and costs associated with approximately doubling the number of new sales agents  who have been handling a record volume of new business throughout several productivity enhancement initiatives are underway aimed at reducing per unit process costs and lowering fixed costs in corporate support areas 
the combined ratio was in the year ended december   compared to and for and  respectively 
company management remains focused on achieving sustainable growth and a combined ratio of 
since  the company has simultaneously met those benchmarks only twice and 
the third and fourth quarters of both marked the first times since that the company has achieved both an underwriting profit and growth of in direct premiums written in its auto lines 
in the third quarter of the company entered into a catastrophe reinsurance agreement with aig subsidiaries  folksamerica reinsurance company and transatlantic reinsurance company on its auto lines  which reinsures any covered events up to million in excess of million 
the premium for this reinsurance coverage is approximately million per month 
homeowner and earthquake lines in runoff and all other 
underwriting results of the homeowners and earthquake lines  which are in runoff  were losses of million in  million in and million in this line included million for the write off of software development costs in the third quarter of the company has not written any earthquake coverage since and ceased writing new homeowner policies in september the company has executed various transactions to exit from its homeowner line 
under a january  agreement with balboa insurance company balboa  a subsidiary of countrywide financial corporation countrywide  of homeowner unearned premium reserves and subsequent related losses were reinsured by balboa 
obligations relating to the northridge earthquake are not covered by the agreement with balboa 
the company began non renewing homeowner policies expiring on february   and thereafter 
substantially all of these customers are being offered homeowner coverage through an affiliate of countrywide 
california senate bill sb  effective from january   to december   allowed the re opening of previously closed earthquake claims arising out of the northridge earthquake 
in the fourth quarter of  the company recorded a million pre tax charge for loss and inspection costs but  at that time  it was impracticable to reasonably estimate the legal defense costs associated with previously closed earthquake claims 
the company s constitutional challenge to sb came to an unsuccessful result on april   when the united states supreme court refused to hear the company s case 
based on information subsequently available to the company  the company recorded an additional million pre tax charge for such legal defense costs in the third quarter of the company cautions that the recorded loss and lae estimates for this event are subject to a greater than normal degree of uncertainty for a variety of reasons see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
on october   a los angeles superior court granted the company s motion for summary judgment in the matter of st century insurance company vs 
people of the state of california ex rel 
bill lockyer  attorney general et al 
the court determined that the company s april   settlement with the california department of insurance with respect to regulatory actions arising out of the northridge earthquake was fully valid and enforceable 
the court denied the attorney general s motion seeking to have the settlement declared void and unenforceable  a result that may have allowed the cdi to reinstitute regulatory proceedings with respect to the company s handling of claims arising out of the northridge earthquake 
the cdi has appealed the ruling 
since  the company has engaged an external software development company  computer sciences corporation csc  to develop and install an advanced personal lines processing system 
the system has four main components policy  claims  billing  and customer service 
the system is still in development and currently supports less than of the company s business 
to date  the company has spent nearly million on this project  most of which was paid directly to csc 
in the third quarter of  it became evident through a series of tests and reviews conducted by the company that material components of this new system do not perform at levels necessary to support the entire operations of the company  and the company recorded a one time pre tax charge to write off million of previously capitalized software costs 
on december   the company commenced an arbitration proceeding against csc arising out of csc s obligation to provide insurance company information technology software and other software programs to the company 
csc has filed a counterclaim in the proceeding 
the arbitration will be conducted in accordance with the rules of the american arbitration association 
capital expenditures relating to this project totaled million  million and million in  and  respectively 
at december   management has estimated that the million carrying value and the million estimated cost to complete such software  or million in total  is recoverable from cost savings from future operations 
however  if the remaining software components cannot be successfully implemented  some or all of the remaining million carrying value may be written off see critical accounting policies property and equipment 
investment income the company utilizes a conservative investment philosophy 
no equities  derivatives or nontraditional securities are held in the company s investment portfolio 
substantially all of the portfolio is investment grade 
net investment income was million in  compared to million in and million in average invested assets increased in from the prior year and decreased in from the decrease in was primarily due to the sale of investments to cover incurred loss costs  the acquisitions of property and equipment and the payment of dividends to stockholders 
the average annual pre tax yields on invested assets were in  in and in the average annual after tax yields on invested assets were in  in and in net realized gains on the sale of investments were million in gross realized gains were million  gross realized losses were million and investment expenses were million compared to million in and net realized losses of million in at december   million of the company s total investments at fair value were invested in tax exempt bonds with the remainder  representing of the portfolio  invested in taxable securities  compared to and  respectively  at december  as of december   the company had a pre tax net unrealized gain of million compared to a net unrealized loss on fixed maturity investments of million in and a net unrealized gain of million in the company recognized no other than temporary impairments in  or see discussion under critical accounting policies 
critical accounting policies the company believes its critical accounting policies are those which require management to make significant assumptions or estimates  and to ascertain the appropriateness and timing of any changes in those assumptions or estimates that can have a material effect on the company s financial condition  results of operations or cash flows 
specifically  the following areas require management to make such assumptions and estimates each time the company prepares its financial statements losses and loss adjustment expenses  particularly the liability for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses included in the liability section of the company s balance sheet  the recoverability of certain property and equipment  deferred income taxes  and deferred policy acquisition costs included in the asset section of the company s balance sheet  and the review of the company s investments for possible other than temporary declines in fair value 
management has discussed the company s critical accounting policies and estimates  together with any changes therein  with the audit committee of the company s board of directors 
the company s disclosure committee and audit committee have reviewed the company s disclosures in this document 
losses and loss adjustment expenses 
the estimated liabilities for losses and loss adjustment expenses lae include the accumulation of estimates of losses for claims reported prior to the balance sheet dates  estimates based upon actuarial analysis of historical data of losses for claims incurred but not reported  the development of case reserves to ultimate values and estimates of expenses for investigating  adjusting and settling all incurred claims 
amounts reported are estimates of the ultimate costs of settlement  net of estimated salvage and subrogation 
the estimated liabilities are necessarily subject to the outcome of future events  such as changes in medical and repair costs  as well as economic and social conditions that impact the settlement of claims 
in addition  time can be a critical part of reserving determinations since the longer the span between the incidence of a loss and the payment or settlement of the claim  the more variable the ultimate settlement amount can be 
accordingly  short tail claims  such as property damage claims  tend to be more reasonably predictable than long tail liability claims 
for the company s current mix of auto exposures  which include both property and liability exposures  an average of approximately of the ultimate losses are settled within twelve months of the date of loss 
given the inherent variability in the estimates  management believes the aggregate reserves are within a reasonable and acceptable range of adequacy  although the company continues to caution that the reserve estimates relating to sb are subject to a greater than normal degree of variability and possible future material adjustment as new facts become known 
the methods of making such estimates and establishing the resulting reserves are reviewed and updated quarterly and any resulting adjustments are reflected in current operations 
changes in the estimates for these liabilities flow directly to the income statement on a dollar for dollar basis 
for example  an upward revision of million in the estimated liability for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses would decrease underwriting profit  and pre tax income  by the same million amount 
conversely  a downward revision of million would increase pre tax income by the same million amount 
property and equipment 
accounting standards require long term assets to be tested for possible impairment under certain conditions 
at december   management believes the company s remaining capitalized costs for policy and claims software is the only long term asset that meets the conditions for impairment testing 
under the applicable accounting standards  the first step is to determine whether the carrying value and cost to complete the asset is recoverable from future operations  based on estimates of future undiscounted cash flows  if not  then an impairment write down would be required to be recognized based on the fair value of the asset 
at december   management has estimated that the million carrying value and million estimated cost to complete such software  or million in total  is recoverable from cost savings from future operations 
this conclusion is based primarily on the assumptions that the software can be successfully implemented and can reduce the company s employee count by at least people about of its workforce for the to years after implementation ie  the current estimate of the probable productive life of the software 
once the project has successfully reached the stage where it is substantially complete and ready for its intended use  the company anticipates there will be annual depreciation charges varying from approximately million to million 
however  although management believes it is reasonable to assume these future cost savings  it must be noted that any such estimates are subject to considerable uncertainty and there can be no assurance that such cost savings will be achieved 
deferred income taxes 
generally accepted accounting principles require deferred tax assets and liabilities dtas and dtls  respectively to be recognized for the estimated future tax effects attributed to temporary differences and carryforwards based on provisions of the enacted tax law 
the effects of future changes in tax laws or rates are not anticipated 
temporary differences are differences between the tax basis of an asset or liability and its reported amount in the financial statements 
for example  the company has a dta because the tax basis of its loss and lae reserves is smaller than their book basis  and it has a dtl because the book basis of its capitalized software exceeds its tax basis 
carryforwards include such items as alternative minimum tax credits  which may be carried forward indefinitely  and net operating losses see further discussion in part  loss and loss adjustment expenses  and in part under financial condition 
see note above and note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
see note above 
nols  which can be carried forward years for losses incurred before and years thereafter 
a summary of the significant dtas and dtls relating to the company s temporary differences and carryforwards is included in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
at december   the company s dtas total million  and its dtls total million 
the net of those amounts  million  represents the net deferred tax asset reported in the consolidated balance sheet 
the company is required to reduce dtas but not dtls by a valuation allowance if  based on the weight of available evidence  it is more likely than not ie  a likelihood of more than that some portion or all of the dtas will not be realized 
recognition of a valuation allowance would decrease reported earnings on a dollar for dollar basis in the year in which any such recognition were to occur 
the determination of whether a valuation allowance is appropriate requires the exercise of management judgment 
in making this judgment  management is required to weigh the positive and negative evidence as to the likelihood that the dtas will be realized 
portions of the company s nol carryforward are scheduled to expire beginning in  as shown in the table of expirations below amounts in millions year of nol excluding srly nol of consolidated expiration st of arizona st of arizona nol totals with the performance of the company s core business in the past two quarters running close to management s goals of growth in direct written premiums and a combined ratio  management believes it is reasonable to discount the possibility of future underwriting losses and to conclude it is at least more likely than not that the company will be able to realize the benefits of its dtas 
if necessary  the company believes it could implement tax planning strategies  such as investing a higher proportion of its investment portfolio in taxable securities  in order to generate sufficient future taxable income to utilize the nol carryforwards prior to their expiration 
accordingly  no valuation allowance has been recognized as of december  however  generating future taxable income is dependent on a number of factors  including regulatory and competitive influences that may be beyond the company s ability to control 
future underwriting losses could possibly jeopardize the company s ability to utilize its nols 
in the event underwriting losses due to either sb or other causes were to persist  management might be required to reach a different conclusion about the realizability of the dtas and  if so  to recognize a valuation allowance at that time 
srly stands for separate return limitation year 
deferred policy acquisition costs 
deferred policy acquisition costs dpac include premium taxes and other variable costs incurred in connection with writing business 
these costs are deferred and amortized over the period in which the related premiums are earned 
management assesses the recoverability of deferred policy acquisition costs on a quarterly basis 
the assessment calculates the relationship of actuarially estimated costs incurred to premiums from contracts issued or renewed for the period 
the company does not consider anticipated investment income in determining the recoverability of these costs 
based on current indications  no reduction in dpac is required unless the loss and loss adjustment expense ratio should exceed 
the loss and lae ratio used in the recoverability estimate is based primarily on the assumption that the future loss and lae ratio will approximate that of the recent past 
while management believes that is a reasonable assumption  actual results could differ materially from such estimates 
investments 
impairment losses for declines in value of fixed maturity investments below cost attributable to issuer specific events are based upon all relevant facts and circumstances for each investment and are recognized when appropriate in accordance with staff accounting bulletin sab noncurrent marketable equity securities  financial accounting statement fas no 
accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities  and related guidance 
for fixed maturity investments with unrealized losses due to market conditions or industry related events  where the company has the positive intent and ability to hold the investment for a period of time sufficient to allow a market recovery or to maturity  declines in value below cost are not assumed to be other than temporary 
where declines in values of securities below cost or amortized cost are considered to be other than temporary  a charge is required to be reflected in income for the difference between cost or amortized cost and the fair value 
no such charges were recorded in  or the determination of whether a decline in market value is other than temporary is necessarily a matter of subjective judgment 
the timing and amount of realized losses and gains reported in income could vary if conclusions other than those made by management were to determine whether an other than temporary impairment exists 
however  there would be not impact on equity because any unrealized losses are already included in comprehensive income
