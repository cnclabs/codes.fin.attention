appc strengthens the company s position in fine chemicals and provides additional manufacturing capabilities in europe 
in the fine chemicals product lines  most plants operated at similar rates to those experienced in  with the largest exception being the magnolia  arkansas  bromine based performance chemicals facilities  which have improved to near full utilization in in polymer chemicals product lines  most of the company s plants operated at somewhat higher capacity utilization in than during  however  the aluminum alkyls plants operated at rates below those in the company operates on a worldwide basis with i manufacturing plants located in france  germany and the united kingdom  in addition to facilities in the united states  and has interest in certain joint venture production facilities in japan  people s republic of china  jordan and austria  ii offices and distribution terminals in belgium  france  japan and singapore  as well as the united states and iii offices in shanghai and beijing  china 
the company does not believe it has significant assets in countries in which those assets would be deemed to be exposed to substantial risk 
see note  operating segments and geographic area information of notes to the consolidated financial statements in item on page competition albemarle operates in a highly competitive marketplace  competing against a number of other companies in most of its product lines 
some markets involve a significant number of competitors  while others involve only a few 
the competitors of the company are varied in terms of size  resources and market share 
competition generally is based on product performance and availability  reputation for quality  price and customer service and support 
the degree and nature of competition depends on the type of product involved 
in general  the company competes on the basis of the quality and price of its products and customer services by maintaining a broad range of products and by focusing resources on products in which the company has a competitive advantage 
it endeavors to improve its reputation for quality products  competitive prices and excellent customer service and support 
competition in connection with the company s products requires continuing investments in research and development  product and process improvements and specialized customer services 
through research and development  the company continues to seek to increase margins by introducing value added products and products based on proprietary technologies 
albemarle corporation and subsidiaries raw materials and significant supply contracts raw materials used by the company include ethylene  potassium chloride  aluminum  ortho toluidine  bisphenol a  chlorine  phenol  isobutylene  caustic soda  toluene  diphenyl oxide  alumina trihydrate  dimethlyamine  phthalic anhydride  polystyrene  alpha olefins  maleic anhydride  ethanol  phosphorus  sulfuric acid and nitrogen  as well as electricity and natural gas as fuels  most of which are readily available from numerous suppliers and are purchased or provided under contracts at prices the company believes are competitive 
the company also produces bromine in arkansas from its extensive brine reserves supported by an active leasing program 
the company has supply agreements with the dead sea bromine group of companies

additional information summary of critical accounting policies estimates and assumptions the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of revenues  expenses  assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements 
listed below are the estimates and assumptions that the company considers to be significant in the preparation of the financial statements 
allowance for doubtful accounts the company estimates losses for uncollectible accounts based on the aging of receivables and the evaluation of the likelihood of success in collecting the receivables 
recovery of long lived assets the company evaluates the recovery of its long lived assets on a segment basis by periodically analyzing its operating results and considering significant events or changes in the business environment 
acquisition accounting the company estimates the fair value of assets and liabilities when allocating the purchase price of an acquisition 
income taxes the company assumes the deductibility of certain costs in its income tax filings and estimates the future recovery of deferred tax assets 
legal accruals the company estimates the amount of potential exposure it may have with respect to litigation  claims and assessments 
environmental remediation liabilities the company estimates and accrues the costs required to remediate a specific site depending on site specific facts and circumstances 
cost estimates to remediate each specific site are developed by assessing i the scope of the company s contribution to the environmental matter  ii the scope of the anticipated remediation and monitoring plan  and iii the extent of other parties share of responsibility 
insurance accruals receivables the company records and assumes the recoverability of insurance receivables and potential impact of insurance claims based on the company s estimates after considering advice from in house and outside legal counsel as well as outside consultants 
actual results could differ materially from the estimates and assumptions that the company uses in the preparation of its financial statements 
revenue recognition sales revenue is recognized when ownership and all rewards and risks of loss have been transferred to the buyer  the price is fixed and determinable  and collectibility is reasonably assured 
revenue from services is recognized when performance of the services has been completed 
property  plant and equipment accounts include costs of assets constructed or purchased  related delivery and installation costs and interest incurred on significant capital projects during their construction periods 
expenditures for renewals and betterments also are capitalized  but expenditures for repairs and maintenance are expensed as incurred 
the cost and accumulated depreciation applicable to assets retired or sold are removed albemarle corporation and subsidiaries from the respective accounts  and gains or losses thereon are included in income 
depreciation is computed primarily by the straight line method based on the estimated useful lives of the assets 
the company evaluates historical and expected undiscounted operating cash flows of the related business segments or fair value of property  plant and equipment to determine the future recoverability of any property  plant and equipment recorded 
recorded property  plant and equipment is re evaluated on the same basis at the end of each accounting period whenever any significant permanent changes in business or circumstances have occurred which might impair recovery 
the costs of brine wells  leases and royalty interests are primarily amortized over the estimated average life of the field 
on a yearly basis for all fields  this approximates a units of production method based upon estimated reserves and production volumes

outlook as we began  we noted the slow global economy and the significant effect during on our polymer chemicals segment  particularly the electronics and the plastics markets which suffered from diminishing consumer demand throughout at that time  we were hopeful that market conditions would improve in after a difficult first half 
this situation again appears to be the case as we enter during we successfully overcame many of the obstacles thrown in our path by the economy and heightened global competition 
the company saw an increase in demand generally for the flame retardants sold into the polymer markets in  however  a sluggish holiday season in the united states raises concern about the prospects of a difficult first half in added to the concern of the global economy for the polymer chemicals segment is the continuing uncertainty in the agricultural market that began to affect albemarle s fine chemicals segment in the second half of albemarle management cautions that the first half of will likely resemble the fourth quarter of a good period for shipments  but presenting a challenge to the company to maintain focus on cost reductions  selective price increases and volume gains in order to deliver growth 
albemarle actively manages contract and spot buying programs for raw materials and energy costs to limit the risks and maximize the benefits of such purchases to the company 
in  the environment was favorable for many raw materials  and the company posted significant savings compared to as we enter  many suppliers are reviewing their pricing  and while the company is protected in many cases by long term contracts  the performance of our sourcing team will be harder to replicate in generally  the following key raw materials and energy cost annualized effects  exclusive of any corresponding increases in selling price  should be considered albemarle corporation and subsidiaries ethylene a 
lb price increase would impact earnings per share eps by cents  chlorine similarly ton change cents eps and natural gas mm btu change cents eps change including electricity impacts 
the company continues to generate good cash flow 
albemarle ended the year with a strong balance sheet and our net debt of million is similar to the start of the year 
during  we paid dividends of approximately million  made stock purchases of about million  incurred capital spending of million  including the investment in jbc and made a year end contribution of million to our pension fund 
this is a total of million 
we believe we can continue to sustain such a level going forward  and we remain cautious in our approach to uses of cash in and beyond 
priorities for investing in the business include capital expenditures and quality acquisitions that are synergistic to the company 
we will also maintain our strong dividend policy and will evaluate the repurchase of outstanding shares 
the company currently has authorization to repurchase over million shares 
in  we continued workforce reductions  where appropriate  as part of albemarle s ongoing efforts to control costs 
the company will continue to search for similar opportunities 
during capital spending should be similar to levels in the range of million  and the effective income tax rate will remain around 
albemarle forecasts a continuing reduction of pension income for compared to however  modifications in other areas of employee benefits programs could offset a portion of this impact 
going into  we will continue to monitor the effect that currency fluctuations could have on our business 
our polymer chemicals segment s potential in is colored by an uncertain world 
for example  the electronic printed wiring board book to bill ratio remains below one an important production ratio for the industry  but the number of shipments and bookings used in the calculation increased at the end of even though demand uncertainty is the watchphrase of the day  the company believes that first quarter will show improvement over the fourth quarter of albemarle s jbc joint venture began as a bromine plant  however jbc is poised to bring on additional capacity of a key flame retardant if market conditions dictate 
the company is expanding the diversification benefits from the halogen free flame retardant products added through the martinswerk acquisition and our joint venture  polymeradditives 
com 
the markets for mineral flame retardants include a number of areas that are not currently being served with brominated flame retardants 
in the organometallics area  specifically new catalysts  the company is optimistic that it will see continued growth as the polyolefin producers commercialize new products 
albemarle s technical expertise and manufacturing position in single site activators provides a platform for success in this business 
in the base business in  the company overcame the loss of certain aluminum alkyls business with additional sales in new catalysts and a number of other products 
stannica  a majority owned subsidiary that supplies organotin intermediates  became operational on april  stannica has more than met albemarle s high expectations  giving the company access to an important heat stabilizer market 
albemarle s sales in asia were up in  compared with this geographical region is an important growth area for both the polymer and fine chemicals segments 
there is an active program to enhance growth initiatives in the area  and a great percentage of business leadership time will be committed to the region in will be the first full year of operation of the albemarle chemicals shanghai company  ltd  a chinese company  which the company believes will have a much larger impact in the region in coming years based upon existing sales and supply efforts  joint ventures in the region and the anticipated growth of the market in china 
albemarle acquired ethyl s phenolic antioxidant business as we entered this business is a million revenue product area 
the acquisition builds upon the company s core strength in orthoalkylation chemistry and is a natural fit with the existing customer base 
albemarle previously served this business as a contract manufacturer for ethyl  this acquisition allows us to go further downstream to drive growth in this product area 
it is an example of the momentum our bolt on acquisition program has seen over the last several years  and we are very pleased with this business as we begin integrating it into our additives portfolio 
in the fine chemicals segment  albemarle made important strategic progress in despite the flat profit results 
in  agricultural products face a downturn in the overall agricultural economy  and the company remains cautious regarding whether this market has seen its bottom 
in addition  tough conditions in the custom chemicals manufacturing market provided a challenge for this product area 
performance chemicals and pharmaceutical products continue to provide good growth prospects in higher chlorine costs have continued to confront this business 
overall pricing  while mixed in  is expected to improve in uncertain agricultural chemicals demand  raw material price inflation and competitive custom manufacturing markets could affect our efforts 
this leads us to be cautiously albemarle corporation and subsidiaries optimistic about delivering profit increases for fine chemicals 
however  continued discipline in driving cost reductions  selective price increases and volume gains will be required to offset these headwinds 
the company has plans to address each of these areas 
albemarle believes that increased benefits from its new product efforts and success in filling flexible manufacturing assets also can be accomplished  leading the company to forecast positive performance in fine chemicals in fine chemicals ended with three straight quarters of sequential sales growth  an expanded new product pipeline  the full integration of the chemfirst custom fine chemicals business and martinswerk acquisitions  and a successful startup of the jbc bromine and derivatives manufacturing capacities 
albemarle began to market commercial sales from jbc  which the company believes will gather momentum in this startup was ahead of schedule and under budget and marks a major milestone in the strategy of global leadership in bromine related businesses 
additionally  the non flame retardant products from the martinswerk acquisition  the aluminum specialties  should continue to be important contributors to overall fine chemicals profit growth 
the acquisition of chemfirst custom fine chemicals manufacturing products and assets has enabled significant and positive fundamental changes to the way albemarle is driving its fine chemicals business 
the company s previously limited offering to the global life sciences market is now much more substantial  covering a broad array of offerings and services active ingredients  intermediates  custom manufacturing  and contract research 
albemarle s reception with customers has grown  the new product pipeline has filled  and the global flexible manufacturing assets are poised to benefit 
despite less than targeted profit results in from the acquired assets  the capabilities have led the company to pull similar  global capabilities together into a new business area  fine chemistry services intermediates  which it believes holds significant promise for profitable growth for albemarle 
finally  albemarle has focused great attention on the recently enacted sarbanes oxley act and related rules and regulations of the securities and exchange commission and the new york stock exchange 
as one example  the company has installed an internal disclosure and controls committee  and it intends to stay at the forefront of any corporate governance and financial control initiatives

an increase in pricing level based on the company s debt to capitalization ratio would not accelerate the maturity of our indebtedness thereunder 
however  an increase in our debt to capitalization ratio would result in an increase in the interest rate and fees payable under the credit agreement 
albemarle corporation and subsidiaries in addition  at december   the company had the flexibility to borrow up to a total of million million outstanding at december  under its various other credit arrangements 
the noncurrent portion of the company s long term debt amounted to million at december   compared to million at the end of the debt level at december   amounting to million  was reflected as current due to the maturity date of the credit facility

at december   the company s foreign currency translation adjustments  net of related deferred taxes  included in accumulated other comprehensive loss in the consolidated statement of changes in shareholders equity on page  increased from december   primarily due to the weakening of the us dollar against the euro 
capital expenditures in of million were lower than the level of million 
the company s capital spending program is expected to be in the million range over the next few years  with expenditures expected to expand capacities at existing facilities to support an expected increase in sales 
capital spending for environmental and safety projects is expected to be more in than the current year 
future capital spending is expected to be financed primarily with cash provided from operating activities  with the balance  if necessary  provided by additional debt 
the company continues to evaluate potential acquisitions of facilities and or businesses  particularly in areas where our know how adds value 
the following table summarizes the company s contractual obligations for capital projects  lines of credit  investments and various take or pay and throughput agreements contractual obligations payments due by period years years more than years take or pay throughput agreements unused lines of credit additional investment commitment payments capital projects other total environmental matters the company is subject to federal  state  local and foreign requirements regulating the handling  manufacture and use of materials some of which may be classified as hazardous or toxic by one or more regulatory agencies  the discharge of materials into the environment and the protection of the environment 
to the company s knowledge  it is currently complying and expects to continue to comply in all material respects with existing environmental laws  regulations  statutes and ordinances such compliance with federal  state  local and foreign environmental protection laws is not expected to have in the future a material effect on earnings or the competitive position of albemarle 
among other environmental requirements  the company is subject to the federal superfund law  and similar state laws  under which the company may be designated as a potentially responsible party prp and may be liable for a share of the costs associated with cleaning up various hazardous waste sites 
management believes that in most cases  the company s participation is de minimis 
further  almost all such sites represent environmental issues that are quite mature and have been investigated  studied and in many cases settled by the company or its predecessor company  ethyl 
in de minimis prp matters  the company s policy generally is to negotiate a consent decree and to pay any apportioned settlement  enabling the company to be effectively relieved of any further liability as a prp  except for remote contingencies 
in other than de minimis prp matters  the company s records indicate that unresolved exposures should be immaterial 
the company accrues and expenses its proportionate share of prp costs 
because management has been actively involved in evaluating environmental matters  the company is able to conclude that the outstanding environmental liabilities for unresolved prp sites should not be material to operations 
the company s environmental and safety operating costs charged to expense were approximately million in versus approximately million in and million in  excluding depreciation of previous albemarle corporation and subsidiaries capital expenditures  and are expected to be in the same range in the next few years 
costs for remediation have been accrued and payments related to sites are charged against accrued liabilities  which at december   totaled approximately million  up million  from december  there is a reasonable possibility that future remediation costs in excess of amounts already recorded could be up to million before income taxes 
however  the company believes that most of the amount it may be required to pay in connection with environmental remediation matters in excess of the amounts recorded should occur over a period of time and should not have a material adverse impact on its financial condition or results of operations  but could have a material adverse impact in a particular quarterly reporting period 
capital expenditures for pollution abatement and safety projects for the company  including such costs that are included in other projects  were approximately million  million and million in  and  respectively 
for each of the next few years  capital expenditures for these types of projects are likely to be equivalent to current year expenditures 
management s estimates of the effects of compliance with governmental pollution abatement and safety regulations are subject to i the possibility of changes in the applicable statutes and regulations or in judicial or administrative construction of such statutes and regulations  and ii uncertainty as to whether anticipated solutions to pollution problems will be successful  or whether additional expenditures may prove necessary

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk in the normal course of operations  the company is exposed to changes in financial market conditions due to the denomination of its business transactions in diverse foreign currencies and the company s ongoing manufacturing and funding activities 
as a result  future earnings  cash flows and fair values of assets and liabilities are subject to uncertainty 
the company has established policies  procedures and internal processes governing its management of albemarle corporation and subsidiaries uncertain market conditions  and uses both operational and financial market actions in its risk management activities  which include the use of derivative instruments 
the company does not use derivative instruments for trading purposes 
the company only enters into derivative contracts based on economic analysis of underlying exposures anticipating that adverse impacts on future earnings  cash flows and fair values due to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates will be offset by the proceeds from and changes in fair value of the derivative instruments 
the company does not hedge its exposure to market risks in a manner that completely eliminates the effects of changing market conditions on earnings  cash flows and fair values 
short term exposures to changing foreign currency exchange rates are primarily due to operating cash flows denominated in foreign currencies 
the company covers certain known and anticipated operating exposures by using forward contracts 
the primary currencies for which the company has foreign currency exchange rate exposure are the euro  japanese yen  british pound sterling and the us dollar in certain of its foreign locations 
in response to the greater fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates in recent periods  the company has increased the degree of risk management activities to minimize their impact on earnings of future periods 
the company s financial instruments  subject to foreign currency exchange risk  consist of foreign currency forward contracts and represented a net asset position of 
million at december  the company conducted a sensitivity analysis on the fair value of its foreign currency hedge portfolio assuming instantaneous changes in foreign currency exchange rates from their levels as of december   with all other variables held constant 
a appreciation of the us dollar against foreign currencies would result in an increase of million in the fair value of foreign currency exchange hedging contracts 
a depreciation of the us dollar against foreign currencies would result in a decrease of million in the fair value of foreign currency exchange hedging contracts 
the sensitivity in fair value of the foreign currency hedge portfolio represents changes in fair values estimated based on market conditions as of december   without reflecting the effects of underlying anticipated transactions 
when those anticipated transactions are realized  actual effects of changing foreign currency exchange rates could have a material impact on earnings and cash flows in future periods 
the company is exposed to changes in interest rates that could impact its results of operations and financial condition 
the company manages the worldwide exposure of its interest rate risks and foreign exchange exposure through its regular operations and financing activities 
the company utilizes a credit agreement as its primary source of financing  which could expose the company to changes in interest rates  if various financial covenants are not met 
the company manages its ratio of debt to capitalization with the objective of achieving the lowest interest rate possible 
raw materials used by the company are subject to price volatility caused by weather  supply conditions  political and economic variables and other unpredictable factors 
the company does not use futures  options and swap contracts to manage the volatility related to the above exposures 
however  management seeks to limit its exposure by entering into long term contracts when available
