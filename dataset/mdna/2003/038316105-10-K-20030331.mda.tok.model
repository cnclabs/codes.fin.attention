critical accounting policies and estimates this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations discusses the company s condensed consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
management bases its estimates and assumptions on expected or known trends or events  historical experience and various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 

table of contents management believes the following critical accounting policies  among others  involve the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition revenue from software licensing and service fees is recognized in accordance with statement of position sop  software revenue recognition  and sop software revenue recognition with respect to certain transactions 
substantially all of the company s product license revenue is earned from licenses of off the shelf software requiring no customization 
accordingly  the company recognizes revenue from software licensing when all of the following criteria are met persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists via a signed agreement or purchase order  delivery has occurred including authorization keys  the fee is fixed or determinable representing amounts that are due unconditionally with no future obligations under customary payment terms  and collectibility is probable 
revenue from consulting and training is recognized at the time the services are rendered 
for contracts with multiple obligations eg  deliverable and undeliverable products  support obligations  consulting  and training services  the company allocates revenue to each element of the contract based on vendor specific objective evidence vsoe of the fair value of the elements 
the company has determined fair value based upon prices it charges customers when these elements are sold separately 
maintenance contracts are generally sold with the initial licenses 
the related maintenance revenue is deferred based upon vsoe  which is determined by the renewal price of the annual maintenance contract  and is recognized ratably over the maintenance contract period 
the company recognizes consulting and training service revenues  including those sold with license fees  as the services are performed based upon their established vsoe 
the company determines the amount of revenue to allocate to the licenses sold with services or maintenance using the residual method of accounting 
under the residual method  the company allocates the total value of the arrangement first to the undelivered elements based on their vsoe and the remainder to the delivered element  the software license 
in those instances in which indirect channel partners provides certain support services under the maintenance support contracts to the end user customer  the company accounts for amounts received in these arrangements in accordance with emerging issues task force  reporting revenue gross as a principal versus net as an agent 
the company must make certain judgments in these types of arrangements including whether the company or the indirect channel partners is in the principal obligor in the arrangement with the end user customer 
accounts receivable and bad debt the company maintains allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of its customers to make required payments 
the company continuously monitors collections and payments from its customers and determines the allowance for doubtful accounts based upon analysis of aged accounts receivable  historical experience and specific customer collection issues 
an allowance for doubtful accounts is provided for accounts which management believes may not be collected due to a customer s financial circumstance eg bankruptcy  and for all accounts which are over days past due  absent evidence which supports their collectibility 
if the financial condition of the company s customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  or the company s overdue receivables balance were to increase significantly  additional allowances may be required 
the company generally invoices the customer in the same local currency as to be paid by the customer 
the company does not hedge its foreign customer receivables due to the relatively small exposure from foreign currency rate fluctuations 
software development costs the company accounts for software development costs in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for the costs of computer software to be sold  leased  or marketed 
sfas no 

table of contents specifies that software development costs incurred internally should be expensed as incurred until technological feasibility has been established 
once technological feasibility has been established  all software development costs should be capitalized until the product is available for general release to customers 
judgment is required in determining when the technological feasibility of products is established 
the company considers technological feasibility to be achieved when a product design and working model of the software product have been completed and the software product is ready for initial customer testing 
capitalized software development costs are amortized as a cost of software license revenue over the estimated product life 
development costs not capitalized under the policy are classified as a development expense in the same period as incurred 
if management determines that the recoverability of these unamortized capitalized software costs is not probable based on its cash flow estimates  these costs may require adjustment to their net realizable value  which could affect the results of the reporting period 
accounting for cost based investments in assessing potential impairment for cost based investments  the company considers various factors including but not limited to a company s financial performance  anticipated funding needs  comparable companies performance  and volatility inherent in the external market for these investments 
if these factors are not supportive of the carrying value of the investment  the company may record impairment charges not previously recognized to reflect management s best estimate of recoverability 
with the divestment of its vistasource business unit  the company retained a cost based investment in real time international  inc that was deemed to have no value at the date of the transaction 
the company also has a cost based investment in turbolinux  inc  which was determined to be impaired  resulting in recognition of a  impairment loss in goodwill and other intangible assets and related impairment during  the company completed its acquisition of dynamic decisions and recorded goodwill in the amount of  associated with the excess purchase price over the fair value of the net assets acquired and identifiable intangible assets of  assigned to identified customer relationships 
the amounts assigned to the identifiable assets and liabilities acquired in connection with the acquisition were based on estimated fair values at the date of acquisition 
the fair values were determined by the company s management  based in part upon information supplied by the management of the acquired business and a valuation prepared by an independent appraiser 
the valuation of identified customer relationships has been based primarily upon future cash flow projections discounted to present value using a risk adjusted discount rate 
in assessing the recoverability of the company s goodwill and other intangible assets  the company must make assumptions regarding estimated future cash flows and other factors including legal factors  market conditions and operational performance of its acquired businesses to determine the fair value of the respective assets 
if these estimates or their related assumptions change in the future  the company may be required to record impairment charges for these assets not previously recorded 
if events change and the company has overestimated the economic life of its intangible asset  the company will begin to amortize the remaining unamortized carrying value of this asset over the newly estimated life  which may result in additional amortization expense 
restructuring during and  the company recorded charges in connection with its restructuring programs 
these charges include estimates pertaining to employee separation costs and the settlements of contractual obligations resulting from the company s actions 
although the company does not anticipate significant changes  the actual costs may differ from these estimates  which would result in adjustments to the original estimates 

table of contents deferred taxes the company accounts for income taxes in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
accounting for income taxes sfas no 
which requires that deferred tax assets and liabilities be recognized using enacted tax rates for the effect of temporary differences between the book and tax bases of recorded assets and liabilities 
sfas no 
also requires that deferred tax assets be reduced by a valuation allowance if it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax asset will not be realized 
the company evaluates quarterly the realizability of its deferred tax assets by assessing its valuation allowance and by adjusting the amount of such allowance  if necessary 
at december  and december   the company s deferred tax assets were fully reserved 
in the event the company were to determine in the future that it would be able to realize its deferred tax assets in excess of its net recorded amount  an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would increase income in the period such determination was made

the 
table of contents company made progress in towards decreasing operating losses for the year compared to the prior year 
additionally  the company improved its cash flow and improved its cash position at december  the company currently expects that the principal sources of funding for its operating expenses  capital expenditures and other liquidity needs will be a combination of its available cash balances  which includes funds received from the sale of the company s crm business see note and funds generated from operations and its accounts receivable purchase facility 
the company believes that its currently available sources of funds will be sufficient to fund its operations for at least the next months 
however  there are a number of factors that may negatively impact the company s available sources of funds 
the amount of cash generated from operations will be dependent upon such factors as the successful execution of the company s business plan  the market acceptance of applix integra  and worldwide economic conditions including information technology spending 
should the company not meet its plans to generate sufficient revenue or positive cash flows  it may need to raise additional capital or reduce spending

risk factors our stock price may be adversely affected by significant fluctuations in our quarterly results 
we expect to experience significant fluctuations in our future results of operations due to a variety of factors  many of which are outside of our control  including demand for and market acceptance of our products and services  the size and timing of customer orders  particularly large orders  some of which represent more than of total revenue during a particular quarter  introduction of products and services or enhancements by us and our competitors  competitive factors that affect our pricing  the mix of products and services we sell  the hiring and retention of key personnel  our expansion into international markets  the timing and magnitude of our capital expenditures  including costs relating to the expansion of our operations  the acquisition and retention of key partners  changes in generally accepted accounting policies  especially those related to the recognition of software revenue  and new government legislation or regulation 
we typically receive a majority of our orders in the last month of each fiscal quarter because our customers often delay purchases of products until the end of the quarter and our sales organization and our individual sales representatives strive to meet quarterly sales targets 
as a result  any delay in anticipated sales is likely to result in the deferral of the associated revenue beyond the end of a particular quarter  which would have a significant effect on our operating results for that quarter 
in addition  most of our operating expenses do not vary directly with net sales and are difficult to adjust in the short term 
as a result  if net sales for a particular quarter were below expectations  we could not proportionately reduce operating expenses for that quarter  and  therefore  that revenue shortfall would have a disproportionate adverse effect on our operating results for that quarter 
if our operating results are below the expectations of public market analysts and investors  the price of our common stock may fall significantly 
our future success is dependent in large part on the success of applix integra 
we have devoted a substantial amount of resources to the development and marketing of our new applix integra product 
we believe that our future financial performance will be dependent in large part on the success of applix integra 
because applix integra just became available for commercial shipments on october   we cannot yet assess its market acceptance or predict with accuracy the amount of revenue it will generate 
we may not be able to fulfill any future capital needs 
we have incurred losses from continuing operations for the last several years 
operating losses and negative cash flows may continue because of costs and expenses relating to brand development  marketing 
table of contents and other promotional activities  continued development of our information technology infrastructure  expansion of product offerings and development of relationships with other businesses 
although we made progress throughout towards decreasing operating losses as compared to  there can be no assurance that we will achieve a profitable level of operations in the future 
we believe  based upon our current business plan  that our current cash and cash equivalents  funds expected to be generated from operations and available credit lines should be sufficient to fund our operations as planned for at least the next twelve months 
however  we may need additional funds sooner than anticipated if our performance deviates significantly from our current business plan or if there are significant changes in competitive or other market factors 
if we elect to raise additional operating funds  such funds  whether from equity or debt financing or other sources  may not be available  or available on terms acceptable to us 
if we do not introduce new products and services in a timely manner  our products and services will become obsolete  and our operating results will suffer 
the business performance management and business intelligence markets  including in interactive planning  budgeting and analytics are characterized by rapid technological change  frequent new product enhancements  uncertain product life cycles  changes in customer demands and evolving industry standards 
our products could be rendered obsolete if products based on new technologies are introduced or new industry standards emerge 
enterprise computing environments are inherently complex 
as a result  we cannot accurately estimate the life cycles of our products 
new products and product enhancements can require long development and testing periods  which requires us to hire and retain technically competent personnel 
significant delays in new product releases or significant problems in installing or implementing new products could seriously damage our business 
we have  on occasion  experienced delays in the scheduled introduction of new and enhanced products and may experience similar delays in the future 
our future success depends upon our ability to enhance existing products  develop and introduce new products  satisfy customer requirements and achieve market acceptance 
we may not successfully identify new product opportunities and develop and bring new products to market in a timely and cost effective manner 
attempts to expand by means of business combinations and acquisitions may not be successful and may disrupt our operations or harm our revenues 
we have in the past  and may in the future  buy businesses  products or technologies 
in the event of any future purchases  we will face additional financial and operational risks  including difficulty in assimilating the operations  technology and personnel of acquired companies  disruption in our business because of the allocation of resources to consummate these transactions and the diversion of management s attention from our core business  difficulty in retaining key technical and managerial personnel from acquired companies  dilution of our stockholders  if we issue equity to fund these transactions  assumption of increased expenses and liabilities  our relationships with existing employees  customers and business partners may be weakened or terminated as a result of these transactions  and additional ongoing expenses associated with write downs of goodwill and other purchased intangible assets 

table of contents we rely heavily on key personnel 
we rely heavily on key personnel throughout the organization 
we have engaged david mahoney  one of our directors  to serve as interim president and chief executive officer  and we are currently seeking a permanent president and chief executive officer 
the transition of these positions to mr 
mahoney and any transition to a permanent president and chief executive officer may result in the distraction of management and a delay in our ability to execute our business strategies 
the loss of any of our other members of management  or any of our staff of sales and development professionals  could prevent us from successfully executing our business strategies 
any such loss of technical knowledge and industry expertise could negatively impact our success 
moreover  the loss of any critical employees or a group thereof  particularly to a competing organization  could cause us to lose market share  and the applix brand could be diminished 
we may not be able to meet the operational and financial challenges that we encounter in our international operations 
due to the company s significant international operations  we face a number of additional challenges associated with the conduct of business overseas 
for example we may have difficulty managing and administering a globally dispersed business  fluctuations in exchange rates may negatively affect our operating results  we may not be able to repatriate the earnings of our foreign operations  we have to comply with a wide variety of foreign laws  we may not be able to adequately protect our trademarks overseas due to the uncertainty of laws and enforcement in certain countries relating to the protection of intellectual property rights  reductions in business activity during the summer months in europe and certain other parts of the world could negatively impact the operating results of our foreign operations  export controls could prevent us from shipping our products into and from some markets  multiple and possibly overlapping tax structures could significantly reduce the financial performance of our foreign operations  changes in import export duties and quotas could affect the competitive pricing of our products and services and reduce our market share in some countries  and economic or political instability in some international markets could result in the forfeiture of some foreign assets and the loss of sums spent developing and marketing those assets 
because the business performance management and business intelligence markets are highly competitive  we may not be able to succeed 
if we fail to compete successfully in the highly competitive and rapidly changing business performance management and business intelligence markets  we may not be able to succeed 
we face competition primarily from business intelligence firms 
we also face competition from traditional call center technology providers  large enterprise application software vendors  independent systems integrators  consulting firms and in house it departments 
because barriers to entry into the software market are relatively low  we expect to face additional competition in the future 
many of our competitors can devote significantly more resources to the development  promotion and sale of products than we can  and many of them can respond to new technologies and changes in customer preferences more quickly than we can 
further  other companies with resources greater than ours may attempt to gain market share in the customer analytics and business planning markets by acquiring or forming strategic alliances with our competitors 

table of contents because we depend on third party systems integrators to sell our products  our operating results will likely suffer if we do not develop and maintain these relationships 
we rely in part on systems integrators to promote  sell and implement our solutions 
if we fail to maintain and develop relationships with systems integrators  our operating results will likely suffer 
in addition  if we are unable to rely on systems integrators to install and implement our products  we will likely have to provide these services ourselves  resulting in increased costs 
as a result  our results of operation may be harmed 
in addition  systems integrators may develop  market or recommend products that compete with our products 
further  if these systems integrators fail to implement our products successfully  our reputation may be harmed 
because the sales cycle for our products can be lengthy  it is difficult for us to predict when or whether a sale will be made 
the timing of our revenue is difficult to predict in large part due to the length and variability of the sales cycle for our products 
companies often view the purchase of our products as a significant and strategic decision 
as a result  companies tend to take significant time and effort evaluating our products 
the amount of time and effort depends in part on the size and the complexity of the deployment 
this evaluation process frequently results in a lengthy sales cycle  typically ranging from three to six months 
during this time we may incur substantial sales and marketing expenses and expend significant management efforts 
we do not recoup these investments if the prospective customer does not ultimately license our product 
our business will be harmed if we are unable to protect our trademarks from misuse by third parties 
our collection of trademarks is important to our business 
the protective steps we take or have taken may be inadequate to deter misappropriation of our trademark rights 
we have filed applications for registration of some of our trademarks in the united states 
effective trademark protection may not be available in every country in which we offer or intend to offer our products and services 
failure to protect our trademark rights adequately could damage our brand identity and impair our ability to compete effectively 
furthermore  defending or enforcing our trademark rights could result in the expenditure of significant financial and managerial resources 
our products may contain defects that may be costly to correct  delay market acceptance of our products and expose us to litigation 
despite testing by applix and our customers  errors may be found in our products after commencement of commercial shipments 
if errors are discovered  we may have to make significant expenditures of capital to eliminate them and yet may not be able to successfully correct them in a timely manner or at all 
errors and failures in our products could result in a loss of  or delay in  market acceptance of our products and could damage our reputation and our ability to convince commercial users of the benefits of our products 
in addition  failures in our products could cause system failures for our customers who may assert warranty and other claims for substantial damages against us 
although our license agreements with our customers typically contain provisions designed to limit our exposure to potential product liability claims  it is possible that these provisions may not be effective or enforceable under the laws of some jurisdictions 
our insurance policies may not adequately limit our exposure to this type of claim 
these claims  even if unsuccessful  could be costly and time consuming to defend 

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk as a multinational corporation  the company is exposed to market risk  primarily from changes in foreign exchange rates 
these exposures may change over time and could have a material adverse impact on the company s financial results 
most of the company s international sales through its subsidiaries are denominated in foreign currencies 
relative to foreign currency exposures existing at december   a unfavorable movement in foreign exchange rates would not expose the company to significant losses in earnings or cash flows 
to date  foreign currency fluctuations have not had a material effect on the company s operating results 
at december   the company held  in cash equivalents  including  of restricted cash  consisting primarily of money market funds 
cash equivalents are classified as available for sale and carried at fair value  which approximates cost 
a hypothetical increase in interest rates would not have a material impact on the fair market value of these instruments due to their short maturity and the company s intention that all the securities will be sold within one year 
there have been no significant changes in cash equivalents since december
