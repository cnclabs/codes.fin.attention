item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview emeritus is a washington corporation organized by daniel r 
baty and two other founders in in november  we completed our initial public offering and began our expansion strategy 
through  we focused on rapidly expanding our operations in order to assemble a portfolio of assisted living communities with a critical mass of capacity 
we pursued an aggressive acquisition and development strategy during that time  acquiring and developing communities in  acquiring and developing communities in  and developing communities in during and continuing through  we substantially reduced our pace of acquisition and development activities to concentrate on improving our operations and increasing occupancy and our average revenue per unit 
in  along with a focus on operations  we selectively acquired  leased  and managed additional communities

   percentage increase decrease included in our consolidated portfolio of communities 
the percentage increase decrease indicates the change from the prior period 
the communities under development at december   were developed by third parties  but are currently managed by emeritus 
the leased communities are all operating leases  in which the revenues and expenses from these communities are included in the consolidated statement of operations but the assets and liabilities are not included in the consolidated balance sheets 
we rely primarily on our residents ability to pay our charges for services from their own or familial resources and expect that we will do so for the foreseeable future 
although care in an assisted living community is typically less expensive than in a skilled nursing facility  we believe that generally only seniors with income or assets meeting or exceeding the regional median can afford to reside in our communities 
inflation or other circumstances that adversely affect seniors ability to pay for assisted living services could therefore have an adverse effect on our business 
all sources of resident related revenue other than residents private resources constitute less than of our total revenues 
we have incurred net operating losses since our inception  and as of december   we had an accumulated deficit of approximately million 
these losses resulted from a number of factors  including occupancy levels at our communities that were lower for longer periods than we originally anticipated and have declined in the last two years  financing costs that we incurred as a result of multiple financing and refinancing transactions  and administrative and corporate expenses that we incurred to facilitate our growth and maintain operations 
during  we decided to reduce acquisition and development activities and dispose of selected communities that had been operating at a loss 
we believe that slowing our acquisition and development activities has enabled us to use our resources more efficiently and increase our focus on enhancing community operations 
in  along with a focus on operations  we selectively acquired additional communities and new management contracts 
emeritrust transactions in two separate transactions during the fall of and the spring of  we arranged for two investor groups to purchase an aggregate of of our operating communities and five communities under development for a total purchase price of approximately million 
of the communities involved  had been  or were proposed to be leased to us by meditrust company llc under sale leaseback financing arrangements  and three had been owned by us 
the first purchase  consisting of communities  which we call the emeritrust i communities  was completed in december and the second purchase  consisting of communities  of which we call the emeritrust ii operating communities and five of which we call the emeritrust ii development communities  was completed in march of the million purchase price for the emeritrust i communities  million was financed through a three year first mortgage loan with an independent party and million was financed through subordinated debt and equity investments from the investor group  which includes daniel r 
baty  our chief executive officer  who is also a director and a principal shareholder 
of the million purchase price for the emeritrust ii operating communities and emeritrust ii development communities  approximately million was financed through three year first mortgage loans with independent third parties and million was financed through subordinated debt and equity investments from the investor group  which includes mr 
baty 
the investor groups retained us to manage all of the communities through december   and granted us options to purchase the communities during during  the emeritrust i communities failed to comply with covenants under the million mortgage loan and in it became clear that we would not be able to purchase the communities under the options 
as a result  the mortgage loans were restructured and the management agreements and options to purchase were extended to june  to december  in the case of the five emeritrust ii development communities 
the discussion below reflects the terms of these arrangements as modified 
from january   through june   we will receive for the emeritrust i communities a base management fee of of gross revenues generated by the communities and an additional management fee of  payable out of of cash flow 
the availability of operating cash flow to pay management fees is subject to first meeting mandatory owner distribution requirements  which include repayment of fees and expenses related to restructuring the mortgage loan and subsequent extension in september for the emeritrust ii operating communities and the emeritrust ii development communities  we have received and continue to receive a base management fee of of gross revenues and an additional management fee of  payable to the extent that the communities meet certain cash flow standards 
prior to january   the management fees for the emeritrust i communities were computed in this fashion 
under the management agreements  we are obligated to reimburse the investor groups for cumulative cash operating losses greater than million in the case of the emeritrust i communities and million in the case of the emeritrust ii development communities 
since these thresholds have been exceeded  we are currently responsible for most cash operating losses generated by these communities if they occur 
there is no such funding arrangement with respect to the emeritrust ii operating communities 
our funding obligations for the emeritrust i communities have been  million  and million for  and  respectively 
our funding obligations for the emeritrust ii development communities have been   and million in   and  respectively 
although the amounts of our funding obligation each year include management fees earned by us under the management agreements  we do not recognize these management fees as revenue in our financial statements to the extent that we are funding the cash operating losses that include them 
correspondingly  we recognize the funding obligation under the agreement  less the applicable management fees  as an expense in our financial statements under the category other  net 
conversely  if the applicable management fees exceed our funding obligation  we recognize the management fees less the funding obligation as management fee revenue in our consolidated financial statements 
management fees earned for the emeritrust i communities have been million  million  and million in   and  respectively  of which million  million  and zero  have been recognized in   and  respectively 
management fees earned for the emeritrust ii development communities have been   and  of which   and  have been recognized in   and  respectively 
management fees earned for the emeritrust ii operating communities have been million earned and recognized in each of the years    and we have an option to purchase of the emeritrust communities and a right of first refusal with respect to the remaining three communities  both of which expire june  for the emeritrust operating communities and december   for the emeritrust development communities 
the option must be exercised with respect to all communities or may not be exercised at all 
if investor groups require mr 
baty to purchase certain of the communities  upon the conditions described below  we have the right to exercise our option within days of receiving notice of this action 
the option price for the emeritrust communities is equal to the original cost of the communities of approximately million  plus an amount that would provide the investor groups with an rate of return  compounded annually  on their original investment of million less any cash distributions received 
in connection with the exercise of the option  we are also obligated to pay certain costs and fees 
based upon current market conditions and valuations  we believe the option purchase price for these facilities exceeds their current fair market value 
the management agreements  including the options to purchase the related communities  are subject to various termination provisions  including cross default provisions among all three groups of communities 
the management agreement for the emeritrust i communities may be terminated if cash distributions to the investor group do not meet certain levels or if the communities fail to meet certain coverage requirements under the mortgage loan 
in addition  certain of the communities have been refinanced and  accordingly  our ability to exercise the option will depend on whether we can assume or refinance the debt secured by these communities 
termination of the management agreements or failure to exercise the options could result in the loss of management fees and the substantial decrease in the number of communities we operate 
under related agreements  the investor groups may require mr 
baty to purchase between ten and twelve of the emeritrust communities  depending on the occurrence of any one of the following events a we do not exercise our option to purchase the communities before the option expires  b we default under the management agreements  c mr 
baty s net worth falls below a certain threshold  d we experience a change of control or e mr 
baty ceases to be our chief executive officer 
if mr 
baty is required to purchase some of the communities  he will also have the option to purchase all of the emeritrust communities on the same terms under which we are entitled purchase the communities  subject to our prior right to do so within a specified time period 
the management agreements and related options to purchase these communities expire june   except that management agreements with respect to five communities would continue until december  
because we are not in a position to exercise the options to acquire the communities prior to expiration  we are currently in discussions with the owners of the communities and their lenders to extend the management agreements and related options 
while we believe that these arrangements will be extended  we cannot guarantee that these discussions will be successful or  if the arrangements are extended  what the terms will be 
if we are unsuccessful  we could lose the management fee revenue from these communities and future rights with respect to them 
other transactions in january  we entered into management and accounting services agreements with regent assisted living  inc of portland  oregon  to manage or provide administrative services to of their communities 
the agreements provide for us to receive a fixed base management service fee with some agreements having provisions for incentive fees based upon improved community performance

results of operations summary of significant accounting policies and use of estimates emeritus s discussion and analysis of its financial condition and results of operations are based upon emeritus s consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires emeritus to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an ongoing basis  emeritus evaluates its estimates  including those related to resident programs and incentives  bad debts  investments  intangible assets  income taxes  financing operations  restructuring  long term service contracts  contingencies  self insured retention  health insurance  and litigation 
emeritus bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
emeritus believes the following accounting policies are most significant to the judgments and estimates used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements 
revisions in such estimates are charged to income in the period in which the facts that give rise to the revision become known 
emeritus utilizes third party insurance for losses and liabilities associated with general and professional liability insurance claims subject to established self insured retention levels on a per occurrence basis 
losses up to these self insured retention levels are accrued based upon actuarially determined estimates of the aggregate liability for claims incurred 
for health insurance  emeritus self insures up to a certain level for each occurrence above which a catastrophic insurance policy covers any additional costs 
health insurance expense is accrued based upon historical experience of the aggregate liability for claims incurred 
if these estimates are insufficient  additional charges may be required 
emeritus maintains allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of its residents to make required payments 
if the financial condition of emeritus s residents were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional charges may be required 
emeritus holds shares in arv assisted living  inc amounting to less than of its shares 
arv is publicly traded and has a volatile share price 
emeritus records an investment impairment charge when it believes this investment has experienced a decline in value that is other than temporary 
future adverse changes in market conditions or poor operating results underlying this investment could result in losses or an inability to recover the carrying value of the investment that may not be reflected in this investment s current carrying value  thereby possibly requiring an impairment charge in the future 
emeritus records a valuation allowance to reduce its deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized  which at this time shows a net asset valuation of zero 
while emeritus has considered future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for the valuation allowance  in the event emeritus were to determine that it would be able to realize its deferred tax assets in the future in excess of its net recorded amount  an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would increase income in the period such determination was made

these results were partially offset by a decrease in occupancy to in from in for the year ended december   our net income decreased to million from million for  primarily as a result of increased community operating expenses mainly due to higher health and workers compensation insurance costs in compared to net income was also reduced by an increase in additional rent expense from existing leases due to contingent rent expense and increased by lower interest expense related to the december  refinancing see other transactions 
liquidity and capital resources for the year ended december   net cash provided by operating activities was million compared to million of cash provided in operating activities for the prior year 
the primary component of the operating cash provided in the year ended december   was an increase in deferred revenue of million and an increase in other liabilities of million offset by an increase in prepaid expenses of million and a decrease in accrued interest of million 
net cash provided by investing activities amounted to million for the year ended december   and was comprised primarily of proceeds from sale of property and equipment related to refinancing of four communities through sale leaseback transactions  which was partially offset by the acquisition of property  equipment  new leases  and lease improvements 
for the year ended december   net cash used in financing activities was million primarily from short term and long term debt repayments and other financing costs  offset by proceeds from long term borrowings 
for the year ended december   net cash used in financing activities was million primarily from short term and long term debt repayments 
we have incurred significant operating losses since our inception and have a working capital deficit of million  although million represents deferred revenue and million of preferred dividends is due only if declared by the company s board of directors 
in and we reported positive net cash from operating activities in our consolidated statements of cash flows 
at times in the past  however  we have been dependent upon third party financing or disposition of assets to fund operations and we cannot guarantee that  if necessary in the future  such transactions will be available timely or at all  or on terms attractive to us 
in  we refinanced substantially all of our debt obligations  extending the maturities of such financings to dates in or thereafter  at which time we will need to refinance or otherwise repay the obligations 
many of our debt instruments and leases contain cross default provisions pursuant to which a default under one obligation can cause a default under one or more other obligations to the same lender or lessor 
such cross default provisions affect owned assisted living properties and operated under leases 
accordingly  any event of default could cause a material adverse effect on our financial condition if such debt or leases are cross defaulted 
management believes that the company will be able to sustain positive operating cash flow at least through and will have adequate cash for all necessary investing and financing activities including required debt service and capital expenditures

impact of inflation to date  inflation has not had a significant impact on emeritus 
inflation could  however  affect our future revenues and operating income due to our dependence on the senior resident population  most of whom rely on relatively fixed incomes to pay for our services 
the monthly charges for the resident s unit and assisted living services are influenced by the location of the community and local competition 
our ability to increase revenues in proportion to increased operating expenses may be limited 
we typically do not rely to a significant extent on governmental reimbursement programs 
in pricing our services  we attempt to anticipate inflation levels  but there can be no assurance that we will be able to respond to inflationary pressures in the future 
risk factors our business  results of operations and financial condition are subject to many risks  including  but not limited to  those set forth below the following important factors  among others  could cause actual operating results to differ materially from those expressed in forward looking statements included in this report and presented elsewhere by our management from time to time 
do not place undue reliance on these forward looking statements  which speak only as of the date of this report 
a number of the matters and subject areas discussed in this report refer to potential future circumstances  operations and prospects  and therefore  are not historical or current facts 
the discussion of such matters and subject areas is qualified by the inherent risks and uncertainties surrounding future expectations  which may materially differ from our actual future experience involving any one or more of such matters and subject areas as a result of various factors  including possible excess assisted living capacity in our market areas affecting our occupancy and pricing levels  uncertainties in increasing occupancy and pricing  generally  effective management of costs and the effects of cost increases beyond our control  such as utilities and insurance  the difficulty in reducing and eliminating continuing operating losses  vulnerability to defaults in our debt and lease financing as a result of noncompliance with various covenants  the effects of cross default terms  competition  and uncertainties relating to construction  licensing  environmental  and other matters that affect acquisition  disposition and development of assisted living communities 
we have attempted to identify  in context  certain of the factors that may cause actual future experience and results to differ from our current expectations regarding the relevant matter or subject area 
we are not obligated to publicly release the results of any revisions to these forward looking statements that may be made to reflect events or circumstances after the date of this report or to reflect the occurrence of unanticipated events 
these and other factors are discussed in more detail below 
we have incurred losses since we began doing business and may continue to incur losses for the foreseeable future 
we organized and began operations in july and have operated at a loss since we began doing business 
for   and  we recorded net losses before preferred dividends of million  million  and million  respectively 
we believe that the historically aggressive growth of our portfolio through acquisitions and developments and related financing activities were among the causes of these losses 
to date  at many of our communities  we have been generally unable to stabilize occupancy and rate structures to levels that result in positive cash flow and earnings for the company as a whole 
our operations may not become profitable in line with our current expectations or may not become profitable at all 
if we cannot generate sufficient cash flow to cover required interest  principal and lease payments  we risk defaults on our debt agreements and operating leases 
at december   we had total debt of million  with minimum principal payments of about million due in at december   we were obligated under long term operating leases requiring minimum annual lease payments of which million is payable in in addition  we will have approximately million and million in principal amount of debt repayment obligations that become due in and  respectively 
if we are unable to generate sufficient cash flow to make such payments as required and are unable to renegotiate payments or obtain additional equity or debt financing  a lender could foreclose on our communities secured by the respective indebtedness or  in the case of an operating lease  could terminate our lease  resulting in loss of income and asset value 
in some cases  our indebtedness is secured by a particular community and a pledge of our interests in a subsidiary entity that owns that community 
in the event of a default  a lender could avoid judicial procedures required to foreclose on real property by foreclosing on our pledge instead  thus accelerating its acquisition of that community 
furthermore  because of cross default and cross collateralization provisions in certain of our mortgage and sale leaseback agreements  if we default on one of our payment obligations  we could adversely affect a significant number of our communities 
because we are highly leveraged  we may not be able to respond to changing business and economic conditions or continue with selected acquisitions 
a substantial portion of our future cash flow will be devoted to debt service and lease payments 
in the past  we have frequently been dependent on third party financing and disposition of assets to fund these obligations in full and we may be required to do so in the future 
in addition  we are periodically required to refinance these obligations as they mature 
these circumstances reduce our flexibility and ability to respond to our business needs  including changing business and financial conditions such as increasing interest rates and opportunities to expand our business through selected acquisitions 
we may be unable to increase or stabilize our occupancy rates that would result in positive earnings 
in previous years we had difficulty increasing our occupancy levels 
our historical losses have resulted  in part  from lower than expected occupancy levels at our newly developed and acquired communities 
although we have reduced our acquisition and development activity  we have been unable to increase occupancy levels as we had anticipated and  during the last year  occupancy levels declined 
we cannot guarantee that our occupancy levels will increase 
we will occasionally seek additional funding through public or private financing  including equity financing 
we may not find adequate equity  debt  or sale leaseback financing when we need it or on terms acceptable to us 
this could affect our ability to finance our operations or refinance our properties to avoid the consequences of default and foreclosure under our existing financing as described above 
in addition  if we raise additional funds by issuing equity securities  our shareholders may experience dilution of their investment 
we may be unable to obtain the additional capital we will need to retain important segments of our operating communities 
we manage of our operating communities under short term management agreements expiring june   for the communities  which we have referred to throughout this document as the emeritrust i and emeritrust ii operating communities  and december   for the remaining five emeritrust ii development communities 
we also have options to purchase communities  and a right of first refusal to purchase three of these communities prior to december   for the five emeritrust ii development communities  and june   for the remaining communities 
based on formulas in the options  the purchase prices of the communities would be substantially greater than the original purchase prices paid by the investor groups that currently own them  depending on when the purchase occurs and the performance of the communities 
if we are unable to obtain the capital and related mortgage financing necessary to complete these purchases  we could lose control of these communities and the right to operate them  which represents about of our total operating capacity 
the loss of these operating communities would have a material adverse effect on our revenues and results of operations 
if we fail to comply with financial covenants contained in our debt instruments  our lenders may accelerate the related debt 
from time to time  we failed to comply with certain covenants in our financing agreements 
in the future we may not be able to comply with these covenants  which generally relate to matters such as cash flow  and debt coverage ratios 
if we fail to comply with any of these requirements  our lenders could accelerate the related indebtedness so that it becomes due and payable prior to its stated due date 
we may be unable to pay or refinance this debt if it becomes due 
our liability insurance may be insufficient to cover the liabilities we face 
in recent years  participants in the long term care industry have faced an increasing number of lawsuits alleging negligence  malpractice or related legal theories 
many of these suits involve large claims and significant legal costs 
we expect that we occasionally will face such suits because of the nature of our business 
we currently maintain insurance policies with coverage and self insured retention with respect to general and professional liability and deductibles with respect to auto liability and property damage claims we deem appropriate based on the nature and risks of our business  historical experience  industry standards  and the availability of insurance 
we could incur liability in excess of our insurance coverage or experience claims not covered by our insurance  including punitive damages 
claims against us  regardless of their merit or eventual outcome  may also undermine our ability to attract residents or expand our business and would require management to devote time to matters unrelated to the operation of our business 
our liability insurance policies must be renewed annually  and we may not be able to obtain liability insurance coverage in the future or  if available  on acceptable terms 
during the past several years  retained losses relating to high self insured retention and annual premiums have increased significantly  which have substantially compounded our costs associated with insurance and claims defense 
we face risks associated with selective acquisitions 
we intend to continue to seek selective acquisition opportunities 
however  we may not succeed in identifying any future acquisition opportunities or completing any identified acquisitions 
the acquisition of communities presents a number of risks 
existing residences available for acquisition may frequently serve or target different market segments than those we presently serve 
it may be necessary in these cases to re position and renovate acquired residences or turn over the existing resident population to achieve a resident care level and income profile that is consistent with our objectives 
in the past  these obstacles have delayed the achievement of acceptable occupancy levels and increased operating and capital expenditures 
as a consequence  we currently plan to target assisted living communities with established operations  which could reduce the number of acquisitions we can complete and increase the expected cost 
even in these acquisitions  however  we may need to make staff and operating management personnel changes to successfully integrate acquired communities into our existing operations 
we may not succeed in repositioning acquired communities or in effecting any necessary operational or structural changes and improvements on a timely basis 
we also may face unforeseen liabilities attributable to the prior operator of the acquired communities  against whom we may have little or no recourse 
we expect competition in our industry to increase  which could cause our occupancy rates and resident fees to decline 
the long term care industry is highly competitive  and given the relatively low barriers to entry and continuing health care cost containment pressures  we expect that our industry will become increasingly competitive in the future 
we believe that the industry is experiencing over capacity in several of our markets  thereby intensifying competition and adversely affecting occupancy levels and pricing 
we compete with other companies providing assisted living services as well as numerous other companies providing similar service and care alternatives  such as home healthcare agencies  independent living facilities  retirement communities  and skilled nursing facilities 
we expect that competition will increase from new market entrants  as assisted living residences receive increased market awareness and more states decide to include assisted living services in their medicaid programs 
many of these competitors may have substantially greater financial resources than we do 
increased competition may limit our ability to attract or retain residents or maintain our existing rate structures 
this could lead to lower occupancy rates or lower rate structures in our communities 
we also cannot predict the effect of the healthcare industry trend toward managed care on the assisted living marketplace 
managed care  an arrangement whereby service and care providers agree to sell specifically defined services to public or private payers in an effort to achieve more efficiency with respect to utilization and cost  is not currently a significant factor in the assisted living marketplace 
however  managed care plans sponsored by insurance companies or hmos may in the future affect pricing and the range of services provided in the assisted living marketplace 
if development of new assisted living facilities outpaces demand  we may experience decreased occupancy  depressed margins  and diminished operating results 
we believe that some assisted living markets have become or are on the verge of becoming overbuilt 
the barriers to entry in the assisted living industry are not substantial 
consequently  the development of new assisted living facilities could outpace demand 
overbuilding in the markets in which we operate could thus cause us to experience decreased occupancy and depressed margins and could otherwise adversely affect our operating results 
market forces could undermine our efforts to attract seniors with sufficient resources 
we rely on our residents abilities to pay our fees from their own or familial financial resources 
generally  only seniors with income or assets meeting or exceeding the comparable median in the region where our assisted living communities are located can afford our fees 
inflation or other circumstances may undermine the ability of seniors to pay for our services 
if we encounter difficulty in attracting seniors with adequate resources to pay for our services  our occupancy rates may decline and we may suffer losses that could cause the value of your investment in our stock to decline 
our labor costs may increase and may not be matched by corresponding increases in rates we charge to our residents 
we compete with other providers of assisted living services and long term care in attracting and retaining qualified and skilled personnel 
we depend on our ability to attract and retain management personnel responsible for the day to day operations of each of our residences 
if we are unable to attract or retain qualified residence management personnel  our results of operations may suffer 
in addition  possible shortages of nurses or trained personnel may require us to enhance our wage and benefits packages to compete in the hiring and retention of personnel 
we also depend on the available labor pool of semi skilled and unskilled employees in each of the markets in which we operate 
as a result of these and other factors  our labor costs may increase and may not be matched by corresponding increases in rates we charge to our residents 
we face possible environmental liabilities at each of our properties 
under various federal  state and local environmental laws  ordinances and regulations  a current or previous owner or operator of real property may be held liable for the costs of removal or remediation of certain hazardous or toxic substances  including asbestos containing materials  that could be located on  in or under its property 
these laws and regulations often impose liability whether or not the owner or operator knew of  or was responsible for  the presence of the hazardous or toxic substances 
we could face substantial costs of any required remediation or removal of these substances  and our liability typically is not limited under applicable laws and regulations 
our liability could exceed our properties value or the value of our assets 
we may be unable to sell or rent our properties  or borrow using our properties as collateral  if any of these substances is present or if we fail to remediate them properly 
under these laws and regulations  if we arrange for the disposal of hazardous or toxic substances such as asbestos containing materials at a disposal site  we also may be liable for the costs of the removal or of the hazardous or toxic substances at the disposal site 
in addition to liability for these costs  we could be liable for governmental fines and injuries to persons or properties 
some of our facilities generate infectious medical waste due to the illness or physical condition of the residents  including  for example  blood soaked bandages  swabs and other medical waste products  and incontinence products of those residents diagnosed with an infectious disease 
the management of infectious medical waste  including handling  storage  transportation  treatment  and disposal  is subject to regulation under various laws  including federal and state environmental laws 
these environmental laws set forth the management requirements  as well as permit  record keeping  notice  and reporting obligations 
each of our facilities has an agreement with a waste management company for the proper disposal of all infectious medical waste 
any finding that we are not in compliance with these environmental laws could adversely affect our business and financial condition 
because these environmental laws are amended from time to time  we cannot predict when and to what extent liability may arise 
in addition  because these environmental laws vary from state to state  expansion of our operations to states where we do not currently operate may subject us to additional restrictions on the manner in which we operate our facilities 
our chief executive officer has personal interest that may conflict with ours due to his interest in holiday retirement corporation and columbia pacific group  inc mr 
baty  our chief executive officer  is a principal shareholder  director and chairman of the board of holiday retirement corporation  and is the principal owner of columbia pacific group  inc substantially all of the independent living facilities operated by holiday are owned by partnerships that are controlled by mr 
baty and holiday 
mr 
baty s varying financial interests and responsibilities include the acquisition  financing  and refinancing of independent living facilities and the development and construction of  and capital raising activities to finance  new facilities 
columbia pacific and affiliated partnerships operate assisted living communities and independent living facilities  many of which we manage under various management agreements 
the financial interests and management and financing responsibilities of mr 
baty with respect to holiday and columbia pacific and their affiliated partnerships could present conflicts of interest with us  including potential competition for residents in markets where both companies operate and competing demands for the time and efforts of mr 
baty 
because mr 
baty is both our chief executive officer as well as holiday s chairman of the board and is the principal owner of columbia pacific  circumstances could arise that would distract him from our operations 
our interests and those of holiday and columbia pacific interests may on some occasions be incompatible 
we have entered into a noncompetition agreement with mr 
baty  but this noncompetition agreement does not limit mr 
baty s current role with holiday or its related partnerships  so long as assisted living is only an incidental component of holiday s operation or management of independent living facilities 
we have entered into agreements with a number of entities that are owned or controlled by mr 
baty  whose interests with respect to these companies occasionally may conflict with ours 
we have entered into agreements  including most of our management agreements  with a number of entities that are owned or controlled by mr 
baty 
under these agreements  we provide management and other services to senior housing and assisted living communities owned by these entities and we have material agreements with these entities relating to the purchase  sale  and financing of a number of our operating communities 
there is a risk that the administration of these and any future arrangements could be adversely affected by these continuing relationships because our interest and those of mr 
baty may not be consistent at all times 
some of our recent transactions and the operations of certain communities that we manage are supported financially by mr 
baty with limited guarantees and through his direct and indirect ownership of such communities  we would be unable to benefit from these transactions and manged communities without this support 
our recent transactions to lease an additional communities and our agreements to manage communities involve limited guarantees by mr 
baty and rely on his direct and indirect ownership of the communities involved 
we believe that we would be unable to take advantage of these transactions and management opportunities without mr 
baty s individual support 
the ongoing administration of these transactions  however  could be adversely affected by these continuing relationships because our interests and those of mr 
baty may not be consistent at all times 
in addition  we cannot guarantee that such support will be available in the future 
we may be unable to attract and retain key management personnel 
we depend upon  and will continue to depend upon  the services of mr 
baty  our chief executive officer 
the loss of mr 
baty s services  in part or in whole  could adversely affect our business and our results of operations 
mr 
baty has financial interests and management responsibilities with respect to holiday and its related partnerships 
as a result  he does not devote his full time and efforts to emeritus 
we may be unable to attract and retain other qualified executive personnel critical to the success of our business 
our costs of compliance with government regulations may significantly increase in the future 
federal  state and local authorities heavily regulate the healthcare industry 
regulations change frequently  and sometimes require us to make expensive changes in our operations 
a number of legislative and regulatory initiatives relating to long term care are proposed or under study at both the federal and state levels that  if enacted or adopted  could adversely affect our business and operating results 
we cannot predict to what extent legislative or regulatory initiatives will be enacted or adopted or what effect any initiative would have on our business and operating results 
changes in applicable laws and new interpretations of existing laws can significantly affect our operations  as well as our revenues  particularly those from governmental sources  and our expenses 
our residential communities are subject to varying degrees of regulation and licensing by local and state health and social service agencies and other regulatory authorities 
while these regulations and licensing requirements often vary significantly from state to state  they typically address fire safety  sanitation  staff training  staffing patterns  living accommodations such as room size  number of bathrooms  and ventilation  and health related services 
we may be unable to satisfy all regulations and requirements or to acquire and maintain any required licenses on a cost effective basis 
in addition  with respect to our residents who receive financial assistance from governmental sources for their assisted living services  we are subject to federal and state regulations that prohibit certain business practices and relationships 
failure to comply with these regulations could prevent reimbursement for our healthcare services under medicaid or similar state reimbursement programs 
our failure to comply with such regulations also could result in fines and the suspension or inability to renew our operating licenses 
federal  state and local governments occasionally conduct unannounced investigations  audits and reviews to determine whether violations of applicable rules and regulations exist 
devoting management and staff time and legal resources to such investigations  as well as any material violation by us that is discovered in any such investigation  audit or review  could strain our resources and affect our profitability 
in addition  regulatory oversight of construction efforts associated with refurbishment could cause us to lose residents and disrupt community operations 
our stock price has been highly volatile  and a number of factors may cause our common stock price to decline 
the market price of our common stock has fluctuated and could fluctuate significantly in the future in response to various factors and events  including  but not limited to the liquidity of the market for our common stock  variations in our operating results  variations from analysts expectations  and new statutes or regulations  or changes in the interpretation of existing statutes or regulations  affecting the healthcare industry generally or the assisted living residence business in particular 
in addition  the stock market in recent years has experienced broad price and volume fluctuations that often have been unrelated to the operating performance of particular companies 
these market fluctuations also may cause the market price of our common stock to decline 
our share ownership and certain other factors may impede a proposed takeover of our business 
as of february   mr 
baty  our chief executive officer  controls about of our outstanding common stock 
together  our directors and executive officers own  directly and indirectly  over of the voting power of our outstanding common and preferred stock 
accordingly  mr 
baty and the other members of our board and management would have significant influence over the outcome of matters submitted to our shareholders for a vote  including matters that would involve a change of control of emeritus 
further  our articles of incorporation require a two thirds supermajority vote to approve a business combination of emeritus with another company that is not approved by the board of directors 
accordingly  the current management group and board of directors could prevent approval of such a business combination 
we currently have a staggered board in which only one third of the board stands for election each year 
thus  absent removals and resignations  a complete change in board membership could not be accomplished in fewer than approximately two calendar years 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the table below provides information about our financial instruments entered into for purposes other than trading that are sensitive to changes in interest rates 
for our debt obligations  the table presents principal repayments in thousands of dollars and current weighted averages of interest rates on these obligations as of december  for our debt obligations with variable interest rates  the rates presented reflect the current rates in effect at the end of these rates are based on libor plus a margin of 
expected maturity date in thousands average fair interest thereafter total value rate long term debt fixed rate 

        variable rate        if market interest rates average more in than they did in  our interest expense and net loss would increase by million 
these amounts are determined by considering the impact of hypothetical interest rates on our outstanding variable rate borrowings as of december   and do not consider changes in the actual level of borrowings that may occur subsequent to december  this analysis also does not consider the effects of the reduced level of overall economic activity that could exist in such an environment nor does it consider possible actions that management could take with respect to our financial structure to mitigate the exposure to such a change
