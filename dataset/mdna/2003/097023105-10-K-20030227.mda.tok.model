additional information regarding these factors is contained in the company s sec filings  including  without limitation  the company s annual report on form k for the year ended december  and the forms q for the quarters ended march   june  and september  critical accounting policies and standards issued and not yet implemented application of critical accounting policies the company s primary operating segments are commercial airplanes  military aircraft and missile systems  space and communications  and boeing capital corporation bcc  a wholly owned subsidiary of the company 
the following is a summary of the company s most critical accounting policies 
contract accounting contract accounting is used predominately by the military aircraft and missile systems and space and communications segments 
the majority of the business conducted in these segments is performed under contracts for the us government and foreign governments that extend over a number of years 
the process to estimate the total contract cost revenue relationship results in the development of gross margin and cost of sales percentages 
these percentages are utilized in the recognition of earnings and are significant factors in contract accounting 
the amount reported as cost of sales is determined by applying the estimated cost of sales percentages to the amount of revenue recognized for each contract 
total contract revenue estimates are based on the negotiated contract price modified by assumptions regarding contract options  change orders  incentive and award provisions associated with technical performance  and contract terms that provide for the adjustment of prices in the event of variations from projected inflationary trends 
total contract cost estimates are based in a large part on historical performance trends  business base and other economic projections  and information provided by suppliers 
factors that influence these estimates include technical and schedule risk  internal and subcontractor performance trends  business volume assumptions  asset utilization  anticipated labor agreements  and inflationary trends 
revenues under contracts with fixed prices are generally recognized as deliveries are made 
for certain fixed price contracts that require substantial performance over an extended period before deliveries begin  revenues are recorded based on the attainment of performance milestones 
revenues under contracts with terms that reimburse for costs incurred plus an agreed upon profit are recorded as costs are incurred 
contracts may contain provisions to earn incentive and award fees if targets are achieved 
incentive and award fees that can be reasonably estimated are recorded over the performance period of the contract 
incentive and award fees that cannot be reasonably estimated are recorded when awarded 
the development of gross margin and cost of sales percentages involves procedures and personnel in all areas of the company that provide financial or production information on the status of contracts 
this contract management process produces the company s best estimate of contract cost and contract revenue 
estimates of each significant contract s cost and revenue are reviewed and reassessed quarterly 
changes in these estimates result in recognition of cumulative adjustments to the contract profit in the period in which changes are made 
the experience over the past two years has resulted in a range of plus or minus for the combined gross margin of all contracts in the military aircraft and missile systems and the space and communications segments 
if combined gross margin for all contracts in the military aircraft and missile systems and the space and communications segments for all of had been estimated to be higher or lower by it would have increased or decreased income for the year by approximately million 
program accounting the company uses program accounting for its series commercial airplane programs 
program accounting is a method of accounting for the costs of certain products manufactured for delivery under production type contracts where profitability is realized over multiple contracts and years 
under program accounting  inventoriable production costs including overhead  program tooling costs and warranty costs are accumulated and charged to revenue by program instead of by individual units or contracts 
a program consists of the estimated number of units accounting quantity of a product to be produced in a continuing  long term production effort for delivery under existing and anticipated contracts 
to establish the relationship of revenue to cost of sales  program accounting requires estimates of a the number of units to be produced and sold in a program  b the period over which the units can reasonably be expected to be produced  and c their expected selling prices  production costs  program tooling  and warranty costs for the total program 
the reliance on estimates in the use of program accounting requires the demonstrated ability to reliably estimate the cost revenue relationship for the defined program accounting quantity 
the factors that must be estimated include selling price  labor and employee benefit costs  material costs  procured parts and major component costs  and overhead costs 
to meet this requirement the company employs a rigorous estimating process that is reviewed and updated on a quarterly basis 
changes in estimate are recognized on a prospective basis 
underlying all estimates used for program accounting is the assumed market and the corresponding production rates 
the program accounting quantity is established based upon the assumed market 
the total program revenue is determined by estimating the model mix and sales price for all unsold units within the accounting quantity added together with the revenue for all undelivered units under contract 
the sales prices for all undelivered units within the accounting quantity include an escalation adjustment that is based on projected escalation rates 
cost estimates are based in a large part on historical performance trends  business base and other economic projections  and information provided by suppliers 
factors that influence these estimates include production rates  internal and subcontractor performance trends  asset utilization  anticipated labor agreements  and inflationary trends 
the company recognizes revenue for commercial airplanes when a unit is completed and accepted by the customer 
the revenue recognized is the price negotiated with the customer including special features adjusted by an escalation formula 
the amount reported as cost of sales is determined by applying the estimated cost of sales percentage for the total remaining program to the amount of revenue recognized for the quarter 
because of the higher unit production costs experienced at the beginning of a new airplane program known as the learning curve effect  the actual costs incurred for production of the early units in the program will exceed the amount reported as cost of sales for those units 
this difference known as deferred production costs is included in inventory along with unamortized tooling costs 
the experience of the last two years  with all programs being relatively mature  has been that estimate changes due to model mix  escalation  cost performance  and accounting quantity increases have resulted in a range of plus or minus for the combined gross margin of all commercial airplane programs 
if combined gross margin for all commercial airplane programs for all of had been estimated to be higher or lower by it would have increased or decreased income for the year by approximately million 
aircraft valuation used aircraft under trade in agreements the company enters into certain trade in agreements to purchase used aircraft from customers at a specific price at a future point in time when those customers purchase new aircraft from the company 
in the event the company accepts an aircraft under a trade in agreement  the aircraft purchased by the company serves as collateral to offset amounts paid by the company to the customer 
obligations recorded from trade in aircraft agreements are measured as the difference between gross amounts payable to customers and the estimated fair value of the collateral 
the fair value of collateral is determined using a process based on the net present value of expected future cash flows from the trade in aircraft  assuming the most likely market placement of the aircraft 
the first step in this process uses the company s assessment of the market for each trade in aircraft  which in most instances begins years before the return of the aircraft 
there are several possible markets to which the company continually pursues opportunities to place used aircraft 
these markets include  but are not limited to  the resale market  which could potentially include the cost of long term storage  the leasing market  with the potential for refurbishment costs to meet the leasing customer s requirements  or the scrap market 
collateral valuation varies significantly depending on which market the company determines is most likely for each aircraft 
on a quarterly basis  the company updates its valuation analysis based on the actual activities associated with placing each aircraft into a market 
this quarterly collateral valuation process yields results that are typically lower than residual value estimates by independent sources and tends to more accurately reflect results upon the actual placement of the aircraft 
based on the best market information available at the time  the company deemed it probable that it would be obligated to perform on trade in agreements with gross amounts payable to customers totaling  million and  million as of december  and  respectively 
accounts payable and other liabilities included million and million as of december  and  respectively  which represents the trade in aircraft exposure related to these trade in agreements 
using a measurement date of december   had the estimate of collateral value used to calculate its obligation related to trade in agreements been higher or lower than the company s actual assessment  accounts payable and other liabilities would have decreased or increased by approximately million 
the company continually updates its assessment of the likelihood of its trade in aircraft purchase obligations and continues to monitor all these obligations for adverse developments 
asset valuation for equipment under operating lease  held for re lease and collateral on receivables the fair value of owned assets equipment under operating leases and assets held for re lease and collateral on receivables is periodically assessed to determine if the fair value is less than the carrying value 
differences between carrying value and fair value are considered in determining the allowance for losses on receivables and  in certain circumstances  recorded as impairment for owned assets 
the company uses the average published value from multiple sources based on the type and age of the aircraft to determine the fair value of aircraft 
under certain circumstances  the company applies judgment based on the attributes of the specific aircraft to determine fair value  usually when the features or utilization of the aircraft varies significantly from the more generic aircraft attributes covered by outside publications 
impairment review for equipment under operating leases and held for re lease the company reviews these assets for impairment when events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of these assets may not be recoverable 
an asset under operating lease or held for re lease is considered impaired when the expected undiscounted cash flow over the remaining useful life is less than the book value 
various assumptions are used when determining the expected undiscounted cash flow 
these assumptions include lease rates  lease term s  periods in which the asset may be held in preparation for a follow on lease  maintenance costs  remarketing costs and the life of the asset 
the determination of expected lease rates is generally based on outside publications 
the company uses historical information and current economic trends to determine the remaining assumptions 
when impairment is indicated for an asset  the amount of impairment loss is the excess of carrying value over fair value 
the company estimates that had the fair value of such assets deemed impaired during been higher or lower at the time each specific impairment had been taken  the impairment expense would have decreased or increased by approximately million 
the company is unable to predict the magnitude of any future impairments 
allowance for losses on receivables the allowance for losses on receivables valuation allowance is a valuation account used to provide for potential impairment of receivables on the balance sheet 
the balance is an accounting estimate of probable but unconfirmed losses in the receivable portfolio 
the valuation allowance relates to two components of receivables a specifically identified receivables that are evaluated individually for impairment  and b pools of receivables that are evaluated for impairment 
a specific receivable is reviewed for impairment when  based on current information and events  it is probable that the company will be unable to collect amounts due according to the contractual terms of the receivable agreement 
factors considered in assessing uncollectibility include a customer s extended delinquency  requests for restructuring and filing for bankruptcy 
a specific impairment allowance is provided based on the difference between the carrying value of the receivable and the estimated fair value of the related collateral 
the company reviews the adequacy of the general valuation allowance attributable to the remaining pool of receivables by assessing both the collateral exposure and the applicable default rate 
collateral exposure for a particular receivable is the excess of the carrying value over the applicable collateral value of the related asset 
a receivable with an estimated collateral value in excess of the carrying value is considered to have no collateral exposure 
the applicable default rate is determined using two components customer credit ratings and weighted average remaining portfolio term 
credit ratings are identified for each customer in the portfolio 
customer credit ratings are updated based on current rating agency information or the company s best estimates 
for each credit rating category  the collateral exposure is multiplied by an applicable historical default rate  yielding a credit adjusted collateral exposure 
historical default rates are published by standard poor s reflecting both the customer credit rating and the weighted average remaining portfolio term 
the sum of the credit adjusted collateral exposures generates an initial estimate of the general valuation allowance 
in recognition of the uncertainty of the ultimate loss experience and relatively long duration of the portfolio  a range of reasonably possible outcomes of the portfolio s credit adjusted collateral exposure is calculated by varying the applicable default rate by approximately plus and minus 
the valuation allowance recorded represents the best estimate within the resulting range of credit adjusted collateral exposure  factoring in considerations of risk of individual credits  current and projected economic and political conditions  and prior loss experience 
the resulting range of the credit adjusted collateral exposure as of december   was approximately million to million 
the company adjusted the valuation allowance to million at december  goodwill impairment the company accounts for its goodwill under statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
this statement requires an impairment only approach to accounting for goodwill 
because the composition of the company has changed significantly due to various acquisitions  goodwill constitutes a significant portion of the company s long term assets 
as a result of the adoption of sfas no 
 the company recorded a pre tax goodwill impairment charge of  million during the first quarter of the sfas no 
goodwill impairment model is a two step process 
first  it requires a comparison of the book value of net assets to the fair value of the related operations that have goodwill assigned to them 
if the fair value is determined to be less than book value  a second step is performed to compute the amount of the impairment 
in this process  a fair value for goodwill is estimated  based in part on the fair value of the operations used in the first step  and is compared to its carrying value 
the shortfall of the fair value below carrying value represents the amount of goodwill impairment 
sfas no 
requires goodwill to be tested for impairment annually at the same time every year  and when an event occurs or circumstances change such that it is reasonably possible that an impairment may exist 
the company selected april as its annual testing date 
the company estimates the fair values of the related operations using discounted cash flows 
the forecasts of future cash flows are based on the company s best estimate of future revenues and operating costs  based primarily on existing firm orders  expected future orders  contracts with suppliers  labor agreements  and general market conditions  and are subject to review and approval by senior management and the board of directors 
changes in these forecasts could cause a particular operating group to either pass or fail the first step in the sfas no 
goodwill impairment model  which could significantly change the amount of impairment recorded 
the cash flow forecasts are adjusted by an appropriate discount rate derived from the company s market capitalization plus a suitable control premium at the date of evaluation 
therefore  changes in the stock price will also affect the amount of impairment recorded 
at the date of the previous impairment  a increase in the value of boeing common stock would have reduced the impairment charge recorded in the first quarter of by approximately million 
a decrease in the value of boeing common stock would have increased the impairment charge by approximately million 
postretirement plans the company sponsors various pension plans covering substantially all employees 
the company also provides postretirement benefit plans other than pensions  consisting principally of health care coverage  to eligible retirees and qualifying dependents 
the liabilities and annual income or expense of the company s pension and other postretirement plans are determined using methodologies that involve several actuarial assumptions  the most significant of which are the discount rate  the long term rate of asset return  and medical trend rate of growth for medical costs 
not all net periodic pension income or expense is recognized in net earnings in the year incurred because it is allocated to production as product costs  and a portion remains in inventory at the end of a reporting period 
the company uses a discount rate that is based on a point in time estimate as of the september measurement date 
this rate is determined based on a review of long term  high quality corporate bonds as of the measurement date and use of models that match projected benefit payments of the company s major united states pension and other postretirement plans to coupons and maturities from high quality bonds 
a basis point increase in the discount rate would decrease the pension and other postretirement liabilities by approximately  million and million  respectively  and decrease the net periodic pension and other postretirement expense by approximately million and million  respectively 
a basis point decrease in the discount rate would increase the pension and other postretirement liabilities by approximately  million and million  respectively  and increase the net periodic pension and other postretirement expense by approximately million and million  respectively 
net periodic pension costs include an underlying expected long term rate of asset return 
in developing this assumption  the company looks at a number of factors a review of asset class return by several of the company s trust fund investment advisors  long term inflation assumptions  and long term historical returns for the company s plans 
the expected long term rate of asset return is based on a diversified portfolio including domestic and international equities  fixed income  real estate  private equities and uncorrelated assets 
pension income or expense is especially sensitive to changes in the long term rate of asset return 
an increase or decrease of basis points in the expected long term rate of asset return would have increased or decreased pension income by approximately million 
the postretirement benefit obligation for non pension plans reflects a significant increase in medical trend 
recent losses due to higher than expected increases in medical claims costs have created an unrecognized loss in the company increased its short term medical trend for to reflect the revised expectations of continued cost increases in the next few years 
standards issued and not yet implemented in june  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for asset retirement obligations  which is effective january  this standard addresses financial accounting and reporting for obligations associated with the retirement of tangible long lived assets and the associated retirement costs 
the company has determined that the implementation of this standard will not have a material effect on its financial statements 
in july  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities 
this standard requires costs associated with exit or disposal activities to be recognized when they are incurred 
the requirements of sfas no 
apply prospectively to activities that are initiated after december   and as such  the company cannot reasonably estimate the impact of adopting these new rules until and unless it undertakes relevant activities in future periods 
in november  the fasb issued interpretation no 
fin  guarantor s accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees  including indirect guarantees of the indebtedness of others  which clarifies the requirements of sfas no 
 accounting for contingencies  relating to a guarantor s accounting for and disclosures of certain guarantees issued 
fin requires enhanced disclosures for certain guarantees 
it also will require certain guarantees that are issued or modified after december   including certain third party guarantees  to be initially recorded on the balance sheet at fair value 
for guarantees issued on or before december   liabilities are recorded when and if payments become probable and estimable 
the company expects fin to have the general effect of delaying recognition for a portion of the revenue for product sales that are accompanied by certain third party guarantees 
the financial statement recognition provisions are effective prospectively  and the company cannot reasonably estimate the impact of adopting fin until guarantees are issued or modified in future periods  at which time their results will be initially reported in the financial statements 
see off balance sheet arrangements discussion 
in january  the fasb issued interpretation no 
fin  consolidation of variable interest entities  which clarifies the application of accounting research bulletin no 
 consolidated financial statements  relating to consolidation of certain entities 
first  fin will require identification of the company s participation in variable interests entities vie  which are defined as entities with a level of invested equity that is not sufficient to fund future activities to permit them to operate on a stand alone basis  or whose equity holders lack certain characteristics of a controlling financial interest 
for entities identified as vie  fin sets forth a model to evaluate potential consolidation based on an assessment of which party to the vie  if any  bears a majority of the exposure to its expected losses  or stands to gain from a majority of its expected returns 
fin also sets forth certain disclosures regarding interests in vie that are deemed significant  even if consolidation is not required 
the company is currently assessing the application of fin as it relates to its variable interests

consolidated results of operations and financial condition the company operates in four principal segments commercial airplanes  military aircraft and missile systems  space and communications  and bcc 
all other activities fall within the other segment  principally made up of boeing technology  connexion by boeing sm and air traffic management 
consolidated results of operations dollars in millions revenues    operating earnings    operating margins net earnings   research and development    effective income tax rate contractual backlog    includes in process research development in revenues revenues for were billion compared with billion in and billion in the lower revenues in principally reflect decreased deliveries in the commercial airplanes segment 
fewer commercial airplane deliveries in were offset by growth of billion in the military aircraft and missile systems segment revenues 
the higher revenues in compared to principally reflect increased deliveries in the commercial airplanes segment  but also reflect an increase in space and communications segment revenues 
consolidated revenues based on current schedules and plans  the company projects total revenues to be approximately billion 
operating earnings operating earnings for were  million compared with  million in and  million in operating earnings were significantly impacted by million of pre tax special charges related to the events of september  see note excluding the september   special charges  operating earnings in would have been million lower than operating earnings 
this decrease in operating earnings reflected lower commercial airplane deliveries offset by production efficiencies in the commercial airplanes segment and higher deliveries of military aircraft and missile systems segment products 
space and communications segment operating earnings also decreased as commercial satellite losses offset growth and performance on other programs 
in addition  million of asset impairment charges and additional valuation reserves related to customer and commercial financing assets were recorded by bcc and the other segment during operating earnings of  million for were million higher than operating earnings of  million 
excluding the september   pre tax special charges of million  operating earnings in would have been  million higher than operating earnings 
the increase in operating earnings during was primarily related to higher commercial airplane deliveries and an increase in space and communications segment operating earnings 
as indicated in note  the company has generated significant net periodic benefit income related to pensions million in  million in  and million in not all net periodic pension benefit income or expense is recognized in net earnings in the year incurred because it is allocated to production as product costs  and a portion remains in inventory at the end of a reporting period 
accordingly  the operating earnings for  and  included million  million and million  respectively  of pension income 
due to the significant investment losses incurred in recent years  the expected future market related value of assets is expected to decrease significantly in the near future 
this decrease  when combined with the decrease of basis points in the expected long term asset return is expected to reduce pension income reflected in operating earnings from million in to approximately million in in  the pension impact to earnings will depend on market conditions  but based upon current assumptions  the company expects to recognize a non cash pension expense estimated to range from million to million 
net earnings net earnings of million for were  million lower than earnings of  million 
the decrease in net earnings principally reflected a  million charge recorded in upon the adoption of sfas no 
 decreased commercial airplane deliveries  increased customer financing charges and higher commercial satellite production costs 
other income decreased million in  to million in from million in other income in included million of interest income associated with federal income tax audit settlements  did not include similar interest income 
also contributing to lower other income in was million of losses on long held equity investments 
interest and debt expense increased million in  to million in from million in the increased interest expense resulted from increased debt  primarily associated with the increased customer and commercial financing activities of bcc 
interest expense is expected to increase concurrent with increasing future financing activity 
net earnings of  million for were million higher than net earnings of  million 
the increase in net earnings principally reflected increased operating earnings associated with the increase in revenue for net earnings in were significantly reduced by million of pre tax special charges million after tax related to the events of september  the increase in net earnings for over also reflected the in process research and development expense of million million after tax that was recognized in  of which million was associated with the acquisition of the hughes space and communications businesses  which were renamed boeing satellite systems 
other income decreased million in  to million in from million in the decrease in other income in principally reflected lower interest income from cash  but was partially offset by higher interest income associated with federal income tax audit settlements million in  compared with million in 
other income in also included a million gain on sale of a long held equity investment 
interest and debt expense increased million in  to million in from million in the increased interest expense resulted from increased debt  primarily associated with the increased customer and commercial financing activities of bcc 
research and development research and development expenditures involve design  development and related test activities for defense systems  new and derivative commercial jet aircraft  advance space  other company sponsored product development  and basic research and development 
these expenditures are either charged directly against earnings or are included in amounts allocable as reimbursable overhead costs on us government contracts 
research and development highlights for each of the major business segments are discussed in segment results of operations and financial condition 
in addition  boeing technology  the advanced research and development organization of the company  focuses on improving its competitive position by investing in certain technologies and processes that apply to multiple business units 
technology investments currently being pursued within boeing technology include network centric operations  affordable structures and manufacturing technology  lean and efficient design processes and tools  lean support and service initiatives  advanced platform systems and safe and clean products 
total research and development expense in was  million  compared with  million in and  million in excluding the million of in process research and development expense in  research and development expense increased million in  principally reflecting increases in the commercial airplanes segment and the other segment  which includes activities relating to connexion by boeing sm 
consolidated research and development income taxes the effective income tax rate for was compared with in and in the effective income tax rate of varies from the federal statutory tax rate of  principally due to foreign sales corporation fsc and extraterritorial income eti exclusion tax benefits of million 
this rate also reflects tax credits  state income taxes and favorable resolution of certain audit issues 
the effective income tax rates of for and for also vary from the federal statutory tax rate principally due to fsc benefits of million in and million in the income tax rate also reflects a one time benefit of million reflecting a settlement with the internal revenue service irs relating to research credit claims on mcdonnell douglas corporation fixed price government contracts applicable to the federal income tax returns 
in december  the boeing company filed suit in the us district court for the western district of washington for the refund of over million in federal income taxes and related interest 
if the company were to prevail  the refund of the amount in dispute would include interest computed to the payment date 
however  the company cannot predict the likelihood of a favorable outcome 
the suit challenged the irs method of allocating research and development costs for the purpose of determining tax incentive benefits on export sales through the company s domestic international sales corporation disc and its fsc for the years through the company prevailed with the district court  but lost an appeals decision with the ninth circuit court of appeals 
the company appealed to the supreme court and is awaiting their decision  which is expected in the first half of the company s financial statements will not be negatively impacted as a result of the suit s outcome 
beginning in and continuing through the european union eu has issued a series of objections with the world trade organization wto to both us fsc and eti provisions 
the wto has agreed with the eu and ruled that the fsc and eti provisions constitute prohibited export subsidies 
in response the wto has authorized the eu to impose retaliatory tariffs 
a list of products upon which the retaliatory tariff would be imposed is not yet final  but at this point no boeing products have been included on the list 
president bush has stated that the us will bring its tax laws into compliance with the wto ruling that the extraterritorial income regime constitutes a prohibited export subsidy 
both the house ways and means committee and the senate finance committee are continuing to assess alternatives for a replacement of the eti legislation 
it is not possible to predict what impact this issue will have on future earnings pending final resolution of these matters 
if eti is repealed and replacement legislation is not enacted  the loss of benefit to the company could be substantial 
income taxes have been settled with the irs for all years through  and irs examinations have been completed through in connection with these examinations  the company disagrees with irs proposed adjustments  and the years through are in litigation 
the irs examination for mcdonnell douglas corporation for the years through has been settled and the company received a refund of million in the company believes adequate provision for all outstanding issues has been made for all open years 
backlog contractual backlog of unfilled orders excludes purchase options  announced orders for which definitive contracts have not been executed  and unobligated us and foreign government contract funding 
total contractual backlog balances were billion at december   billion at december   and billion at december  the decreases in contractual backlog from to and to were related to decreases in contractual backlog for commercial airplanes offset by increases in contractual backlog for both space and communications and military aircraft and missile systems 
unobligated backlog includes us and foreign government definitive contracts for which funding has not been appropriated 
unobligated backlog totaled billion  billion and billion at december   and  respectively 
the increase in unobligated backlog from to is primarily related to military aircraft and missile systems  partially offset by space and communications 
overall  unobligated backlog decreased from to due to a decrease in unobligated backlog for military aircraft and missile systems  which was partially offset by an increase in unobligated backlog for space and communications 
liquidity and capital resources the primary factors that affect the company s investment requirements and liquidity position  other than operating results associated with current sales activity  include the following timing of new and derivative programs requiring both high developmental expenditures and initial inventory buildup  cyclical factors  including growth and expansion requirements and requirements associated with reducing sales levels  customer financing assistance  the timing of federal income tax payments  the company s stock repurchase plan  and potential acquisitions 
cash flow summary the company has generated strong cash flow from operating activities with billion provided in  billion in and billion in earnings  adjusted for non cash items  continue to be the primary source of operating cash flow with over billion provided in each of the last three years 
dollars in millions year ended december  net earnings   non cash items    changes in working capital  net cash provided by operating activities    net cash used by investing activities    net cash provided used by financing activities net increase decrease in cash and cash equivalents  cash and cash equivalents at beginning of year   cash and cash equivalents at end of year   non cash items non cash items in earnings primarily include depreciation  amortization  share based plans expense  impairments  valuation provisions and the cumulative effect of accounting change relating to the adoption of sfas no 
non cash items and corresponding amounts are listed in the company s consolidated statements of cash flows 
working capital working capital from operations excluding cash contributions for pensions generated approximately billion of net cash in due to the decline in the airline industry  lower inventory balances and production rates resulted in a billion increase in cash flow 
the amount of customer advance payments received in excess of costs was billion less in than the previous year due primarily to lower advance payments received 
there was also a substantial reduction in vendor payables 
the reduction in tax payments in resulted principally from lower earnings and a billion tax refund from settlements of several tax audits 
the working capital trend as reflected in the five year summary indicates that the company has been able to use lower amounts of working capital to support the volume of business transacted and is using capital more efficiently 
this trend does not reflect a change in the company s ability to meet obligations 
pensions operating cash flow included billion of cash funding to the pension plans 
on april   the company voluntarily funded three of its defined benefit plans to ensure that each of its plans would have assets that were at least approximately equal to and in most cases greater than the liability for vested benefits as measured by the pension benefit guaranty corporation 
the company does not expect significant pension funding requirements in  although it may make additional discretionary contributions 
the company measures its pension plan using a september year end for financial accounting purposes 
the significant declines experienced in the financial markets have unfavorably impacted asset performance 
as a result  the company has reduced its expected long term rate of asset return by basis points to beginning in the expected long term rate of asset return is based on target asset allocations of equity with a return of  fixed income with a return of  and other including real estate with a return of 
current allocations are within to of each of the long term targets 
the decline in asset performance coupled with historically low interest rates a key factor when estimating plan liabilities  caused the company to recognize a significant non cash charge to equity in the fourth quarter of this charge  which amounted to a billion increase to the accrued pension plan liability and a billion after tax decrease to the accumulated other comprehensive income account within shareholders equity  did not impact earnings or cash flow  and could reverse in future periods should either interest rates increase or market performance and plan returns improve 
the company uses a discount rate that is based on a point in time estimate as of the september measurement date 
although future changes to the discount rate are unknown  had the discount rate increased or decreased basis points  the pension and postretirement liability would have decreased billion or increased billion  respectively 
investing activities the majority of bcc s customer financing is funded by debt and cash flow from its own operations 
as of december   the company had outstanding irrevocable commitments of approximately billion to arrange or provide financing related to aircraft on order or under option for deliveries scheduled through the year not all these commitments are likely to be used  however  a significant portion of these commitments are with parties with relatively low credit ratings 
see note and outstanding loans and commitments are primarily secured by the underlying aircraft 
additional investments of billion were made by bcc in enhanced equipment trust certificates eetcs offered by various airlines in eetcs are widely used in the airline industry as a method of financing aircraft 
bcc provides financing for airlines and has begun investing in these types of instruments as an investor 
see bcc segment results of operations and financial condition 
financing activities debt maturities during this three year period included billion in  billion in  and billion in additionally  bcc issued billion of debt in  billion in and billion in the significant bcc debt issuance in and was performed in conjunction with the transfer of a significant portion of the company s customer financing assets to bcc as well as growth in the customer financing portfolio 
in  bcc debt issuance was generally used for growth in the customer financing portfolio 
the company has a share repurchase program  but there were no share repurchases in see note disclosures about contractual obligations and commitments the following table summarizes the company s known obligations to make future payments or other consideration pursuant to certain contracts as of december   as well as an estimate of the timing in which these obligations are expected to be satisfied 
contractual obligations dollars in millions total less than year years years after years long term debt      capital lease obligations operating leases  other long term liabilities     total contractual obligations      other long term liabilities in the table above include accrued retiree health care  accrued pension plan liability and deferred lease income 
inventory procurement contacts the company has entered into certain significant inventory procurement contracts that specify determinable prices and quantities  and long term delivery timeframes 
these agreements require suppliers and vendors to be prepared to build and deliver items in sufficient time to meet the company s production schedules 
the need for such arrangements with suppliers and vendors arises due to the extended production planning horizon for many of its products  including commercial aircraft  military aircraft and other products where the delivery to the customer is over an extended period of time 
a significant portion of these inventory commitments are either supported by a firm contract from a customer or have historically resulted in settlement through either termination payments or contract adjustments  when necessary  should the customer base not materialize to support delivery from the supplier 
although there are no plans to do so  if any of the company s programs were to be terminated  the company would be exposed to potentially material termination costs 
industrial participation agreements the company has entered into various industrial participation agreements with customers in foreign countries to effect economic flow back and or technology transfer to their businesses or government agencies as the result of their procurement of goods and or services from the company 
these commitments may be satisfied by the company s placement of direct work  placement of vendor orders for supplies  opportunities to bid on supply contracts  transfer of technology  or other forms of assistance to the foreign country 
the company does not commit to industrial participation obligations unless a contract for sale of the company s products or services is signed 
to be eligible for such a commitment from the company  the foreign country or customer must have sufficient capability and capacity and must be competitive in cost  quality and schedule 
in certain cases  if a contract is placed with a foreign supplier to satisfy an industrial participation obligation  failure of that supplier to comply with any or all of these terms and conditions relieves the company of its obligations pursuant to that portion of its industrial participation commitment 
in certain cases  penalties could be imposed if the company does not meet its industrial participation obligations 
during  no penalties were incurred by the company 
as of december   the company has outstanding industrial participation obligations totaling approximately billion that extend through capital resources the company has the following standard poor s credit ratings short term  a  senior debt  a 
bcc has the following standard poor s credit ratings short term  a  senior debt  a 
the company has the following moody s credit ratings short term  p  senior debt  a bcc has the following moody s credit ratings short term  p  senior debt  a the company has the following fitch s credit ratings short term  f  senior debt  a 
bcc has the following fitch s credit ratings short term  f  senior debt  a 
the events of september   negatively impacted the liquidity and capital resources of the company 
subsequent to september   the company established a commercial paper program providing additional short term liquidity 
commercial paper remains a significant liquidity source 
the company has debt obligations of billion  which are unsecured 
approximately billion will mature in  and the balance has an average maturity of years 
excluding bcc debt of billion and non recourse debt of billion  total debt is at of total shareholders equity plus debt 
the consolidated debt  including bcc  is at of total shareholders equity plus debt 
as previously noted  the company has recognized a significant non cash charge to equity of billion  net of tax 
excluding this item and bcc debt  the consolidated debt was of shareholders equity plus debt 
the company has additional substantial borrowing capability 
currently  the company has billion that remains available from shelf registrations filed with the securities and exchange commission sec and billion billion exclusively available for bcc of unused borrowing on revolving credit line agreements with a group of major banks 
see note the company believes its internally generated liquidity  together with access to external capital resources  will be sufficient to satisfy existing commitments and plans  and also to provide adequate financial flexibility to take advantage of potential strategic business opportunities should they arise within the next year 
due to the continuing downturn in the commercial aviation market and the recent airline announcements in the united states that confirm the delayed recovery of airline traffic and profitability  several customers have rescheduled aircraft delivery dates 
the rescheduling of delivery dates will reduce aircraft advance payments in the near term 
the reduction in advance payments will be offset by reduced inventory spending  resulting in an immaterial impact on the company s liquidity 
off balance sheet arrangements the company is a party to certain off balance sheet arrangements  as defined by the sec  including certain guarantees and variable interests in unconsolidated entities 
guarantees the following tables provide quantitative data regarding the company s third party guarantees 
the maximum potential payment amounts represent worst case scenarios  and do not necessarily reflect results expected by the company 
estimated proceeds from collateral and recourse represent the anticipated values of assets the company could liquidate or receive from other parties to offset its payments under guarantees 
the carrying amount of liabilities recorded on the balance sheet reflects the company s best estimate of future payments it may be required to make as part of fulfilling its guarantee obligations 
portions of certain liabilities were established in prior periods as part of the company s special charges due to the events of september  as of december   maximum potential payments estimated proceeds from collateral recourse carrying amounts of liabilities portion of liabilities related to the events of septemer  asset related guarantees credit guarantees related to the sea launch venture other credit guarantees equipment trust certificates performance guarantees amounts included in accounts payable and other liabilities the company has issued various asset related guarantees  principally to facilitate the sale of certain commercial aircraft 
under these arrangements  the company is obligated to make payments to a guaranteed party in the event the related aircraft fair values fall below a specified amount at a future point in time 
these obligations are collateralized principally by commercial aircraft 
no aircraft have been delivered with these types of guarantees in several years 
recent declines in asset values of commercial aircraft increase the risk of future payment by the company under these guarantees 
during the year ended december   the company recorded a reduction to expense of million and made net cash payments totaling million related to its asset related guarantees 
the company has issued credit guarantees to creditors of the sea launch venture  of which the company is a owner  to assist the venture in obtaining financing 
in the event the company is required to perform on these guarantees  it has the right to recover a portion of the loss from another venture partner  and has collateral rights to certain assets of the venture 
in addition  the company has issued credit guarantees  principally to facilitate the sale of certain commercial aircraft 
under these arrangements  the company is obligated to make payments to a guaranteed party in the event that lease or loan payments are not made by the original debtor or lessee 
the company s commercial aircraft credit related guarantees are collateralized by the underlying commercial aircraft 
a substantial portion of these guarantees have been extended on behalf of original debtors or lessees with less than investment grade credit 
recent financial weakness in certain airlines further exposes the company to loss under its credit guarantees 
during the year ended december   the company recorded no expenses and made net cash payments totaling million related to its credit guarantees 
as a liquidity provider for equipment trust certificate etc pass through arrangements  the company has certain obligations to investors in the trusts  which requires funding to the trust to cover interest due to such investors resulting from an event of default by united airlines 
in the event of funding  the company receives a first priority position in the etc collateral in the amount of the funding 
on february   the company advanced million to the trust perfecting its collateral position and terminating its liquidity obligation 
the trust currently has collateral value that significantly exceeds the amount due to the company 
also relating to an etc investment  the company has potential obligations relating to shortfall interest payments in the event that the interest rates in the underlying agreements are reset below a certain level 
these obligations would cease if united airlines were to default on its interest payments to the trust 
there were no significant payments made by the company during the company has outstanding performance guarantees issued in conjunction with joint venture investments 
pursuant to these guarantees  the company would be required to make payments in the event a third party fails to perform specified services 
material variable interests in unconsolidated entities the company is currently assessing the application of fin as it relates to its variable interests 
while the company is currently not required to consolidate the full amount of the etcs  eetcs or the sea launch venture in which it has invested  it is unable to definitively conclude at this time whether consolidation or disclosure will be required for these investments upon full adoption of fin the company s investment in etcs and eetcs aggregated million at december  during the year ended december   the company recorded revenues of million  cash inflows of million  and impairment expense of million relating to these investments 
as of december   the vie etcs and eetcs in which the company has invested have total assets of approximately billion and total debt which is non recourse to the company of approximately billion 
the total assets and total liabilities of the sea launch venture each represent less than of the company s consolidated total assets and total liabilities as of december  the company made no additional capital contributions to the sea launch venture during the year ended december  disclosures about commercial commitments the following table summarizes the company s commercial commitments outstanding as of december   as well as an estimate of the timing in which these commitments are expected to expire 
commercial commitments dollars in millions total amounts committed maximum amount of loss less than year years years after years standby letters of credit and surety bonds   guarantees asset related guarantees credit guarantees equipment trust certificates performance guarantees trade in commitments   other commercial commitments    total commercial commitments     related to the issuance of certain standby letters of credit and surety bonds included in the above table  the company received million of advance payments from customers 
the company enters into certain trade in agreements to purchase used aircraft from customers at a specific price at a future point in time when those customers purchase new aircraft from the company 
in the event the company accepts an aircraft under a trade in agreement  the aircraft purchased by the company serves as collateral to offset amounts paid by the company to the customer 
as of december   accounts payable and other liabilities included million related to trade in commitments  of which million was related to the events of september  the total contractual trade in value of all aircraft that customers had the right to sell to the company was  million as of december   and the company estimated the fair value of those aircraft was  million 
there is a high degree of uncertainty inherent in the assessment of the likelihood of trade in commitments 
generally  as commercial aircraft values decline  the probability of the company s performance on trade in commitments increases 
there have been recent declines in value for certain aircraft models  including those for which the company has trade in agreements 
updates on the likelihood that trade in commitments will be exercised using both quantitative information from valuation sources and qualitative information from other sources are continually assessed 
the company continues to monitor all trade in commitments for adverse developments 
other commercial commitments include irrevocable financing commitments related to aircraft on order and commercial equipment financing 
these are previously discussed and also disclosed in note to the consolidated financial statements 
segment results of operations and financial condition commercial airplanes dollars in millions revenues    of total company revenues unit cost method operating earnings    operating margins program accounting method operating earnings    operating margins research and development contractual backlog    revenues commercial airplanes segment revenues were billion in compared with billion in and billion for commercial airplanes revenue is derived primarily from jet aircraft deliveries 
the decline in revenue in compared to was due primarily to the decline in the commercial aviation market and resulting jet aircraft deliveries and revenue 
revenue was higher than in due primarily to the increase in commercial jet aircraft deliveries 
commercial jet aircraft deliveries were in compared with in and in summarized as follows model classic next generation md md total commercial jet aircraft deliveries included deliveries under operating lease  which are identified by parentheses in the table above 
deliveries in included intercompany deliveries of four next generation aircraft  consisting of three c aircraft and one project wedgetail airborne early warning and control aew c system aircraft 
deliveries in included intercompany deliveries of two next generation aircraft  and in included intercompany deliveries of four next generation aircraft and one aircraft 
final deliveries of the md aircraft program occurred in final deliveries of the classic and md aircraft programs occurred in the cumulative number of commercial aircraft deliveries as of december were as follows model next generation   the undelivered units under firm order as of december were as follows model next generation firm orders represent new aircraft purchase agreements where the customers rights to cancel without penalty have expired 
typical customer rights to cancel without penalty include receiving board of directors approval  shareholder approval  government approval and completing financing arrangements 
all such cancellation rights must be satisfied or expired even if satisfying such conditions are highly certain 
firm orders exclude option aircraft and aircraft subject to reconfirmation 
total commercial jet aircraft deliveries for are currently projected to approximate aircraft 
for  commercial aircraft deliveries are currently projected to be in the range of to aircraft 
as of january   the delivery forecast for is virtually sold out and approximately sold for at the lower end of the range 
commercial airplanes segment revenues for are projected to be in the range of billion 
operating earnings commercial airplanes segment calculates its operating earnings using both the unit cost and program accounting methods 
for segment reporting purposes  as disclosed in note  the commercial airplanes operating earnings as of december   and  are provided on the unit cost basis 
beginning in first quarter  commercial airplanes segment data will be based on the program accounting method 
commercial airplanes segment operating earnings  based on the unit cost of airplanes delivered  were  million  compared with  million in and  million in the related operating margins were  and  respectively 
and operating earnings included million and million  respectively  of recoveries charges associated with the september   terrorist attacks 
excluding these recoveries charges  commercial airplanes segment operating earnings in and were  million and  million  resulting in operating margins of and  respectively 
excluding the september recoveries charges  operating margin was slightly lower than due to the decline in revenue offset by improved operating efficiency and reduced research and development expense 
operating earnings and margin  excluding september charges  increased from principally due to increased revenue and continued improvement in the production process 
commercial airplanes segment operating earnings  based on the program method of accounting and including intercompany transactions  as discussed in note  were  million   million and  million as of december   and  respectively 
the related operating margins were   and 
excluding the and recoveries charges associated with september   the operating earnings for these periods were  million and  million  respectively 
the comparable margins were and 
the decline in margins from to is primarily due to the reduction in revenue offset by improved operating efficiency and reduced research and development expense 
in addition  the margins have been adversely impacted compared to due to the aircraft market decline 
in general  this has resulted in the lengthening of the time needed to produce the accounting quantity 
commercial aircraft production costs include a significant amount of infrastructure costs  a portion of which do not vary with production rates 
as the amount of time needed to produce the accounting quantity increases  the average cost of the accounting quantity also increases as these infrastructure costs are included in the total cost estimates  thus reducing the gross margin and related earnings provided other factors do not change 
the favorable cost performance reflected in the current year earnings and margin is recognized over current and future deliveries under the program method of accounting 
for segment reporting purposes  the favorable cost performance is a cumulative adjustment to unit cost over current and prior deliveries 
the company will continue to experience a higher than normal quantity of used airplanes through as a result of commitments entered into through purchase agreements with customers for new aircraft and services 
due to the current market for used airplanes  the company s used airplane inventory may increase and these purchases and commitments to purchase may result in future charges 
accounting quantity a program consists of the estimated accounting quantity for each aircraft to be produced for delivery under existing and anticipated contracts 
the company has a policy that determines the appropriate accounting quantity for each commercial aircraft program 
this policy takes into account several factors influenced by the demand for the particular product 
the company reviews and reassesses its program accounting quantities on a quarterly basis in compliance with relevant program accounting guidance 
the current market for commercial aircraft is adversely affecting all of commercial airplanes commercial aircraft programs 
the resulting reduction in production rates is extending the time frame for production and delivery of the accounting quantities used for program accounting 
this is particularly true for the  and programs 
the and programs have been experiencing the most difficulty acquiring new orders 
current market projections indicate that the company will be successful in selling the unsold units within the current accounting quantity for all programs  therefore no accounting quantities have been reduced 
the estimate of total program accounting quantities and changes  if any  as of december were next generation additions additions deletions the accounting quantity for the program continues to be based on firm orders as it has been since fourth quarter of the increase of five units in the program accounting quantity during the second quarter of was the result of net new order activity on the program 
the reduction of units in the program accounting quantity during the fourth quarter of was driven by a lack of firm demand for the aircraft subsequent to september  see note this decrease in demand is demonstrated in the table below by the sharp decrease in the program s anticipated orders as a percentage of cumulative firm orders between december  and december  program accounting quantity increases between december  and december  on other programs were the result of the normal progression of business  delivering aircraft  and obtaining additional orders 
within the accounting quantity for all programs there are units that have been delivered  undelivered units under contract  and units anticipated to be under contract in the future anticipated orders 
in developing total program estimates all of these conditions within the accounting quantity must be addressed 
the percentage of anticipated orders included in the program accounting estimates as compared to the number of cumulative firm orders as of december were as follows next generation cumulative firm orders cfo    anticipated orders n a anticipated orders as a cfo n a cumulative firm orders cfo    anticipated orders n a anticipated orders as a cfo n a cumulative firm orders cfo    anticipated orders n a anticipated orders as a cfo n a cumulative firm orders represent the cumulative number of commercial jet aircraft deliveries as of december see table on page plus undelivered units under firm order see table on page 
cumulative firm orders include orders that fall within the current accounting quantities as well as orders that extend beyond the current accounting quantities 
cumulative firm orders exclude program test aircraft that will not be refurbished for sale 
as of december   the company had cumulatively delivered program aircraft 
the company will record deliveries on a break even basis until such time as program reviews indicate changes to the gross margin 
the company has potentially material exposures related to the program  principally attributable to termination costs that could result from a lack of longer term market acceptance 
the company is anticipating an order from the us air force for tankers  which will have a long term positive impact on the program 
this order has been incorporated into the program estimates to the extent the aircraft fall within the current accounting quantity 
based on the anticipated delivery schedule and forecasted production rates most of these aircraft fall beyond the current accounting quantity 
the order from the us air force for tankers is anticipated to become a firm contract during deferred production costs inventory production costs incurred on in process and delivered units in excess of the estimated average cost of such units determined as described in note represent deferred production costs 
as of december  and  there were no significant excess deferred production costs or unamortized tooling costs not recoverable from existing firm orders for the next generation and programs 
the unamortized tooling and deferred production costs included in inventory at december are summarized in the following table unamortized tooling next generation deferred production costs next generation as of december  and  the balance of deferred production costs and unamortized tooling related to the   and programs was insignificant 
fleet support the company provides the operators of all its commercial airplane models assistance and services to facilitate efficient and safe aircraft operation 
collectively known as fleet support services  these activities and services include flight and maintenance training  field service support costs  engineering services and technical data and documents 
fleet support activity begins prior to aircraft delivery as the customer receives training  manuals and technical consulting support  and continues throughout the operational life of the aircraft 
services provided after delivery include field service support  consulting on maintenance  repair  and operational issues brought forth by the customer or regulators  updating manuals and engineering data  and the issuance of service bulletins that impact the entire model s fleet 
field service support involves company personnel located at customer facilities providing and coordinating fleet support activities and requests 
the costs for fleet support are expensed as incurred and have been historically less than of total consolidated costs of products and services 
this level of expenditures is anticipated to continue in the upcoming years 
these costs do not vary significantly with current production rates 
research and development the company continually evaluates opportunities to improve current aircraft models  and assesses the marketplace to ensure that its family of commercial jet aircraft are well positioned to meet future requirements of the airline industry 
the fundamental strategy is to maintain a broad product line that is responsive to changing market conditions by maximizing commonality among the boeing family of commercial aircraft 
additionally  the company is determined to continue to lead the industry in customer satisfaction by offering products with the highest standards of quality  safety  technical excellence  economic performance and in service support 
commercial airplanes segment research and development expense was million in  million in and million in the decrease in from was due primarily to reduced spending on the development of the er and er 
the increase in over was due primarily to increased spending on the development of the er  lr  er and a sonic cruiser airplane 
the initial delivery of the er and the rollout of the first er occurred in the fourth quarter of the initial delivery of the er is expected to occur in the initial delivery of the  the largest member of the next generation family occurred in the second quarter of the initial delivery of the er  a stretched version of er  occurred in the third quarter of in the fourth quarter of  the company announced it will focus its product development efforts on the development of an efficient to seat airplane that will fly  to  nautical miles with to percent lower fuel usage at the top end of today s commercial jet speeds 
the market potential for a new airplane of this size is forecasted at up to  units over the next years 
the company expects to formally offer the new airplane to customers in early  with entry into service targeted for the following chart summarizes the time horizon between go ahead and certification initial delivery for major commercial airplanes derivatives and programs 
consolidated research and development backlog commercial airplanes segment contractual firm backlog balances were billion at december   billion at december   and billion at december  contractual firm backlog for commercial airplanes segment excludes customers deemed by management to be high risk or in bankruptcy as of the reporting date 
the contractual backlog decline reflects the impact that the economic downturn has had on the airline industry 
the decline in backlog of billion from december  to december   and billion from december  and december   represents higher delivery volume on all airplane programs relative to new orders 
december   backlog does not include the anticipated order of us air force tankers 
this order is anticipated to become a firm contract during business environment and trends overview the worldwide market for commercial jet airplanes continues to be predominantly driven by long term trends in airline passenger traffic 
the principal factors underlying long term traffic growth are sustained economic growth  both in developed and emerging countries  and political stability 
demand for the company s commercial airplanes is further influenced by airline industry profitability  world trade policies  government to government relations  environmental constraints imposed upon airplane operations  technological changes  and price and other competitive factors 
airline industry environment commercial aviation has been impacted by an economic downturn that began in and continued through in addition  the industry suffered a tremendous shock from the terrorist attacks of september  air travel in most areas of the world has not recovered to the volume carried by the airlines in  which is affecting profitability for many airlines 
us full service airlines have suffered the greatest losses 
holiday traffic in for the us airlines showed an improvement and most carriers indicated better financial performance 
however  this improvement was for only a short period of time and the major us full service airlines reported significant losses for in contrast  low fare airlines in the us and in europe are reporting positive financial results and are growing 
european network airlines are expected to show better results than their us counterparts for the fiscal period ending in march of traffic between asia and europe has rebounded to pre september levels 
this trend combined with stronger traffic within the region is offsetting the slow growth over the pacific permitting most asian airlines to show profits 
our timetable for industry recovery has been delayed 
we presently see to be the year of recovery for world air travel  late early to be the year of airline profitability recovery  to be the year of airplane order recovery  and to be the year of delivery recovery 
the major uncertainty that is curbing economic growth and a stronger and sooner rebound in the industry is the iraqi situation in terms of timing  scale of military engagement  effect on oil prices  and clarity of political resolution 
the company s year forecast of the average long term growth rate in passenger traffic is annually  based on projected average worldwide annual economic real growth of 
based on global economic growth projections over the long term  and taking into consideration an increasingly competitive environment  increasing utilization levels of the worldwide airplane fleet and requirements to replace older airplanes  the company projected almost a trillion market for new airplanes and services over the next years 
this is a long term forecast  historically  while factors such as the gulf war and ticket charges for security have had significant impact over the span of several years  they have not dramatically affected the longer term trends in the world economy  and therefore  the company s market outlook 
airline deregulation worldwide  the airline industry has experienced progressive deregulation of domestic markets and increasing liberalization of international markets 
twenty five years ago virtually all air travel took place within a framework of domestic and international regulatory oversight 
since then  an increasing number of countries  most notably the united states  australia  japan and the countries in western europe  have eliminated restrictive regulations for domestic airline markets and promoted a more open market climate for international services 
these trends are expected to continue  but at varying rates in different parts of the world 
at the end of the next decade  an estimated two thirds of air travel will be in open markets 
liberalization of government regulations  together with increased airplane range capabilities  gives airlines greater freedom to pursue optimal fleet mix strategies 
this increased flexibility allows the airlines to accommodate traffic growth by selecting the best mix of flight frequencies and airplane size and capabilities for their route systems 
in intercontinental markets  more liberal bilateral air service agreements provide an important stimulus to opening new city pair markets  which favor increased flight frequency over capacity growth 
in parallel with regulatory liberalization  improvements in airplane range performance will continue to allow airlines to expand the number of direct city to city routes  thus reducing the reliance on indirect routes through central hubs that require larger capacity airplanes 
industry competitiveness the company currently faces aggressive international competitors that are seeking to increase market share 
this competitive factor was demonstrated by the decision of airbus to introduce the a  a proposed aircraft with passenger seating greater than the  to increase market share at the upper end of the large airplane market 
this market environment has resulted in intense pressures on pricing and other competitive factors 
the company s focus on improving processes and other cost reduction efforts is intended to enhance its ability to pursue pricing strategies that enable the company to maintain leadership at satisfactory margins 
additionally  the company s extensive customer support services network for airlines throughout the world plays a key role in maintaining high customer satisfaction 
as an example  on line access is available to all airline customers for engineering drawings  parts lists  service bulletins and maintenance manuals 
the commercial jet aircraft market and the airline industry remain extremely competitive 
competitive pressures and increased lower fare travel have combined to cause a long term downward trend in passenger revenue yields worldwide measured in real terms 
market liberalization within europe has enabled low cost airlines to enter the market 
these airlines increase the downward pressure on airfares  similar to the competitive environment in the united states 
airfares between asia and the united states are among the lowest yield airfare divided by revenue passenger miles of any in the world 
these factors result in continued price pressure on the company s products 
major productivity gains are essential to ensure a favorable market position at acceptable profit margins 
in july  three major european aerospace companies aerospatiale matra of france  daimlerchrysler aerospace of germany  and construcciones aeronautica of spain combined to form the european aeronautic defence and space company eads 
as a result of the formation  eads became an owner of airbus industrie ai and led the effort for the formation of the airbus integrated company aic in early the creation of the aic effectively changes the airbus role  from that of a marketer distributor of large commercial airplanes to one including complete manufacturing responsibility 
the aic is incorporated under french law as a privately held corporation owned by eads and by bae systems 
over the past five years  sales outside the united states have accounted for approximately of the company s total commercial airplanes third party segment sales  approximately of the commercial airplanes segment contractual backlog as of december   was with customers based outside the united states 
continued access to global markets remains vital to the company s ability to fully realize its sales potential and projected long term investment returns 
summary although near term market uncertainties remain  particularly with respect to the recovery post september  the long term market outlook appears favorable 
the company is well positioned in all segments of the commercial jet airplane market  and intends to remain the airline industry s preferred supplier through emphasis on product offerings and customer service that provide the best overall value in the industry 
military aircraft and missile systems dollars in millions revenues    of total company revenues operating earnings    operating margins research and development contractual backlog    revenues military aircraft and missile systems segment revenues were billion in  billion in and billion in increased revenues in were primarily due to additional deliveries on the c globemaster  f a e f super hornet  f eagle  jdam  ah apache programs and increased aerospace support volume 
the military aircraft and missile systems business segment is broadly diversified  and no program other than the c globemaster program and the f a e f super hornet program accounted for more than of total segment revenues 
revenues include amounts attributable to production programs and amounts recognized on a cost reimbursement basis for developmental programs such as the f a raptor  v osprey  and the rah comanche 
the increase in revenues between and is primarily due to increased aircraft deliveries in  one additional c globemaster  four c a clippers and four ch chinook helicopters 
deliveries of units for principal production programs  including deliveries under operating lease  which are identified by parentheses  were as follows model c globemaster f a e f super hornet t ts goshawk f e eagle ch chinook c a clipper ah apache military aircraft and missile systems segment revenues for are projected to be in the billion range

research and development the company is continuing to invest in business opportunities where it can use its customer knowledge  technical strength and large scale systems integration capabilities to shape the market 
investments in unmanned systems continue to leverage the company s capabilities in architectures  system of systems integration and weapon systems technologies to provide transformational capabilities for the us military 
investment is continuing in the tanker programs for the us air force and international customers 
company investments in airborne electronic attack and precision weapons and advanced rotorcraft systems are expanding its breadth of products and capabilities enabling it to access larger portions of the combat systems markets 
military aircraft and missile systems research and development expense in was million  compared with million in and million in current research and development activities are focused on the international and domestic tanker program  reflected in the increased expenditures over this program represents a large opportunity to provide state of the art tanking capabilities to our potential domestic and international customers 
it demonstrates the synergistic value of the diversified boeing portfolio in providing best value solutions to our customers 
italy recently became the first customer of the tanker ordering four aircraft with first aircraft delivery scheduled in the military aircraft and missile systems segment continues to pursue business opportunities where it can use its customer knowledge  technical strength and large scale integration capabilities 
the segment s level of research and development expenditures is consistent with this approach  and reflects the recent business environment  which has presented few major new start opportunities 
other research and development efforts include upgrade and technology insertions to enhance the capability and competitiveness of current product lines  as well as exploration of new markets such as unmanned air vehicles uavs 
backlog total contractual backlog for military aircraft and missile systems was billion at december   billion at december  and billion at december  military aircraft and missiles systems contractual backlog increased by in compared to the increase in compared to is primarily attributed to the capture of several key international awards including the korean f eagle contract and the italian tanker contract 
backlog also increased due to rate increases on several domestic programs in low rate initial production including v osprey and the f a raptor 
the c globemaster program maintained consistent backlog as new orders replaced sales on the existing production contracts 
the program is well positioned for continued sales well into this decade 
the f a e f super hornet program backlog increased moderately as the customer continues to increase production rate 
the jdam program backlog also increased moderately with additional orders from both the navy and air force 
aerospace support orders continued to increase this past year 
business environment and trends overview the us department of defense dod  represents nearly of the world s defense budget  and remains the principal customer of the military aircraft and missile systems business unit 
several trends are emerging that are shaping customer behavior in this market 
us military force structure is shrinking  its platforms are aging  and the tempo of operations and engagements worldwide remains high 
the united states current military activity demonstrates the value of systems solutions that allow all systems to communicate with each other  to operate over longer ranges  are unmanned and provide the advantages of precision  persistence and selective engagement 
these factors are driving the us dod  along with militaries worldwide  to focus on ways to transform their forces and the way they operate 
military transformation the transformation in forces is evidenced by a trend toward smaller  but more capable and more technologically advanced force structures 
the transformation in acquisition is evidenced by an increasing trend toward spiral development programs  cooperative international development programs and a demonstrated willingness to explore new forms of acquisition and ownership including the lease of military support aircraft 
institutions and events continue to shape the defense industrial environment 
from an institutional perspective  the establishment of the homeland defense and us northern command are creating new organizations with responsibilities for national airspace control  coastal protection and civil support 
the creation of the us strategic command is consolidating responsibilities for global strike  integrated missile defense  information operations  command  control  communications and computers  and intelligence  surveillance and reconnaisance into a single organization 
events like operation enduring freedom and the continuing war on global terrorism reaffirms the need for the rapid projection of decisive combat power around the world and emphasizes the need for new capabilities and solutions for the warfighter 
toward that end  the dod is fully committed to a transformation that will achieve and maintain advantages through changes in operational concepts  organizational structure and technologies that significantly improve warfighting capabilities 
competitive environment the global competitive environment continues to intensify  with increased focus on the us defense market  the world s largest and most attractive 
military aircraft and missile systems faces strong competition in all market segments  primarily from lockheed martin  raytheon  eads and northrop grumman 
the financial problems plaguing some domestic industry competitors appear to be resolved  enabling them to acquire new assets and compete more vigorously 
eads continues to strategically build a presence in the us market through building its north american operations and by partnering with us defense companies 
continued industry consolidation and market concentration was marked by the acquisition of trw by northrop grumman 
northrop s position in the uav  space  systems integration  and strike markets has been strengthened 
however  all prime contractors continue to partner or serve as major suppliers to each other on various programs 
at the lower tiers  consolidation persists and select companies have been positioning for larger roles  especially in the aerospace support market 
in addition to leveraging its internal resources and capabilities  the company is creating a competitive advantage by developing global strategic relationships to provide superior value for its customers  both in the us and abroad 
summary events like nuclear proliferation in north korea  operation enduring freedom and the continued war on terrorism  highlight the fact that our national security goals are not rhetorical 
there is an immediate and a durable need to maintain strong us defense capabilities covering a very broad spectrum of threats and responses 
near term dod budgets have increased  and longer range forecasts expect dod budgets to grow faster than anticipated prior to september  however  with a softening global economy and anticipated federal budget tensions  allocations to dod procurement are unlikely to increase significantly 
this suggests that the dod will continue to focus on affordability strategies emphasizing network centric operations  long range strike  unmanned air combat and reconnaissance vehicles  precision guided weapons and continued privatization of logistics and support activities as a means to improve overall effectiveness while maintaining control over costs 
the company s capabilities and programs are well suited to provide the military capabilities essential to meet the challenges facing our nation 
space and communications dollars in millions revenues    of total company revenues operating earnings loss operating margins research and development contractual backlog    revenues space and communications segment revenues were billion in  compared with billion in and billion in the segment remains broadly diversified 
the contributors to space and communications segment revenues included five market segments integrated battlespace  missile defense  human space flight and exploration  launch and satellite and homeland security 
the increase in revenues from to was primarily due to increased activity in missile defense offset by decreases in launch and satellite due to continued market downturn 
revenues were higher than revenues due primarily to increased activity on integrated battlespace programs and the acquisition of boeing satellite systems bss in october deliveries of production units were as follows model delta ii delta iv bss satellites space and communications segment revenues for are projected to be in the billion range 
the greatest growth is expected in the integrated battlespace market as space and communications has become the dod s leading industry partner in executing the military transformation with the capture of the future combat systems program  joint tactical radio system  and the family of advanced beyond line of sight terminals program 
missile defense expects continued growth as the missile defense agency continues its emphasis on the development of various missile defense capabilities 
operating earnings space and communications segment operating earnings for were million compared with million in and million in  and the related operating margins were  and for  and  respectively 
the operating results include a million pre tax charge to write down an equity investment in teledesic  llc 
also contributing to the decreased operating earnings was cost growth on satellite programs and the continued downturn in the launch and commercial satellite market 
the operating results included a pre tax charge of million associated with the in process research and development from the acquisition of the hughes space and communications businesses and autometric businesses  along with million in costs associated with a delta iii demonstration launch in august the segment operating margins were reduced from due to factory cost  schedule performance and a satellite contract termination in the commercial satellite business along with aew c development cost growth 
the reduced margins were offset by favorable commercial space contract actions  improved margins for integrated battlespace  and ground based midcourse defense program performance 
the operating margins were improved over the operating margins primarily due to reduced new product development expenses associated with the delta iv rs engine as it completed developmental engine certification and transitioned to production 
the company projects that operating earnings will continue to be impacted by new program development expenses but to a lesser degree than in prior years  primarily due to the transition of the delta iv launch vehicle into production 
in february  space and communications undertook a reorganization of its commercial satellite manufacturing activities in response to poor performance compounded by unfavorable market conditions 
the impact to earnings by satellite program cost growth was partially offset by favorable contractual actions 
the net impact to the year for bss was a reduction in operating earnings of approximately million 
progress has been made in implementing process improvements and program management best practices  however  factory problems that arise out of acceptance testing continue to impact existing contracts 
as a result  completion schedules have slipped which has resulted in exposing the company to the risk of contract termination for default tfd notification 
during the fourth quarter of  the company received a tfd notification on a commercial satellite contract that had an expected delivery beyond the contractual tfd date 
the customer no longer required the satellite for their current business base 
the company is currently marketing the satellite  which was adjusted to the estimated net realizable value 
early in the first quarter of  the company passed the tfd dates for two commercial satellite contracts 
management believes a tfd situation for each of these contracts is not likely to result in a material financial impact due to continuing legal  production  and contractual efforts in work 
certain launch and satellite contracts include provisions for replacement launch services or hardware if specified performance criteria are not met 
the company has historically purchased insurance to cover these obligations when allowed under the terms of the contract 
due to recent events  the current insurance market reflects unusually high premium rates and also suffers from a lack of capacity to handle all insurance requirements 
although the company does not intend to do so  it may elect to forego the procurement of third party insurance and  instead  retain such risks internally 
management believes the contract cost estimates have sufficient provisions to cover the expected value for these risks 
previously identified market based risks associated with delta iii inventory is being mitigated by a combination of reusing inventory on other delta programs  customer payments provided to reassign payloads to other launch vehicles  and the retention of existing customer deposits should those customers terminate their contract for delta iii launches 
at this time the delta iii inventory is no longer considered a material financial risk 
the sea launch venture  in which the company is a partner with rsc energia of russia  kvaerner asa of norway  and kb yuzhnoye po yuzhmash of ukraine  provides ocean based launch services to commercial satellite customers 
the venture had one successful launch in the company s investment in this venture as of december   is reported at zero  which reflects the recognition of losses reported by sea launch in prior years 
the venture incurred losses in  due to the relatively low volume of launches  reflecting a depressed satellite market 
the company has financial exposure with respect to the venture  which relates to guarantees by the company provided to certain sea launch creditors  performance guarantees provided by the company to a sea launch customer of million and financial exposure related to accounts receivable inventory of million 
the exposures related to guarantees are included in the off balance sheet arrangements discussion and disclosed in note to the consolidated financial statements 
the company and lockheed martin are partners in united space alliance  which is responsible for all ground processing of the space shuttle fleet and for space related operations with the us air force 
united space alliance also performs modifications  testing and checkout operations that are required to ready the space shuttle for launch 
united space alliance operations are performed under cost plus type contracts 
the company s proportionate share of joint venture earnings is recognized as income 
the segment s operating earnings include earnings of million  million  and million for  and  respectively  attributable to united space alliance 
on february   the country experienced the tragic loss of space shuttle columbia and its seven person crew 
the company is assisting nasa to determine the cause of this accident 
this accident did not impact the company s results of operations for  and it is too early to determine the effect on the company s business operations for and beyond 
research and development within the space and communications businesses the company continued investing in the new delta iv expendable launch vehicle which resulted in its successful inaugural commercial launch in november of this product gives the company greater access to a portion of the launch market that was previously unavailable with the delta ii rocket alone 
in the communications market  the company is investing to enable connectivity between existing air ground platforms  increase communications availability and bandwidth through more robust space systems  and leverage innovative communications concepts 
investments were made in global situational awareness concepts to develop communication system architectures to support various business opportunities including future combat systems  joint tactical radio system  fab t and global missile defense 
a major contributor to the company s support of these dod transformation programs is the investment in the boeing integration center where the company s network centric operations concepts are developed in partnership with its customers 
the company also will continue to make focused investments that will lead to the development of next generation space intelligence systems 
space and communications research and development expense  excluding in process research and development  was million in compared to million in and significant investment in development programs at the space and communications segment continued during company sponsored research and development expenditures supported the development of the delta iv launch vehicle 
delta iv development expense has been reduced by the us government s participation in developing the evolved expendable launch vehicle eelv 
aew c system research and development program expenses decreased as the effort transitioned to work that is specifically required for the australian wedgetail program 
company sponsored research and development levels are expected to decline in due to the transition of the delta iv launch vehicle into production 
backlog total contractual backlog for space and communications was billion at december  and billion at december  and billion at december  space and communications contractual backlog increased by in compared to the increase is primarily due to orders for proprietary programs  an order by the department of transportation for airport security  a nasa award for space flight payload processing and orders for delta iv launch vehicles 
this increase was partially offset by the declines in commercial satellite backlog due to decreases in new orders and sales on existing orders 
business environment and trends overview space and communications products and services  as part of integrated defense systems  will span five distinctive markets integrated battlespace  missile defense  homeland security  human space flight and exploration  and commercial launch and satellite 
each of these markets has unique customers and requirements  and therefore  will be discussed individually below 
integrated battlespace us military force structure is shrinking  its platforms are aging  and the tempo of operations and engagements worldwide remains high 
several of the recent united states military actions have demonstrated the value of systems solutions that allow all systems to communicate with each other  operate over longer ranges  and are unmanned and provide the advantages of precision  persistence and selective engagement 
refer to military aircraft and missile systems business environment and trends beginning on page for further discussion on military transformation 
missile defense funding for the missile defense market is primarily driven by the us government missile defense agency mda budget 
the primary thrusts in this market are the continued development and deployment of theater missile defense systems and the ground based missile defense gmd program 
the overall mda missile defense budget is approximately billion 
there is continued congressional support for development of strong missile defense capabilities as evidenced by the fact that the fiscal year budgets were fully funded in all four defense committees by congress 
in january  a new gmd program strategy was released in which the mda stated their objective to put a test bed capability in place by september this test bed would allow critical testing of the ground based midcourse defense segment along with the addition of other systems and sensors into the test scenario 
these new requirements for a test bed and development program were baselined by the company and the us government in the resulting contract change was finalized in december additionally on december   president george w 
bush called for our nation s missile defense capabilities to move from the test only category into a deployed system 
the company  in conjunction with mda  has initiated efforts to fulfill the direction of the president 
through our leadership position on the missile defense national team and our prime contractor role on the ground based midcourse defense segment program and on the airborne laser program  space and communications is positioned to maintain its role as mda s contractor 
homeland security since the events of september   the world has permanently changed 
the president quickly issued an executive order establishing an office of homeland security 
this office was officially designated as a cabinet level department led by governor tom ridge on january  this department will be responsible for a budget of nearly billion annually with a workforce of  consolidating from disparate agencies 
over the past year  the company has aligned internally to meet the challenges of the new threat 
in june  the company was chosen to lead the team that installed explosive detection technology for baggage screening in all us airports by december  this was the largest homeland security contract awarded to date  representing one of the largest short term projects in government history 
the company is focusing on the federal homeland security marketplace  and will leverage its experience and capabilities in network centric operations to enhance the solutions for homeland security opportunities 
human space flight and exploration the total human space flight and exploration market is forecasted to be relatively flat over the next ten years 
this forecast is based on budget projections for nasa  the primary customer in this market 
but within this flat forecast the company is observing changes in direction and emphasis with the establishment of a new vision and mission 
over the past year  nasa has developed a new integrated space transportation plan istp to implement their new vision 
this plan is designed to benefit the international space station  space shuttle program  and the agency s science and research objectives 
the new istp dedicates more resources to the space station program  provides additional funding to extend the life and enhance the safety and reliability of the agency s orbiter fleet  boosts funding for science based payloads and research  and restructures nasa s space launch initiative 
the space launch initiative will now focus on the development of a crew transport vehicle to ferry space station crewmembers  along with a continued technology effort to identify future reusable launch vehicle technologies 
the company is well positioned to join with nasa to help realize their vision using the expertise the company has gained from its prime contractor role on the space shuttle program and the international space station and an integral player in the space launch initiative program 
as nasa s investigation of the columbia accident continues the company may see some budget reprioritizing  but it is far too early in the investigation to speculate on that 
what we do know is that this administration is committed to finding the cause of the accident  fixing it  and successfully returning the space shuttle fleet back to operational status 
we will participate fully in these efforts 
commercial launch and satellite the commercial market has softened significantly since the late s in conjunction with the downturn in the telecommunications industry 
these markets are now characterized by overcapacity  commodity pricing and limited near term opportunities 
the recovery in the commercial satellite market may take several years at which time we believe the market will stabilize in the satellites per year range 
this recovery in satellite orders should also produce new opportunities in the launch services business 
we have taken aggressive actions to right size and restructure our organizations to meet the future commercial demand  while continuing to meet our government customer requirements 
in addition  we have worked diligently over the last year to improve processes in our quality  engineering and manufacturing disciplines 
we believe boeing satellite systems and boeing launch services delta ii  iii  iv and sea launch are positioned to bring unique and competitive offerings to our commercial customers as their requirements for new or replacement satellites resurfaces

operating revenues for bcc were million in  compared with million in and million in a larger portfolio  resulting from new business volume and portfolio transfers from boeing over the last two years  is primarily responsible for the increased revenues in and operating earnings operating earnings for bcc were million for the year ended december   compared with million for the year ended december  this decrease was primarily attributable to the impairment and valuation allowance charges recognized in  offset by additional income due to the growth in the portfolio 
operating earnings for were million compared with million in the growth in investment in financing assets was principally responsible for the increase 
the increase was partially offset by higher provision for losses  and higher operating and other expenses

total impairment expense recognized in and was not significant 
bcc segment other segment consolidated increased valuation allowance impairment of investment in equipment trust certificates impairment of joint venture aircraft other assets impairments a pre tax expense of million was recorded to increase the valuation allowance based on the company s assessment of the adequacy of customer financing reserves 
a specific pre tax impairment of million was recorded during the third quarter of related to a long held investment in etcs secured by aircraft on lease to united airlines united 
the write down was based on the decline in credit ratings of united  the long term maturity of the investment and the decline in the underlying aircraft collateral valuations 
the ultimate realization of this investment will depend upon legal developments in united s bankruptcy proceedings and united s ability to meet its related contractual obligations 
a specific pre tax impairment of million was recorded related to a joint venture investment that was established to lease and eventually convert passenger aircraft to full cargo configuration 
based on the company s assessment of current market conditions and the average age of the aircraft averaging over twenty years old  the company recorded an impairment for its share of the adjustment to estimated fair market value for the joint venture s aircraft 
the bcc portfolio does not include any aircraft other than those held through this joint venture

the total bcc portfolio was billion as of december   compared with billion as of december  at december   bcc s debt to equity ratio was to  compared with to at december  business environment and trends bcc acts as a captive finance subsidiary for the company and provides market based lease and loan financing primarily to airlines that purchase or lease commercial aircraft manufactured by the company or others 
bcc competes for aircraft finance business with other finance companies  commercial banks  insurance companies and other financial institutions 
bcc also competes in the commercial equipment leasing and finance markets  primarily in the united states  against a number of large ticket competitors  mainly heavily capitalized leasing companies and relationship banks 
approximately of bcc s portfolio has been generated from commercial equipment leasing and financing activities 
commercial equipment consists of executive aircraft  machine tools and production equipment  containers and marine equipment  chemical  oil and gas equipment and other equipment 
new business volume of bcc is funded with debt obtained in the capital markets  cash from operations  and contributions from the company 
published sources and recent market transactions indicate that values for various aircraft types used as collateral in bcc s portfolio remained depressed 
at the same time  the credit ratings of many airlines  particularly in the united states  have continued to deteriorate 
a substantial portion of bcc s portfolio is concentrated among commercial airline customers 
certain customers have filed for bankruptcy protection or requested lease or loan restructurings  these negotiations were in various stages as of december  these bankruptcies or restructurings could have a material adverse effect on the company s earnings  cash flows or financial position 
united filed for chapter bankruptcy protection on december  as of the filing date  the company has not reached agreement with united on a restructuring of its various transactions 
future negotiations may result in changes to the agreements under which united has agreed to perform 
so long as united remains in bankruptcy  united has the right to reject or abandon its transaction with the company 
in the event that future negotiations or proceedings result in the return of a substantial number of aircraft  there could be a material adverse effect on the company s earnings  cash flows or financial position at least until such time as the aircraft are sold or redeployed for adequate consideration 
as of december   there were million of assets  principally commercial aircraft that were held for sale or re lease at bcc  of which million were not yet identified with a firm contract to sell or place on lease 
additionally  approximately million of bcc s assets are currently scheduled to come off lease in the inability of bcc to sell such assets or place such assets into revenue generating service could pose a potential risk to results of operations should some of these assets be deemed to be impaired 
airlines regularly utilize a special purpose entity spe known as a pass through trust 
the pass through trust enables the airline to aggregate a large number of aircraft secured notes into one trust vehicle  facilitating the issuance of larger bonds called pass through certificates ptcs 
the most common form of ptcs issued by airlines is the eetcs 
eetcs provide investors with tranched rights to cash flows from a financial instrument  as well as a collateral position in the related asset 
while the underlying classes of equipment notes vary by maturity and or coupon depending upon tenor or level of subordination of the specific equipment notes and their corresponding claim on the aircraft  the basic function of the pass through trust in an eetc remains to passively hold separate debt investments to enhance liquidity for investors  whom in turn pass this liquidity benefit directly to the airline in the form of lower coupon and or greater debt capacity 
bcc participates in several eetcs as an investor 
the eetc investments are related to customers the company believes have less than investment grade credit 
bcc also utilizes certain spes to isolate individual transactions for legal liability  perfect security interest from the perspective of the company and a third party lender in certain leveraged transactions  and realize certain income and sales tax benefits 
these spes are fully consolidated in the company s financial statements 
in december  bcc completed an asset securitization that raised million of secured debt through the use of a bank sponsored commercial paper conduit c p conduit 
as collateral for the debt  bcc transferred million of assets from its portfolio to the c p conduit 
these portfolio assets consisted of the cash flows associated with specific financing leases  notes and other receivables and operating leases 
bcc also assigned to the c p conduit perfected security interests in million of collateral underlying the transferred portfolio assets 
the collateral pledged indirectly provides the c p conduit with additional protection in the event that the cash flows from the leases and notes are insufficient to cover the total debt outstanding under the transaction 
the secured debt and securitized assets remain on bcc s balance sheet

the company s workforce level was  at december  contingent items various legal proceedings  claims and investigations related to products  contracts and other matters are pending against the company 
most significant legal proceedings are related to matters covered by insurance 
major contingencies are discussed below 
the company is subject to federal and state requirements for protection of the environment  including those for discharge of hazardous materials and remediation of contaminated sites 
due in part to their complexity and pervasiveness  such requirements have resulted in the company being involved with related legal proceedings  claims and remediation obligations since the s 
the company routinely assesses  based on in depth studies  expert analyses and legal reviews  its contingencies  obligations and commitments for remediation of contaminated sites  including assessments of ranges and probabilities of recoveries from other responsible parties who have and have not agreed to a settlement and of recoveries from insurance carriers 
the company s policy is to immediately accrue and charge to current expense identified exposures related to environmental remediation sites based on estimates of investigation  cleanup and monitoring costs to be incurred 
the costs incurred and expected to be incurred in connection with such activities have not had  and are not expected to have  a material impact to the company s financial position 
with respect to results of operations  related charges have averaged less than of annual net earnings 
such accruals as of december   without consideration for the related contingent recoveries from insurance carriers  are less than of total liabilities 
because of the regulatory complexities and risk of unidentified contaminated sites and circumstances  the potential exists for environmental remediation costs to be materially different from the estimated costs accrued for identified contaminated sites 
however  based on all known facts and expert analyses  the company believes it is not reasonably likely that identified environmental contingencies will result in additional costs that would have a material adverse impact to the company s financial position or operating results and cash flow trends 
the company is subject to us government investigations from which civil  criminal or administrative proceedings could result 
such proceedings could involve claims by the government for fines  penalties  compensatory and treble damages  restitution and or forfeitures 
under government regulations  a company  or one or more of its operating divisions or subdivisions  can also be suspended or debarred from government contracts  or lose its export privileges  based on the results of investigations 
the company believes  based upon all available information  that the outcome of any such government disputes and investigations will not have a material adverse effect on its financial position or continuing operations 
in  the us navy notified mcdonnell douglas now a subsidiary of the company and general dynamics corporation the team that it was terminating for default the team s contract for development and initial production of the a aircraft 
the team filed a legal action to contest the navy s default termination  to assert its rights to convert the termination to one for the convenience of the government  and to obtain payment for work done and costs incurred on the a contract but not paid to date 
as of december   inventories included approximately million of recorded costs on the a contract  against which the company has established a loss provision of million 
the amount of the provision  which was established in  was based on mcdonnell douglas s belief  supported by an opinion of outside counsel  that the termination for default would be converted to a termination for convenience  and that the best estimate of possible loss on termination for convenience was million 
on august   the us court of federal claims issued a decision after trial upholding the us government s default termination of the a contract on the grounds that the team could not meet the revised contract schedule unilaterally imposed by the us government 
this followed an earlier trial court decision in favor of the contractors and reversal of that initial decision on appeal 
the team appealed that decision to the court of appeals and is awaiting a decision 
the team also obtained a stay of the trial court s judgment to prevent the navy from collecting any amounts prior to the decision by the court of appeals 
if  after all judicial proceedings have ended  the courts determine that a termination for default was appropriate  the company would incur an additional loss of approximately million  consisting principally of remaining inventory costs and adjustments  and would be required to pay the us government one half of the unliquidated progress payments of  million plus statutory interest from february currently totaling approximately  million 
the loss to the company would total approximately  million in pre tax charges 
although the court of federal claims sustained the default termination in  the company believes that the court s ruling is contrary to law and fact and that the loss provision established by mcdonnell douglas in continues to provide adequately for the reasonably possible reduction in value of a net contracts in process as of december  final resolution of the a litigation will depend upon the outcome of further proceedings or possible negotiations with the us government 
the company is a defendant in seven employment discrimination matters in which class certification is sought or has been granted 
these matters are pending in seattle  los angeles  st 
louis  tulsa  and wichita 
the company intends to continue its aggressive defense of these cases 
it is not possible to predict what impact  if any  these cases could have on the financial statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk interest rate risk the company has financial instruments that are subject to interest rate risk  principally short term investments  fixed rate debt obligations  and customer financing assets and liabilities 
historically  the company has not experienced material gains or losses due to interest rate changes 
additionally  the company uses interest rate swaps to manage exposure to interest rate changes 
based on the current holdings of short term investments  as well as related swaps  the unhedged exposure to interest rate risk is not material for these instruments 
fixed rate debt obligations issued by the company are generally not puttable until maturity and are not actively traded by the company in the market 
therefore  exposure to interest rate risk is not believed to be material for the company s fixed rate debt 
boeing capital corporation s assets and liabilities  both fixed rate and floating rate  may be subject to interest rate risk to the extent that the maturities and repricing characteristics of the liabilities do not perfectly match those of the assets 
the types and terms of borrowing and hedging instruments that are available to bcc in the market and possible changes in asset terms limit bcc s ability to match assets and liabilities 
bcc attempts to keep this mismatch risk small  partly through the use of interest rate swaps  and does not believe it is materially exposed to gains or losses due to interest rate changes 
bcc has used public market information and common valuation methods to determine the fair value of its assets and liabilities 
the estimates are not necessarily indicative of the amounts bcc could realize in a current market exchange  and the use of different assumptions or valuation methods could have a material effect on the estimated fair value amounts 
at december   the book values of bcc s assets and liabilities were approximately billion and billion  respectively 
bcc uses duration gap analysis to estimate the impact of changes in interest rates 
potential changes in twelve month net interest income and in the current discounted value of the assets and liabilities are calculated based on the amount and timing of cash flows projected from each 
at december   the company estimated that if market interest rates for all maturities were affected by an immediate  one time  basis point increase  bcc s net earnings  taking into account increases in both revenue and interest expense  would have increased by an amount that is immaterial to the results of operations 
additionally  although the assets and liabilities impacted by a change in interest rates are generally not traded  bcc estimated that the net present value of these assets and liabilities would have changed by an amount that is immaterial to its financial position 
foreign currency exchange rate risk the company is subject to foreign currency exchange rate risk relating to receipts from customers and payments to suppliers in foreign currencies 
the company uses foreign currency forward contracts and options from time to time to hedge the price risk associated with firmly committed and forecasted foreign denominated payments and receipts related to its ongoing business and operational financing activities 
foreign currency contracts are sensitive to changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
at december   a unfavorable exchange rate movement in the company s portfolio of foreign currency forward contracts would have resulted in an incremental unrealized loss of million 
consistent with the use of these contracts to neutralize the effect of exchange rate fluctuations  such unrealized losses or gains would be offset by corresponding gains or losses  respectively  in the remeasurement of the underlying transactions being hedged 
when taken together  these forward contracts and the offsetting underlying commitments do not create material market risk 
commodity price risk the company is subject to commodity price risk relating principally to energy used in production 
the company periodically uses commodity derivatives  such as fixed price purchase commitments  to hedge against potentially unfavorable price changes of commodities 
commodity price exposure related to unhedged contracts is not material
