item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations general a predecessor corporation to the company was formed in july under the name of kos pharmaceuticals  inc principally to conduct research and development on new formulations of existing prescription pharmaceutical products 
in june  aeropharm technology  inc aeropharm  a then majority owned subsidiary of the company  was formed to conduct research and development activities on aerosolized products  dispensed in metered dosed inhalers  for the treatment of respiratory diseases 
during june  this predecessor corporation acquired the outstanding minority interest in aeropharm  changed its name to kos holdings  inc holdings  established the company as a wholly owned subsidiary under the name of kos pharmaceuticals  inc  and  effective as of june   transferred all of its existing assets  liabilities  and intellectual property  other than certain net operating loss carryforwards  to the company 
accordingly  all references in this form k filing to the company s business include the business and operations of holdings until june  on march   the company completed an initial public offering ipo of its common stock 
from inception through the ipo  the company had not recorded any significant revenues  and the company had funded its operations exclusively through equity contributions and a loan from its majority shareholder 
through december   the company had accumulated a deficit from operations of approximately million 
in connection with the transfer of operations from holdings to the company on june   net operating loss carryforwards amounting to approximately million and related tax benefits were retained by holdings and not transferred to the company 
consequently  the company may utilize net operating losses sustained subsequent to june   amounting to approximately million as of december   to offset future taxable net income  if any 
on july   the company was granted clearance by the fda to market its lead product  niaspan 
the company began shipping niaspan to wholesalers in mid august and began detailing niaspan to physicians in september on december   the company received approval from the fda to market its new niaspan lovastatin combination product  advicor 
the company began marketing advicor at the end of january results of operations critical accounting policies the company s significant accounting policies are described in note to the consolidated financial statements 
the company believes that its most critical accounting policies include revenue recognition and the estimation of product returns  rebates  and other allowances 
the impact of these estimates on results of operations for the years ended december  and  are described below 
the company s management periodically reviews these policies and estimates  the effect of which is reflected as a component of net revenue in the period in which the change is known 
such changes to these estimates have not been material to the company s results of operations during the three year period ended december  similar to most other pharmaceutical companies  kos has at times been subject to significant forward buy in from pharmaceutical wholesalers 
forward buy in is a practice whereby pharmaceutical wholesalers  relying on their ability to predict manufacturer price increases  augment product purchases just prior to such anticipated increases  as a mechanism to bolster operating profits 
thus  depending on when a particular wholesaler s forecasting model predicts the possibility of a price increase  product demand by wholesalers during a given period may not correlate with prescription demand for such product in that period 
as a result  the company periodically evaluates the inventory position of its customers to determine whether increased risk of product return exists because abnormally 
table of contents high inventory levels of its products are present throughout the product distribution channel 
if such abnormally high inventory levels are identified  the company s policy is to not recognize the revenue and related expenses associated with the excess inventory held by customers until such return risk is mitigated 
accordingly  the company did not recognize million in net revenues and related expenses associated with product shipments made during the year ended december  and will not recognize such gross revenues and related expenses until the level of niaspan and advicor products warehoused by customers returns to normal levels 
a key variable used by the company to assess the level of product return risk entails a determination of an appropriate or normal measurement of the inventory level throughout the product distribution channel  in terms of months on hand  necessary to meet normal demand for its products without an excessive risk of product return 
as of december   the company  based on the latest available market data and on its internal analysis  believes the appropriate industry level to be months on hand  which is consistent with the company s determination of appropriate inventory levels for periods prior to the december  year 
if  however  the company had utilized during the year ended december   a lower number of months on hand to estimate whether increased risk of product return existed because abnormally high inventory levels of such products were present throughout the product distribution channel  reported net revenue for the year ended december  would have been reduced and the amount of net revenue that would not have been recognized would have increased 
years ended december  and the company s reported revenue  including the effect of niaspan and advicor revenue not recognized during the period  increased to million for the year ended december   from million for this increase in revenue was mostly related to increases in prescription volume for the company s niaspan product during as compared to  as well as to the market introduction  during late january  of the company s advicor product 
more specifically  niaspan and advicor revenue for the years ended december  and  were as follows year ended december  in millions product shipments prior period product shipments recorded as revenue during period current period product shipments not recognized as revenue reported product sales the increase in niaspan and advicor product sales during the year ended december   were partially offset by the absence  during the period  of million in co promotion revenue associated with the terms of a co promotion agreement with abbott laboratories  inc abbott  for the promotion and marketing of abbott s mavik and tarka products within the united states the abbott agreement 
under the terms of the abbott agreement  the company received an increasing percentage of revenue based on sales thresholds 
kos and abbott agreed to terminate the abbott agreement effective january  accordingly  revenue for the year ended december   does not reflect co promotion revenue associated with the abbott agreement 
gross profit reported product sales less cost of product sold for the year ended december   was million  compared with million for the period 

table of contents through december   the company was subject to an agreement with dupont pharmaceuticals company dupont for the purpose of co promoting the company s advicor product in the united states and canada the dupont agreement

on december   the company entered into an agreement with bms pursuant to which the dupont agreement was terminated and bms paid kos million the bms payment 
of the total settlement received from bms  approximately million pertained to copromotion expenses due and unpaid by dupont prior to the termination of the dupont agreement 
the remaining settlement amount  or approximately million  was recorded as other income for the year ended december  on january   following the termination of the dupont agreement  the company began commercializing its advicor product 
accordingly  results of operations for the year ended december   reflect the company s significant efforts in connection with the commercial launch of this new product 
on october   the company signed an exclusive international commercialization agreement with merck kgaa merck to market the niaspan and advicor products outside the united states  canada and japan 
under terms of the agreement  merck will provide kos up to million in licensing  milestone and reimbursement payments  including million of upfront payments  of which million are reimbursable by kos if it fails to achieve certain regulatory milestones 
the milestone payments are dependent on the achievement of certain regulatory approvals and sales thresholds 
kos will also receive of net sales of the products in the territory  which includes the cost of goods sold 
merck will be responsible for conducting phase iv clinical studies and commercialization activities while kos is responsible for obtaining initial marketing authorization in all european countries and the supply and manufacturing of the products 
on november   kos received million as an upfront payment from merck 
this upfront payment will be recognized as revenue in future periods upon kos achieving certain regulatory milestones 
the company s research and development expenses increased to million for the year ended december   from million for the year ended december  the increased expense related primarily to increases of million in personnel and personnel related costs  million in medical education costs in support of the niaspan and advicor products  and of million in formulation development costs for products under development 
research and development expenses were also affected by the absence  during the period  of a million contribution made by dupont during the period pursuant to the dupont agreement  which agreement was terminated on december  under the terms of the dupont agreement  dupont shared equally with the company in costs associated with the clinical development  medical education  and promotional efforts of the company s advicor product 
this growth in research and development expenses was partially offset by a decrease of million in clinical study costs as a result of the substantial completion  during the period  of an advicor clinical trial 

table of contents selling  general and administrative expenses increased to million for the year ended december   from million for the year ended december  within this category  selling expenses increased to million for the period from million for the comparable period 
the growth in selling expenses was primarily related to increases of million in sales force operating costs  of million in marketing costs  of million in royalty expenses  of million in fees associated with a contract sales organization s assistance in the promotion of the company s niaspan and advicor products  of million in medical education grants  and by the absence  during the period  of a million contribution made by dupont during the period pursuant to the dupont agreement 
because of the termination of the abbott agreement  selling expenses for the year ended december   also exclude the effect of co promotion expenses associated with such co promotion arrangement  which totaled million for the year ended december  general and administrative expenses increased to million for the period  from million for the period 
this increase in general and administrative expenses related primarily to an increase of million in personnel and personnel related costs  of million in patent costs  and million in other costs associated with the expanded activities of the company

interest expense under these credit facilities totaled million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the company incurred a net loss of million for the year ended december   compared with net income of million for the year ended december  
table of contents years ended december  and the company s reported revenue  including the effect of niaspan revenue not recognized during the period  increased to million for the year ended december   from million for this million increase in revenue reflects a million increase in recorded sales of the company s niaspan product 
the increase in niaspan revenue is best explained as follows year ended december  in millions product shipments prior period product shipments recorded as revenue during period current period product shipments not recognized as revenue reported product sales revenue for the year ended december   also included million  or an increase of million  in co promotion revenue associated with the abbott agreement 
cost of sales was million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the higher cost of sales in was attributable to higher niaspan volume during the period  partially offset by efficiencies attained in the production of niaspan 
on december   the fda issued to the company an approval letter granting marketing clearance for the company s advicor product 
accordingly  results of operations for the year ended december   reflect the company s significant preparations in anticipation of the commercial launch of this new product 
the company s research and development expenses increased to million for the year ended december   from million for the year ended december  the increased expense related primarily to increases of million in medical education costs in support of the niaspan product and the anticipated launch of the advicor product  of million in personnel and personnel related costs  and of million in clinical study costs mostly associated with an advicor safety study 
these increases in research and development expenses were partially offset by a million contribution received from dupont under the terms of the dupont agreement 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased to million for the year ended december   from million for the year ended december  within this category selling expenses increased million to million for the year ended december   primarily as a result of an increase of million in sales force operating expenses  of million in marketing programs in support of niaspan and advicor  of million in marketing costs associated with mavik and tarka promotional efforts  and of million in royalty expenses associated with the increase in net sales of the niaspan product 
these increases in sales and marketing expenses were partially offset by a million contribution received from dupont under the terms of the dupont agreement 
general and administrative expenses increased to million for the year ended december   from million for the preceding period  primarily as a result of an increase of million in personnel and personnel related costs 

table of contents results of operations for the year ended december   also include the effect of termination of the dupont agreement on december  such termination  which concluded with the dupont payment  resulted in the company recording approximately million as other income for the year ended december  interest expense under the company s credit facilities totaled million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the company recorded net income of million for the year ended december   compared with a net loss of million for the year ended december  liquidity and capital resources at december   the company had cash and cash equivalents totaling million of which million was pledged as collateral for the company s letter of credit facility with a local bank and a working capital deficiency of million 
the company s primary uses of cash to date have been to fund selling  general and administrative expenses  and research and development expenses  including clinical trials 
as of december   the company s investment in equipment and leasehold improvements  net of depreciation and amortization  was million 
during the year ended december   the company spent million in capital expenditures and deposits on fixed assets to be acquired 
the company expects to increase the level of capital expenditures during mostly to provide increased production capacity for the advicor product 
accordingly  capital expenditures are expected to be significantly higher than those incurred during the year ended december  on december   the company and michael jaharis  chairman emeritus of the company s board of directors and its principal shareholder  entered into an agreement whereby mr 
jaharis agreed to replace the previous million credit facility extended to the company by mr 
jaharis on july   with a new facility expiring on june  the additional standby facility 
in connection with this new credit arrangement  the company granted to mr 
jaharis non detachable warrants to purchase  shares of the company s common stock at an exercise price based on the market price of the company s common stock on the date that the first draw under this facility occurs 
the company had no borrowings outstanding under the additional standby facility as of december  borrowings  when outstanding  will bear interest at the prime rate as of december   and are subject to the terms and conditions of borrowings made under the supplemental credit facility 
on september   the company formally agreed to the terms of an additional million funding arrangement initially entered into with michael jaharis on october  the supplemental credit facility 
on july   the company replaced its existing million promissory note payable to mr 
jaharis with two  million  promissory notes  one payable in the name of mr 
jaharis and the other payable in the name of mr 
jaharis wife 
with this promissory note replacement  all of mr 
jaharis existing rights and obligations under the supplemental credit facility  with respect to one half of the outstanding amount  have been transferred to mrs 
jaharis  and were subsequently transferred by mrs 
jaharis to a limited partnership that she controls 
all other terms and conditions of the supplemental credit facility remain unchanged 
borrowings under the supplemental credit facility totaled million as of december   bear interest at the prime rate  are convertible at per share into shares of the company s common stock  and will be due december  although no amounts borrowed under the supplemental credit facility have been converted as of december   the conversion of amounts borrowed under the supplemental credit facility into shares of the company s common stock would have resulted in the issuance of  additional shares of the company s common stock  thus causing material dilution to existing shareholders of the company 
the company believes that on or prior to the maturity date  it will have sufficient cash  available credit  and access to capital from third parties to be able to repay the supplemental credit facility on a timely basis 
table of contents in the event that it is not converted into shares of the company s common stock 
however  the company believes that  if the market price of the company s common stock continues to significantly exceed the conversion price established under the supplemental credit facility  which is per share  through the maturity date  mr 
jaharis and the other lenders will elect to convert the borrowings outstanding under this facility into shares of kos common stock prior to the maturity date  thereby relieving the company of the obligation to repay such facility 
if such debt conversion were not to take place for any reason  the company would be required to utilize its cash flow from operations and its then remaining borrowing capacity under its two other facilities with mr 
jaharis  if such borrowing capacity is available at all  to repay borrowings due under the supplemental credit facility 
in addition  the company could also be required to seek to raise additional capital to repay the supplemental credit facility to the extent that its cash and available credit are insufficient to repay the supplemental credit facility in full prior to its maturity date 
the company s decision to issue additional debt or equity  or to sell some or all of its assets  in order generate additional capital would require the consent of mr 
jaharis and the other lenders 
it is possible that the company could seek to extend the maturity date of the supplemental credit facility or enter into a new financing arrangement with mr 
jaharis and the other lenders that would replace the supplemental credit facility  however  the company has not sought any such extension or replacement facility and mr 
jaharis and the other lenders would be under no obligation to the company to provide any such extension or replacement 
there can be no assurance that additional capital will be available to the company on acceptable terms  or at all  or that the lenders under the supplemental credit facility will convert the company s borrowings under such facility into shares of the company s common stock 
on december   mr 
jaharis agreed to extend another million loan to the company the standby facility 
borrowings made under the standby facility totaled million as of december   are due june   and are also subject to most of the terms and conditions of borrowings made under the supplemental credit facility  including the condition that the death of lender shall not have occurred 
borrowings made under the standby facility are not  however  convertible into shares of the company s common stock 
in lieu of a conversion feature  the company has granted to mr 
jaharis non detachable warrants to purchase  shares of the company s common stock at per share  which approximated the market value of the company s common stock on the effective date of the standby facility 
the warrants are exercisable at any time until june  the exercise of a significant number of the warrants issued under the standby facility will cause material dilution to existing shareholders of the company 
the company recorded million and million of interest expense for the years ended december  and  respectively  related to its credit facilities with mr 
jaharis and his transferees 
in january  the securities and exchange commission declared effective a shelf registration statement filed by the company for the sale  from time to time  of up to million of its common stock  preferred stock  stock options  warrants and other rights to purchase common stock or preferred stock 
proceeds from any offerings are expected to be used to fund expanded selling efforts for the company s niaspan and advicor products  and for research and development and general corporate purposes 
at december   the company had not issued any securities under this registration statement 
although the company currently anticipates that  including the capital available to the company under the additional standby facility  the supplemental credit facility  and the standby facility  it has or has access to an amount of working capital that will be sufficient to fund the company s operations for the next twelve months  the company s cash requirements during this period will be substantial and may exceed the amount of working capital available to the company 
the company s ability to fund its 
table of contents operating requirements and maintain an adequate level of working capital will depend primarily on its ability to continue to generate substantial growth in sales of its niaspan and advicor products  its ability to continue to access its credit facilities  and on its ability to control operating expenses 
the company s failure to generate substantial growth in the sales of niaspan and advicor  control operating expenses  or meet the conditions necessary for the company to obtain funding under the additional standby facility  the supplemental credit facility  and the standby facility  and other events including the progress of the company s research and development programs  the costs and timing of seeking regulatory approvals of the company s products under development  the company s ability to obtain regulatory approvals in the united states and abroad  the company s ability to manufacture products at an economically feasible cost  costs in filing  prosecuting  defending  and enforcing patent claims and other intellectual property rights  the extent and terms of any collaborative research  manufacturing  marketing  joint venture  or other arrangements  and changes in economic  regulatory  or competitive conditions or the company s planned business could cause the company to require additional capital 
in the event that the company must raise additional capital to fund its working capital needs  it may seek to raise such capital through loans or the issuance of debt securities that would require the consent of the company s current lender  or through the issuance of equity securities 
to the extent the company raises additional capital by issuing equity securities or obtaining borrowings convertible into equity  ownership dilution to existing shareholders will result  and future investors may be granted rights superior to those of existing shareholders 
moreover  additional capital may not be available to the company on acceptable terms  or at all

market acceptance and sales growth of niaspan and advicor the company s success depends primarily upon its ability to successfully market and sell increasing quantities of the niaspan and advicor products 
the company s ability to successfully sell increasing quantities of the niaspan and advicor products will depend significantly on the continued acceptance of the niaspan product by physicians and their patients despite the introduction of advicor 
as a consequence of the on going commercialization of the advicor product  which is a combination product including niaspan and a statin  prescription levels for niaspan may be adversely affected to the extent a significant number of physicians prescribe advicor as a substitute product for their patients who are currently taking niaspan 
such substitution could have an adverse effect on the growth of the combined revenue generated from the sale of the company s products 
the company believes that intolerable flushing and potential liver toxicity associated with other currently available formulations of niacin are the principal reasons why physicians generally have been reluctant to prescribe or recommend such formulations 
flushing episodes are often characterized by facial redness  tingling or rash  and are a side effect that often occurs when humans ingest niacin 
currently available formulations of niacin generally either require  in the case of immediate release niacin  the patient to take niacin several times per day  resulting in multiple flushing episodes  or result  in the case of sustained release niacin  in liver toxicity 
although most patients taking the niaspan and advicor products will sometimes flush  the formulation and dosing regimen for niaspan and advicor have been designed to maximize patient acceptance and minimize the occurrence of flushing and liver toxicity 
if  however  a significant number of patients using the niaspan and advicor products were to suffer episodes of flushing that they consider intolerable or to suffer other side effects  physicians may discontinue prescribing the niaspan and advicor products or patients may stop taking niaspan and advicor  which would have a material adverse effect on the company 
unanticipated side effects or unfavorable publicity concerning the niaspan or advicor products or any other product incorporating technology similar to that used in the niaspan or advicor products also could have an adverse effect on the company s ability to obtain regulatory approvals or to achieve acceptance by prescribing physicians  managed care providers  or patients  any of which would have a material adverse effect on the company 
on january   the company began commercializing the advicor product 
the company s ability to successfully sell increasing quantities of the advicor product will depend significantly on the increasing acceptance of the advicor product by physicians and their patients 
if a significant number of patients using the advicor product were to suffer episodes of flushing that they consider intolerable or to suffer more serious side effects  such as rhabdomyolysis or myopathy  physicians may discontinue prescribing the advicor product or patients may stop taking advicor  which would have a material adverse effect on the company 
rhabdomyolysis is a rare disease in which serious muscle damage results in release of muscle cell contents into the bloodstream  which may be fatal 
myopathy is a disorder of muscle tissue or muscles that can result from endocrine disorders  metabolic disorders  infection or inflammation of the muscles  and from certain drugs 
the company is not aware of any reported cases of rhabdomyolysis or myopathy that were determined to be caused by patients taking advicor although there have been several cases where niaspan one of the principal ingredients in 
table of contents advicor or advicor have been identified as possible causes of myopathy 
unanticipated side effects or unfavorable publicity concerning the advicor product or any other product incorporating technology similar to that used in the advicor product also could have an adverse effect on the company s ability to maintain regulatory approvals or to achieve acceptance by prescribing physicians  managed care providers  or patients  any of which would have a material adverse effect on the company 
in addition  advicor may prove to be difficult to successfully sell because the cholesterol market is dominated by competitors with significantly larger sales forces and with significantly greater marketing resources than those available to the company 
further  advicor is a combination of two well known cholesterol drugs  niacin and lovastatin  that have been available for a significant period of time 
although the combination of these drugs is highly effective in improving all of the major components of cholesterol  it is possible that physicians may not prescribe advicor because it is not as new as more recently introduced compounds  such as the potent statin products marketed by the company s competitors 
also  because advicor is a combination of two currently available drugs  advicor has been approved by the fda for the improvement of cholesterol disorders in patients who were not able to achieve desired cholesterol improvements by taking either niaspan or lovastatin alone 
consequently  although such an approved treatment indication is standard for combination drugs such as advicor  it is possible that physicians will not prescribe advicor until they have first prescribed either niaspan  lovastatin  or another statin alone and subsequently determined that their patients need advicor to achieve desired cholesterol improvements 
similarly the company s ability to successfully sell increasing quantities of the advicor product may be adversely affected by the november release of zetia  part of a new class of cholesterol lowering agents  and by the possible release of crestor  a new  highly powerful statin product 
zetia is being marketed by merck schering plough pharmaceuticals  which is a joint venture between merck co  inc and schering plough corporation  and crestor will be marketed by astrazeneca 
merck schering plough pharmaceuticals and astrazeneca are both competitors with substantially greater resources than kos 
zetia is part of a new class of cholesterol lowering agents that inhibit the intestinal absorption of cholesterol 
crestor is a type of statin drug that is highly effective in reducing ldl cholesterol  but is less effective in modifying hdl cholesterol  triglycerides and other forms of cholesterol 
the company s future sales of advicor may also be affected by the potential release of several other new combination statin drugs in the future 
further  there are eight versions of generic lovastatin  one of the components of advicor  that have been launched into the cholesterol market  which could adversely affect demand for advicor 
consequently  the company s effort to sell increasing quantities of the advicor product may be unsuccessful 
history of operating losses  uncertainty of future profitability to date  the company has dedicated most of its financial resources to the development and commercialization of the niaspan and advicor products  the development of other products  and general and administrative expenses 
the company expects to incur significant operating losses for at least the first half of  due primarily to continued manufacturing and marketing  sales and administrative expenses associated with the niaspan and advicor products  and for investments in the company s research and development programs 
however  additional significant losses may continue thereafter 
the company s ability to achieve and maintain profitability will depend  among other things  on the commercial success of the niaspan and advicor products  on the company s ability to successfully exploit the company s manufacturing and sales and marketing capabilities  on the company s ability to complete the development of  and obtain regulatory approvals for  and achieve market acceptance for the company s products under development  and on the company s ability to maintain sufficient funds to finance the company s activities 
although the company recorded net income of million for the year ended december   the company s net loss for the years ended december    and has been million  million  and million  respectively 
as of december   the company s accumulated deficit was million 
in connection with the transfer of operations from kos holdings  inc to the company on june   net operating loss carryforwards 
table of contents amounting to approximately million and related tax benefits remained with kos holdings  inc and were not transferred to the company 
consequently  the company may utilize net operating loss carryforwards sustained subsequent to june   amounting to approximately million as of december   to offset future taxable net income  if any 
if the company is unable to achieve or sustain profitability  however  such carryforwards may not be utilized 
barr litigation on january   the company received notice from barr laboratories  inc barr that it had filed with the fda an abbreviated new drug application anda that would  if approved  allow barr to market a generic version of the company s mg niaspan product 
under the patent laws of the united states  the filing of an anda for a pharmaceutical composition or method of use that is currently protected by a patent  such as niaspan  constitutes an act of infringement 
as a result  on march   the company filed a patent infringement lawsuit against barr in the southern district of new york sdny 
on march   the company filed an amended complaint the amended complaint 
in this lawsuit  the company asserts that barr has infringed the and patents 
under the fda statute  the filing of a patent infringement suit by the company suspends the anda approval process for months or until the infringement suit is resolved 
on march   barr answered the amended complaint by denying that the and patents are valid and infringed  and seeking a declaratory judgment to that effect 
on august   barr amended its answer to add counterclaims requesting a declaratory judgment that two other patents owned by kos  us patent number  and  are not infringed  and that the patent is invalid 
on july   the company received notice from barr that it had filed an anda with the fda that would  if approved  allow barr to market generic versions of the company s mg and mg niaspan products 
on august   the company filed a second patent infringement lawsuit against barr also in the sdny 
again  the company asserted that barr has infringed the and patents 
on september   barr answered the complaint by denying infringement and alleging that the patents are invalid 
barr also sought a declaratory judgment that the    and patents are not infringed  and that the   and patents are invalid 
the two cases were consolidated on september  on september   the company received notice from barr that it had filed a supplemental paragraph iv certification relating to kos patent 
the company filed a third lawsuit on november   against barr in the sdny asserting infringement of this patent 
on december   barr answered the complaint by denying that the patent is valid and infringed  and enforceable  and seeking a declaratory judgment of invalidity 
barr also sought a declaratory judgment that the    and patents are not infringed  and that the  and patents are invalid 
the third case was consolidated with the first two on january  on march   kos replied to barr s declaratory judgment counterclaims by denying that kos patents are invalid or not infringed 
kos also sought a declaratory judgment that one or more of barr s products will infringe the and patents 
this current litigation is costly and time consuming  and we cannot assure you that we will be successful 
in addition  such litigation may result in financial losses or harm to our reputation  and may divert management resources and attention from our operations 
if barr is successful in this litigation  the company s  and and patents could be found to be invalid and unenforceable 
if such patents are invalid and unenforceable  the company would be unable to prevent barr from marketing a generic version of the niaspan product  which would have a material adverse effect on the company 
the company would also be unable to prevent other companies from introducing generic and other competing products into the market place 
furthermore  there could be an increased risk that other companies would challenge the company s proprietary rights or claim that the company s products infringe on their patents 

table of contents future capital needs  uncertainty of additional funding in order to finance the company s operations  as of december   the company has borrowed a total of million from michael jaharis  the company s principal shareholder and a director 
the company can borrow up to an additional million from mr 
jaharis under agreements currently in place  provided that the conditions of borrowings have been satisfied including  without limitation  that the death of lender shall not have occurred 
the repayment of funds borrowed from mr 
jaharis are secured by the pledge of all of the company s assets to him 
as a result  if the company is unable to repay the loans as they become due  the company could be forced to liquidate the company s assets or transfer all of such assets to mr

although the company experienced positive cash flows from operations during its third and fourth quarters of  the company has mostly experienced negative cash flows from operations since inception 
the company has spent and will continue to be required to spend substantial funds to continue research and development activities  including clinical trials of the company s products under development  and to commercialize the niaspan and advicor products and its other products under development  if regulatory approvals are obtained for such products under development 
the company believes that it has sufficient resources  including funds available to it under loans from mr 
jaharis  to fund its operations through at least the next twelve months 
even with the proceeds from these sources  however  the company may need or elect to raise additional capital prior to such date 
the company s ability to fund its operating requirements and maintain an adequate level of working capital for the next twelve months will depend primarily on the near term commercial success of niaspan and advicor  the company s ability to meet the conditions necessary to obtain funding under its lines of credit  including  without limitation  that the death of lender shall not have occurred  the problems  delays  expenses and complications frequently encountered by companies at this stage of development  the progress of the company s research  development  and clinical trial programs  the costs and timing of seeking regulatory approvals of the company s products under development  the company s ability to obtain such regulatory approvals  costs in filing  prosecuting  defending  and enforcing patent claims and other intellectual property rights  the extent and terms of any collaborative research  manufacturing  marketing  or other arrangements  and changes in economic  regulatory  or competitive conditions or the company s planned business 
estimates about the adequacy of funding for the company s activities are based on certain assumptions  including assumptions regarding the marketing and sales success of the niaspan and advicor products  the regulatory and commercial success of the advicor product  and that testing and regulatory procedures relating to the company s other products under development can be conducted at projected costs and within projected time frames 
to the extent these assumptions prove to be inaccurate  the company may have insufficient resources to fund its operations as currently planned 
to satisfy its capital requirements  the company may seek to raise funds in the public or private capital markets 
the company s ability to raise additional funds in the public markets may be adversely affected if sales of the niaspan and advicor products do not increase rapidly  if the results of the clinical trials for the company s products under development are not favorable  or if regulatory approval for any of its products under development is not obtained 
the company may seek additional funding through corporate collaborations and other financing vehicles 
if adequate funds are not available to the company  or if available  their terms are unacceptable  kos may be required to significantly reduce its marketing activities for the niaspan and advicor products or curtail significantly one or more of its research or development programs or the company may be required to obtain funds through arrangements with future collaborative partners or others that may require kos to relinquish rights to the niaspan or advicor products or to some or all of its technologies or products under development or take significant cost reducing actions or both 
if the company is successful in obtaining additional financing  the terms of the financing may have the effect of diluting or adversely affecting the holdings or the rights of the holders of the company s securities 

table of contents limited sales and marketing experience and resources although the company markets the niaspan and advicor products and it intends to market its products under development through the company s own specialty sales force  including sales representatives available exclusively to kos under a contract sales force arrangement  substantial resources will continue to be required for kos to promote the sale of its products 
because its current marketing resources are limited  the company may be unable to devote sufficient resources to the niaspan and advicor products  or to the company s products under development to achieve increasing market acceptance of such products 
the company s failure to expend the resources to adequately promote the niaspan and advicor products or its other products under development would have a material adverse effect on the company s business and results of operations 
moreover  because the company has fewer sales persons than its competitors  the company s sales force may be unable to detail successfully physicians who prescribe lipid altering medications 
the company may not be able to retain its current sales representatives 
even if the company hires additional representatives  they may not be immediately effective in promoting the sale of the niaspan and advicor products 
as a result  kos may be unable to generate significantly increased sales of the niaspan or advicor products 
the failure of the company s sales representatives to generate increased sales of the niaspan and advicor products would have a material adverse effect on operating results 
control by existing shareholder michael jaharis  the company s principal shareholder and a director  owns  directly or indirectly   shares of the company s common stock as of december   or approximately of the common stock outstanding 
accordingly  mr 
jaharis can control the outcome of certain shareholder votes  including votes concerning the election of directors  the adoption or amendment of provisions in the company s articles of incorporation  and the approval of mergers and other significant corporate transactions 
this level of concentrated ownership by one person may have the effect of delaying or preventing a change in the management or voting control of kos 
in addition  a line of credit totaling  between kos  mr 
jaharis and his spouse  or her transferee  gives each of them the right to convert at per share amounts owed to them by kos under such line of credit into shares of the company s common stock 
another line of credit gives mr 
jaharis the right to exercise warrants to purchase six million shares of the company s common stock at per share 
the warrants are non detachable and can be exercised only through the conversion of principal and interest accumulated under the line of credit 
if this conversion option and warrant exercises were to occur  mr 
jaharis direct or indirect ownership of the company s common stock would increase to  shares  or approximately of the common stock outstanding  and mary jaharis or her transferee would control  shares  or approximately of the common stock outstanding  in each case assuming such conversion and warrant exercises had occurred as of december  
table of contents competition and technological change many products are commercially available for the treatment of elevated ldl cholesterol  and the manufacturers of such products  individually and collectively  have significantly greater financial resources and sales and manufacturing capabilities than those available to kos  including combined field sales forces exceeding  persons  compared with the company s approximately person field sales force  including approximately contract sales force representatives 
the company s direct competitors and their respective competitive products include  among others abbott tricor bristol myers squibb pravachol merck zocor and mevacor novartis lescol pfizer lipitor and lopid sankyo welchol merck schering plough zetia astrazeneca crestor the company estimates that the existing niaspan and advicor prescriptions account for slightly more than of the total prescriptions currently being written in the united states for cholesterol lowering pharmaceutical compounds 
in addition  zetia  part of a new class of cholesterol lowering agents that inhibit the intestinal absorption of cholesterol  was launched in november by merck schering plough pharmaceuticals  and crestor  a new highly powerful statin product  could be launched during by astrazeneca 
both merck schering plough pharmaceuticals and astrazeneca are competitors who have substantially greater resources than those available to kos 
further  several other new combination statin drugs may be marketed during succeeding years 
finally  there are eight versions of generic lovastatin  one of the components of advicor  currently being marketed in the cholesterol market 
the existence of distributors of generic lovastatin and the competitive environment they create may inhibit the niaspan and advicor products from competing successfully or from achieving increased sales 
moreover  the active ingredient in niaspan  niacin  is available in several other formulations  most of which do not require a prescription 
although the company believes that there are no other currently available niacin formulations that have been approved by the fda specifically for once a day dosing  physicians may decide to prescribe or recommend some of these unapproved niacin formulations  using the niaspan product s dosing regimen  to try to achieve the same results as niaspan 
substitution of other niacin formulations for the niaspan product could have a material adverse effect on the company s business and results of operations 
moreover  manufacturers of other niacin formulations could promote their products using the niaspan product s dosing regimen and could promote the sale of their products to treat the indications for which the company has received clearance to market niaspan 
although such promotion would be a violation of fda regulations  the significant occurrence of such practices would have a material adverse effect on the company 
moreover  many established pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies  universities  and other research institutions with resources significantly greater than kos may develop products that directly compete with the company s products 
even if the company s products under development prove to be more effective than those developed by other entities  such other entities may be more successful in marketing their products than kos because of greater financial resources  stronger sales and marketing efforts  and other factors 
if these entities are successful in developing products that are safer  more effective  or less costly than the products developed by kos  the company s products may be unable to compete successfully with any of those products 

table of contents international commercialization agreement with merck kgaa on october   the company signed an exclusive international commercialization agreement with merck kgaa merck to market the niaspan and advicor products outside the united states  canada and japan the merck agreement 
under terms of the merck agreement  merck will provide kos up to million in licensing  milestone and reimbursement payments  including million in upfront payments 
kos is responsible for obtaining initial marketing authorization in all european countries and the supply and manufacturing of the products 
pursuant to the merck agreement  if marketing authorization is not obtained for niaspan or advicor in certain countries and within certain timeframes  merck will have the right to terminate the agreement  and kos will be required to reimburse merck for up to million of the upfront payments 
in addition  other milestone payments payable to kos under the merck agreement are dependent on the achievement of marketing authorization of niaspan in certain countries  the achievement of marketing authorization of advicor in certain countries  and achieving certain net sales thresholds of niaspan and advicor 
in  kos received marketing approval for niaspan in the united kingdom  and in  submitted advicor for marketing approval in the united kingdom 
there is no certainty that marketing authorizations for the niaspan and advicor products will be obtained under the mutual recognition procedures  or  with respect to advicor  at all  and there could be delays in the granting of such authorizations 
consequently  kos may be required to reimburse merck for up to million of the upfront payments and may not receive any of the milestone payments under the merck agreement 
no assurance of adequate third party reimbursement the company s ability to commercialize successfully its products under development is dependent in part on the extent to which appropriate levels of reimbursement for the niaspan and advicor products  or for the other products it sells are obtained from government authorities  private health insurers  and managed care organizations such as health maintenance organizations or hmos 
the company estimates that  through december   approximately million  or  of the company s cumulative niaspan and advicor revenue has been subjected to the reimbursement rules of such organizations 
managed care organizations and other third party payors are increasingly challenging the pricing of pharmaceutical products 
the trend toward managed healthcare in the united states  the growth of organizations such as hmos  and legislative proposals to reform healthcare and government insurance programs could significantly influence the purchase of pharmaceutical products  resulting in lower prices and reduced demand for niaspan  the advicor product  or the company s products under development 
such cost containment measures and potential legislative reform could affect the company s ability to sell niaspan  advicor  or its products under development and may have a material adverse effect on the company 
significant uncertainty exists about the reimbursement status of newly approved pharmaceutical products 
although the company has obtained approvals for reimbursement for the cost of niaspan and advicor from many third party payors  such approvals  in the united states and in foreign countries  may be discontinued for niaspan  or unavailable for advicor or any of the company s products under development 
the unavailability or inadequacy of third party reimbursement for niaspan  advicor  or the company s products under development may reduce the demand for  or negatively affect the price of  these products  which would have a material adverse effect on the company 

table of contents dependence on key personnel the company s success is dependent on the company s ability to attract and retain highly qualified scientific  management  and sales personnel 
in april  the company hired its current president and chief executive officer  adrian adams 
mr 
adams succeeded daniel m 
bell  kos current chairman of the board of directors  as the chief executive officer of the company in january the loss of mr 
adams as the company s president and chief executive officer could have a material adverse effect on its operations and business 
similarly  the loss of mr 
bell as the chairman of kos board of directors could have a material adverse effect on the company s operations and business 
due to intense competition for personnel from other companies  academic institutions  government entities  and other organizations  the company may be unsuccessful in attracting and retaining key personnel 
the loss of key personnel  or the inability to attract and retain the additional  highly skilled employees required for the expansion of kos activities  could adversely affect its business and operating results 
products under development although the company has obtained clearance from the fda to market the niaspan and advicor products  the company may be unsuccessful in effectively formulating any of its other products as planned 
further  the company may not be successful in demonstrating the safety and efficacy of such products in human clinical trials 
these trials may be costly and time consuming 
the administration of any product the company develops may produce undesirable side effects that could result in the interruption  delay or suspension of clinical trials  or the failure to obtain fda or other regulatory approval for any or all targeted indications 
even if regulatory approval is secured  the company s products under development may later produce adverse effects that limit or prevent their widespread use or that necessitate their withdrawal from the market 
the company may discontinue the development of any of its products under development at any time 
patents and trademarks  interference the company s ability to commercialize any of its products under development will depend  in part  on the company s or on its licensors ability to obtain patents  enforce those patents  preserve trade secrets  and operate without infringing on the proprietary rights of third parties 
in addition  the patents that the company has been issued or for which kos has applied relating to niaspan  advicor and certain of the company s products under development are based on  among other things  the extended release nature of the niacin active ingredient 
if the indications treated by niaspan  advicor and such other products under development could be treated using drugs without such extended release properties  such patents and patent applications may not prevent the use of other niacin based drugs for the treatment of such indications  which would have a material adverse effect on the company 
further  the company would be adversely affected if the patent applications licensed to or owned by kos do not result in issued patents  meaningful patent protection is not secured for any particular technology  or any patents that have been or may be issued to kos or the company s licensors  including the patents covering the company s niaspan product  are invalid or unenforceable 
in general  the us patents and patent applications owned by or licensed to kos relate to certain extended release niacin compositions and their methods of use 
protection of the chemical entity is not available for the active ingredient in niaspan  or either of the active ingredients in advicor 
moreover  the active ingredient in niaspan  niacin  is currently sold in the united states and other markets for lipid altering and for other uses 
the additional active ingredient in advicor  lovastatin  is also currently sold in the united states and other markets for lipid altering 
even in jurisdictions where the use of the active ingredients in niaspan and advicor for lipid altering and other indications may be covered by the claims 
table of contents of method of use and composition patents owned by or licensed to kos  off label sales might occur that would be difficult to prevent through enforcement of kos patents  especially if another company markets the active ingredient at a price that is less than the price of niaspan or advicor  thereby potentially reducing the sales of such products 
the us patent and trademark office the pto has issued us patent numbers  and  to the company with claims related to niaspan s composition and method of use 
in addition  on june   the pto issued us patent number  related to certain unique pharmacokinetic features of kos inventive extended release niacin compositions  including niaspan and advicor 
on february   the company entered into an agreement with a generic manufacturer pursuant to which the company and the manufacturer granted cross licenses to each other under their respective patents 
the company has purchased the patents that were the subject of the cross license agreement and agreed to continue paying a royalty to the manufacturer on terms similar to those contained in the cross license agreement 
the company has received patents and has filed patent applications covering technologies pertaining to propellant driven aerosol formulations that do not contain chlorofluorocarbons 
the company is aware that certain european and us patents have been issued with claims covering products that contain certain propellant driven aerosol formulations that do not contain chlorofluorocarbons 
it may be argued that certain or all of the company s aerosol products under development may use a formulation covered by such european or us patents 
if that is shown to be the case  the company would be prevented from making  using or selling such products unless kos obtains a license under such patents  which license may not be available on commercially reasonable terms  or at all  or unless such patents are determined to be invalid in europe or invalid or unenforceable in the united states 
the company s development of products that may be covered by such patents and its failure to obtain licenses under such patents in the event such patents are determined to be valid and enforceable could have an adverse effect on the company s business 
on january   the company received notice from barr laboratories  inc barr that it had filed with the fda an abbreviated new drug application anda that would  if approved  allow barr to market a generic version of the company s mg niaspan product 
under the patent laws of the united states  the filing of an anda for a pharmaceutical composition or method of use that is currently protected by a patent  such as niaspan  constitutes an act of infringement 
as a result  on march   the company filed a patent infringement lawsuit against barr in the southern district of new york sdny 
on march   the company filed an amended complaint the amended complaint 
in this lawsuit  the company asserts that barr has infringed the and patents 
under the fda statute  the filing of a patent infringement suit by the company suspends the anda approval process for months or until the infringement suit is resolved 
on march   barr answered the amended complaint by denying that the and patents are valid and infringed  and seeking a declaratory judgment to that effect 
on august   barr amended its answer to add counterclaims requesting a declaratory judgment that two other patents owned by kos  us patent number  and  are not infringed  and that the patent is invalid 
on july   the company received notice from barr that it had filed an anda with the fda that would  if approved  allow barr to market generic versions of the company s mg and mg niaspan products 
on august   the company filed a second patent infringement lawsuit against barr also in the sdny 
again  the company asserted that barr has infringed the and patents 
on september   barr answered the complaint by denying infringement and alleging that the patents are invalid 
barr also sought a declaratory judgment that the    and patents are not infringed  and that the   and patents are invalid 
the two cases were consolidated on september  
table of contents on september   the company received notice from barr that it had filed a supplemental paragraph iv certification relating to kos patent 
the company filed a third lawsuit on november   against barr in the sdny asserting infringement of this patent 
on december   barr answered the complaint by denying that the patent is valid and infringed  and enforceable  and seeking a declaratory judgment of invalidity 
barr also sought a declaratory judgment that the    and patents are not infringed  and that the  and patents are invalid 
the third case was consolidated with the first two on january  on march   kos replied to barr s declaratory judgment counterclaims by denying that kos patents are invalid or not infringed 
kos also sought a declaratory judgment that one or more of barr s products will infringe the and patents 
because the patent positions of pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies are highly uncertain and involve complex legal and factual questions  the patents owned and licensed by kos  or any future patents  may not prevent other companies from developing competing products or ensure that others will not be issued patents that may prevent the sale of the company s products or require licensing and the payment of significant fees or royalties 
furthermore  to the extent that any of the company s future products or methods are not patentable  such products or methods infringe upon the patents of third parties  or the company s patents or future patents fail to give kos an exclusive position in the subject matter to which those patents relate  the company will be adversely affected 
the company may be unable to avoid infringement of third party patents and may have to obtain a license  or defend an infringement action and challenge the validity of the patents in court 
a license may be unavailable on terms and conditions acceptable to the company  if at all 
patent litigation is costly and time consuming  and the company may be unable to prevail in any such patent litigation or devote sufficient resources to even pursue such litigation 
if the company does not obtain a license under such patents  or if it is found liable for infringement and if it is not able to have such patents declared invalid  the company may be liable for significant money damages  may encounter significant delays in bringing products to market  or may be precluded from participating in the manufacture  use  or sale of products or methods of treatment requiring such licenses 
government regulation  no assurances of regulatory approval the company s research and development activities  preclinical studies  clinical trials  and the manufacturing and marketing of the company s products are subject to extensive regulation by the fda 
the drug development and approval process takes many years and requires the expenditure of substantial resources 
data obtained from preclinical and clinical activities are susceptible to varying interpretations that could delay  limit  or prevent regulatory approval 
although the company may consult the fda for guidance in developing protocols for clinical trials  despite such consultation  the fda may find the clinical trials inadequate or not well controlled 
they may also reject the results of those trials altogether 
in addition  delays or rejections of applications for regulatory approval may result from changes in or additions to fda regulations concerning the drug approval process 
thus  regulatory reviews may be untimely and regulatory approvals could be denied for products developed by the company 
even if regulatory approval of a product is obtained  the approval will be limited as to the indicated uses for which it may be promoted or marketed 
in addition  a marketed drug  its bulk chemical supplier  its manufacturer  and its manufacturing facilities are subject to continual regulatory review and periodic inspections  and later discovery of previously unknown problems with a product  supplier  manufacturer  or facility may result in restrictions on such products or manufacturers  which may require a withdrawal of the product from the market 
failure to comply with the applicable regulatory requirements in the united states or abroad can  among other things  result in fines  suspensions of regulatory approvals  seizure of products  product recalls  operating restrictions  and criminal prosecution  any of which could have a material adverse effect on kos 

table of contents outside the united states  the company s research and development activities  preclinical studies  clinical trials  and the manufacturing and marketing of the company s products are subject to extensive foreign regulation 
in the european union  the approval of new drugs is governed by the central approval or mutual recognition procedures of the european medicines evaluation agency emea 
in  the company received marketing approval for niaspan in the united kingdom  and in  submitted advicor for marketing approval in the united kingdom 
pursuant to the merck agreement  the company is responsible for obtaining initial marketing authorization for the niaspan or advicor products in all countries in the european union 
there could be delays or rejections in applications for regulatory approval in europe and in other countries  as well a requirement of completion of additional preclinical and clinical studies 
the process of obtaining regulatory approval could be costly 
in addition  competitors of the company may obtain regulatory approval for similar products 
even if regulatory approval of a product is obtained  the approval will be limited as to the indicated uses for which it may be promoted or marketed  and the product will be subject to a continual regulatory review and inspections  which  if previously unknown problems are discovered  may result in restrictions on the products and manufacturers  which may require a withdrawal of the product from the market 
in addition  individual countries will have pricing  third party reimbursement and labeling approvals necessary for the manufacture  distribution  use and sale of products with which the company must comply 
moreover  because the legislative and regulatory environment continues to evolve in the us and abroad  it is difficult to predict the impact of legislation and regulations on the company and its products 
in july  the division of drug marketing  advertising  and communication at the fda issued a warning letter to kos related to an advertisement the company ran in a healthcare section of time magazine 
the advertisement  which the company intended to run only one time  was designed to increase awareness of the company s niaspan product 
in its warning letter  the fda objected to the advertisement on the grounds that the advertisement failed to reflect a fair balance of the contraindications  warnings  precautions  and side effects of the company s niaspan product 
the fda also objected to the advertisement on the grounds that the advertisement overstated the efficacy of the niaspan product in light of its approved labeling 
subsequent to this event  the company reached agreement with the fda to remedy their objections by placing a new advertisement with content that adequately characterizes the risks and other safety implications for the product 
the company s business is also subject to regulation under state  federal and local laws  rules  regulations  and policies relating to the protection of the environment and health and safety  including those governing the use  generation  manufacture  storage  air emission  effluent discharge  handling  and disposal of certain materials 
the company believes that it is in compliance in all material respects with all such laws  rules  regulations  and policies applicable to kos 
however  non compliance with such environmental and health and safety laws and regulations in the future would require kos to incur significant costs to comply 
the company s research and development involves the controlled use of hazardous materials 
although the company believes that its safety procedures for handling and disposing of such materials comply with the standards prescribed by applicable state  federal  and local regulations  the risk of contamination or injury from these materials cannot be completely eliminated 
in the event of such contamination or injury  the company could be held liable for any damages that result and any such liability could exceed its resources and materially adversely affect the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 

table of contents limited manufacturing experience  risk of scale up the company currently manufactures the niaspan and advicor products in one manufacturing plant in edison  new jersey that has been inspected and approved by the fda for both niaspan and advicor 
although both products have been approved for manufacture in the edison facility and are produced in substantial compliance with current good manufacturing practice regulations as required by the fda for the manufacture of pharmaceutical products  the company has limited experience in manufacturing products for commercial sale in the edison facility and inefficiencies may exist in the manufacturing process 
the company may need to further scale up certain of the company s current manufacturing processes to achieve production levels consistent with the commercial sale of its products for both the us and international use 
further  modifications to the facilities  systems  and procedures may be necessary to maintain capacity at a level sufficient to meet market demand or to maintain compliance with current good manufacturing practices regulations and other regulations prescribed by various regulatory agencies including the occupational safety and health administration and the environmental protection agency 
the company s failure to successfully further scale up  expand in connection with manufacture for commercial sale  or modify the company s manufacturing process or to comply with current good manufacturing practices regulations and other regulations could delay the approval of its products under development or limit its ability to meet the demand for its products  any of which would have a material adverse effect on kos 
such occurrences may require kos to acquire alternative means of manufacturing the company s products  which may not be available on a timely basis  on commercially practicable terms  or at all 
dependence on single sources of supply some materials used in the company s products  including the active ingredients in niaspan and advicor  are currently sourced from single qualified suppliers 
the company has not established arrangements with alternative suppliers for these ingredients  although the company believes that it can obtain an alternative supply of lovastatin  one of the two active ingredients in advicor  if necessary 
although the company has maintained a business relationship with its niacin supplier since  and has not experienced difficulty to date in acquiring niacin  or other materials for product development  additional product validations and regulatory submissions would be required if supply interruptions were to occur in the future or if the company had to obtain substitute materials 
similarly  the company s source for lovastatin is relatively inexperienced as a supplier of such ingredient 
although the company has maintained a business relationship with its lovastatin supplier since  and this supplier is experienced as a supplier of other pharmaceutical grade active ingredients  this supplier may be unable to meet the company s requirements for lovastatin on a sustained basis  at an acceptable quality standard  or at a commercially viable price 
in such an event  the company would be forced to obtain an alternative supplier of lovastatin 
any interruption of raw material supply  for any reason  in any of the required ingredients for the company s products could have a material adverse effect on kos ability to manufacture its products or to obtain or maintain regulatory approval of such products 

table of contents risk of product liability claims  no assurance of adequate insurance manufacturing  marketing  selling  and testing niaspan  advicor  and the company s products under development entails a risk of product liability 
on august   bayer ag  removed its statin product  baycol  from the market because of multiple deaths attributed to a rare form of a muscle disorder called rhabdomyolysis 
as a result of the removal of baycol from the market  however  the side affects of statin products have been subject to increased scrutiny 
although the statin component of advicor has been approved by the fda and marketed for nearly years and is a different drug compound than that which was used in baycol  to the extent that patients who take advicor develop serious adverse side affects  such as rhabdomyolysis  or associate the adverse events experienced by some baycol patients with all other statin products  including the company s advicor product  it would have a material adverse effect on the company s business 
the company could be subject to product liability claims in the event that its products or products under development fail to perform as intended 
even unsuccessful claims could result in the expenditure of funds in litigation and the diversion of management time and resources and could damage the company s reputation and impair the marketability of its products 
while the company currently maintains liability insurance  the company may not be able to maintain such insurance at a commercially reasonable cost 
if a successful claim were made against the company  and the amount of insurance were inadequate to cover the costs of defending against or paying such a claim  or the damages payable by kos  the company would experience a material adverse effect on its business  financial condition  and results of operations and on the price of the company s common stock 
certain registration rights the company has granted certain registration rights to the company s controlling shareholder  mr 
jaharis  his spouse  and their transferees  and to kos investments  inc and kos holdings  inc  which entitle such persons and entities to cause the company to effect an unlimited number of registrations under the securities act of of sales of up to an aggregate of  shares of the company s common stock owned or controlled by such persons or entities or that could be acquired by such person or entities upon exercise or conversion of securities they currently hold 
these registration rights generally would also permit the holders of such rights to include shares in any registration statement otherwise filed by kos 
by exercising these registration rights  these persons and entities could cause a large number of shares to be registered and become freely tradeable without restrictions under the securities act except for those purchased in the offering by the company s affiliates immediately upon the effectiveness of such registration 
such sales may have an adverse effect on the market price of the common stock and could impair the company s ability to raise additional capital 

table of contents possible stock price volatility the stock market  including the nasdaq national market  on which the company s shares are listed  has from time to time experienced significant price and volume fluctuations that may be unrelated to the operating performance of particular companies 
in addition  the market price of the company s common stock  like the stock prices of many publicly traded pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies  has been and may continue to be highly volatile 
the following table sets forth  for the fiscal periods indicated  the range of high and low prices for trades of the company s common stock on the nasdaq national market system

table of contents anti takeover provisions certain provisions of the company s articles of incorporation and bylaws generally permit removal of directors only for cause by a vote of the shareholders  require a vote of the shareholders to amend the company s articles of incorporation and bylaws  require a demand of at least of the company s shareholders to call a special meeting of shareholders  and prohibit shareholder actions by written consent 
certain of such provisions also allow the board of directors to authorize the issuance of preferred stock with rights superior to those of the common stock 
moreover  provisions of the florida business corporation act  to which the company is subject  prohibit the voting of shares that are acquired in certain takeovers without the approval of the board of directors or the approval by a majority of the corporation s voting shares 
accordingly  the forgoing provisions could prevent the removal of the company s current directors and management  or discourage a third party from attempting to acquire  or make it more difficult for a third party to acquire  control of kos 

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company s exposure to market risk is limited primarily to fluctuating interest rates associated with variable rate indebtedness that is subject to interest rate changes in the united states
