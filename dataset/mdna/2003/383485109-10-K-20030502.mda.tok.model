item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations following is management s discussion and analysis of significant factors that have affected the company s financial position and its results of operations for the periods presented in the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
fiscal and results both include weeks as compared to fiscal results  which includes weeks 
management believes the company s results of operations for fiscal were not materially affected by results attributable to the rd week 
critical accounting policies the company s significant accounting policies are described in note to the consolidated financial statements included in part iv  item of this form k 
the company s discussion and analysis of its financial condition and results of operations are based upon the company s consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires the company to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and the related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an ongoing basis  the company evaluates its estimates  including those related to its revenue recognition policy  the carrying value of its merchandise inventories  the adequacy of its store closure reserves  and the valuation of its long lived assets and deferred tax assets 
the company bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
in the past  actual results have not been materially different from the company s estimates 
some of the company s significant accounting policies involve a higher degree of judgment or complexity than its other accounting policies 
the policies described below have been identified as critical to the company s business operations and the understanding of its results of operations 
the impact and associated risks related to these policies on the company s business operations are discussed throughout management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
revenue recognition policy net retail sales are recognized at the point of sale  net of estimated sales returns and allowances and exclusive of sales tax 
net retail sales also include all amounts billed to a customer in a sale transaction for shipping and handling  including customer delivery charges 
revenues on special order sales are recognized when the merchandise is delivered to the customer and the merchandise has been paid for in its entirety 
the company records an allowance for estimated sales returns in the period in which the related sale occurs 
these estimates are based primarily on historical sales returns 
if the historical data used to calculate these estimates does not properly reflect future returns  revenue could be overstated and adjustments to the allowance for estimated sales returns may be necessary 
inventory valuation merchandise inventory  which consists of merchandise held for resale  is valued at the lower of lifo last in  first out cost or market using the retail inventory method rim of accounting 
inherent in the rim calculation are various judgements and estimates including  among others  merchandise markon  markups  markdowns and shrinkage  which significantly impact the ending inventory valuation at cost  as well as resulting gross margins 
the company applies various methodologies to ensure that the application of the rim is consistent for all periods presented 
such methodologies include the development of consistent cost to retail ratios and the grouping of homogenous classes of merchandise 
estimated inventory shrinkage between physical inventory dates is based on historical experience 
should actual inventory shrinkage results differ from the company s estimate  year end revisions to inventory shrinkage expense recognized on an interim basis may be required 
estimating the market value of the company s merchandise inventory requires assumptions about future demand and market conditions 
such estimates are based on actual and forecasted sales trends  current inventory levels and aging information by merchandise categories 
the company records markdowns to value merchandise inventories at net realizable value 
if forecasted sales are not achieved  or if other indicators of impairment are present  additional markdowns may be needed in future periods to clear excess or slow moving merchandise  which may result in lower gross margins 
reserve for store closure costs in the event a store is closed before its lease has expired  the remaining lease obligation after the closing date less anticipated sublease rental income or proceeds from lease settlements  if any  and asset impairment charges related to furniture  fixtures and equipment  leasehold improvements  goodwill and leasehold interests  if any  are expensed in the period in which management adopts a plan to close the store 
severance and other incremental costs associated with a store closure are expensed as incurred 
for store closure plans adopted after january   store closure costs will generally be recognized when the costs are incurred 
as of february   the company had a reserve for store closure costs totaling  which consisted primarily of estimated future lease obligations for two of the store locations closed in fiscal and the four locations closed in fiscal in the event the company is not successful in selling or subleasing the two locations closed in fiscal as soon as management expects  additional reserves for store closure costs may be recorded 
in addition  in the event the company decides to close additional store locations in fiscal or beyond  additional reserves for store closure costs  which may be material  may be incurred 
impairment of long lived assets the company s long lived assets consist primarily of property and equipment  goodwill  leasehold interests and other long term assets 
long lived assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable 
with respect to store locations  the company performs an evaluation of whether an impairment charge should be recorded whenever a store experiences unfavorable operating performance 
a store s assets are evaluated for impairment by comparing its estimated undiscounted cash flows over its estimated remaining lease term to its carrying value 
if the cash flows are not sufficient to recover the carrying value  a loss equal to the difference between the carrying value and the discounted future cash flows of the asset is recognized 
estimates of future cash flows are based on a variety of factors  including historical experience in similar locations  changes in merchandising  promotional or operating strategy that may affect the profitability of a particular location  knowledge of the market area and in some cases  expected sale proceeds or sublease income  and independent appraisals 
in addition  the analysis assumes that new store locations typically take three years to achieve their full profit potential 
various uncertainties  including but not limited to changes in consumer preferences  increased competition or a general deterioration in economic conditions could adversely impact the expected cash flows to be generated by an asset or group of assets 
in fiscal  the company recorded asset impairment charges in connection with store closures  and such charges are included in store closure costs in the accompanying consolidated income statement 
in addition  asset impairment charges were recorded for certain underperforming store locations which continue to be operated 
if actual performance or fair value estimates for other locations are less favorable than management s projections  future asset impairment charges may be necessary 
similar procedures are used when analyzing other corporate assets for impairment 
effective the beginning of fiscal  the provisions of sfas no 
were implemented 
as a result  the company no longer amortizes previously recorded goodwill 
the company performs an annual impairment review of goodwill as required by the statement  unless more frequent reviews are warranted by specific events or circumstances 
there can be no assurance that at the time these reviews are completed that material impairment charges will not be recorded 
income taxes the carrying value of the company s net deferred tax assets assumes that the company will be able to generate sufficient future taxable income to realize the value of these assets 
in determining the appropriate valuation allowance  management considers all available evidence for certain tax credit  net operating loss and capital loss carryforwards that would likely expire prior to their utilization 
management believes it is more likely than not that the company will generate sufficient future taxable income in the appropriate carryforward periods to realize the benefit of its remaining net deferred tax assets 
however  if the available evidence were to change in the future  an adjustment to the valuation allowance may be required  resulting in additional income tax expense 
accounting for the securitization and sale of receivables prior to the sale of its customer credit card accounts and accounts receivable to household on january   the company conveyed all of the receivables generated under its private label customer credit cards to a wholly owned subsidiary  gcrc  on a daily basis 
those receivables that met certain eligibility requirements of the program were simultaneously conveyed to gcc trust to be used as collateral for securities issued to investors 
gcc trust was a qualified special purpose entity and was not consolidated in the company s financial statements 
the transfers of such receivables were accounted for as sales for financial reporting purposes pursuant to sfas no 
 accounting for the transfers and servicing of financial assets and extinguishments of liabilities  and as such  the transferred receivables were removed from the company s balance sheet at the time of the transfer 
the company retained a beneficial ownership interest in certain of the receivables transferred under the program and also retained an uncertificated ownership interest in the retained interest to future interest income interest only strip and other receivables that did not meet certain eligibility requirements of the program 
the retained interests and the interest only strips were carried at their estimated fair values  which were estimated based upon the present value of the expected future cash flows  calculated using management s best estimates of key assumptions about anticipated credit losses  account prepayment speeds  discount rates and other factors necessary to derive an estimate of fair values 
the gain or loss on the sale of the receivables was calculated by comparing the carrying amount of the financial assets involved in the transfer to their relative fair values at the date of transfer 
the certificated portion of the retained interests were considered readily marketable and were classified as available for sale and carried at their estimated fair values in accordance with sfas no

the company operated department stores and specialty stores as of the end of fiscal as compared to department stores and specialty stores as of the end of fiscal as described more fully in note to the accompanying financial statements  during fiscal the company announced the closure of eight stores 
two such stores were closed in each of june  january and february  and one store was closed in each of march and april six stores were closed in june and july  with one of those stores subsequently reopened in september the company closed one additional store at the end of january  resulting in a total of six stores closed in fiscal net credit revenues net credit revenues related to the company s credit card receivables portfolio decreased by approximately million or  to million in fiscal as compared to million in fiscal as a percent of net sales  net credit revenues were of net sales in both fiscal and fiscal net credit revenues consist of the following in thousands of dollars service charge revenues   interest expense on securitized receivables   charge offs on receivables sold and provision for credit losses on receivables ineligible for sale   gain on sale of receivables service charge revenues and interest expense on securitized receivables in fiscal were essentially equal to fiscal the company s credit sales as a percent of total sales increased to in fiscal as compared to in fiscal charge offs on receivables sold and the provision for credit losses on receivables ineligible for sale increased by million  or  in fiscal as compared to fiscal as a percentage of net sales  such losses increased to in fiscal as compared to in fiscal these increases reflect higher bankruptcies and higher unemployment rates caused by the economic downturn in certain of the company s market areas 
the company expects a substantial decrease in net credit revenues in fiscal as a result of the receivables sale to household 
the company also expects a reduction in selling  general and administrative expenses as a result of outsourcing the credit card servicing to household 
in addition  the company anticipates a reduction in interest expense arising from reduced line of credit borrowings resulting from the application of the proceeds from the household transaction 
the company believes the net credit revenues the company receives under the cca will equal or exceed the net revenues from its former in house credit card operations  net of operating expenses and interest expense 
net leased department revenues net rental income generated by the company s various leased departments decreased by approximately million  or  to million in fiscal as compared to million in fiscal this decrease is primarily due to the august termination of the shoe department leases in of the company s pacific northwest and alaska locations  which were operated by an independent lessee 
the company subsequently re opened company operated shoe departments in of those stores 
pursuant to staff accounting bulletin sab no 
 sales generated in those departments after the termination of the leases are included in total sales as opposed to net leased department revenues for financial reporting purposes 
leased department sales are presented net of the related costs for financial reporting purposes 
sales generated in the company s leased departments  consisting primarily of fine jewelry departments  the shoe departments in pacific northwest and alaska locations prior to the termination of the lease in august and beauty salons  totaled million in fiscal as compared to million in fiscal cost of sales cost of sales  which includes costs associated with the buying  handling and distribution of merchandise  decreased by approximately million to million in fiscal as compared to million in fiscal  a decrease of 
the dollar decrease is primarily due to the decrease in sales volume 
the company s gross margin percentage increased to in fiscal as compared to in fiscal the increase in the gross margin percentage was primarily due to lower markdowns as a percentage of sales as compared to the prior year 
selling  general and administrative expenses selling  general and administrative expenses decreased by approximately million  or  to million in fiscal as compared to million in fiscal as a percentage of net sales  selling  general and administrative expenses increased to in fiscal as compared to in fiscal the dollar decrease is primarily attributable to realized benefits from cost reduction efforts and store closures  partially offset by increases in health care  workers compensation and property and casualty insurance costs 
lower sales volume contributed to the increase in selling  general and administrative costs as a percentage of net sales 
the company is continuing to implement programs aimed at reducing operating costs throughout all areas of the company 
although the company fully anticipates it will be successful in achieving its cost reduction initiatives  there can be no assurance that the company will be able to fully offset the impact of increases in certain of these costs in the future 
depreciation and amortization depreciation and amortization expense  which includes the amortization of intangibles leasehold interests and  in fiscal  goodwill  increased by approximately million or  to million in fiscal as compared to million in fiscal as a percent of net sales  depreciation and amortization expense increased to in fiscal as compared to in fiscal the dollar increase is primarily due to additional depreciation related to information systems placed in service during and capital expenditures for the renovation and expansion of certain existing stores 
these increases were partially offset by the discontinuance of goodwill amortization as a result of the implementation of sfas no 
effective the beginning of fiscal  the company adopted the provisions of sfas no 
as a result  goodwill is no longer amortized and instead is evaluated for impairment annually  or at any time certain indicators of impairment arise 
the amortization of goodwill totaled million in fiscal the company will continue to amortize leasehold interests over their estimated lease terms 
asset impairment charges during  the company recorded non cash asset impairment charges of million to write down long lived assets related to certain underperforming stores  primarily former lamonts locations 
these charges consisted of million of property and equipment  million of leasehold interests and million of goodwill 
the charges were determined by comparing projected net operating cash flows  including estimated proceeds from the sale of certain assets  to the carrying value of the stores long lived assets 
no such costs were recorded in store closure costs during fiscal  the company announced the closure of eight of the stores acquired from lamonts 
these stores were determined to be either underperforming or inconsistent with the company s long term operating strategy 
two of these stores were closed in each of june  january and february and one store was closed in each of march and april net costs associated with the closure of these stores totaled million in fiscal this amount consists of estimated lease termination costs  non cash asset impairment charges  severance and other incremental costs associated with the store closings totaling million less million of cash proceeds received from the sale of lease rights and fixtures and equipment 
after the eight store closures are completed  the company will continue to operate of the original stores acquired from lamonts 
during the second quarter of the company closed six of the acquired stores that also were determined to be either underperforming or inconsistent with the long term operating strategy of the company

certain of the company s remaining stores have continued to perform below expectations 
in the event the company is unable to improve the operating performance of such underperforming stores  the company may consider the sale  sublease or closure of those stores in the future 
in the past  the company has successfully improved the operating results and cash flows of underperforming stores through a variety of strategies  including revising the merchandise mix  changing store management  revising marketing strategies  renegotiating lease agreements and reducing operating costs 
however  there can be no assurance that these strategies will improve the operating results and cash flows of the remaining underperforming stores  or that the company will be able to sell  sublease or close those stores in the event their performance does not improve 
in addition  the company may incur certain costs and expenses in connection with the sale or closure of those locations that may not be fully offset by sale proceeds  sublease income or favorable lease terminations 
receivables sale costs in connection with the sale of accounts receivable to household  the company recorded receivable sale transaction costs of million including consulting  legal  and other fees  and the net non cash write off of the remaining accounts of gcrc 
these charges are partially offset by a million retained interest only strip that will be amortized over the estimated life of the underlying assets sold estimated to be approximately five months 
the interest only strip represents the portion of the initial program fees to be paid that is considered a residual interest in the assets sold 
interest expense interest expense  which includes the amortization of deferred financing costs  increased by approximately million to million in fiscal as compared to million in fiscal  an increase of 
as a percent of net sales  interest expense increased to in fiscal as compared to in fiscal these increases are primarily due to amortization of higher deferred financing costs relating to long term financings entered into in the fourth quarter of fiscal and the first three quarters of fiscal  and to an amendment fee relating to the company s revolving credit facility

the increase is also due to an increase in the volume of late charge fees collected on delinquent credit card balances as compared to the same period of the prior year 
the decrease as a percentage of net sales is primarily due to lower average outstanding balances on newly originated customer accounts in the new stores opened in fiscal such accounts continue to generate lower service charge revenues as compared to those produced by more established accounts

the dollar increase is consistent with the increase in sales volume 
the company s gross margin percentage decreased to in fiscal as compared to in fiscal the decrease in the gross margin percentage was primarily due to higher markdowns as a percentage of sales as compared to the prior year 
the increased level of markdowns was primarily attributable to the clearance of excess seasonal inventory levels in the first half of fiscal resulting from lower than expected sales in certain of the pacific northwest and alaska store locations and to inventory liquidations at the six stores which were closed 
selling  general and administrative expenses selling  general and administrative expenses increased by approximately million  or  to million in fiscal as compared to million in fiscal as a percentage of net sales  selling  general and administrative expenses increased to in fiscal as compared to in fiscal the dollar increase is primarily attributable to operating costs associated with a full year of operating the stores opened in the second half of fiscal  as compared to five months of such costs incurred in the prior year

these factors  combined with lower than expected sales volume generated by the new stores opened in fiscal  contributed to the increase in selling  general and administrative costs as a percentage of net sales 
depreciation and amortization depreciation and amortization expense  which includes the amortization of intangibles goodwill and leasehold interests  increased by approximately million  or  to million in fiscal as compared to million in fiscal as a percent of net sales  depreciation and amortization expense increased to in fiscal as compared to in fiscal the dollar increase is primarily due to additional depreciation related to assets acquired from lamonts  capital expenditures for new stores and for the renovation of existing stores  and for information systems enhancements  both to integrate the newly acquired stores into the company s existing systems and for other system enhancements 
the increase is also due to an increase in the amortization of assets acquired under capital leases and to the amortization of goodwill and leasehold interests recorded as a result of the lamonts acquisition

interest expense interest expense  which includes the amortization of deferred financing costs  increased by approximately million to million in fiscal as compared to million in fiscal  an increase of 
as a percent of net sales  interest expense decreased to in fiscal as compared to in fiscal these decreases are primarily due to lower average outstanding borrowings on the company s working capital facility  as well as a decrease in the weighted average interest rate applicable to the facility in fiscal as compared to in fiscal 
these decreases were partially offset by higher interest resulting from the completion of a million mortgage loan and approximately million of additional fixtures and equipment lease financings in the first half of fiscal see liquidity and capital resources

the company expects the availability improvement over the course of the fiscal year to range from million to million  compared to the prior year and based upon historical levels of accounts receivable 
as a result  the company believes its liquidity position after the sale is substantially improved in comparison to prior years 
in fiscal  the company generated a total of million from operations as compared to million positive cash flow from operations in fiscal the decrease is due to a significant reduction in inventory levels in fiscal to correct overstock conditions in the former lamonts stores 
despite the positive cash flows from operations  the company has nevertheless experienced significantly reduced earnings  including the million loss in  and a strained liquidity position throughout both and as described more fully below  recent efforts to improve the company s liquidity position have included the following the sale of receivables to household  ii refinancing the company s revolving credit facility  which was successfully completed on february   iii restoring trade and factor credit  iv selling  subleasing or closing underperforming stores  v completing other financing and sale transactions  and vi reducing operating costs

the ge facility contains restrictive financial and operating covenants  including the requirement to maintain a minimum twelve month trailing ebitda and the requirement to maintain a minimum accounts payable to inventory ratio 
in addition  the ge facility does not permit the repayment of the subordinated note on its scheduled maturity date of august   which has resulted in the maturity of that note automatically being extended to august  management believes the company is in compliance with all restrictive financial and operating covenants applicable to the ge facility as of february  and through the date of this report 
trade credit and transactions with affiliate the success of the company s business is highly dependent upon the adequacy of trade credit offered by key factors and vendors  the vendors ability and willingness to sell it products at favorable prices and terms  and the willingness of vendors to ship merchandise on a timely basis 
restrictions to the amount of trade credit granted by key factors and vendors can adversely impact the volume of merchandise the company is able to purchase 
any significant reduction in the volume of merchandise the company is able to purchase  or a prolonged disruption in the timing of when merchandise is received  would have a material adverse affect on the company s business  liquidity position  and results of operations 
the company began to experience a significant reduction in the level of unsecured credit offered by many of its factors and vendors in late fiscal following the finalization of the ge facility on february   the level of unsecured credit offered by vendors increased  but unsecured credit granted by key factors  which can represent over of total trade credit granted to the company  remained restricted 
management negotiated the restoration of partially secured credit lines with certain key factors by issuing standby letters of credit 
certain of those letters of credit were collateralized by the harris letter of credit  which is described below 
the issuance of those letters of credit reduced the company s borrowing availability under the ge facility 
in order to offset the majority of this availability reduction  harris  an affiliate of the company  agreed to provide a short term credit enhancement to the ge facility under the terms of the cfa entered into with the company on february  during  the cfa was amended three times to provide for extensions of the expiration date of the harris letter of credit 
under the terms of the third amendment to the cfa  the harris letter of credit was cancelled and the cfa was terminated as a result of the closing of the sale of receivables to household 
despite the increase in the amount of unsecured credit granted by the company s vendors and factors since the finalization of the ge facility in february  such amounts remained below historical levels throughout fiscal nevertheless  the company has been able to purchase an adequate level of merchandise to support its operations to date 
in addition  upon the completion of the receivables sale to household  the company s largest factor significantly increased its unsecured credit line and substantially all of the company s major unfactored suppliers increased their credit lines to historical levels 
the company has also reduced the amount of outstanding factor letters of credit and intends to negotiate further reductions and ultimately the elimination of all such letters of credit 
nonetheless  there can be no assurance the company will continue to receive an adequate level of key factor and vendor trade credit to support its operations 
any significant reductions of trade and factor support may impair the company s ability to purchase an adequate level of merchandise to support its operations 
the inability to purchase an adequate level of merchandise would have a material adverse affect on the company s business  liquidity position and results of operations 
other financings the company has continued efforts to obtain financing from external resources as a means of improving its liquidity position 
the company entered into a million three year term loan with kimco capital corp 
on march  proceeds from the kimco financing were used to repay previously existing mortgage loans on two store properties and a term loan and to pay certain fees and costs associated with the transaction 
the remaining million was used to reduce outstanding borrowings under the ge facility 
on february   the company also completed a million  seven year term loan financing of its corporate aircraft 
on may   the company completed the financing of its ownership interest in the partnership that owns the company s corporate headquarters building 
proceeds from this transaction  totaling million  were used to reduce outstanding borrowings under the ge facility 
the related note payable bears interest at a variable rate of prime plus per annum  which is payable monthly 
the million principal portion of the note payable is due in full upon maturity on may  the company may consider various other sources of liquidity in the future  including but not limited to the issuance of additional securities that might have a dilutive effect on existing shareholders or incurring additional indebtedness which would increase the company s leverage 
uses of liquidity the company s primary uses of liquidity are for working capital  debt service requirements and capital expenditures 
capital expenditures in fiscal  totaling million  were primarily related to information system enhancements and the renovation  refixturing  and expansion of certain existing locations 
the company presently has no commitments to open or remodel any stores in fiscal as of february   the company had issued a total of million of standby letters of credit and documentary letters of credit totaling million 
the standby letters of credit were issued to secure credit lines with key factors and to provide collateral for a workers compensation insurance policy 
the factor letters of credit currently expire at the end of june  management believes that the likelihood of any draws under the standby letters of credit is remote 
documentary letters of credit are issued in the ordinary course of business to facilitate the purchase of merchandise from overseas suppliers 
the supplier draws against the documentary letter of credit upon delivery of the merchandise

cash generated by operations  together with liquidity provided by the ge facility  the cca and other financial resources  including without limitation the factors described below  are expected to adequately finance the company s planned cash requirements for fiscal however  the company s actual results may differ from the expectations set forth in the preceding sentence 
the company s liquidity and capital resources may be affected by a number of factors and risks many of which are beyond the control of the company  including but not limited to the availability of adequate borrowing capacity and the ability to maintain compliance with restrictive debt covenants contained in the company s senior revolving credit facility and its other debt obligations  adequate cash flows generated by operations  and the adequacy of factor and trade credit 
subject to the previously described risks and uncertainties relative to the company s sources of liquidity  management currently believes that the described sources of liquidity will be adequate to meet the company s working capital  capital expenditure and debt service requirements for fiscal because the company is already highly leveraged  the ability to obtain additional or alternative sources of financing in the future for working capital  capital expenditures  new store openings  acquisitions and other general corporate purposes is limited 
if the estimates or assumptions relative to any one of these sources of liquidity are not realized  or if those sources of liquidity become significantly reduced  the company s liquidity position  financial condition and results of operations may be materially adversely affected 
recently issued accounting standards in august  the financial accounting standards board the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for asset retirement obligations  which addresses financial accounting and reporting for obligations associated with the retirement of tangible long lived assets and the associated asset retirement costs 
this statement requires that the fair value of a liability for an asset retirement obligation be recognized in the period in which it is incurred if a reasonable estimate of fair value can be made 
the associated asset retirement costs are capitalized as part of the carrying amount of the long lived asset 
the company will adopt sfas no 
effective the beginning of fiscal and does not currently expect that its adoption will have a significant effect on the company s financial position or its results of operations 
in april  the fasb issued sfas no 
 rescission of fasb statements no 
  and  amendment of fasb statement no 
 and technical corrections 
sfas no 
 among other things  eliminates the prior requirement that all gains and losses from the early extinguishment of debt were to be classified as an extraordinary item 
upon adoption of sfas no 
 gains and losses from the early extinguishment of debt are now classified as an extraordinary item only if they meet the unusual and infrequent criteria contained in accounting principles board opinion apbo no 
in addition  upon adoption of sfas no 
 all gains and losses from the early extinguishment of debt that had previously been classified as an extraordinary item are to be reassessed to determine if they would have met the unusual and infrequent criteria of apbo no 
any such gain or loss that would not have met the apbo no 
criteria is retroactively reclassified and reported as a component of income before extraordinary item 
the company has determined that its previously recognized loss from the early extinguishment of debt that occurred in fiscal would not have met the apbo no 
criteria for classification as an extraordinary item  and accordingly such previously reported loss from the early extinguishment of debt has been retroactively reclassified and is now reported as a component of income before income taxes 
the company has also determined that the fiscal loss from the early extinguishment of debt does not meet the apbo no 
criteria for extraordinary item classification  and accordingly such loss is reported as a component of income before income taxes

 accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities  which addresses accounting for restructuring and similar costs 
sfas no 
supersedes previous accounting guidance  principally emerging issues task force issue no 
sfas no 
requires that the liability for costs associated with an exit or disposal activity be recognized when the liability is incurred 
under issue  a liability for an exit cost was recognized at the date of the company s commitment to an exit plan 
sfas no 
also establishes that the liability should initially be measured and recorded at fair value 
accordingly  sfas no 
may affect the timing of recognizing future restructuring costs as well as the amounts recognized 
the company will adopt the provisions of sfas no 
for restructuring activities initiated after december  in november  the emerging issues task force eitf of the fasb issued eitf issue no 
 accounting by a reseller for cash consideration received from a vendor 
the company will adopt the provisions of eitf effective with the beginning of fiscal the company is in the process of evaluating the potential impact of its adoption on the company s financial position and results of operations 
inflation although inflation has not been a material factor in the company s operations during the past several years  the company has experienced increases in the costs of certain merchandise  salaries  employee benefits and other general and administrative costs  including utilities  health care and workers compensation and property and casualty insurance costs 
the company is generally able to offset these increases by adjusting its selling prices or by modifying its operations 
the company s ability to adjust selling prices is limited by competitive pressures in its market areas 
the company values its merchandise inventories at the lower of lifo cost or market using the rim of accounting 
under the lifo method  which is determined by using the department store price indices published by the bureau of labor statistics  the cost of products sold reported in the financial statements approximates current costs and thus reduces the impact of inflation due to increasing costs on reported income 
the valuation of the company s merchandise inventories under the lifo method is currently equal to that as determined by the first in  first out fifo method of accounting 
seasonality the company s business  like that of most retailers  is subject to seasonal influences  with the major portion of net sales  gross profit and operating income realized during the christmas selling months of november and december of each year  and  to a lesser extent  during the easter and back to school selling seasons 
the company s results may also vary from quarter to quarter as a result of  among other things  the timing and level of the company s sales promotions  weather  fashion trends and the overall health of the economy  both nationally and in the company s market areas 
working capital requirements also fluctuate during the year  increasing substantially prior to the christmas selling season when the company must carry significantly higher inventory levels 
the following table sets forth unaudited quarterly results of operations for fiscal and in thousands  except per share data 
quarter ended may august november february net sales     gross profit     loss before income taxes     net loss     net loss per common share basic and diluted weighted average number of common shares outstanding basic     diluted     quarter ended may august november february net sales     gross profit     income loss before income taxes     net income loss     net income loss per common share basic and diluted loss before income taxes in the period ended february  includes pre tax charges of million 
these charges included million of primarily non cash charges related to the write down of assets and to post closure lease obligations in connection with the closure of six stores  million non cash charges related to impairment of long lived assets in certain of the company s underperforming locations  million of charges related to the sale of receivables  and million of charges related to the early extinguishment of accounts receivable securitization debt 
income before income taxes in the three month period ended february  includes a charge of million related to the early extinguishment of the company s prior revolving credit facility 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company is exposed to market risks in the normal course of business due to changes in interest rates on short term borrowings under its senior revolving credit facility 
as of february   the company also had one term loan bearing variable interest rates 
the company does not engage in financial transactions for speculative or trading purposes  nor does the company purchase or hold any derivative financial instruments 
as of february   borrowings subject to a variable interest rate  represented of the company s total outstanding borrowings 
the interest payable on the company s senior revolving credit facility is based on variable interest rates and is therefore affected by changes in market interest rates 
an increase of basis points on existing floating rate borrowings a change from the company s weighted average interest rate as of february  would reduce the company s pre tax net income and cash flow by approximately million 
this basis point increase in interest rates would not materially affect the fair value of the company s fixed rate financial instruments
