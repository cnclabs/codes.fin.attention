item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations you should read the following analysis of our consolidated financial condition and results of operations in conjunction with the forward looking statements included on the table of contents  selected financial data and the consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form k 
the consolidated financial statements of prudential insurance for periods prior to the demutualization in december became the historical consolidated financial statements of prudential financial 
overview demutualization and related transactions on the date of demutualization  prudential insurance converted from a mutual life insurance company owned by its policyholders to a stock life insurance company and became an indirect  wholly owned subsidiary of prudential financial 
on that date  eligible policyholders  as defined in the plan of reorganization  received shares of prudential financial s common stock or the right to receive cash or policy credits  which are increases in policy values or increases in other policy benefits  upon the extinguishment of all membership interests in prudential insurance 
on the date of demutualization  prudential financial completed an initial public offering of million shares of its common stock at an initial public offering price of per share  including million shares issued as a result of the exercise of the over allotment option granted to underwriters in the initial public offering 
also on the date of demutualization  prudential financial completed the sale  through a private placement  of million shares of class b stock  a separate class of common stock  at a price of per share 
the common stock reflects the performance of the financial services businesses and the class b stock reflects the performance of the closed block business  discussed below 
collectively  the financial services businesses and the closed block business are referred to as the businesses 
in addition  on the date of demutualization  prudential financial issued million equity security units for gross proceeds of million  including as a component thereof redeemable capital securities of prudential financial capital trust i  a statutory business trust that is consolidated in our financial statements 
furthermore  prudential holdings  llc phllc  a wholly owned subsidiary of prudential financial that owns the capital stock of prudential insurance  issued billion in senior secured notes the ihc debt  a portion of which were insured by a bond insurer 
concurrent with the demutualization  various subsidiaries of prudential insurance were reorganized or destacked becoming direct or indirect subsidiaries of prudential financial 
to effect the destacking  prudential insurance distributed to prudential financial  directly or indirectly  the following subsidiaries  together with certain related assets and liabilities our property and casualty insurance companies  our principal securities brokerage companies  our international insurance companies  our principal asset management operations  and our international securities and investments  domestic banking  and residential real estate brokerage franchise and relocation services operations 
the plan of reorganization required us to establish and operate a regulatory mechanism known as the closed block 
the closed block is designed generally to provide for the reasonable expectations for future policy dividends after demutualization of holders of policies included in the closed block by allocating assets that will be used for payment of benefits  including policyholder dividends  on these policies 
see note to the consolidated financial statements and financial services businesses and closed block business for more information on the closed block 

table of contents financial services businesses and closed block business reorganization in august  we implemented organizational changes within the financial services businesses 
the discussion below presents the results of our divisions and segments on a basis consistent with the new organization structure 
the reclassifications associated with the realignment of our divisions and segments had no impact on total adjusted operating income defined below under consolidated results of operations or net income of the financial services businesses or closed block business 
financial services businesses we refer to the businesses in our three operating divisions and our corporate and other operations  collectively  as our financial services businesses 
the insurance division consists of our individual life and annuities  group insurance and property and casualty insurance segments 
the investment division consists of our investment management  financial advisory  retirement and other asset management segments 
the international insurance and investments division consists of our international insurance and international investments segments 
we also have corporate and other operations  which includes our real estate and relocation services business  as well as corporate items and initiatives that are not allocated to business segments 
corporate and other operations also include businesses that we have divested or placed in wind down status 
we attribute financing costs to each segment based on the amount of financing used by each segment 
the net investment income of each segment includes earnings on the amount of equity that management believes is necessary to support the risks of that segment 
we seek growth internally and through acquisition  joint ventures or other forms of business combination or investment 
our principal acquisition focus is in our current business lines  both domestic and international 
closed block business for periods prior to demutualization  the results of the closed block business are those of our former traditional participating products segment 
upon the establishment of the closed block business  we transferred billion of net assets previously associated with the former traditional participating products segment to the financial services businesses 
this capital was initially allocated to our corporate and other operations 
as a result  income from continuing operations before income taxes of the closed block business for the year ended december  does not include returns on these net assets  which were historically included in income from continuing operations of the former traditional participating products segment 
in connection with the demutualization  we ceased offering domestic participating products 
the liabilities for our individual in force participating products were segregated  together with assets which will be used exclusively for the payment of benefits and policyholder dividends  expenses and taxes with respect to these products  in a regulatory mechanism referred to as the closed block 
we selected the amount and type of closed block assets and closed block liabilities included in the closed block so that the closed block assets initially had a lower book value than the closed block liabilities 
we expect that the closed block assets will generate sufficient cash flow  together with anticipated revenues from the closed block policies  over the life of the closed block to fund payments of all expenses  taxes and policyholder benefits to be paid to  and the reasonable dividend expectations of  policyholders of the closed block policies 
we also segregated for accounting purposes the assets that we need to hold outside the closed block to meet capital requirements related to the policies included within the closed block 
no policies sold after demutualization will be added to the closed block  and its in force business is expected to ultimately decline as we pay policyholder benefits in full 
we also expect the proportion of our business represented by the closed block to decline as we grow other businesses 
a minor portion of our former traditional participating products segment consisted of other traditional insurance products that were not included in the closed block 

table of contents the closed block business consists principally of the closed block  assets held outside the closed block that prudential insurance needs to hold to meet capital requirements related to the closed block policies  invested assets held outside the closed block that represent the difference between the closed block assets and closed block liabilities and the interest maintenance reserve  deferred policy acquisition costs related to closed block policies  the principal amount of the ihc debt and related hedging activities and certain other related assets and liabilities 
we allocated the net proceeds from the issuance of the class b stock and ihc debt  except for million used to purchase a guaranteed investment contract to fund a portion of the bond insurance cost associated with that debt  to the financial services businesses 
however  we expect that the ihc debt will be serviced by the net cash flows of the closed block business over time  and we report results of the closed block business  including interest expenses associated with the ihc debt 
revenues and expenses we earn our revenues principally from insurance premiums  mortality  expense  and asset management fees from insurance and investment products  commissions and other revenues from securities brokerage transactions  and investment of general account and other funds 
we earn premiums primarily from the sale of individual life insurance  group life and disability insurance and automobile and homeowners insurance 
we earn mortality  expense  and asset management fees from the sale and servicing of separate account products including variable life insurance and variable annuities 
we also earn asset management and administrative fees from the sale  servicing and management of mutual funds  retirement products and other asset management products and services 
our operating expenses principally consist of insurance benefits provided  general business expenses  dividends to policyholders  commissions and other costs of selling and servicing the various products we sell and interest credited on general account liabilities 
profitability our profitability depends principally on our ability to price and manage risk on insurance products  our ability to attract and retain customer assets  and our ability to manage expenses 
specific drivers of our profitability include our ability to manufacture and distribute products and services and to introduce new products gaining market acceptance on a timely basis  our ability to price our insurance products at a level that enables us to earn a margin over the cost of providing benefits and the expense of acquiring customers and administering those products  our mortality and morbidity experience on individual and group life insurance  annuity and group disability insurance products  our persistency experience  which affects our ability to recover the cost of acquiring new business over the lives of the contracts  our management of our exposure to catastrophic and other losses on our property and casualty insurance products  our cost of administering insurance contracts and providing asset management products and services  our returns on invested assets  net of the amounts we credit to policyholders accounts  our ability to earn commissions and fees from the sale and servicing of mutual funds  annuities  defined contribution and other investment products at a level that enables us to earn a margin over the expense of providing such services  the amount of our assets under management and changes in their fair value  which affect the amount of asset management fees we receive  our ability to generate commissions and fees from securities activities at a level that enables us to earn a margin over the expenses of providing such services  and our ability to generate favorable investment results through asset liability management and strategic and tactical asset allocation 

table of contents in addition  factors such as regulation  competition  interest rates  taxes  foreign exchange rates  securities market conditions and general economic conditions affect our profitability 
in some of our product lines  particularly those in the closed block business  we share experience on mortality  morbidity  persistency and investment results with our customers  which can offset the impact of these factors on our profitability from those products 
historically  the participating products included in the closed block have yielded lower returns on capital invested than many of our other businesses 
with the completion of the demutualization  we expect that the proportion of the traditional participating products in our in force business will gradually diminish as these older policies age  and we grow other businesses 
however  the relatively lower returns to us on this existing block of business will continue to affect our consolidated results of operations for many years 
our common stock reflects the performance of our financial services businesses  but there can be no assurance that the market value of the common stock will reflect solely the performance of these businesses 
the financial services businesses include the capital previously included in the former traditional participating products segment in excess of the amount necessary to support the closed block business 
the financial services businesses also includes other traditional insurance products previously included in the former traditional participating products segment but which are not included in the closed block 
the class b stock reflects the financial performance of our closed block business 
application of critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements in conformity with us generally accepted accounting principles gaap requires the application of accounting policies that often involve a significant degree of judgment 
management  on an ongoing basis  reviews estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of financial statements 
if management determines that modifications in assumptions and estimates are appropriate given current facts and circumstances  results of operations and financial position as reported in the consolidated financial statements may change significantly 
the following sections discuss the accounting policies applied in preparing our financial statements that management believes are most dependent on the application of estimates and assumptions 
valuation of investments a large portion of our investments is reflected at fair value in the statements of financial position based on quoted market prices or estimates from independent pricing services 
however  when such information is not available  for example  with respect to private placement fixed maturity securities  which comprise of our investments as of december   fair value is estimated  typically by using a discounted cash flow model  which considers current market credit spreads for publicly traded issues with similar terms by companies of comparable credit quality 
consequently  changes in estimated future cash flows or in our assessment of the issuer s credit quality will result in changes in fair value estimates 
for fixed maturities and equity securities classified as available for sale  the impact of such changes is recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income loss  a separate component of equity 
however  the carrying value of these securities is reduced  with a corresponding charge to earnings  when a decline in value is considered to be other than temporary 
factors we consider in determining whether a decline in value is other than temporary include whether the decline is substantial  the length of time the fair value has been less than cost  generally six months  and the financial condition and near term prospects of the issuer 
this corresponding charge is referred to as an impairment and is reflected in realized investment gains losses  net in the statements of operations 
the level of impairment losses can be expected to increase when economic conditions worsen and decrease when economic conditions improve 
commercial loans  which comprise of our investments as of december   are carried at unpaid principal balances  net of unamortized discounts and an allowance for losses 
this allowance includes a loan specific portion as well as a portfolio reserve for incurred but not specifically identified losses 
the loan specific portion is based on management s judgment as to ultimate collectibility of loan principal 
the portfolio reserve is based on a number of factors  such as historical experience and portfolio diversification 
similar to impairment losses discussed above  the allowance for losses can be expected to increase when economic conditions worsen and decrease when economic conditions improve 

table of contents see business general account investments for a discussion of our investment portfolio and related results  including policies and disclosures regarding other than temporary declines in investment value 
policyholder liabilities and deferred policy acquisition costs the liability for future policy benefits is the largest liability included in our statements of financial position  of total liabilities as of december  changes in this liability are generally reflected in the policyholders benefits caption in our statements of operations 
this liability is primarily comprised of the present value of estimated future payments to holders of life insurance and annuity products where the timing and amount of payment depends on policyholder mortality  surrender or retirement experience 
for traditional participating life insurance products of our closed block business  the mortality and interest rate assumptions we apply are those used to calculate the policies guaranteed cash surrender values 
for life insurance and annuity products of our financial services businesses  expected mortality is generally based on the company s historical experience or standard industry tables 
interest rate assumptions are based on factors such as market conditions and expected investment returns 
although mortality and interest rate assumptions are locked in upon the issuance of new insurance or annuity business with fixed and guaranteed terms  significant changes in experience or assumptions may require us to provide for expected future losses on a product by establishing premium deficiency reserves 
for example  in we restructured the portfolio that supports the structured settlement products within our retirement segment to reduce the emphasis on equity investments  which in turn lowered our expected future investment returns 
as a result  we recorded a charge to establish a premium deficiency reserve for these products 
our liability for unpaid claims and claim adjustment expenses  which is of total liabilities as of december   includes estimates of claims that we believe have been incurred  but have not yet been reported ibnr as of the balance sheet date  primarily attributable to our property and casualty insurance segment and our group insurance segment 
consistent with industry accounting practice  we do not establish loss reserves until a loss  including a loss from catastrophe  has occurred 
these ibnr estimates  and estimates of the amounts of loss we will ultimately incur on reported claims  which are based in part on our historical experience  are regularly adjusted to reflect actual claims experience 
when actual experience differs from our previous estimate  the resulting difference will be included in our reported results for the period of the change in estimate in the policyholders benefits caption in our statements of operations 
on an ongoing basis  trends in actual experience are a significant factor in the determination of claim reserve levels 
in recent years  actual claims experience with respect to our automobile insurance business within our property and casualty insurance segment has been more favorable than the assumptions we used in originally establishing the reserves for these claims  which resulted in a benefit to earnings for these years due to reserve releases 
actual claims experience can also be less favorable than that assumed in establishing reserves  which can require a charge to earnings to increase reserves 
for most life insurance and annuity products that we sell  we defer costs that vary with and are related primarily to the production of new business to the extent these costs are deemed recoverable from future profits  and we record these costs as an asset known as deferred policy acquisition costs or dac in the statements of financial position 
we amortize this dac asset over the expected lives of the contracts  based on the level and timing of either estimated profits or premiums  depending on the type of contract 
for products with amortization based on estimated profits  the amortization rate is periodically updated to reflect current period experience or changes in assumptions that affect future profitability  such as lapse rates  investment returns  mortality experience  expense margins and surrender charges 
however  for products with amortization based on future premiums  the amortization rate is locked in when the product is sold 
for example  expected profitability is a significant estimate in evaluating deferred acquisition costs related to annuity products 
expected profitability considers  among other assumptions  our best estimate of future asset returns to estimate the future fees we expect to earn  the costs associated with minimum death benefit guarantees we expect to incur and other profitability factors 
for the average remaining life of our variable annuity contracts in force as of december   our evaluation of deferred policy acquisition costs is based on a annual blended rate of return that reflects an assumed rate of return of for equity type assets 
continuation of current market conditions or further deterioration in market conditions may result in increases in the amortization of deferred policy acquisition costs  while a significant improvement in market conditions may result in a 
table of contents decrease in the amortization of deferred policy acquisition costs 
these changes in dac balances are included as a component of general and administrative expenses in our statements of operations 
see insurance division individual life and annuities for discussion of the impact of dac amortization on our results of our annuities businesses  including increased amortization recorded in and reflecting lower estimates of future gross profits as well as a discussion of the proposed aicpa statement of position  accounting and reporting by insurance enterprises for certain nontraditional long duration contracts and for separate accounts 
reserves for contingencies a contingency is an existing condition that involves a degree of uncertainty that will ultimately be resolved upon the occurrence of future events 
under gaap  reserves for contingencies are required to be established when the future event is probable and its impact can be reasonably estimated 
an example is the establishment of a reserve for losses in connection with an unresolved legal matter 
the initial reserve reflects management s best estimate of the probable cost of ultimate resolution of the matter and is revised accordingly as facts and circumstances change and  ultimately  when the matter is brought to closure 
other significant estimates in addition to the items discussed above  the application of gaap requires management to make other estimates and assumptions 
for example  accounting for pension and other postretirement and postemployment benefits requires estimates of future returns on plan assets  expected increases in compensation levels and trends in health care costs 
see corporate and other operations for a discussion of our pension assumptions and related returns 
another example is the recognition of deferred tax assets  which depends on management s assumption that future earnings will be sufficient to realize the deferred benefit 
this is discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements 
accounting policies adopted accounting for stock options employee stock options issued during and are accounted for using the intrinsic value method prescribed by accounting principles board opinion apb no 
 accounting to stock issued to employees  and related interpretations  an allowable alternative method under statement of financial accounting standards sfas no  accounting for stock based compensation 
under apb no 
 we did not recognize any stock based compensation expense for employee stock options as all employee stock options had an exercise price equal to the market value of our common stock at the date of grant 
after consideration  we have concluded that our employee stock options represent compensation costs and including such costs in our results of operations is a preferable method of accounting 
effective january   we changed our accounting for employee stock options to adopt the fair value recognition provisions of sfas no 
 as amended  prospectively for all new awards granted to employees on or after january  under these provisions  the fair value of all employee stock options awarded on or after january   will be included in the determination of net income  but not options awarded prior thereto 
accordingly  the amount we will include in the determination of net income will be less than that which would have been recognized if the fair value method had been applied to all awards since inception of the employee stock option plan 
the fair value of employee stock options is determined using a black scholes option pricing model that utilizes the following assumptions dividend yield  expected volatility  risk free interest rate  and expected life of the option 
if we had accounted for all employee stock options under the fair value based accounting method  net income for the year ended december  would have been reduced by million and basic and diluted earnings per share for common stock would have reduced by 
for the period december  through december   net income and basic and diluted earnings per share of common stock would have been reduced by million and  respectively 

table of contents discontinued operations during  we announced the discontinuance of our web based business for the workplace distribution of voluntary benefits  our european retail transaction oriented stockbrokerage and related activities and our tokyo based retail brokerage business 
the discontinuance of these businesses was accounted for under sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
under sfas no 
 in the period in which such components qualify for discontinued operations treatment  the results of operations for each component for all periods presented are reclassified to income loss from discontinued operations  a separate line in the statements of operations 
in addition  where necessary  we reduced the carrying value of each component to estimated fair value through a charge to earnings that is also included in income loss from discontinued operations 
goodwill as of december   we completed our annual impairment testing of goodwill in accordance with sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
impairment testing requires us to compare the fair value of each reporting unit to its carrying amount  including goodwill  and record an impairment charge if the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its estimated fair value 
as a result of the december  annual impairment test  we determined that the goodwill related to our property and casualty insurance segment was impaired 
accordingly  we recorded an impairment charge of million representing the entire carrying amount of the segment s goodwill 
the property and casualty insurance segment has been determined to be a reporting unit for goodwill impairment testing 
the fair value of the segment was determined based on independent third party assessments 
we initially adopted sfas no 
as of january  accordingly  results for the years ended december  and include goodwill amortization of million and million  respectively  while no goodwill amortization was recorded for recently issued accounting pronouncements see note to the consolidated financial statements for a discussion of recently issued accounting pronouncements 
the financial accounting standards board fasb is currently discussing the accounting related to certain modified coinsurance modco and funds withheld reinsurance agreements 
more specifically  the discussions relate to whether modco and funds withheld reinsurance agreements that provide for a total return on a pool of fixed income securities contain embedded derivatives that would require bifurcation under sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
the fasb plans to address this issue by combining it with a portion of the tentative guidance in sfas no 
implementation issue no 
b  embedded derivatives bifurcation of embedded credit 
if embedded derivative accounting for certain modco and funds withheld reinsurance agreements is eventually required under implementation issue no 
b  we intend to apply the guidance prospectively  for all existing contracts and future transactions  in the quarter following final resolution of the issue 
based upon our current level of modco and funds withheld reinsurance  we do not believe application of implementation issue no 
b  as we currently understand it  would have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations 
consolidated results of operations in managing our business  we analyze operating performance separately for our financial services businesses and our closed block business 
for the financial services businesses  we analyze our operating performance using a non gaap measure we call adjusted operating income 
results of the closed block business for all periods are evaluated and presented only in accordance with gaap 
we calculate adjusted operating income for the financial services businesses by adjusting our income from continuing operations before income taxes to exclude the following items realized investment gains  net of losses and related charges and adjustments  
table of contents sales practices remedies and costs  the contribution to income loss of divested businesses that we sold or exited that did not qualify for discontinued operations accounting treatment under gaap  and demutualization costs and expenses 
wind down businesses that we have not divested remain in adjusted operating income 
the excluded items are important to an understanding of our overall results of operations 
you should not view adjusted operating income as a substitute for net income determined in accordance with gaap  and you should note that our definition of adjusted operating income may differ from that used by other companies 
however  we believe that the presentation of adjusted operating income as we measure it for management purposes enhances the understanding of our results of operations by highlighting the results from ongoing operations and the underlying profitability of our businesses 
we exclude realized investment gains  net of losses including impairments and sales of credit impaired securities and related charges and adjustments 
the timing of impairments and losses from sales of credit impaired securities is largely dependent on market credit cycles and can vary considerably across periods 
in addition  the timing of other sales that would result in gains or losses is subject to our discretion 
including the fluctuating effects of these transactions could distort trends in the underlying profitability of our businesses 
we exclude sales practices remedies and costs relating to the settlement of individual life insurance sales practices issues for the period from through because they relate to a substantial and identifiable non recurring event 
we exclude contribution to income loss of businesses we divested because  as a result of our decision to dispose of these businesses  these results are not relevant to the profitability of our ongoing operations and could distort the trends associated with our ongoing operations 
we also exclude demutualization costs and expenses because they are directly related to our demutualization and could distort the trends associated with our business operations 
the tables below summarize certain financial data  including year over year variances  for the financial services businesses on both a gaap and adjusted operating income basis  as well as the results of the closed block business on a gaap basis

realized investment gains realized investment gains  net of losses  primarily include gains and losses resulting from sales and impairments of fixed income and equity investments  prepayment premiums we receive on private bond issues  and gains and losses in connection with derivative contracts that do not qualify for hedge accounting treatment 
we perform impairment reviews on an ongoing basis 
the level of impairments generally reflects economic conditions  and is expected to increase when economic conditions worsen and to decrease when economic conditions improve 
we may realize additional credit related losses through sales of investments pursuant to our credit risk and portfolio management objectives 
we require most issuers of private fixed maturity securities to pay us make whole yield maintenance payments when they prepay the securities 
the prepayments are driven by factors specific to the activities of our borrowers as much as by the interest rate environment 
we use derivative contracts to hedge the risk that changes in interest rates or foreign currency exchange rates will affect the market value of certain investments 
we also use derivative contracts to mitigate the risk that 
table of contents unfavorable changes in currency exchange rates will reduce us dollar equivalent earnings generated by certain of our non us businesses 
the vast majority of these derivative contracts do not qualify for hedge accounting  and consequently we recognize the changes in fair value of such contracts from period to period in current earnings  although we do not necessarily account for the hedged assets or liabilities the same way 
accordingly  realized investment gains and losses from our hedging activities contribute significantly to fluctuations in net income 
the comparisons below discuss realized investment gains  net of losses and related charges and adjustments 
related charges  which pertain to the financial services businesses and not to the closed block business  pertain to policyholder dividends  deferred policy acquisition costs and reserves for future policy benefits 
a percentage of net realized investment gains on specified gibraltar life assets is required to be paid as dividends to gibraltar life policyholders 
see results of operations for financial services businesses by division and closed block business below 
we amortize deferred policy acquisition costs for interest sensitive products based on estimated gross profits  which include net realized investment gains on the underlying invested assets  and the related charge for amortization of deferred policy acquisition costs represents the amortization related to net realized investment gains 
we adjust the reserves for some of our policies when cash flows related to these policies are affected by net realized investment gains  and the related charge for reserves for future policy benefits represents that adjustment 
the changes in these related charges from one period to another may be disproportionate to the changes in realized investment gains  net of losses  evaluated over several periods 
a portion of realized gains  pertaining to certain derivative results  are included in adjusted operating income 
pursuant to a currency hedging program  we execute forward sale contracts in the hedged currencies in exchange for us dollars at a specified exchange rate 
the maturities of these contracts correspond with future periods in which non us earnings are expected to be generated 
these contracts do not qualify for hedge accounting under gaap 
all resulting profits or losses from such contracts  including mark to market adjustments of open contracts  are included in realized investment gains losses  net 
when the contracts are terminated in the same period that the expected earnings emerge  the resulting positive or negative cash flow is included in adjusted operating income 
in addition  we utilize interest and currency swaps to manage interest and currency exchange rate exposures arising from mismatches between assets and liabilities  including duration mismatches 
for the swap contracts that do not qualify for hedge accounting treatment  mark to market adjustments of open contracts as well as periodic settlements are included in realized investment gains losses  net 
periodic settlements pertaining to such contracts are included in adjusted operating income

adjusted operating income to annual comparison 
adjusted operating income increased million in from the increase reflected a million increase from individual life insurance and a million decrease from individual annuities 
the segment s individual life insurance business reported adjusted operating income of million in  compared to million in the prior year  which included million of net losses from insurance claims arising out of the september  terrorist attacks on the us results for benefited from a decline in operating expenses  reflecting savings that we continue to realize from our field management and agency restructuring program implemented in  for which that year s expenses included million of implementation costs 
additionally  results of our individual life insurance business for benefited from increased investment income  primarily from an increase in the level of invested assets 
however  these items were partially offset by less favorable mortality experience in  as well as a million increase in amortization of deferred policy acquisition costs  primarily due to a market decline and related policy lapses associated with declines in variable life insurance account values 
the segment s individual annuity business reported a loss  on an adjusted operating income basis  of million in compared to adjusted operating income of million in results of our annuity business in included charges totaling million for additional amortization of deferred policy acquisition costs 
these charges reflect our lower estimates of future gross profits resulting from greater expected costs from minimum death benefit guarantees and lower expected fees under these contracts due to declines in asset values and decreased future asset returns 
results for included similar charges for additional amortization of deferred policy acquisition costs totaling million 
a decline in fee revenues from our variable annuity products due to a decrease in average account values was partially offset by a decrease in operating expenses resulting from our expense management efforts 
deferred acquisition costs related to annuity products are evaluated quarterly by comparing our actual profitability to our expectations 
expected profitability considers  among other assumptions  our estimate of future asset returns which determine the future fees we will earn  the costs associated with minimum death benefit guarantees we expect to incur and other profitability factors 
if actual asset returns do not differ significantly from our expectations  they do not result in a change in the rate of amortization of deferred acquisition costs 
where actual asset returns differ significantly from expectations  future asset return assumptions are evaluated using a reversion to mean approach 
under the reversion to mean approach  we consider historical returns over a period of time and project returns for a future four year period so that the investments underlying the annuities grow at a targeted return for the entire period 
we evaluate returns over a historical period beginning january  giving higher weighting to the returns experienced during the most recent two year period 
a calculated rate of return over the four future years  which we refer to as the look forward period  is determined so that this calculated rate  together with the actual rate of return for the historical period  produces the targeted return for the entire period 
if the calculated rate of return is consistent with our range of expectations in light of market conditions  we use it to project the asset growth for the next four years 
if the calculated rate of return is not supported by our current expectations  we adjust the rate of return for purposes of these computations 
for contract years after the look forward period  we project asset growth using our long term rate  currently an annual blended rate of return  which reflects an assumed rate of return of for equity type assets 
beginning in the second quarter and continuing throughout the year  we utilized a rate of return lower than the calculated return  which contributed to our additional amortization of deferred acquisition 
table of contents costs during the second and third quarters of the equity rate of return used in the immediate four year look forward period varies by product  but was under for all of our variable annuity products for our evaluation of deferred policy acquisition costs as of december  for the average remaining life of our variable annuity contracts in force as of december   our evaluation of deferred policy acquisition costs is based on a annual blended rate of return that reflects an assumed rate of return of for equity type assets 
continuation of current market conditions or additional deterioration in market conditions may result in further increases in the amortization of deferred policy acquisition costs  while a significant improvement in market conditions may result in a decrease in the amortization of deferred policy acquisition costs

policyholder benefits and related changes in reserves decreased million  from million in to million in  as the impact of claims arising from the september  terrorist attacks on the us on benefits and expenses was partially offset by less favorable mortality experience in than that of  other than the impact of those claims 
a million increase in amortization of deferred acquisition costs  primarily due to the market impact of declines in variable life insurance account values  was a partial offset to the aforementioned decreases in benefits and expenses 
the segment s individual annuity business reported benefits and expenses of million in  compared to million in  an increase of million  or 
the increase reflects an increase in amortization of deferred policy acquisition costs of million  which primarily includes charges for additional amortization of million in and million in resulting from decreases in expected future gross profits on our annuity products as discussed above 
guaranteed minimum death benefit payments increased million  from million in to million in the guaranteed minimum death benefit feature provides annuity contract holders with a guarantee that the benefit received at death will be no less than a prescribed minimum amount 
this minimum amount is based on the net deposits paid into the contract  the net deposits accumulated at a specified rate  the highest historical account value on a contract anniversary  or more typically  the greatest of these values  depending on features offered in various contracts and elected by the contract holders 
these contracts generally require payment of additional charges for guarantees other than those based on net deposits paid into the contract 
to the extent that the guaranteed minimum death benefit is higher than the current account value at the time of death  we incur a cost 
this results in increased annuity policy benefits in periods of declining financial markets and in periods of stable financial markets following a decline 
current accounting literature does not prescribe advance recognition of the expected future net costs associated with these guarantees  and accordingly  we currently do not record a liability corresponding to these projected future obligations for death benefits in excess of annuity account values 
however  we consider the expected net costs associated with these guarantees in our calculations of expected gross profits on variable annuity business  on which our periodic evaluations of unamortized deferred policy acquisition costs are based 
a proposed aicpa statement of position  accounting and reporting by insurance enterprises for certain nontraditional long duration contracts and for separate accounts the proposed sop  would require the recording of a liability for the expected net costs associated with these guarantees under certain circumstances  if adopted as proposed 
we are currently evaluating the impact of the proposed sop 
as of december   the death benefit coverage in force representing the amount that we would have to pay if all annuitants had died on that date was approximately billion 
the death benefit coverage in force represents the excess of the guaranteed benefit amount over the fair value of the underlying mutual fund investments

while there can be no assurance  we expect these actions  as well as pricing discipline in writing new business  will allow us to achieve gradual improvements in our loss ratios  although the impact has so far been limited by a highly competitive market 
the implementation of these actions resulted in a modest decline in persistency on our group life insurance business in force and  consistent with our expectations  some slowing of our sales

also impacting the result was a million charge to write off the goodwill associated with a reporting unit within this segment 
this charge was the outcome of our annual impairment test 
partially offsetting these declines were premium increases reflecting rate increases we have implemented  and lower expenses as a result of our expense reduction efforts 

table of contents as previously announced  we are exploring options related to our personal lines property and casualty insurance business  including the possible sale of all or part of these operations  while no decision has yet been made 
based upon current market conditions  we believe that a sale of these operations would result in a charge to earnings that could be material to quarterly or annual net income  although the amount of any charge will depend on the terms of any such agreement 
the individual life and annuities segment is compensated for property and casualty insurance products sold through its distribution network 
in the event of a sale of the property and casualty operations that resulted in continued access to non proprietary property and casualty products by the prudential agents  as expected by management  the individual life and annuities segment would expect to continue to be compensated for sales of these products  although the extent of these revenues cannot be predicted 
in addition  certain expenses incurred at the corporate level are allocated to the property and casualty insurance segment 
although we would seek to reduce the level of these expenses in the event of a sale of our property and casualty insurance business  these corporate level expenses would initially result in greater charges within adjusted operating income reported for corporate and other operations

the remaining million increase came primarily from new distribution channels we implemented during and  including career agents focused on selling property and casualty insurance  workplace and affinity marketing  direct distribution  and independent agents  many of whom were producers for the acquired subsidiary 
improved persistency in also contributed to the growth in earned premiums 
homeowners earned premiums increased million  or  from to due to lower reinsurance premiums ceded  as the number of policies in force was relatively unchanged 
this stabilization of our policies in force represented an improvement compared with declines in prior years  which reflected intense rate competition that attracted customers to other companies

accident year combined ratios reflect the combined ratios for accidents that occur in the indicated calendar year  restated to reflect subsequent changes in loss estimates for those claims based on cumulative loss data through december  these ratios reflect the recoveries from stop loss reinsurance contracts as noted above 
we analyze accident year combined ratios because they reflect the actual loss experience of accidents that occur in a given period excluding the effect of accidents that occur in other periods 
to annual comparison 
our automobile loss ratio  as shown in the table immediately above  increased from to primarily due to the lower net benefit from prior accident year reserve development in  of million  and million of lesser benefits from stop loss reinsurance recoveries

we have been in the process of re underwriting and non renewing business that has produced adverse loss experience to the extent permitted contractually and by state insurance regulations  and pursuing rate increases across our business 
these efforts have not yet affected the loss ratio significantly  as the business produced prior to their implementation will continue to affect the accident year results until the associated premiums are fully earned 
our ability to implement re underwriting and non renewal measures has been limited by regulatory requirements in various jurisdictions 
consistent with our geographic market segmentation strategy  we have ceased writing new homeowners business in a number of states to further reduce our exposure to catastrophes consistent with our profitability objectives 
the point increase in the homeowners loss ratio from to is due to a million higher unfavorable development on prior accident year losses and a reduction of million in stop loss reinsurance recoveries  partially offset by million lower catastrophe losses in on this business and the impact of rate increases implemented on homeowners policies

the decrease in the accident year combined ratio resulted from the decline in the expense ratio 
recoveries from stop loss reinsurance resulted in decreases in the accident year combined ratio of percentage points in and percentage points in to annual comparison 
our automobile loss ratio increased from to primarily due to the lower net benefit from prior accident year reserve development in we released reserves of million in and million in primarily because our automobile casualty claims experience for prior years was more favorable than we previously estimated in establishing reserves for these accident years 
the impact of experience on new automobile business also contributed to the increase in this ratio  since the experience on our seasoned automobile business was relatively consistent 
we added significant new automobile business during  primarily in the first half of the year

sales results in managing our international insurance business  we analyze new annualized premiums  which do not correspond to revenues under gaap  as well as revenues  because new annualized premiums measure the current sales performance of the business unit  while revenues reflect the renewal persistency and aging of in force policies written in prior years and net investment income in addition to current sales

investment margins and other profitability factors many of our insurance products sold in international markets provide for the buildup of cash values for the policyholder at mandated guaranteed interest rates 
the spread between the actual investment returns and these guaranteed rates of return to the policyholder is an element of the profit or loss that we will experience on these products 
interest rates guaranteed in our japanese insurance contracts are regulated by japanese authorities 
between july  and april   we guaranteed premium rates using an interest rate of on most of 
table of contents the products we sold even though the yield on japanese government and high quality corporate bonds was less than that much of this time 
this resulted in some negative investment spreads over this period 
as a consequence  our profitability with respect to these products in japan during that period resulted primarily from margins on mortality  morbidity and expense charges 
in response to the low interest rate environment  japanese regulators approved a reduction in the required rates for most of the products we sell to in april  which results in our charging higher premiums on new business for the same amount of insurance 
while this has also resulted in an improvement in investment spreads  these spreads had a negative impact on adjusted operating income from our japanese insurance operation other than gibraltar life in and  and the profitability of these products in japan continues to result primarily from margins on mortality  morbidity  and expense charges 
in  japanese regulators approved further reductions in the required interest rates applicable to most of the products we sell 
as a result  we increased premium rates on most of our products sold in japan when the new rates were implemented  in april for some products and in october for other products 
additionally  interest rates on our guaranteed products sold in korea are regulated by korean authorities  who approved  in april  a reduction in the required rates for most of the products we sell  allowing us to charge higher premiums on new business for the same amount of insurance 
while these actions enhance our ability to set rates commensurate with available investment returns  the major sources of profitability on our products in korea  as in japan  are margins on mortality and expense charges rather than investment spreads 
we base premiums and cash values in most countries in which we operate on mandated mortality tables 
our mortality experience in the international insurance segment on an overall basis for and was well within our pricing assumptions and below the guaranteed levels reflected in the premiums we charge

corporate level activities benefited from the impact of the transfer of net assets from the traditional participating products segment at the date of our demutualization and from cash and short term investments held at the parent company  which together contributed million to current period adjusted operating income 
this additional investment income was offset by lower returns from joint venture and limited partnership investments and reduced investment income  net of interest expense  from the wind down of a debt financed portfolio and lower yields on corporate level invested assets

the decrease in expected rate of return on pension plan assets for reflects the impact of current market conditions on our prospective view for equity  debt and real estate returns  while the decrease in the discount rate reflects the impact of current market conditions 
we will continue to apply a rate of increase in compensation levels for purposes of these calculations 
giving effect to the foregoing assumptions for purposes of pension calculations  we expect that income from our own qualified pension plan will continue to contribute to adjusted operating income in at a level of about million to million below that of the year ended december  our assumption for return on plan assets for of has been established as of the september  plan valuation for purposes of results for the year and will not change with respect to results

hedging losses retained at the corporate level decreased million from million in to million in the increase in income from our own qualified pension plan and decrease in hedging losses were partially offset by reductions in investment income from our debt financed investment portfolio and from invested assets that we held pending disbursement for sales practices remedies and costs

in addition  our real estate and relocation business reported a loss  on an adjusted operating income basis  of million in versus adjusted operating income of million in the loss in resulted from expenses of million from consolidation of operating facilities as well as a decline in corporate relocation volume 
closed block business as discussed under overview financial services businesses and closed block business  we established the closed block business effective at the date of demutualization 
the closed block business  which represents results of our former traditional participating products segment prior to the demutualization  includes our in force traditional participating life insurance and annuity products  and assets that are being used for the payment of benefits and policyholder dividends on these policies  as well as other assets and equity and related liabilities that support these policies 
we have ceased offering these participating policies 
also concurrently with our demutualization  we issued the ihc debt 
we allocated the majority of the net proceeds from the issuance of the ihc debt to the financial services businesses 
however  we expect that the ihc debt will be serviced by the net cash flows of the closed block business over time  and results of the closed block business include interest expense associated with the ihc debt 
upon the establishment of the closed block business  we transferred billion of net assets previously associated with the former traditional participating products segment to the financial services businesses 
as a result  income loss from continuing operations before income taxes of the closed block business excludes returns on these net assets  which were historically included in income loss from continuing operations before income taxes of the former traditional participating products segment 
at the end of each year  the board of directors of prudential insurance determines the dividends payable for participating policies for the following year based on its statutory results and past experience  including investment income  net realized gains over a number of years  mortality experience and other factors 
as required by generally accepted accounting principles  we developed an actuarial calculation of the timing of the maximum future earnings from the policies included in the closed block  and if actual cumulative earnings in any given period are greater than the cumulative earnings we expect  we will record this excess as a policyholder dividend obligation 
we will subsequently pay this excess to closed block policyholders as an additional dividend unless it is otherwise offset by future closed block performance that is less favorable than what we originally expected 
the policyholder dividends we charge to expense within the closed block business will include any policyholder dividend obligations that we recognize for the excess of actual cumulative earnings in any given period over the cumulative earnings we expect in addition to the actual policyholder dividends declared by the board of directors of prudential insurance 
if cumulative performance is less favorable than we expected  the policyholder dividends we charge to expense within the closed block business will be the actual dividends declared by the board of directors 
subsequent to the date of demutualization  there was no required charge to recognize a policyholder dividend obligation for the excess of actual cumulative earnings in any given period over the cumulative earnings we expect 
however  unrealized investment gains and losses that have arisen subsequent to the establishment of the closed block have been reflected as a policyholder dividend obligation to be paid to closed block policyholders  unless otherwise offset by future experience  with an offsetting amount reported in accumulated other comprehensive income and  as such  we have a policyholder dividend obligation to be paid to closed block policyholders of billion recorded as of december  
table of contents operating results management does not consider adjusted operating income to assess operating performance of the closed block business 
consequently  results of the closed block business for all periods are presented only in accordance with gaap 
the following table sets forth the closed block business s gaap results for the periods indicated

loss from continuing operations before income taxes increased million  to million for from million in the increase in the loss from continuing operations before income taxes reflects a decline in net investment income  including interest expense on the ihc debt  of million 
this decline reflects our transfer of billion of net assets previously associated with the former traditional participating products segment at the date of our demutualization in late and a lower investment yield on the assets remaining in the closed block business  as well as interest expense associated with the ihc debt  which we issued in december partially offsetting these items was a decrease in the charge for policyholder dividends of million  reflecting changes in the dividend scale for and in addition  we established million of reserves in for death and other benefits due with respect to policies for which we had not received a death claim but where death has occurred 
lastly  we continue to benefit from our expense reduction efforts  for which the closed block business incurred million of implementation costs in to annual comparison

we discontinued sales of traditional products in connection with our demutualization and expect the decline in first year and renewal premiums to continue as the policies in force mature or terminate over time

to annual comparison 
benefits and expenses decreased million  or  from to interest expense declined million  from million in to million in  primarily due to a lower level of borrowing activity associated with the decrease in investment income 
amortization of deferred policy acquisition costs decreased million  from million in to million in  as these costs became fully amortized on a portion of this business

partially offsetting these items is a reduction in the amount of reserves established for new and renewal business

these sources of funds are complemented by prudential financial s capital markets access 
we believe that cash flows from these sources are more than adequate to satisfy the liquidity requirements of our operations 
as of december   prudential financial had cash and short term investments of approximately billion  a decrease of billion  or  from december  sources of cash sources of cash included dividends and returns of capital of approximately million from several operating businesses as well as approximately million in additional cash received from operating businesses  which includes approximately million in excess cash loaned to prudential financial on a short term basis 
uses of cash in addition to the payment of billion for demutualization consideration to eligible policyholders in our demutualization  uses of cash included capital contributions of billion to various operating businesses  as well as million in dividends paid to common shareholders and million utilized to repurchase common stock 
prudential financial remains obligated to disburse further payments of approximately million  representing demutualization consideration for eligible policyholders we were unable to locate 
to the extent we are unable to locate these policyholders within a prescribed period of time specified by state escheat laws  typically three to seven years  the funds must be remitted to governmental authorities 
liabilities relating to demutualization consideration payments were established on the date of demutualization 
our insurance  broker dealer and various other companies are subject to regulatory limitations on the payment of dividends and on other transfers of funds to affiliates 
with respect to prudential insurance  new jersey insurance law provides that  except in the case of extraordinary dividends or distributions  all dividends or 
table of contents distributions paid by prudential insurance may be declared or paid only from unassigned surplus  as determined pursuant to statutory accounting principles  less unrealized investment gains and revaluation of assets 
upon demutualization  unassigned surplus was reduced to zero  thereby limiting prudential insurance s ability to pay a dividend immediately following demutualization 
as of december  and  prudential insurance s unassigned surplus deficit was million and million  respectively  and there were no applicable adjustments for unrealized investment gains or revaluation of assets for purposes of the foregoing law regarding dividends and distributions 
prudential insurance also must notify the new jersey insurance regulator of its intent to pay a dividend 
if the dividend  together with other dividends or distributions made within the preceding twelve months  would exceed a specified statutory limit  prudential insurance must also obtain a non disapproval from the new jersey insurance regulator 
the current statutory limitation applicable to new jersey life insurers generally is the greater of of the prior calendar year s statutory surplus or the prior calendar year s statutory net gain from operations excluding realized capital gains 
in addition to these regulatory limitations  the terms of the ihc debt also contain restrictions potentially limiting dividends by prudential insurance applicable to the financial services businesses in the event the closed block business is in financial distress and other circumstances 
in  prudential insurance notified the new jersey insurance regulator of its intent to pay an extraordinary dividend and  upon non disapproval from the regulator  paid an extraordinary dividend of million to prudential holdings  llc 
prudential holdings  llc  in turn  paid million of such dividend to prudential financial of which million was attributable to the financial services businesses 
in addition to the prudential insurance dividend  two of our property and casualty subsidiaries  prudential property and casualty insurance company of new jersey and prudential property and casualty insurance company  paid extraordinary dividends of million and million  respectively  in these subsidiaries are subject to regulations similar to those applicable to prudential insurance with respect to their ability to pay dividends 
the laws regulating dividends of the other states and foreign jurisdictions where our other insurance companies are domiciled are similar  but not identical  to new jersey s 
in addition  the net capital rules to which our broker dealer subsidiaries are subject may limit their ability to pay dividends to prudential financial 
pursuant to gibraltar life s reorganization  there are certain restrictions on gibraltar life s ability to pay dividends to prudential financial

the transaction  which is expected to close in the second quarter of  is subject to various closing conditions  including  among others  regulatory approvals  filing under the hart scott rodino antitrust improvements act and approval by the boards of directors and shareholders of the mutual funds advised by skandia us s subsidiaries 
we plan to utilize cash and borrowing capacity at prudential financial to fund this transaction 

table of contents on february   we announced an agreement with wachovia to combine each company s respective retail securities brokerage and clearing operations 
this transaction is expected to close in the third quarter of the new combined company will require additional capital to finance the cost of merging the businesses 
our share of such funding  excluding related tax benefits  is expected to be approximately million 
that need is expected to be partially offset at closing with cash that will be distributed to prudential securities group  inc from prudential securities  inc as the businesses are combined 
the transaction is not expected to have a material impact on prudential financial s liquidity and capital position 
financing activities prudential financial is authorized to borrow funds from various sources to meet its financing needs  as well as the financing needs of its subsidiaries 
as of december   there was no outstanding third party debt at prudential financial 
to enhance financial flexibility  we plan to file a registration statement with the securities and exchange commission in the second quarter of  which will permit the issuance of public debt and equity securities 
in addition  prudential funding  llc prudential funding  a wholly owned subsidiary of prudential insurance  continues to serve as a source of financing for prudential insurance and its subsidiaries  as well as for destacked subsidiaries 
prudential funding operates under a support agreement with prudential insurance  whereby prudential insurance has agreed to maintain prudential funding s positive tangible net worth at all times 
prudential funding borrows funds primarily through the direct issuance of commercial paper and private placement medium term notes 
prudential funding s outstanding loans to destacked subsidiaries are expected to decline over time as it transitions into a financing company primarily for prudential insurance and its remaining subsidiaries 
we anticipate that our other companies will borrow directly from third parties and from prudential financial  as well as from prudential funding from time to time 
our current financing activities principally consist of unsecured short term and long term unsecured debt borrowings and asset based or secured forms of financing 
these secured financing arrangements include transactions such as securities lending and repurchase agreements  which we generally use to finance liquid securities in our short term spread portfolios

total general debt obligations as of december  decreased by billion  or  from december   reflecting a million decrease in long term debt obligations and a billion decrease in short term debt obligations 
the decrease in short term debt was driven in part by the recapitalization of prudential securities group net of its increased borrowing needs  which contributed approximately million to the decrease in short term debt 
in addition  various other businesses utilized over million in cash from operations to reduce commercial paper outstanding 
also contributing to the decline in short term debt were decreased borrowing needs of approximately million in various operating businesses 
long term debt decreased primarily due to the reclassification of million in long term debt to current  including million in surplus notes 
asset based financing increased by billion in our short term spread portfolios 

table of contents our total borrowings consist of amounts used for general corporate purposes  investment related debt  securities business related debt and debt related to specified other businesses 
borrowings used for general corporate purposes include those used for cash flow timing mismatches at prudential financial and investments in equity and debt securities of subsidiaries including amounts utilized for regulatory capital purposes 
investment related borrowings consist of debt issued to finance specific investment assets or portfolios of investment assets  including institutional spread lending investment portfolios  real estate  and real estate related investments held in consolidated joint ventures  as well as institutional and insurance company portfolio cash flow timing differences

the total principal amount of debt outstanding under prudential funding s medium term note programs as of december  and was billon and billion  respectively 
the weighted average interest rates on prudential funding s long term debt  in the aggregate  were  and for the years ended december   and  respectively 
as of december   prudential financial had no short term or long term debt outstanding 
we had outstanding surplus notes totaling million and million as of december  and  respectively 
these debt securities  which are included as surplus of prudential insurance on a statutory accounting basis  are subordinate to other borrowings and to policyholder obligations and are subject to regulatory approvals for principal and interest payments 
as of december   prudential insurance and prudential funding had unsecured committed lines of credit totaling billion 
the lines consist of billion expiring during  billion expiring in may  and billion expiring in october borrowings under the outstanding facilities must mature no later than the respective expiration dates of the facilities 
the facility expiring in may includes financial institutions  many of which are also among the financial institutions participating in the october facility 
up to billion of the billion available under these facilities can be utilized by prudential financial 
the 
table of contents billion consists of billion made available under each of the facilities expiring in may and october we use these facilities primarily as back up liquidity lines for our commercial paper programs  and there were no outstanding borrowings under these facilities as of december  or our ability to borrow under these facilities is conditioned on our continued satisfaction of customary conditions  including maintenance at all times by prudential insurance of total adjusted capital of at least billion based on statutory accounting principles prescribed under new jersey law 
prudential insurance s total adjusted capital as of december  and was billion and billion  respectively 
the ability of prudential financial to borrow under these facilities is conditioned on its maintenance of consolidated net worth of at least billion  based on gaap 
prudential financial s consolidated net worth totaled billion and billion as of december  and  respectively 
in addition  we have a credit facility utilizing a third party sponsored  asset backed commercial paper conduit  under which we can borrow up to million 
this facility is supported by unsecured committed lines of credit from many of the financial institutions included in our other facilities 
our actual ability to borrow under this facility depends on market conditions  and with respect to the lines of credit  prudential financial is subject to the same net worth requirement as with our other facilities 
this facility expires in december we also use uncommitted lines of credit from banks and other financial institutions 
insurance  annuities and guaranteed products liquidity general our principal cash flow sources from insurance  annuities and guaranteed products are premiums and annuity considerations  investment and fee income  and investment maturities and sales 
we supplement these cash inflows with financing activities 
we actively use our balance sheet capacity for financing activities on a secured basis through securities lending  repurchase and dollar roll transactions and on an unsecured basis for temporary cash flow mismatch coverage 
historically  we have also used our balance sheet capacity to earn additional spread income  primarily through our debt financed investment portfolio included in corporate and other operations  although this portfolio was substantially reduced in  with the remainder liquidated in cash outflow requirements principally relate to benefits  claims  dividends paid to policyholders  and payments to contract holders as well as amounts paid to policyholders and contract holders in connection with surrenders  withdrawals and net policy loan activity 
uses of cash also include commissions  general and administrative expenses  purchases of investments  and debt service and repayments in connection with financing activities 
we believe that cash flows from operating and investing activities of our insurance  annuity and guaranteed products operations are adequate to satisfy liquidity requirements of these operations based on our current liability structure and considering a variety of reasonably foreseeable stress scenarios 
the continued adequacy of this liquidity will depend upon factors including future securities market conditions  changes in interest rate levels and policyholder perceptions of our financial strength  which could lead to reduced cash inflows or increased cash outflows 
prudential insurance and insurance subsidiaries we manage cash flow at these entities to ensure that all liquidity requirements are satisfied 
some of our products  such as guaranteed products offered to institutional customers of the retirement segment  provide for payment of accumulated funds to the contract holder at a specified maturity date unless the contract holder elects to roll over the funds into another contract with us 
we regularly monitor our liquidity requirements associated with policyholder and contractholder obligations so that we can manage cash inflows to match anticipated cash outflow requirements 
gross account withdrawals for prudential insurance and its insurance subsidiaries amounted to billion and billion for the years ended december  and  respectively 
these withdrawals include contractually scheduled maturities of traditional guaranteed investment contracts totaling billion and billion in and  respectively 
we experienced these withdrawals on guaranteed products as 
table of contents a result of contractual expirations of products sold in the late s and early s 
since these contractual withdrawals  as well as the level of surrenders experienced  were consistent with our assumptions in asset liability management  the associated cash outflows did not have an adverse impact on our overall liquidity 
we use surrender charges and other contract provisions to mitigate the extent  timing and profitability impact of withdrawals of funds by customers from annuity contracts 
the following table sets forth withdrawal characteristics of our general account annuity reserves and deposit liabilities based on statutory liability values as of the dates indicated 
as of december  amount of total amount of total in millions not subject to discretionary withdrawal provisions subject to discretionary withdrawal  with adjustment with market value adjustment at contract value  less surrender charge of or more subtotal subject to discretionary withdrawal at contract value with no surrender charge or surrender charge of less than total annuity reserves and deposit liabilities as of december  and  general account balances for variable life insurance products other than single payment life were billion and billion  respectively

gibraltar life s assets and liabilities were substantially restructured under a reorganization concurrent with our acquisition  which included the imposition of special surrender penalties on existing policies according to the following schedule for each year ending september as of december  and  gibraltar life had cash and short term investments of approximately billion and billion  respectively  and fixed maturity investments classified as available for sale with fair values of billion and billion at those dates  respectively 
prudential securities group liquidity prudential securities group inc maintains a highly liquid balance sheet with substantially all of its assets consisting of securities purchased under agreements to resell  short term collateralized receivables from clients and broker dealers arising from securities transactions  marketable securities  securities borrowed and cash equivalents 
prudential securities group s assets totaled billion and billion as of december  and  respectively 
prudential securities group s total capitalization  including equity  subordinated debt and long term debt  was billion and billion as of december  and  respectively 
in october  we announced that we would terminate our institutional fixed income activities that constituted the major portion of the debt capital markets operations of prudential securities group 
as of december   prudential securities group had remaining assets amounting to approximately million related to its institutional fixed income activities  as compared to billion as of december  
table of contents non insurance contractual obligations the following table presents our contractual cash flow commitments on short term and long term debt  equity security units and operating leases as of december  see notes  and to the consolidated financial statements for additional information on our short term and long term debt  equity security units and operating leases 
this table does not reflect our obligations under our insurance  annuity and guaranteed products contracts 
payment due by period total and and and after in millions short term and long term debt equity security units operating leases total in connection with our consumer banking business  commitments for home equity lines of credit and other lines of credit include agreements to lend up to specified limits to customers 
it is anticipated that commitment amounts will only be partially drawn down based on overall customer usage patterns and  therefore  do not necessarily represent future cash requirements 
we evaluate each credit decision on such commitments at least annually and have the ability to cancel or suspend such lines at our option 
the total commitments for home equity lines of credit and other lines of credit were billion  of which million remains available as of december  we also have other commitments  which primarily include commitments to originate and sell mortgage loans and commitments to fund investments in private placement securities and limited partnerships 
these commitments amounted to billion as of december  in connection with certain acquisitions  we agreed to pay additional consideration in future periods  based upon the attainment by the acquired entity of defined operating objectives 
in accordance with sfas no 
 business combinations  we do not accrue contingent consideration obligations prior to the attainment of the objectives 
at december   maximum potential future consideration pursuant to such arrangements  to be resolved over the following six years  is million 
any such payments would result in increases in goodwill 
we provide financial guarantees incidental to other transactions 
these credit related financial instruments have off balance sheet credit risk because only their origination fees  if any  and accruals for probable losses  if any  are recognized until the obligation under the instrument is fulfilled or expires 
these instruments can extend for several years and expirations are not concentrated in any single period 
we seek to control credit risk associated with these instruments by limiting credit  maintaining collateral where customary and appropriate and performing other monitoring procedures 
as of december   financial guarantees were million

table of contents deferred policy acquisition costs we capitalize costs that vary with and are related primarily to the production of new insurance and annuity business 
these costs include commissions  costs to issue and underwrite the policies and certain variable field office expenses 
the capitalized amounts are known as deferred policy acquisition costs  or dac 
our total dac  including the impact of unrealized investment gains and losses  amounted to billion and billion as of december  and  respectively 
approximately of our total dac as of december  relates to our individual life and annuities segment  and approximately relates to our closed block business 
if we were to experience a significant decrease in asset values or increase in lapse or surrender rates on policies for which we amortize dac based on estimated gross margins or gross profits  such as participating and variable life insurance  we would expect acceleration of the write off of dac for the affected blocks of policies 
additionally  for all policies on which we have outstanding dac  we would be required to evaluate whether this experience called into question our ability to recover all or a portion of the dac  and we would be required to write off some or all of the dac if we concluded that we could not recover it 
while an accelerated write off of dac would not affect our cash flow or liquidity  it would negatively affect our reported earnings and level of capital under generally accepted accounting principles 
off balance sheet arrangements guarantees as discussed under liquidity and capital resources non insurance contractual obligations we provide guarantees incidental to other transactions and services 
we provide a number of guarantees related to sales or transfers of real estate  in which the buyer has borrowed funds  and we have guaranteed their obligation to their lender 
we provide these guarantees to assist them in obtaining financing for the transaction on more beneficial terms 
in some instances  the buyer is an unconsolidated affiliate  and in other instances the buyer is unaffiliated and we retain no interests in the transferred asset 
our maximum potential exposure under these guarantees was million as of december  any payments that may become required by us under these guarantees would either first be reduced by proceeds received by the creditor on a sale of the assets  or would provide us with rights to obtain the assets 
other off balance sheet arrangements we do not have retained or contingent interests in assets transferred to unconsolidated entities  or variable interests in unconsolidated entities or other similar transactions  arrangements or relationships that serve as credit  liquidity or market risk support  that are reasonably likely to have a material effect on our financial condition  changes in financial condition  revenues or expenses  results of operations  liquidity  capital expenditures or our access to or requirements for capital resources 
in addition  we do not have relationships with any unconsolidated entities that are contractually limited to narrow activities that facilitate our transfer of or access to assets 

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk risk management  market risk and derivative instruments risk management includes the identification and measurement of various forms of risk  the establishment of risk thresholds and the creation of processes intended to maintain risks within these thresholds while optimizing returns on the underlying assets or liabilities 
we consider risk management an integral part of our core business 
market risk is the risk of change in the value of financial instruments as a result of absolute or relative changes in interest rates  foreign currency exchange rates or equity or commodity prices 
to varying degrees  the investment and trading activities supporting all of our products and services generate market risks 
the market risks incurred and our strategies for managing these risks vary by product 
with respect to non variable life insurance products  fixed rate annuities  the fixed rate options in our variable life insurance and annuity products  consumer banking products  and other finance businesses  we incur market risk primarily in the form of interest rate risk 
we manage this risk through asset liability management strategies that seek to match the interest rate sensitivity of the assets to that of the underlying liabilities 
our overall objective in these strategies is to limit the net change in value of assets and liabilities arising from interest rate movements 
while it is more difficult to measure the interest sensitivity of our insurance liabilities than that of the related assets  to the extent that we can measure such sensitivities we believe that interest rate movements will generate asset value changes that substantially offset changes in the value of the liabilities relating to the underlying products 
for variable annuities and variable life insurance products  excluding the fixed rate options in these products  mutual funds and most separate accounts  our main exposure to the market is the risk that asset management fees decrease as a result of declines in assets under management due to changes in prices of securities 
we also run the risk that asset management fees calculated by reference to performance could be lower 
for variable annuity and variable life insurance products with minimum guaranteed death benefits  we also face the risk that declines in the value of underlying investments as a result of changes in prices of securities may increase our net exposure to death benefits under these contracts 
we do not believe that these risks add significantly to our overall market risk 
we manage our exposure to equity price risk relating to our general account primarily by seeking to match the risk profile of equity investments against risk adjusted equity market benchmarks 
we measure benchmark risk levels in terms of price volatility in relation to the market in general 
the sources of our exposure to market risk can be divided into two categories  other than trading activities conducted primarily in our insurance  annuity and guaranteed products operations  and trading activities conducted primarily in our securities operations 
as part of our management of both other than trading and trading market risks  we use a variety of risk management tools and techniques 
these include sensitivity and value at risk var measures  position and other limits based on type of risk  and various hedging methods 
other than trading activities we hold the majority of our assets for other than trading activities in our segments that offer insurance  annuities and guaranteed products 
we incorporate asset liability management techniques and other risk management policies and limits into the process of investing our assets 
we use derivatives for hedging purposes in the asset liability management process 
insurance  annuities and guaranteed products asset liability management we seek to maintain interest rate and equity exposures within established ranges  which we periodically adjust based on market conditions and the design of related products sold to customers 
our risk managers establish investment risk limits for exposures to any issuer  geographic region  type of security or industry sector and oversee efforts to manage risk within policy constraints set by management and approved by the board of directors 

table of contents we use duration and convexity analyses to measure price sensitivity to interest rate changes 
duration measures the relative sensitivity of the fair value of a financial instrument to changes in interest rates 
convexity measures the rate of change of duration with respect to changes in interest rates 
we seek to manage our interest rate exposure by legal entity by matching the relative sensitivity of asset and liability values to interest rate changes  or controlling duration mismatch of assets and liabilities 
we have target duration mismatch constraints for each entity 
as of december  and  the difference between the pre tax duration of assets and the target duration of liabilities in our duration managed portfolios was within our constraint limits 
we consider risk based capital implications in our asset liability management strategies 
we also perform portfolio stress testing as part of our regulatory cash flow testing 
in this testing  we evaluate the impact of altering our interest sensitive assumptions under various moderately adverse interest rate environments 
these interest sensitive assumptions relate to the timing and amount of redemptions and prepayments of fixed income securities and lapses and surrenders of insurance products 
we evaluate any shortfalls that this cash flow testing reveals to determine if we need to increase statutory reserves or adjust portfolio management strategies 
market risk related to interest rates our other than trading assets that subject us to interest rate risk include fixed maturity securities  commercial loans and policy loans 
in the aggregate  the carrying value of these assets represented of our consolidated assets  other than assets that we held in separate accounts  as of december  and as of december  with respect to other than trading liabilities  we are exposed to interest rate risk through policyholder account balances relating to interest sensitive life insurance  annuity and investment type contracts and through outstanding short term and long term debt 

table of contents we assess interest rate sensitivity for other than trading financial assets  financial liabilities and derivatives using hypothetical test scenarios that assume either upward or downward basis point parallel shifts in the yield curve from prevailing interest rates 
the following tables set forth the potential loss in fair value from a hypothetical basis point upward shift at december  and  because this scenario results in the greatest net exposure to interest rate risk of the hypothetical scenarios tested at those dates 
while the test scenario is for illustrative purposes only and does not reflect our expectations regarding future interest rates or the performance of fixed income markets  it is a near term  reasonably possible hypothetical change that illustrates the potential impact of such events 
these test scenarios do not measure the changes in value that could result from non parallel shifts in the yield curve  which we would expect to produce different changes in discount rates for different maturities 
as a result  the actual loss in fair value from a basis point change in interest rates could be different from that indicated by these calculations 
december  notional value of derivatives estimated fair value hypothetical fair value after basis point parallel yield curve shift hypothetical change in fair value in millions financial assets with interest rate risk fixed maturities available for sale held to maturity commercial loans mortgage securitization inventory policy loans derivatives swaps futures options forwards financial liabilities with interest rate risk short term and long term debt investment contracts guaranteed beneficial interest in trust holding solely debentures of parent total estimated potential loss december  notional value of derivatives estimated fair value hypothetical fair value after basis point parallel yield curve shift hypothetical change in fair value in millions financial assets with interest rate risk fixed maturities available for sale held to maturity commercial loans mortgage securitization inventory policy loans derivatives swaps futures options forwards financial liabilities with interest rate risk short term and long term debt investment contracts guaranteed beneficial interest in trust holding solely debentures of parent total estimated potential loss 
table of contents the tables above do not include approximately billion of insurance reserve and deposit liabilities at december  and billion at december  we believe that the interest rate sensitivities of these insurance liabilities offset  in large measure  the interest rate risk of the financial assets set forth in these tables 
the  million increase in the total estimated potential loss at december  from december  resulted primarily from the increase in our portfolio of fixed maturities available for sale during the estimated changes in fair values of our financial assets shown above relate primarily to assets invested to support our insurance liabilities  but do not include assets associated with products for which investment risk is borne primarily by the contract holders rather than by us 
market risk related to equity prices we actively manage equity price risk against benchmarks in respective markets 
we benchmark our return on equity holdings against a blend of market indices  mainly the s p and russell  and we target price sensitivities that approximate those of the benchmark indices 
we estimate our equity price risk from a hypothetical decline in equity benchmark market levels and measure this risk in terms of the decline in fair market value of equity securities we hold 
using this methodology  our estimated equity price risk at december  was million  representing a hypothetical decline in fair market value of equity securities we held at that date from billion to billion 
our estimated equity price risk using this methodology at december  was million  representing a hypothetical decline in fair market value of equity securities we held at that date from billion to billion 
in calculating these amounts  we exclude equity securities related to products for which the investment risk is borne primarily by the contractholder rather than by us 
while these scenarios are for illustrative purposes only and do not reflect our expectations regarding future performance of equity markets or of our equity portfolio  they represent near term reasonably possible hypothetical changes that illustrate the potential impact of such events 
market risk related to foreign currency exchange rates we are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risk in our general account and through our operations in foreign countries 
in our international life insurance business  we generally invest in assets denominated in the same currencies as our insurance liabilities  which mitigates our foreign currency exchange rate risk for these operations 
our exposure to foreign currency risk within the general account investment portfolios supporting our us insurance operations arises primarily from purchased investments that are denominated or payable in foreign currencies 
we generally hedge substantially all foreign currency denominated fixed income investments supporting our us operations into us dollars  using foreign exchange forward contracts and currency swaps  in order to mitigate the risk that the fair value of these investments fluctuates as a result of changes in foreign exchange rates 
we generally do not hedge all of the foreign currency risk of our equity investments in unaffiliated foreign entities 
our operations in foreign countries create two additional sources of foreign currency risk 
first  we reflect the operating results of our foreign branches and subsidiaries in our financial statements based on the average exchange rates prevailing during the period 
we hedge some of these foreign currency flows based on our overall risk management strategy and loss limits 
we generally hedge our anticipated exposure to adjusted operating income fluctuations resulting from changes in foreign currency exchange rates relating to our international operations in japan  of which our japanese insurance operations are the most significant  using foreign exchange forward contracts and currency swaps 
second  we translate our equity investment in foreign branches and subsidiaries into us dollars using the foreign currency exchange rate at the financial statement period end date 
we have chosen to partially hedge this exposure 
we actively manage foreign currency exchange rate risk within specified limits at the consolidated level using value at risk analysis 
this statistical technique estimates  at a specified confidence level  the potential pre tax loss in portfolio market value that could occur over an assumed time horizon due to adverse market movements 
we calculate this using a variance covariance approach 

table of contents we calculate value at risk estimates of exposure to loss from volatility in foreign currency exchange rates for one month time periods 
our estimated var at december  for foreign currency assets not hedged to us dollars  measured at the confidence level and using a one month time horizon  was million  representing a hypothetical decline in fair market value of these foreign currency assets from million to million 
our estimated var at december  for foreign currency assets not hedged to us dollars  measured at the confidence level and using a one month time horizon  was million  representing a hypothetical decline in fair market value of these foreign currency assets from million to million 
these calculations use historical price volatilities and correlation data at a confidence level 
we discuss limitations of var models below 
our estimated var for foreign exchange forward contracts and currency swaps used to hedge our anticipated exposure to adjusted operating income fluctuations resulting from changes in foreign currency exchange rates relating to our international operations  measured at the confidence level and using a one month time horizon  was million at december  and million at december  our average monthly value at risk for foreign currency assets not hedged to us dollars from foreign currency exchange rate movements  measured at the confidence level over a one month time horizon  was million during and million during derivatives derivatives are financial instruments whose values are derived from interest rates  foreign exchange rates  financial indices  or the prices of securities or commodities 
derivative financial instruments may be exchange traded or contracted in the over the counter market and include swaps  futures  options and forward contracts 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for a summary of our derivative positions as of december  and under insurance statutes  our insurance companies may use derivative financial instruments to hedge actual or anticipated changes in their assets or liabilities  to replicate cash market instruments or for certain income generating activities 
these statutes generally prohibit the use of derivatives for speculative purposes 
we use derivative financial instruments primarily to seek to reduce market risk from changes in interest rates or foreign currency exchange rates  and to alter interest rate or foreign currency exposures arising from mismatches between assets and liabilities 
in addition  derivatives are used in our securities operations for trading purposes 
trading activities we engage in trading activities primarily in connection with our securities businesses 
we maintain trading inventories in various equity and fixed income securities  foreign exchange instruments and commodities  primarily to facilitate transactions for our clients 
market risk affects the values of our trading inventories through fluctuations in absolute or relative interest rates  credit spreads  foreign currency exchange rates  securities and commodity prices 
we seek to use short security positions and forwards  futures  options and other derivatives to limit exposure to interest rate and other market risks 
we also trade derivative financial instruments that allow our clients to manage exposure to interest rate  currency and other market risks 
most of our derivative transactions involve exchange listed contracts and are short term in duration 
we act both as a broker  by selling exchange listed contracts  and as a dealer  by entering into futures and security transactions as a principal 
as a broker  we assume counterparty and credit risks that we seek to mitigate by using margin or other credit enhancements and by establishing trading limits and credit lines 
as a dealer  we are subject to market risk as well as counterparty and credit risk 
we manage the market risk associated with trading activities through hedging activities and formal policies  risk and position limits  counterparty and credit limits  daily position monitoring  and other forms of risk management 
value at risk var is one of the tools we use to monitor and manage our exposure to the market risk of our trading activities 
we calculate a var that encompasses our trading activities using a confidence level 
the var method incorporates the risk factors to which the market value of our trading activities is exposed  which consist of interest rates  including credit spreads  foreign exchange rates  equity prices and commodity prices  estimates of volatilities from historical data  the sensitivity of our trading activities to changes in those market factors and 
table of contents the correlations of those factors 
we regularly test our var model by comparing actual adverse results to those estimated by the var model with a confidence level over a one day time horizon 
the var for our trading activities expressed in terms of adverse changes to fair value at the confidence level over a one day time horizon was million at december  and million at december  the average daily var for our trading activities  expressed in terms of adverse changes to fair value with a confidence level over a one day time horizon  was million during and million during the following table sets forth a breakdown of this var by risk component as follows as of december  average for as of december  average for in millions interest rate risk equity risk total at december  and  and during the years then ended  var from each of foreign currency exchange rate risk and commodity risk in our trading activities was immaterial 
limitations of var models although var models represent a recognized tool for risk management  they have inherent limitations  including reliance on historical data that may not be indicative of future market conditions or trading patterns 
accordingly  you should not view var models as a predictor of future results 
we may incur losses that could be materially in excess of the amounts indicated by the models on a particular trading day or over a period of time  and there have been instances when results have fallen outside the values generated by our var models 
a var model does not estimate the greatest possible loss 
we use these models together with other risk management tools  including stress testing 
the results of these models and analysis thereof are subject to the judgment of our risk management personnel
