this statement requires that the results of operations  gains and losses  and cash flows attributed to properties held for sale or sold during and thereafter  such as third avenue and flushing  be classified as discontinued operations for all periods presented  and that any assets and liabilities of properties held for sale be presented separately in the consolidated balance sheet

critical accounting policies in preparing the consolidated financial statements management has made estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
set forth below is a summary of the accounting policies that management believes are critical to the preparation of the consolidated financial statements 
the summary should be read in conjunction with the more complete discussion of the company s accounting policies included in note to the consolidated financial statements in this annual report on form k 
real estate real estate is carried at cost  net of accumulated depreciation and amortization 
maintenance and repairs are charged to operations as incurred 
depreciation requires an estimate by management of the useful life of each property as well as an allocation of the costs associated with a property to its various components 
if the company does not allocate these costs appropriately or incorrectly estimates the useful lives of its real estate  depreciation expense may be misstated 
when real estate and other property is undergoing development activities  all property operating expenses  including interest expense  are capitalized to the cost of the real property to the extent that management believes such costs are recoverable through the value of the property 
the company s properties are reviewed for impairment if events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable 
in such event  a comparison is made of the current and projected operating cash flows of each property on an undiscounted basis  to the carrying amount of such property 
if the company incorrectly estimates the value of the asset or the undiscounted cash flows  the impairment charges may be different 
revenue recognition the company has the following revenue sources and revenue recognition policies base rents income arising from tenant leases 
these rents are recognized over the non cancellable term of the related leases on a straight line basis which includes the rent steps and free rent abatements under the leases 
percentage rents income arising from retail tenant leases which are contingent upon the sales of the tenant exceeding a defined threshold 
these rents are recognized in accordance with sab  which states that this income is to be recognized only after the contingency has been removed ie sales thresholds have been achieved 
expense reimbursement income income arising from tenant leases which provide for the recovery of all or a portion of the operating expenses and real estate taxes of the respective property 
this income is accrued in the same periods as the expenses are incurred 
before the company can recognize revenue  it is required to assess  among other things  its collectibility 
if the company incorrectly determines the collectibility of its revenue  its net income and assets could be overstated 
income taxes the company operates in a manner intended to enable it to continue to qualify as a reit under sections through of the internal revenue code of  as amended the code 
under those sections  a reit which distributes at least of its reit taxable income as a dividend to its stockholders each year and which meets certain other conditions will not be taxed on that portion of its taxable income 
the company s net operating loss nol carryovers generally would be available to offset the amount of the company s reit taxable income
