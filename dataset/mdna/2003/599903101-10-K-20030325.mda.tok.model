item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations introduction the company s principal operations are grouped into three business segments titanium dioxide and related products  acetyls  and specialty chemicals 
operating income and expense not identified to the three separate business segments  consisting primarily of employee related costs from predecessor businesses and certain other expenses  are reflected as other 
the company also holds a interest in equistar  which is accounted for using the equity method 
see notes and to the consolidated financial statements included in this annual report 
a discussion of equistar s financial results for the relevant period is included below  as the company s interest in equistar represents a significant component of the company s assets and equistar s results can have a significant effect on the company s consolidated results of operations 
the following information should be read in conjunction with the company s consolidated financial statements and notes thereto 
in connection with the forward looking statements that appear in the following information  please carefully review the cautionary statements in disclosure concerning forward looking statements included in this annual report 
historical cyclicality of the chemicals industry the company s income and cash flow levels reflect the cyclical nature of the chemicals industries in which it operates 
most of these industries are mature and sensitive to cyclical supply and demand balances 
in particular  the markets for ethylene and polyethylene  in which the company participates through its interest in equistar  are highly cyclical  resulting in volatile profits and cash flow over the business cycle 
the global markets for tiou  vam  acetic acid  and fragrance and flavor chemicals are also cyclical  although to a lesser degree 
the balance of supply and demand in the markets in which the company and equistar do business  as well as the level of inventories held by downstream customers  has a direct effect on the sales volume and prices of the company s and equistar s products 
for example  if supply exceeds demand  producers are often pressured to maintain sales volume with customers and  consequently  pressure to reduce prices may result 
this is especially true in periods of economic decline or uncertainty  when demand may be limited and customers may become cautious about building inventory 
producers  such as the company and equistar  may respond in various ways depending upon the particular circumstances  including by meeting competitive price reductions  short term curtailment of production  or longer term temporary or permanent plant shutdowns 
in contrast  the company believes that  over a business cycle  the markets for specialty chemicals are generally more stable in terms of industry demand  selling prices and operating margins 
demand for tiou  which is influenced by changes in the gross domestic product of various regions of the world  has fluctuated from year to year  averaging an increase of approximately to per year over the last ten years 
the industry is also sensitive to changes in its customers marketplaces  which are primarily the paint and coatings  plastics and paper industries 
in recent history  consolidations and negative business conditions within certain of those industries have put pressure on tiou prices as companies compete to keep volume placed 
demand for ethylene and its derivatives and for acetyls has fluctuated from year to year depending on various factors including but not limited to the economy  industrial production  weather and threat of war 
however  over the last ten years  global demand for ethylene and its primary derivative  polyethylene  has increased an average of approximately per year 
this industry segment is particularly sensitive to capacity additions 
producers have historically experienced alternating periods of inadequate capacity  resulting in increased selling prices and operating margins  followed by periods of large capacity additions  resulting in declining capacity utilization rates  selling prices and operating margins 
this cyclical pattern is most visible in the markets for ethylene and polyethylene  resulting in volatile profits and cash flow over the business cycle 
currently  there is overcapacity in these industries  as a number of equistar s competitors in various segments of these industries have added capacity 
there can be no assurance that future growth in product demand will be sufficient to utilize current or any additional capacity 
excess industry capacity has depressed and may continue to depress equistar s volumes and margins 
profitability in the acetyls business segment and in equistar s businesses is further influenced by fluctuations in the price of natural gas and feedstocks for ethylene 
it is not possible to predict accurately the effect that future changes in natural gas and feedstock costs  market conditions and other factors will have on the company s or equistar s profitability 
different facilities may have differing operating rates from period to period depending on supply and demand for the product produced at the facility during that period and other factors  such as energy costs  feedstock costs and transportation costs 
as a result  individual facilities may be operated below or above rated capacities  may be idled or may be shut down and restarted in any period 
it is possible that lower demand in the future will cause the company or equistar to reduce operating rates or idle facilities 
the global economic and political environment continues to be uncertain  contributing to lower operating rates  adding to the volatility of raw material and energy costs  and forestalling recovery from trough conditions  all of which is placing  and may continue to place  pressure on the company s and equistar s results of operations 
major factors affecting results o demand for tiou and acetyls products increased significantly over prior year levels as signs of economic recovery began to emerge in most world markets except south america and customers rebuilt inventory levels depleted during o unstable economic conditions prevailed in south america  resulting in lower sales volume and prices in that region in o after reaching their lowest level in more than five years in the first quarter of  tiou prices rose steadily through the end of the year  as price increases announced by the company and most of its competitors were gradually realized  supported by increased demand 
o the value of the euro  british pound and australian dollar strengthened versus the us dollar  further contributing to increasing sales revenue when translated into us dollars 
the brazilian real continued to weaken against the us dollar  contributing to declining sales revenue in that region 
o tiou manufacturing costs decreased in as compared with due to productivity and reliability improvements  lower cost of natural gas and other purchased materials  the realization of benefits from the company s cost saving initiatives  including the idling of its high cost sulfate process tiou plant in hawkins point  maryland at the end of the third quarter of and lower unit production costs due to higher fixed cost absorption from higher production rates as a result of increased customer demand 
o acetyls prices rose steadily through the end of the year after reaching a low early in the second quarter  as announced price increases were realized 
o acetyls margins in were greatly improved in comparison with higher demand resulted in lower per unit production costs due to higher fixed cost absorption resulting from increased plant operating rates 
unfavorable fixed price natural gas purchase positions that increased acetyls operating loss in by million expired at the end of the first quarter of o acetyls feedstock costs  including costs of natural gas and ethylene  remained relatively stable throughout much of the year  but increased during the fourth quarter primarily due to unseasonably cold weather in certain regions of the us and events in the middle east 
o conditions in the worldwide markets of the specialty chemicals business segment remained competitive due to excess capacity  and volume was negatively affected by competition from low cost manufacturers in asia 
in addition  the company s production facilities for specialty chemicals experienced high maintenance and production costs due to planned and unplanned production interruptions 
o the company reduced selling  development and administrative s  d a costs by million or from o higher interest costs were incurred primarily as a result of higher average debt levels and the higher cost of debt due to the issuance in june of million additional principal amount of senior notes 
o at equistar  operating results were slightly lower compared to higher polymers margins primarily due to lower raw material costs were more than offset by lower margins in the petrochemicals segment primarily as a result of lower sales prices 
outlook for the company has announced additional price increases for tiou and acetyls products during the first quarter of however  contracts with most of the company s large volume tiou customers include periods of price protection 
therefore  the benefits of tiou price increases  if implementation is successful  may not be fully realized by the company for several months after the effective date of the price increases 
the success of price increases in both the tiou and acetyls business segments is dependent on continuing economic recovery and accompanying strong customer demand 
the tiou business segment expects sales volume and prices in the first quarter of to be up slightly compared to the fourth quarter of natural gas and ethylene pricing is critical to profitability in the acetyls business segment 
natural gas prices have been on the rise since early december due to unseasonably cold weather in certain regions of the us and events in the middle east 
natural gas prices and  as a result  the cost of ethylene  have increased significantly in the first quarter of the company has responded by announcing price increases for acetyls products in the first quarter of the higher costs could help to support the recently announced price increases for acetyls products  but the increase in feedstock costs has put pressure on margins in the acetyls business segment 
acetyls price increases have not been sufficient to offset rising natural gas prices  accordingly  the profitability of the acetyls business segment is expected to be adversely affected in the first quarter of first quarter operating income is expected to be positive for acetyls but below fourth quarter levels 
first quarter operating results for the specialty chemicals business segment are expected to improve slightly from the fourth quarter of based on an increase in sales volume without the production outages and maintenance that led to increased costs in the fourth quarter of the company has achieved reductions in production costs and s  d a expenses as a result of process improvement  cost reduction and cost containment programs 
these programs have been critical to achieving improved operating profit levels and will continue to be a priority in in the first quarter of  the olefins and polyethylene industries experienced significantly higher and more volatile energy and raw material costs than in the fourth quarter equistar has responded by implementing price increases in the first quarter of for substantially all of its petrochemicals and polymers products 
however  the effect of historically high energy related feedstocks will make for a very difficult first quarter 
equistar s ethylene cash costs have risen significantly faster than the effective price increases equistar has obtained or expects to obtain in the first quarter 
due to price protection and market forces  typically  there is a lag of weeks to months before a cost increase in equistar s feedstocks translates to full or partial price increase realization in polymers and derivatives 
accordingly  the company s equity loss in equistar s results is expected to be greater than the million loss recorded in the fourth quarter of industry analysts forecast that the olefins industry will experience improved supply demand conditions in  driven by industry announcements of plant shutdowns and maintenance turnarounds 
however  unless global economic uncertainties and energy market issues are resolved  the impact of high raw material and energy costs could outweigh these benefits and could depress demand 
if global economic uncertainties and energy market issues are resolved  it should result in reduced raw material costs and increased industrial activity  which would benefit equistar s operations 
as discussed in more detail in financing and capital structure on page  the company believes that it will not be in compliance with certain financial covenants at june   unless economic and business conditions improve significantly in the second quarter of accordingly  the company is seeking a waiver or amendment to its credit agreement  which it expects to obtain by june  with the company s lowered cost base and improved prices for its major products during the first quarter  overall prospects for the company s business segments are expected to be favorable for compared to  however  the current global economic uncertainties and volatile energy markets could significantly adversely affect these prospects as well as the prospects of equistar 
pension assets and equity because of the recent declines in the financial markets  certain of the company s us and foreign pension plans had underfunded accumulated benefit obligations abo at the end of the company is required to charge to shareholders equity a minimum liability for any underfunded amount and the existing prepaid pension asset related to the affected plans 
the charge to shareholders equity at december   net of income taxes  was million 
see note to the consolidated financial statements included in this annual report 
due to the reduction in the fair value of pension plan assets and the company s decision to reduce its assumptions for the expected return on pension plan assets and the discount rate related to its pension plans  pension expense for is expected to increase by approximately million 
pension plan funding requirements are not expected to materially change in income tax benefits the company s and results include income tax benefits due to favorable developments related to items reserved for in prior years and the recognition of deferred tax assets associated with net operating loss carryforwards 
these deferred tax assets  as well as any newly generated deferred tax assets  are evaluated quarterly to assess the likelihood of realization  which is ultimately dependent upon generating future taxable income prior to expiration of the net operating loss carryforwards 
if it were considered to be more likely than not that the deferred tax assets would not be realized  a valuation allowance would be established against some or all of the deferred tax assets 
as a result of the company s assessment of its net deferred tax assets at december   based upon certain available tax planning strategies  the company considers it more likely than not that million of its net deferred tax assets will be realized in the future and therefore  no valuation allowance was required for this portion of its net deferred tax assets at december  should it be determined in the future that it is no longer more likely than not that these assets will be realized  an additional valuation allowance would be required and the company s operating results would be adversely affected during the period in which such determination would be made 
the company currently expects that if it continues to report net operating losses in future periods  income tax benefits associated with those losses would not be recognized  and therefore  the company s results would be adversely affected in those periods

during the fourth quarter of  the company changed from the lifo method to the fifo method of accounting for certain of its united states inventories in the titanium dioxide and related products business segment 
the method was changed in part to achieve a better matching of revenues and expenses 
the fifo method  or methods that approximate fifo  are now used to determine cost for all inventories of the company 
the change increased operating income in the titanium dioxide and related products business segment by less than million and positively impacted the net loss of the company by less than million or per share in the effect of the change on operating income for the titanium dioxide and related products business segment was a decrease of million and an increase of million for the year and  respectively 
net loss income and net loss income per share of the company were negatively impacted by million or per share  respectively  for the year and positively impacted by million or per share  respectively  for the year information presented above and throughout this annual report has been restated for all periods presented to reflect the change from the lifo to fifo method 
goodwill amortization and unusual items the comparability of the company s results in  and is affected by a change in the accounting for goodwill and a number of unusual items 
on january   the company adopted statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 goodwill and intangible assets sfas no 
 which applies to all goodwill and intangible assets acquired in a business combination 
under this new standard  all goodwill  including goodwill acquired before initial application of the standard  is not amortized but must be tested for impairment at least annually at the reporting unit level  as defined in the standard 
accordingly  the company reported a charge for the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle of million in the first quarter of to write off goodwill related to its acetyls business 
also in accordance with sfas no 
 equistar reported an impairment of goodwill in the first quarter of the write off at equistar required an adjustment of million to reduce the carrying value of the company s investment in equistar to its approximate proportional share of equistar s partners capital 
the company reported this adjustment as a charge for the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle 
goodwill amortization was suspended on january  in accordance with sfas no 
results for each of the years and included million of expense in operating income for amortization of the company s goodwill and million included in equity in loss earnings of equistar for the company s share of equistar s goodwill amortization 
unusual items increased results for by net after tax income of million or per share and results for by net after tax income of million or per share 
unusual items consisted of the income tax benefits discussed under income tax benefits above and certain other items presented in the table below 
the results for did not include any unusual items 
the provision for reorganization and plant closure costs recorded in and included in the table below related to reorganization activities within each of the company s business segments 
during the second quarter of  million was recorded in connection with the company s announced decision to reduce its worldwide workforce and indefinitely idle its sulfate process tiou plant in hawkins point  maryland 
the million charge included severance and other employee related costs of million for the termination of approximately employees involved in manufacturing  technical  sales and marketing  finance and administrative support  a million write down of assets and million in other costs associated with the idling of the plant 
during the first quarter of  the company announced the closure of its facilities in cincinnati  ohio  and recorded reorganization and other charges of million in the acetyls segment 
these charges included million of severance and other termination benefits related to the termination of about employees involved in technical  marketing and administrative activities  as well as million related to the write down of assets  lease termination costs and other charges associated with the cincinnati facility 
the office in cincinnati was closed during the second quarter of all payments for severance and related costs and for other costs related to reorganization and plant closure have been made as of december reconciliation of net income as reported to non gaap measures the following table sets forth a reconciliation of net income  as reported in accordance with gaap  to results of operations exclusive of goodwill amortization and unusual items per share per share per share amount basic amount basic amount basic millions  except per share data reported net loss income change in accounting for goodwill cumulative effect of accounting change goodwill amortization equistar goodwill amortization reduction in income tax accruals due to favorable developments related to matters reserved for in prior years reorganization and plant closure charges reduction of reserves due to favorable resolution of environmental claims related to predecessor businesses reserved for in prior years company s share of costs related to shutdown of equistar s port arthur  texas plant results exclusive of goodwill amortization and unusual items results exclusive of goodwill amortization and unusual items the following discussion of results of operations  as adjusted for the change in accounting for goodwill and unusual items  should be considered in conjunction with the preceding table  which provides an explanation and quantification of the change in accounting for goodwill and of the unusual items and also provides a reconciliation between results of operations  as adjusted for the change in accounting for goodwill and for these unusual items  and results of operations determined in accordance with gaap 
the following table sets forth the company s results exclusive of goodwill amortization and unusual items millions net sales 
   operating income equity in loss earnings of equistar net loss income versus excluding unusual items and the change in accounting for goodwill  the company s net losses for and were million or per share and million or per share  respectively 
the company s business segments operated at net income of million or per share in  compared to net income of million or per share in  excluding goodwill amortization and unusual items 
the company s after tax equity loss from equistar of million or per share for increased by million or per share  more than the after tax equity loss of million or per share for  excluding goodwill amortization and unusual items 
excluding unusual items and the change in accounting for goodwill  operating income for of million decreased by million or from this reflected decreases of million and million in the titanium dioxide and related products and specialty chemicals business segments  respectively  and an increase of million in the acetyls business segment compared to other operating income not identified with the three separate business segments for decreased by million compared to  excluding unusual items 
net sales for of billion decreased by million or from as higher sales volume in the titanium dioxide and related products and acetyls business segments was more than offset by lower selling prices 
although average prices for many of the company s products remained at lower levels compared to the prior year  tiou and acetyls prices  after reaching a low in the first quarter of  rose steadily through the end of the year as certain of the company s worldwide price increases for tiou and for acetyls principal products announced during were gradually realized 
specialty chemicals sales revenue for was lower than due to lower sales volume as the business remained under significant competitive pressure 
manufacturing costs decreased in as compared with due to productivity and reliability improvements  lower cost of natural gas and other purchased materials  and the realization of benefits from the company s cost saving initiatives  including the idling of its high cost sulfate process tiou plant in hawkins point  maryland at the end of the third quarter of both the titanium dioxide and related products and acetyls business segments benefited from lower unit production costs due to higher fixed cost absorption from higher production rates as a result of increased customer demand 
results for the acetyls business segment also improved in comparison to as unfavorable fixed price natural gas purchase positions entered into during the first quarter of expired at the end of the first quarter of these unfavorable contracts negatively impacted acetyls operating loss by million in the last three quarters of  while operating profit was reduced by only million 
specialty chemicals manufacturing costs for were higher than due in part to planned and unplanned production outages that increased unit production costs 
after a reduction of million or in  sd a costs were reduced in by an additional million or  excluding the reduction of reserves due to favorable resolution of environmental claims related to predecessor businesses reserved for in prior years 
the company continued to focus on its cost reduction initiatives and received a full year of benefit from its june reorganization and reduction in workforce 
the savings from these initiatives were partially offset by higher incentive compensation costs in the equity loss from equistar  excluding unusual items and goodwill amortization  included in the company s net loss was million in and million in higher polymer margins primarily due to lower raw material costs were more than offset by lower margins in the petrochemical segment primarily as a result of lower sales prices

lower selling prices million more than offset the favorable effects of lower manufacturing and other costs of sales million  lower s  d a expenses million and higher sales volume million 
net sales for decreased million or to billion 
average selling prices for were lower than for  decreasing sales revenue by million 
after reaching their lowest level in more than five years in the first quarter of  tiou prices rose steadily through the end of the year as announced price increases were gradually realized 
however  this increase in prices was not sufficient to raise the average price for to the prior year level 
average prices for were lower than in all three major tiou markets and in all major geographic regions globally 
this was partially offset by a increase in sales volume  which increased revenue by million 
tiou sales volume was higher than the prior year in all major geographic regions globally except central and south america 
sales volume was higher in the paint and coatings market and higher in the plastics market 
sales volume declined by in the paper market  which continued to be depressed in all major geographic regions except europe  due to poor economic conditions and the company s election to reduce its participation in the fine paper markets in light of unacceptably low margins 
the overall operating rate for the company s tiou plants in was compared to for the prior year 
production was increased due to increased market demand in the lower operating rate in was primarily due to curtailment of production at certain facilities in response to weak market demand in operating income was increased by million as a result of lower manufacturing and other cost of sales per metric ton in compared with the prior year 
overall tiou cost of sales per metric ton decreased in primarily due to lower production costs resulting from higher fixed cost absorption due to increased production  idling of the hawkins point plant  reduced controllable and fixed costs due to productivity and reliability improvements and cost saving initiatives  lower utility costs and lower distribution costs 
this was slightly offset by the unfavorable effect of translating local currency manufacturing costs into a weaker us dollar 
s  d a costs in decreased by million or compared to the company continued to focus on its cost reduction initiatives and received a full year of benefit from its june reorganization and reduction in workforce 
the savings from these initiatives were partially offset by higher incentive compensation costs in versus operating income for of million  excluding goodwill amortization and unusual items  decreased million or from the prior year 
the decrease was primarily due to lower sales volume million  lower selling prices million and higher manufacturing costs million  partially offset by lower s  d a expenses million 
net sales decreased to billion 
overall  sales volume was down and average selling prices were down from the prior year 
sales volume in was down compared to in all three major tiou markets paint and coatings   plastics   and paper  
tiou sales volume was also down in all major geographic regions globally 
in addition  tiou sales prices were down in all three major markets and in all major geographic regions globally 
for all of  global economic conditions restricted demand and fueled competitive pricing situations in all markets  most notably in paint and coatings and paper 
the united states and european paper markets suffered declining business conditions  adversely affecting tiou volume and price into these markets 
these economic and business conditions continued in the fourth quarter 
tiou sales volume and price in the fourth quarter of declined and  respectively  from the fourth quarter of operating income for the segment  excluding goodwill amortization  was million for the fourth quarter of compared to million in the third quarter of and million in the fourth quarter of the overall operating rate for the company s tiou plants in was compared to for the prior year 
production was curtailed in line with reduced market demand 
the company idled its  tpa hawkins point  maryland sulfate process plant and re rated its kemerton  australia  and ashtabula  ohio plants at the end of the third quarter of  reducing annual nameplate capacity from  to  metric tons 
the overall tiou cost per metric ton increased in productivity and reliability improvements  cost cutting initiatives  and the benefit of translating local currency manufacturing costs into a stronger us dollar were more than offset by lower fixed cost absorption due to decreased production and by increases in raw material costs compared to the prior year 
in  s  d a costs were million or lower than this significant reduction in s  d a costs was achieved through the company s cost saving initiatives  which included benefits from the company s reorganization  reduction in workforce  reduced external consultant fees  reduced employee bonuses and travel  and various other cost reductions 
acetyls millions net sales operating income loss  as reported reorganization and plant closure charges goodwill amortization operating income loss  excluding goodwill amortization and unusual items versus operating income in the acetyls business segment  excluding goodwill amortization and unusual items  for of million increased by million from an operating loss of million on a comparable basis in  primarily due to lower production costs million and higher sales volume million  partially offset by lower selling prices million and higher s  d a expenses million 
sales revenue for of million decreased million or compared to  primarily due to lower selling prices million across all product lines  partially offset by higher sales volume million 
overall  sales volume for increased from  driven primarily by strong acetic acid demand due to competitor outages and growth in the purified terephthalic acid business  for which acetic acid is a reaction medium 
average selling prices declined by in compared to due to high selling prices in the first half of  which were supported by high feedstock costs during that period 
during the second half of  prices began to decline and continued to decline until reaching a low early in the second quarter of price increases realized during the second  third and fourth quarters of were not sufficient to return revenue to levels  however  profitability on sales in was much improved due to lower costs 
the acetyls business segment benefited from lower feedstock costs and lower unit production costs as increased demand resulted in higher fixed cost absorption from higher production volume in additionally  unfavorable fixed price natural gas purchase positions entered into during the first quarter of  which negatively impacted acetyls operating loss by million in the last three quarters of  expired at the end of the first quarter of  negatively impacting operating profit by million  a net benefit in the effect of these contracts on cost of million 
s  d a costs for were million or higher than versus the acetyls business segment s operating loss  excluding goodwill amortization and unusual items  for was million  a decrease of million or from operating profit of million in the decrease was primarily due to higher production costs million  lower sales volume million and lower selling prices million  partially offset by lower s  d a expenses million 
net sales increased million to million  primarily due to higher prices and higher vam sales volume in the first half of the year compared to the operating loss  excluding goodwill amortization  in the fourth quarter of was million compared to breakeven results in the third quarter of and income of million in the fourth quarter of  as deteriorating business conditions over the course of impacted the acetyls business segment 
the high cost of natural gas compared to the prior year and lower fixed cost absorption due to decreased operating rates were the primary causes for decreased profits in the company did not enjoy the full benefit of lower natural gas prices in the last half of the year because of unfavorable fixed price purchase positions entered into during the first quarter of that negatively impacted operating loss by approximately million for the year

the company and millennium america guarantee the obligations under the credit agreement 
the credit agreement contains various restrictive covenants and requires that the company meet certain financial performance criteria 
the financial covenants in the credit agreement include a leverage ratio and an interest coverage ratio 
the leverage ratio is the ratio of total indebtedness to cumulative ebitda for the prior four fiscal quarters  each as defined 
the interest coverage ratio is the ratio of cumulative ebitda for the prior four fiscal quarters to net interest expense  for the same period  each as defined 
to permit the company to be in compliance  these covenants were amended in the fourth quarter of and again in the second quarter of this second amendment was conditioned upon consummation of the offering of million additional principal amount of the senior notes and retirement of the credit agreement debt described above 
under the covenants now in effect  the company is required to maintain a leverage ratio of no more than to for the fourth quarter of  to for the first quarter of  to for the second quarter of  to for the third and fourth quarters of  and to for january  and thereafter  and an interest coverage ratio of no less than to for the fourth quarter of  to for the first quarter of  to for the second  third and fourth quarters of  and to for january  and thereafter 
the covenants in the credit agreement also limit  among other things  the ability of the company and or certain subsidiaries of the company to i incur debt and issue preferred stock  ii create liens  iii engage in sale leaseback transactions  iv declare or pay dividends on  or purchase  the company s stock  v make restricted payments  vi engage in transactions with affiliates  vii sell assets  viii engage in mergers or acquisitions  ix engage in domestic accounts receivable securitization transactions  and x enter into restrictive agreements 
in the event the company sells certain assets as specified in the credit agreement  the term loans must be prepaid with a portion of the net cash proceeds of such sale 
the obligations under the credit agreement are collateralized by a pledge of of the stock of the company s existing and future domestic subsidiaries and of the stock of certain of the company s existing and future foreign subsidiaries  in both cases other than subsidiaries that hold immaterial assets as defined in the credit agreement  all the equity interests held by the company s subsidiaries in equistar and the la porte methanol company which pledges are limited to the right to receive distributions made by equistar and the la porte methanol company  respectively  and all present and future accounts receivable  intercompany indebtedness and inventory of the company s domestic subsidiaries  other than subsidiaries that hold immaterial assets 
the company was in compliance with all covenants under the credit agreement at december  compliance with these covenants is monitored frequently in order to assess the likelihood of continued compliance 
the company currently expects that it will be in compliance with these covenants at march  however  the company believes that it will not be in compliance with certain of these financial covenants at june   unless economic and business conditions improve significantly in the second quarter of accordingly  the company is seeking a waiver or amendment to the credit agreement  which it expects to obtain by june  the indenture governing the company s million aggregate principal amount of senior notes due november  and million aggregate principal amount of senior debentures due november  allows the company to grant security on loans of up to of consolidated net tangible assets cnta  as defined  of millennium america 
accordingly  based upon cnta and secured borrowing levels at december   any reduction in cnta below approximately billion would decrease the company s availability under the revolving loans by of any such reduction 
cnta was approximately billion at december  the senior notes were issued by millennium america and are guaranteed by the company 
the indenture under which the senior notes were issued contains certain covenants that limit  among other things  the ability of the company and or certain subsidiaries of the company to i incur additional debt  ii issue redeemable stock and preferred stock  iii create liens  iv redeem debt that is junior in right of payment to the senior notes  v sell or otherwise dispose of assets  including capital stock of subsidiaries  vi enter into arrangements that restrict dividends from subsidiaries  vii enter into mergers or consolidations  viii enter into transactions with affiliates  and ix enter into sale leaseback transactions 
in addition  this indenture contains a covenant that would prohibit the company from i paying dividends or making distributions on its common stock  ii repurchasing its common stock  and iii making other types of restricted payments  including certain types of investments  if such restricted payments would exceed a restricted payments basket 
the basket is reduced by the amount of each such restricted payment and is increased by i of the company s cumulative net income as defined in such indenture since july  or is reduced by of its cumulative net income if such amount is negative  ii the net cash proceeds from the sale by the company of its common stock to third parties  and  iii of any cash distributions received from equistar 
as of the filing of this annual report  after taking into consideration the million dividend declared in the first quarter of  the amount of the restricted payments basket is expected to be million 
the indenture also requires the calculation of a consolidated coverage ratio  defined as the ratio of the aggregate amount of ebitda  as defined  for the four most recent fiscal quarters to consolidated interest expense  as defined  for the four most recent fiscal quarters 
if this ratio were to cease to be greater than to to after june   there would be certain restrictions on the company s ability to incur additional indebtedness and the company s ability to pay dividends  repurchase capital stock or make certain other restricted payments would be limited 
however  if the senior notes were to receive investment grade credit ratings from both s p and moody s and meet certain other requirements as specified in the indenture  certain of these covenants would no longer apply 
the company is currently rated bb by s p and ba by moody s 
on march   s p lowered the company s credit rating from investment grade rating bbb to non investment grade rating bb with a negative outlook  reflecting s p s concern regarding the company s ability to generate the cash flow necessary to substantially improve its financial profile during a period of economic uncertainties and higher raw material costs 
moody s affirmed the company s non investment grade rating on june   but revised its ratings outlook to negative from stable  reflecting moody s concern over the company s cash flow performance in the fourth quarter of and the first quarter of at december   the company was in compliance with all covenants in the indentures governing the senior notes  senior notes and senior debentures

accordingly  transferred trade receivables that qualify as a sale  million outstanding at december   are removed from the company s consolidated balance sheet 
the company continues to carry its retained interest in a portion of the transferred assets that do not qualify as a sale  million at december   in trade receivables  net in its consolidated balance sheet at amounts that approximate net realizable value based upon the company s historical collection rate for these trade receivables

based on the current market value of these instruments  the company would not be required to place any funds on deposit with the counterparty to these transactions 
furthermore  the company will also provide a million letter of credit in accordance with a real estate lease 
obtaining this letter of credit will result in an equal reduction of availability under the revolving credit portion of the credit agreement 
environmental and litigation matters certain company subsidiaries have been named as defendants  prps  or both  in a number of environmental proceedings associated with waste disposal sites or facilities currently or previously owned  operated or used by the company s current or former subsidiaries or their predecessors  some of which are on the superfund national priorities list of the epa or similar state lists 
these proceedings seek cleanup costs  damages for personal injury or property damage  or both 
based upon third party technical reports  the projections of outside consultants or outside counsel  or both  the company has estimated its individual exposure at these sites to be between thousand and million 
in the most significant of these proceedings  a subsidiary is named as one of four prps at the kalamazoo river superfund site in michigan 
the site involves contamination of river sediments and floodplain soils with polychlorinated biphenyls 
originally commenced on december  in the united states district court for the western district of michigan as kelly v 
allied paper  inc et al  the matter was stayed and is being addressed under the comprehensive environmental response  compensation and liability act 
in october  the krsg  of which one of the company s subsidiaries is a member  submitted to the state of michigan a draft study  which evaluated a number of remedial options and recommended a remedy involving the stabilization of several miles of river bank and the long term monitoring of river sediments at a total collective cost of approximately million 
during  additional sampling activities were performed in discrete parts of the river 
at the end of  the epa took responsibility for the site at the request of the state 
while the state has submitted comments to the epa on the draft study  the epa has yet to similarly comment 
the company has estimated its liability at this site based upon the krsg s recommended remedy 
guidance as to how the epa will likely proceed with further evaluation and remediation  if required  at the kalamazoo site is expected by early at that time  the company s estimate of its liability will be reevaluated 
the company s ultimate liability for the kalamazoo site will depend on many factors that have not yet been determined  including the ultimate remedy selected by the epa  the number and financial viability of the other members of the krsg as well as of other prps outside the krsg  and the determination of the final allocation among the members of the krsg and other prps 
in addition  the company and various of its subsidiaries are defendants in a number of pending legal proceedings relating to present and former operations 
these include proceedings alleging injurious exposure of the plaintiffs to various chemicals and other materials on the premises of  or manufactured by  the company s current and former subsidiaries  cases alleging historic premises based exposure to asbestos containing materials at various worksites  and cases alleging personal injury  property damage and remediation costs associated with use of the lead pigment in paint 
typically  such proceedings involve claims made by many plaintiffs against many defendants in the chemical industry 
with respect to the non environmental legal proceedings referred to above  the company believes that it has valid defenses and intends to defend them vigorously 
however  litigation is subject to uncertainties and the company is unable to guarantee the outcome of these proceedings 
as discussed in more detail under critical accounting policies environmental liabilities and legal matters below  the company believes that the reasonably probable and estimable range of potential liability for such environmental and litigation contingencies collectively  which primarily relates to environmental remediation activities and other environmental proceedings  is between million and million and has accrued million as of december  the company has not accrued any liabilities for any lead based paint and lead pigment litigation 
the company expects that cash expenditures related to these potential liabilities will not be concentrated in any single year and  based on information currently available  the company does not expect the outcome of these proceedings  either individually or in the aggregate  will have a material adverse effect on the consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows of the company

inflation the financial statements are presented on a historical cost basis 
while the united states inflation rate has been modest for several years  the company operates in many international areas with both inflation and currency instability 
the ability to pass on inflation costs is an uncertainty due to general economic conditions and competitive situations 
foreign currency matters the functional currency of each of the company s non united states operations principally  the company s tiou operations in the united kingdom  france  brazil and australia is the local currency 
consolidated shareholders equity increased approximately million in and decreased approximately million and million in and  respectively  as a result of translating subsidiary financial statements into us dollars 
future events  which may significantly increase or decrease the risk of future movements in foreign currencies in which the company conducts business  cannot be predicted 
the company generates revenue from export sales and revenue from operations conducted outside the united states that may be denominated in currencies other than the relevant functional currency 
revenues earned outside the united states accounted for  and of total revenues in  and  respectively 
these revenues were denominated in us dollars as well as other currencies 
net foreign currency transactions aggregated gains of million in and losses of million and million in and  respectively 
derivative instruments and hedging activities as more fully described in note to the consolidated financial statements included in this annual report  the company is exposed to market risk  such as changes in currency exchange rates  interest rates and commodity pricing  and manages these exposures by selectively entering into derivative transactions pursuant to the company s policies for hedging practices

critical accounting policies the preparation of the company s financial statements requires management to apply generally accepted accounting principles to the company s specific circumstances and make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amount of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements  the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
the company considers the following accounting policies to be critical to the preparation of the company s financial statements environmental liabilities and legal matters the company periodically reviews matters associated with potential environmental obligations and legal matters brought against the company  its subsidiaries and predecessor companies and evaluates  accounts for  reports and discloses these matters in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for contingencies sfas no 

in order to make estimates of liabilities  the company s evaluation of and judgments about environmental obligations and legal matters are based upon the individual facts and circumstances relevant to the particular matters and include advice from legal counsel  if applicable 
the company establishes reserves by recording charges to its results of operations for loss contingencies that are considered probable the future event or events are likely to occur and for which the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated 
when a loss contingency is considered probable but the amount of loss can only be reasonably estimated within a range  the company records a reserve for the loss contingency at the low end of the range  at minimum  but also applies judgment as to whether any particular amount within the range is a better estimate than any other amount 
if an amount within the range is considered to be a better estimate of the loss  the company records this amount as its reserve for the loss contingency 
reserves are exclusive of claims against third parties  except where payment has been received or the amount of liability or contribution by such other parties  including insurance companies  has been agreed  and are not discounted 
loss contingencies that are not considered probable or that cannot be reasonably estimated are disclosed in the notes to the consolidated financial statements  either individually or in the aggregate  if there is a reasonable possibility that a loss may be incurred and if the amount of possible loss could have a significant impact on the company s consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
loss contingencies that are considered remote the chance of the future event or events occurring is slight are not typically disclosed unless the company believes the potential loss to be extremely significant to its consolidated financial position and results of operations 
certain company subsidiaries have been named as defendants  prps  or both  in a number of environmental proceedings associated with waste disposal sites or facilities currently or previously owned  operated or used by the company s current or former subsidiaries or their predecessors  some of which are on the superfund national priorities list of the epa or similar state lists 
these proceedings seek cleanup costs  damages for personal injury or property damage  or both

in the most significant of these proceedings  a subsidiary is named as one of four prps at the kalamazoo river superfund site in michigan

the company believes that the reasonably probable and estimable range of potential liability for environmental and other legal contingencies  collectively  but which primarily relates to environmental remediation activities and other environmental proceedings  is between million and million and has accrued million as of december  the company expects that cash expenditures related to these potential liabilities will be made over a number of years  and will not be concentrated in any single year 
this accrual also reflects the fact that certain company subsidiaries have contractual obligations to indemnify other parties against certain environmental and other liabilities 
for example  the company agreed as part of its demerger from hanson to indemnify hanson and certain of its subsidiaries against certain of such contractual indemnification obligations  and millennium petrochemicals agreed as part of the december  formation of equistar to indemnify equistar for certain liabilities related to the assets contributed by millennium petrochemicals to equistar in excess of million  which threshold was exceeded in the terms of these indemnification agreements do not limit the maximum potential future payments to the indemnified parties 
the maximum amount of future indemnification payments is dependent upon many factors and is not practicable to estimate 
due to the uncertainties involved  the company is unable to predict the outcome of lead based paint and lead pigment litigation  the number or nature of possible future claims and proceedings  or the effect that any legislation and or administrative regulations may have on the company or its subsidiaries 
in addition  management cannot reasonably estimate the scope or amount of the costs and potential liabilities related to such litigation  or any such legislation and regulations 
the company has not accrued any liabilities for such litigation 
however  based upon  among other things  the outcome of such litigation to date  including the dismissal of most of the over lawsuits brought in recent years  management does not currently believe that the costs or potential liabilities ultimately determined to be attributable to the company arising out of such litigation will have a material adverse effect on the consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows of the company

goodwill goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the net assets of acquired companies 
through december   goodwill was amortized using the straight line method over years in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles  and management evaluated goodwill for impairment based on the anticipated future cash flows attributable to its operations in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and long lived assets to be disposed of sfas no 

such expected cash flows  on an undiscounted basis  were compared to the carrying value of the tangible and intangible assets  and if impairment was indicated  the carrying value of goodwill was adjusted 
in the opinion of management  no impairment of goodwill existed at december  under sfas no 
on january   the company adopted sfas no 
 goodwill and intangible assets sfas no 
which applies to all goodwill and intangible assets acquired in a business combination 
under this new standard  all goodwill  including goodwill acquired before initial application of the standard  is not amortized but must be tested for impairment at least annually at the reporting unit level  as defined in the standard
