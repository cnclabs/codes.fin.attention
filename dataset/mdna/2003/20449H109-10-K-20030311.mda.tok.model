table of contents critical accounting policies the accounting principles followed by the company and the methods of applying these principles conform with united states generally accepted accounting principles and with general practices within the banking industry 
the company s critical accounting policies relate to the allowance for loan losses  the valuation of derivatives and other hedging instruments  the transfer of financial assets  the extinguishment of liabilities and the determination of when special purpose vehicles should be included in the consolidated balance sheets and consolidated statements of income 
these critical accounting policies require the use of estimates  assumptions and judgments which are based on information available as of the date of the financial statements 
accordingly  as this information changes  the financial statements could reflect the use of different estimates  assumptions and judgments 
certain determinations inherently have a greater reliance on the use of estimates  assumptions and judgments and as such have a greater possibility of producing results that could be materially different than originally reported 
management s evaluation process to determine the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses combines three factors which involve the use of estimates  assumptions and judgments historical loss experience derived from analytical models  current trends and economic conditions and reasonably foreseeable events 
because current economic conditions can change and future events are inherently difficult to predict  the anticipated amount of estimated loan losses  and therefore the adequacy of the allowance  could change 
management believes the allowance for loan losses is adequate and properly recorded in the financial statements 
in various segments of its business  the company uses derivative financial instruments to reduce exposure to changes in interest rates and market prices for financial instruments 
the application of the hedge accounting policy requires judgment in the assessment of hedge effectiveness  identification of similar hedged item groupings and measurement of changes in the fair value of hedged items 
the company believes that its techniques for addressing these judgmental areas are in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and are in line with industry practices in assessing hedge effectiveness 
however  if in the future the derivative financial instruments used by the company no longer qualify for hedge accounting treatment and  consequently  the change in fair value of hedged items could not be recognized in earnings  the impact on the consolidated results of operations and reported earnings could be significant 
management believes hedge effectiveness is evaluated properly in preparation of the financial statements 
all of the derivative financial instruments used by the company have active markets and indications of fair value can be readily obtained 
the company utilizes certain financing arrangements to meet its balance sheet management  funding  liquidity and market or credit risk management needs 
these financing arrangements are with separate legal entities  corporations  partnerships  or trusts  and are not consolidated in the company s balance sheet 
the majority of these activities are basic term or revolving securitization vehicles 
the company evaluates whether these entities should be consolidated by applying various generally accepted accounting principles and interpretations 
in determining whether the financing entity should be consolidated  the company considers whether the entity is a qualifying special purpose entity qspe as defined in sfas no 
 accounting for transfers and servicing of financial assets and extinguishment of liabilities 
for nonconsolidation  sfas no 
requires the financing entity to be legally isolated  bankruptcy remote and beyond the control of the seller 
management believes these financing entities which qualify as qspe s fulfill the nonconsolidation requirements specified in sfas no

table of contents investment securities the composition of the company s total investment securities portfolio reflects the company s investment strategy of maximizing portfolio yields commensurate with risk and liquidity considerations 
the primary objectives of the company s investment strategy are to maintain an appropriate level of liquidity and provide a tool to assist in controlling the company s interest rate sensitivity position while at the same time producing adequate levels of interest income 
the company s investment securities are classified into one of three categories based upon management s intent to hold the investment securities i trading account securities  ii investment securities held to maturity or iii investment securities available for sale 
investment securities held in a trading account are required to be reported at fair value  with unrealized gains and losses included in earnings 
investment securities designated to be held to maturity are reported at cost  adjusted for amortization of premiums and accretion of discounts  with such amortization and accretion being determined by the interest method 
the company has the ability  and it is management s intention  to hold such securities to maturity 
management of the maturity of the portfolio is necessary to provide liquidity and control interest rate risk 
investment securities available for sale are recorded at fair value 
increases and decreases in the net unrealized gain loss on the portfolio of investment securities available for sale are reflected as adjustments to the carrying value of the portfolio and  for the tax effected amounts  as adjustments to accumulated other comprehensive income  a separate component of shareholders equity 
fair values of trading account securities  investment securities held to maturity and investment securities available for sale are based primarily on quoted  or other independent  market prices 
if quoted market prices are not available  then fair values are estimated using pricing models  quoted prices of instruments with similar characteristics  or discounted cash flows 
fair values for trading account derivatives are estimated using pricing models 
interest earned on investment securities held to maturity  investment securities available for sale and trading account securities is included in interest income on the consolidated statements of income 
net gains and losses on the sale of investment securities available for sale  computed principally on the specific identification method  are shown separately in noninterest income on the consolidated statements of income 
for additional financial information regarding the company s investment securities  see note  investment securities held to maturity and investment securities available for sale  in the notes to consolidated financial statements

gross unrealized gains in the company s investment securities held to maturity portfolio at year end totaled million and gross unrealized losses totaled  at december   gross unrealized gains and losses in the investment securities available for sale portfolio were million and  respectively 
these gains and losses have been recognized through other comprehensive income 
for an analysis of unrealized gains and losses recognized in other comprehensive income  see note  comprehensive income  in the notes to consolidated financial statements 
total average investment securities  including both held to maturity and available for sale  decreased percent and increased percent during and  respectively 
the decrease in was primarily due to the sale and maturity of billion of securities  which was partially offset by the purchase of billion of securities 
the increase in was due in part to the purchase of billion of securities  which was

at december   given a basis point immediate and permanent parallel increase in rates  the expected average lives for mbs and cmos would be years 
similarly  given a basis point immediate and permanent parallel decrease in rates  the expected average lives for mbs and cmos would be and years  respectively 
the weighted average market prices as a percentage of par value for mbs and cmos at december   were and  respectively 
the market prices for mbs and cmos generally decline in a rising rate environment due to the resulting increase in average life  the below market yield on fixed rate securities and the impact of annual and life rate caps on adjustable rate securities

for additional information regarding the company s investment securities  see note  investment securities held to maturity and investment securities available for sale  in the notes to consolidated financial statements 
trading account securities securities carried in the company s trading account securities portfolio are primarily held for sale to institutional customers for their investment portfolios and generally are sold within thirty days of purchase 
interest rate floors and caps are sold to customers to protect themselves against interest rate fluctuation 
the primary purpose for using interest rate swaps in the trading account is to facilitate customer transactions 
the trading interest rate contract portfolio is actively managed and hedged with similar products to limit market value risk of the portfolio 
changes in the estimated fair value of contracts in the trading account along with the related interest settlements on the contracts are recorded in other noninterest income as trading account profits and commissions 
the volume of activity is directly related to general market conditions and reactions to the changing interest rate environment

table of contents deposits and borrowed funds deposits remain the company s primary source of funding earning asset growth 
average deposits totaled billion  a three percent increase over prior year levels 
the increase in deposits was primarily attributable to a percent increase in both savings deposits and noninterest bearing demand deposits offset partially by a percent decrease in time deposits 
the decrease in time deposits was due to a strategic decision  during the first six months of  designed to re channel higher yielding certificates of deposit into lower cost funding sources while focusing on the growth of noninterest bearing deposits and savings accounts 
as part of its overall funding strategy  the company focuses on the mix of deposits and  in particular  maintaining an appropriate level of transaction accounts as a percentage of total deposits 
during  average transaction accounts made up percent of total deposits  an increase over the prior two years 
average interest bearing deposits made up percent of total average interest bearing liabilities in  down from percent in and percent in the following table summarizes the maturities of certificates of deposit of  or more and other time deposits of  or more outstanding at december  maturities of time deposits certificates other time of deposit deposits over over   total in thousands three months or less over three through six months over six through twelve months over twelve months while the company continues to emphasize funding earning asset growth through internal deposit generation  average earning asset growth has exceeded deposit growth 
as a result  the company has relied more heavily on borrowed funds as a supplemental source of funding 
borrowed funds consist of federal home loan bank fhlb advances  subordinated debentures  guaranteed preferred beneficial interests in the company s junior subordinated deferrable interest debentures capital securities and short term borrowings  primarily in the form of federal funds purchased  securities sold under agreements to repurchase and other short term borrowings 
average borrowed funds increased million and billion in and  respectively 
included in other short term borrowings are trading account short sales and the commercial paper of the company 
for a discussion of interest rates and maturities of fhlb and other borrowings  refer to note  fhlb and other borrowings  and note  capital securities and preferred stock  in the notes to consolidated financial statements

table of contents liquidity management liquidity is the ability of the company to convert assets into cash or cash equivalents without significant loss and to raise additional funds by increasing liabilities 
liquidity management involves maintaining the company s ability to meet the day to day cash flow requirements of its customers  whether they are depositors wishing to withdraw funds or borrowers requiring funds to meet their credit needs 
without proper liquidity management  the company would not be able to perform the primary function of a financial intermediary and would  therefore  not be able to meet the needs of the communities it serves 
additionally  the parent company requires cash for various operating needs including dividends to shareholders  business combinations  capital injections to its subsidiaries  the servicing of debt  and the payment of general corporate expenses 
the primary source of liquidity for the parent company is dividends from the subsidiary banks 
at december   the subsidiary banks could have paid additional dividends to the parent company of approximately million while continuing to meet the capital requirements for well capitalized banks 
also  the company has access to various capital markets 
the company does not anticipate any liquidity requirements in the near future that it will not be able to meet 
asset and liability management functions not only serve to assure adequate liquidity in order to meet the needs of the company s customers  but also to maintain an appropriate balance between interest sensitive assets and interest sensitive liabilities so that the company can earn a return that meets the investment requirements of its shareholders 
daily monitoring of the sources and uses of funds is necessary to maintain an acceptable cash position that meets both requirements 
the asset portion of the balance sheet provides liquidity primarily through loan principal repayments  maturities of investment securities held to maturity and available for sale and  to a lesser extent  sales of investment securities available for sale and trading account securities 
other short term investments such as federal funds sold  securities purchased under agreements to resell and maturing interest bearing deposits with other banks  are additional sources of liquidity funding 
the liability portion of the balance sheet provides liquidity through various customers interest bearing and noninterest bearing deposit accounts 
federal funds purchased  securities sold under agreements to repurchase and other short term borrowings are additional sources of liquidity and  basically  represent the company s incremental borrowing capacity 
these sources of liquidity are short term in nature and are used as necessary to fund asset growth and meet short term liquidity needs 
during  the company funded the million of growth in interest earning assets and billion decrease in federal funds purchased and securities sold under agreements to repurchase through deposits and long term borrowed funds 
interest bearing deposits increased by billion  while noninterest bearing deposits increased by million  fhlb and other borrowings increased by million and guaranteed preferred beneficial interests in the company s junior subordinated deferrable interest debentures increased million 
for more information on the composition of the company s long term borrowings  refer to note  fhlb and other borrowings  and note  capital securities and preferred stock  in the notes to consolidated financial statements 
for additional information about possible liquidity uses  see note  commitments  contingencies and guarantees  in the notes to consolidated financial statements

commitments payments due by period less than more than total year years years years in thousands lines of credit standby letters of credit other contingent liabilities and commitments interest rate sensitivity management the company s net interest income  and the fair value of its financial instruments  are influenced by changes in the level of interest rates 
the company manages its exposure to fluctuations in interest rates through policies established by its asset liability committee alco 
the alco meets periodically and has responsibility for approving asset liability management policies  formulating and implementing strategies to improve balance sheet positioning and or earnings and reviewing the interest rate sensitivity of the company 
management utilizes an interest rate simulation model to estimate the sensitivity of the company s net interest income to changes in interest rates 
such estimates are based upon a number of assumptions for each scenario  including the level of balance sheet growth  deposit repricing characteristics and the rate of prepayments 

table of contents the estimated impact on the company s net interest income sensitivity over a one year time horizon at december  is shown below along with comparable prior year information 
such analysis assumes an immediate and sustained parallel shift in interest rates  a static balance sheet and the company s estimate of how interest bearing transaction accounts would reprice in each scenario 
net interest income sensitivity percentage increase decrease in interest income expense given immediate and sustained principal amount parallel interest rate shifts of earning assets  interest bearing down up liabilities basis points basis points in thousands december  assets which reprice in one year or less over one year liabilities which reprice in one year or less over one year total net interest income sensitivity december  assets which reprice in one year or less over one year liabilities which reprice in one year or less over one year total net interest income sensitivity as shown in the table above  the company s net interest income sensitivity from december  to december  went from liability sensitive to asset sensitive 
the change in sensitivity resulted largely from an increase in the proportion of variable rate loans  an extension in maturities of consumer certificates of deposit  a reduction in fixed rate securities and a termination of certain receive fixed swaps 
the alco policy is based on the same assumptions as the preceding table and provides that an immediate parallel basis point increase or decrease in interest rates should not reduce net interest income by more than six percent 
the company enters into various interest rate contracts not held in the trading account interest rate protection products to help manage the company s interest sensitivity 
such contracts generally have a fixed notional principal amount and include interest rate swaps and interest rate caps and floors 
interest rate swaps are contracts where the company typically receives or pays a fixed rate and a counterparty pays or receives a floating rate based on a specified index  generally the prime rate or the london interbank offered rate 
table of contents libor 
interest rate caps and floors purchased are contracts whereby the company receives  respectively  interest if the specified index rises above the cap rate or falls below the floor rate 
the interest rate risk factor in these contracts is considered in the company s interest rate risk management program

capital resources shareholders equity increased by million during and million during these increases are primarily due to increases in retained earnings and accumulated other comprehensive income  partially offset by treasury stock purchases 
dividends of million were declared on the parent company s common stock in  representing a nine percent increase over the annual dividend rate in was per common share  a nine percent increase over the dividend payout ratio was percent  percent and percent for  and  respectively 
the company intends to continue a dividend payout ratio that is competitive in the banking industry while maintaining an adequate level of retained earnings to support continued growth 
subsequent to year end  the parent company s board of directors approved a percent increase in the quarterly dividend rate  raising the annual dividend to an indicated per common share for this marked the nd consecutive year the company has increased its dividend 
a strong capital position  which is vital to the continued profitability of the company  also promotes depositor and investor confidence and provides a solid foundation for the future growth of the organization 
the company has satisfied its capital requirements principally through the retention of earnings 
the company s five year compound growth rate in shareholders equity of percent was achieved primarily through reinvested earnings 
during the third quarter of  the company announced that its board of directors authorized a share repurchase program allowing for the purchase of up to five percent  or approximately million shares  of the company s outstanding common stock 
through december   million shares had been repurchased at a cost of million 
approximately million of the total shares repurchased had been reissued for acquisitions and employee benefit plans 
at december   approximately  shares remained available for repurchase under this program 
on january   the company announced that its board of directors authorized an additional share repurchase program allowing for the purchase of up to another five percent  or approximately million shares  of the company s outstanding common stock 
the timing and amount of purchases under the programs is dependent upon the availability and alternative uses of capital  market conditions and other factors 
on april   the company s shareholders approved an increase in the common stock authorized to be issued from million shares to million shares 

table of contents the ratio of average common shareholders equity as a percentage of total average assets is one measure used to determine capital strength 
overall  the company s capital position remains strong as the ratio of average common shareholders equity to average assets for was percent compared to percent in and percent in in order to maintain this ratio at appropriate levels with continued growth in total average assets  a corresponding level of capital growth must be achieved 
the table below summarizes these and other key ratios for the company for each of the last three years 
return on equity and assets december return on average assets return on average equity dividend payout ratio average common shareholders equity to average assets ratio in addition to the capital ratios mentioned above  banking industry regulators have defined minimum regulatory capital ratios that the parent company and the subsidiary banks are required to maintain 
these risk based capital guidelines take into consideration risk factors  as defined by the banking industry regulators  associated with various categories of assets  both on and off of the balance sheet 
under the guidelines  capital strength is measured in two tiers that are used in conjunction with risk adjusted assets to determine the risk based capital ratios 
tier i capital is defined as common shareholders equity  excluding the net unrealized holding gain loss on available for sale securities except for net unrealized losses on marketable equity securities  plus perpetual preferred stock and the capital securities  minus goodwill and other disallowed intangible assets 
other disallowed intangibles represent intangible assets  other than goodwill  recorded after february  total qualifying capital is defined as tier i capital plus tier ii capital components  which include such items as qualifying allowance for loan losses and qualifying subordinated debt 
at december   the company s tier i capital and total qualifying capital totaled billion and billion  respectively 
the percentage ratios  as calculated under the guidelines  were percent and percent for tier i and total qualifying capital  respectively  at year end these ratios are well above the minimum requirements of four percent for tier i capital and eight percent for total qualifying capital 
tier i capital increased by million  or percent  in primarily as a result of the issuance of million of capital securities which qualify for regulatory capital and earnings retained by the company partially offset by the repurchase of treasury stock 
two other important indicators of capital adequacy in the banking industry are the leverage ratio and the tangible leverage ratio 
the leverage ratio is defined as tier i capital divided by total adjusted quarterly average assets 
average quarterly assets are adjusted by subtracting the average unrealized gain loss on available for sale securities except for net unrealized losses on marketable equity securities  period end goodwill and other disallowed intangibles 
the tangible leverage ratio is defined similarly  except  by definition  all other intangible assets not previously excluded are removed from both the numerator and denominator 
the company s leverage ratio was percent at year end and percent at year end  while its tangible leverage ratio was percent at year end and percent at year end 
table of contents the following table shows the calculation of capital ratios for the company for the last two years 
capital ratios december in thousands risk based capital tier i capital tangible tier i capital total qualifying capital assets net risk adjusted assets adjusted quarterly average assets adjusted tangible quarterly average assets ratios tier i capital total qualifying capital leverage tangible leverage the regulatory capital ratios of the subsidiary banks currently exceed the minimum ratios of percent leverage capital  percent tier i capital and percent total qualifying capital required in for well capitalized banks as defined by federal banking regulators 
the company continually monitors these ratios to ensure that the subsidiary banks exceed the guidelines

sunbelt was structured as a qualifying special purpose entity qspe  as defined by fasb sfas no 
 with a limited business purpose of purchasing highly rated investment grade debt securities from the company s trading account securities portfolio and financing its purchases through the issuance of p f rated commercial paper 
at december   all securities held by sunbelt were aaa aaa rated by at least two of the following nationally recognized statistical ratings organizations moody s investor service  standard poor s or fitch ratings

at december  and  receivables from sunbelt were million and million  respectively 
there were no outstanding payables to sunbelt at december  or the company  under agreements with sunbelt  may be required to purchase assets or provide alternative funding to the conduit in certain limited circumstances  including the conduit s inability to place commercial paper or a downgrade in the company s short term debt rating 
management believes if an event occurs  the company has the ability to provide funding without any material adverse effect 
the underlying assets are all highly rated  primarily variable rate and are eligible investments for compass bank

the following discussion of net interest income is presented on a taxable equivalent basis  unless otherwise noted  to facilitate performance comparisons among various taxable and tax exempt assets 
net interest income for increased percent over after increasing percent in over the increases in both and were due to the company s ability to increase earning assets through loan growth and its ability to manage down the rate paid on interest bearing liabilities 
the rate paid on interest bearing liabilities decreased basis points from to while the yield on earning assets decreased basis points over the same period 
the schedule on pages and provides detail regarding interest income  interest expense and net interest income due to changes in volumes and rates 
the yield on average earning assets decreased due to decreases in yields on all asset categories  including a basis point decrease in the yield on loans 
the decrease in yields was primarily attributable to the purchase  origination and repricing of interest earning assets at lower rates  as evidenced by the decrease in the federal funds target rate during the increase in average earning assets was due primarily to a billion increase in loans  partially offset by a million decrease in investment securities available for sale and a million decrease in investment securities held to maturity 
total interest expense decreased percent in due to a basis point decrease in the rate paid on interest bearing liabilities  partially offset by a percent increase in the average volume 
interest expense on interest bearing deposits decreased by percent as the result of a one percent decrease in the average volume and a basis point decrease in rate 
for borrowed funds  which represents interest bearing liabilities that are not classified as deposits  a percent decrease in interest expense on federal funds purchased was the result of a percent decrease in the average balance along with a basis point decrease in the rate paid 
similarly  an percent decrease in the average balance of securities sold under agreement to repurchase and a basis point decrease in the rate paid resulted in a percent decrease in interest expense in this category 
interest income in remained relatively flat with as a result of a percent increase in the volume of average earning assets  offset by a basis point decrease in the average interest rate earned 
the decrease in the yield on average earning assets was due to a decrease in yield in most categories of earning assets including an basis point decrease in the yield on loans and a basis point decrease on total investment securities 
this decrease in yield was primarily attributable to the repricing of interest earning assets at lower rates  as evidenced by the decrease in the fed funds target rate in total interest expense decreased percent in due to a percent increase in the average volume of interest bearing liabilities offset by a decrease of basis points on the rate paid for interest bearing liabilities 
interest expense on interest bearing deposits decreased by percent as the result of a percent decrease in the average volume and an basis point decrease in rate paid for these deposits 
for securities sold under agreements to repurchase  a percent increase in the average balance and a basis point decrease resulted in a percent decrease in interest expense in this category 
alternatively  a percent increase in interest expense on federal funds purchased was the result of a percent increase in the average balance partially offset by a basis point decrease in the rate paid 
net interest income is commonly evaluated in terms of average rates using the net yield and the interest rate spread 
the net yield on earning assets is computed by dividing fully taxable equivalent net interest income by average total earning assets  excluding market adjustments for investment securities available for sale and hedges 
this ratio represents the difference between the average yield returned on average earning assets and the average rate paid for all funds used to support those earning assets  including both interest bearing and noninterest bearing sources of funds 
the net yield increased basis points to percent in after increasing basis points to percent in the increase in was due to the basis point decrease in the rate paid on interest bearing liabilities that was only partially offset by a basis point decrease in the yield on average interest earning assets 
the increase in was due to the basis point 
table of contents decrease in the rate paid on interest bearing liabilities that was only partially offset by a basis point decrease in the yield on average interest earning assets 
the interest rate spread measures the difference between the average yield on earning assets and the average rate paid on interest bearing liabilities 
the interest rate spread eliminates the impact of noninterest bearing funds and gives a direct perspective on the effect of market interest rate movements 
during  the net interest rate spread increased basis points to percent from the spread of percent

table of contents provision for loan losses  net charge offs and allowance for loan losses the provision for loan losses is the annual cost of providing an allowance or reserve for estimated losses on loans 
the amount for each year is dependent upon many factors including loan growth  net charge offs  changes in the composition of the loan portfolio  delinquencies  management s assessment of loan portfolio quality  the value of collateral and general economic factors 
management monitors the entire loan portfolio  including loans acquired in business combinations  in an effort to identify problem loans so that risks in the portfolio can be identified on a timely basis and an appropriate allowance maintained 
loan review procedures  including loan grading  periodic credit re scoring and trend analysis of portfolio performance  are utilized by the company s loan review department in order to ensure that potential problem loans are identified early to lessen any potentially negative impact on the company s earnings 
management s involvement continues throughout the process and includes participation in the work out process and recovery activity 
these formalized procedures are monitored internally by the loan review department whose work is supplemented by regulatory agencies that provide an additional level of review on an annual basis 
such internal review procedures are quantified in ongoing reports to senior management and are used in determining whether such loans represent potential loss to the company 
the allowance for loan losses is established by risk group as follows large classified loans  nonaccrual loans and loans considered impaired are evaluated individually with specific reserves allocated based on management s review 
smaller nonaccrual and adversely classified loans are assigned a portion of the allowance based on loan grading 
smaller past due loans are assigned a portion of the allowance using a formula that is based on the severity of the delinquency 
the remainder of the portfolio is also allocated a portion of the allowance based on past loss experience and the economic conditions for the particular loan portfolio 
allocation weights are assigned based on the company s historical loan loss experience in each loan category  although a higher allocation weight may be used if current conditions indicate that loan losses may exceed historical experience 
additionally  a portion of the allowance is for inherent losses which probably exist as of the valuation date even though they may not have been identified by the objective processes used for the allocated portion of the allowance 
this portion of the allowance is particularly subjective and requires judgments based upon qualitative factors 
some of the factors considered are changes in credit concentrations  loan mix  changes in underwriting practices  including the extent of portfolios of acquired institutions  historical loss experience and the general economic environment in the company s markets 
while the total allowance is described as consisting of separate portions  these terms are primarily used to describe a process 
all portions are available to support inherent losses in the loan portfolio 
the allowance for loan losses at december   was million  or percent of loans  compared with million  or percent of loans  at december   and million  or percent of loans  at december  the increase in the allowance  for both and  was due to providing adequate coverage for loan growth and to increase the level of coverage based upon current economic conditions at the time 
as shown in the following table  net loan charge offs in were million  or percent of average loans  compared with million  or percent of average loans  in and million  or percent of average loans  in the increase in net charge offs during and was due to a return to historical levels consistent with current economic conditions 
management believes that the allowance for loan losses at december  is adequate given past experience and the underlying strength of the loan portfolio

table of contents when determining the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses  management considers changes in the size and character of the loan portfolio  changes in nonperforming and past due loans  historical loan loss experience  the existing risk of individual loans  concentrations of loans to specific borrowers or industries and current economic conditions 
the portion of the allowance that has not been identified by the company as related to specific loan categories has been allocated to the individual loan categories on a pro rata basis for purposes of the table below

it is the general policy of the company to stop accruing interest income and place the recognition of interest on a cash basis when any commercial  industrial or real estate loan is days or more past due as to principal or interest and or the ultimate collection of either is in doubt  unless collection of both principal and interest is assured by way of collateralization  guarantees or other security 
accrual of interest income on consumer loans is suspended when any payment of principal or interest  or both  is more than days delinquent 
credit card loans and the related accrued interest are charged off before the end of the month when the loan becomes days past due 
when a loan is placed on nonaccrual status  any interest previously accrued but not collected is reversed against current income unless the collateral for the loan is sufficient to cover the accrued interest or a guarantor assures payment of interest 
nonperforming assets at december   were million  an increase of million from year end nonperforming loans increased million from year end to million

consolidation of variable interest entities on january   fasb completed its redeliberations of the project related to the consolidation of variable interest entities which culminated with the issuance of fasb interpretation no 
fin  consolidation of variable interest entities 
fin states that if a business enterprise has a controlling 
table of contents financial interest in a variable interest entity  the assets  liabilities and results of the activities of the variable interest entity should be included in the consolidated financial statements of the business enterprise 
this interpretation explains how to identify variable interest entities and how an enterprise assesses its interests in a variable interest entity to decide whether to consolidate that entity 
fin also requires existing unconsolidated variable interest entities to be consolidated by their primary beneficiaries if the entities do not effectively disperse risks among parties involved 
variable interest entities that effectively disperse risks will not be consolidated unless a single party holds an interest or combination of interests that effectively recombines risks that were previously dispersed 
this interpretation applies immediately to variable interest entities created after january   and to variable interest entities in which an enterprise obtains an interest after that date 
it applies in the first fiscal year or interim period beginning after june   to variable interest entities in which an enterprise holds a variable interest that it acquired before february  this interpretation does not apply to securitization structures that are qualified special purpose entities qspe as defined within sfas no 
compass remaining securitization structures  as of december   met qspe standards  and therefore  will not be affected by adoption of this interpretation  as qspes are not included in the scope of fin impact of inflation and changing prices a bank s asset and liability structure is substantially different from that of an industrial company in that virtually all assets and liabilities of a bank are monetary in nature 
management believes the impact of inflation on financial results depends upon the company s ability to react to changes in interest rates and  by such reaction  reduce the inflationary impact on performance 
interest rates do not necessarily move in the same direction  or at the same magnitude  as the prices of other goods and services 
as discussed previously  management seeks to manage the relationship between interest sensitive assets and liabilities in order to protect against wide interest rate fluctuations  including those resulting from inflation 
various information shown elsewhere in this annual report on form k will assist in the understanding of how well the company is positioned to react to changing interest rates and inflationary trends 
in particular  the summary of net interest income  the maturity distributions  the compositions of the loan and securities portfolios  the data on the interest sensitivity of loans and deposits  and the information related to off balance sheet hedging activities discussed in note  off balance sheet activities  derivatives and hedging  in the notes to consolidated financial statements  should be considered
