critical accounting policies in december  the sec requested that all registrants include in their md a their most critical accounting policies  the judgments and uncertainties affecting the application of those policies  and the likelihood that materially different amounts would be reported under different conditions using different assumptions 
the sec indicated that a critical accounting policy is one which is both important to the portrayal of the company s financial condition and results and requires management s most difficult  subjective or complex judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
we believe that the following accounting policies fit this definition allowance for doubtful accounts the company has of its december  accounts receivable balance with two large customers see footnote of the financial statements set forth in item with the remaining balance among numerous customers  some of which are international 
accounts receivable balances are subject to credit risk 
management has reserved for expected credit losses  sales returns and allowances  and discounts based upon past experience as well as knowledge of current customer information 
we believe that our reserves are adequate 
it is possible  however  that the accuracy of our estimation process could be impacted by unforeseen circumstances 
we continuously review our reserve balance and refine the estimates to reflect any changes in circumstances 
inventory the company values inventory at the lower of cost or market 
inventory values are based upon standard costs which approximate historical costs 
management regularly reviews inventory quantities on hand and records a provision for excess or obsolete inventory based primarily on estimated product demand and other knowledge related to the inventory 
if demand for the company s products is significantly different than management s expectations  the reserve could be materially impacted 
changes to the reserves are included in cost of goods sold 
goodwill and other intangible assets the company adopted the provisions of sfas no 
effective january  goodwill and other long lived assets with indefinite useful lives are reviewed by management for impairment annually or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount may not be recoverable 
if indicators of impairment are present  the determination of the amount of impairment would be based on management s judgment as to the future operating cash flows to be generated from the assets throughout their estimable useful lives 
sfas no 
also requires that intangible assets with estimable useful lives be amortized over their respective estimated useful lives to their estimated residual values  and reviewed for impairment in accordance with sfas no 
contingencies the company and its subsidiaries from time to time are subject to various contingencies  including legal proceedings arising in the normal course of business 
management  with the assistance of external legal counsel  performs an analysis of current litigation and will record liabilities if a loss is probable and can be reasonably estimated 
the company believes the reserve is adequate  however it can not guarantee that costs will not be incurred in excess of current estimates

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risks relating to the company s operations result primarily from changes in interest rates and changes in foreign exchange rates 
from time to time  the company finances acquisitions  capital expenditures and its working capital needs with borrowings under a revolving credit facility 
due to the variable interest rate feature on the debt  the company is exposed to interest rate risk 
based on the company s average debt balance  a theoretical basis point increase in interest rates would have resulted in approximately and of additional interest expense in the years ended december  and  respectively 
in  the company did not carry significant borrowings under its credit facility and thus interest rate risk would have been immaterial 
sales of the company s products in a given foreign country can be affected by fluctuations in the exchange rate 
however  the company sells less than of its products outside the united states 
of these foreign sales  approximately are denominated in us dollars with the remaining approximately denominated in canadian dollars 
as a result  the company does not feel that foreign currency movements have a material impact on its financial statements 
the company does not use derivatives to manage its interest rate or foreign exchange rate risks
