general 
ufc is the result of the combination on february  the heritage merger of two montana based savings and loan holding companies heritage bancorporation heritage and united financial corp 
as it existed prior to the merger  old united 
although ufc was the surviving corporation  the merger was treated as a reverse merger for accounting purposes because the stockholders and management of heritage controlled the operation of ufc after the heritage merger 
using purchase accounting  the historical financial statements of ufc included in this report for periods preceding the heritage merger reflect only the operations of heritage  while the historical financial statements for periods after the heritage merger reflect combined operations

million from net interest income increased 
million or and the provision for loan losses decreased 
million  resulting in a total increase of million or in net interest income after provision for loan losses 
the majority of the 
million increase in non interest income was the result of the increase in gain on sale of loans generated by united s mortgage lending activities in salaries and commissions are the bulk of the 
million increase in non interest expense in united s net income  and more specifically its net interest income  for was also affected by the following two interest related events which occurred in december heritage bank incurred prepayment penalties when it repaid million in fhlb advances prior to their scheduled maturity dates in the form of interest expense on the repayments 
heritage bank also incurred a writedown of loan premium of 
million  which was also charged against net income in the form of interest expense 
net income was million in as compared to million in increased loan volumes in were the primary reason for increased interest income 
net interest income increased million  or  to million in from million in non interest income increased million  or  in compared to non interest expense increased million  or in as compared to net interest income 
like most financial institutions  the most significant component of united s earnings is net interest income  which is the difference between the interest earned on interest earning assets loans  investment securities  mortgage backed securities and other interest earning assets  and the interest paid on deposits and borrowings 
this amount  when divided by average interest earning assets  is referred to as the net interest margin and expressed as a percentage 
net interest income and net interest margin are affected by changes in interest rates  the volume and the mix of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities  and the level of non performing assets 
the difference between the yield on interest earning assets and the cost of interest bearing liabilities expressed as a percentage is referred to as the net interest rate spread

united s net interest income increased 
million to million in from million in  and increased million in from million in as illustrated in the preceding tables  the principal reason for the increase in net interest income from to  was a change in the rates on united s interest earning assets and liabilities 
interest income decreased million in as compared to decreased loan volumes  and more importantly decreased rates  represented million of this decrease 
decreases in rates on investment securities contributed to a further decrease of 
million 
the remaining 
million decrease in interest income came from lower rates on other interest earning assets 
the principal reason for the increase in net interest income from to was an increase in the volume of united s interest earning assets 
interest income increased million in as compared to increased loan volumes  offset by decreased rates  represented million of this increase 
decreases in volumes of investment securities and in rates partially offset the increases from loans receivable 
rates paid on deposits decreased dramatically from to and from to due to rate cuts by the frb 
the decreased interest income in was more than offset by the decreased interest expense resulting from decreases in deposit rates of million and borrowing rates of 
million for a total decrease of million in interest expense in decreases due to rates in were 
million in deposits and 
million in borrowings 
increased volumes in deposits offset the rate decreases somewhat for a net decrease of 
million in interest expense in compared with the 
million decrease in interest expense in and the million increase in interest income combined for a net interest income increase for united of million from million in to million in provision for loan loss 
united provided million for loan losses in compared to million in both and the slight decrease in the loan loss provision in reflects management s estimate of the improvement in loan quality during the provision for loan losses is determined by management as the amount to be added to the allowance for loan losses after net charge offs have been deducted to bring the allowance to a level which is considered adequate to absorb losses inherent in the loan portfolio in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america gaap 
future additions to united s allowance for loan losses and any change in the related ratio of the allowance for loan losses to non performing assets are dependent upon the performance and composition of united s loan portfolio  the economy  inflation  changes in real estate values and interest rates and the view of the regulatory authorities toward adequate reserve levels 
united has identified its most critical accounting policy to be that related to the allowance for loan losses 
united s allowance for loan losses methodology incorporates a variety of risk considerations in establishing an allowance for loan losses that management believes is appropriate 
risk factors include historical loss experience  delinquency and charge off trends  collateral values and an internal loan grading system adopted by the banks 
other factors include the general economic environment in united s markets and  in particular  the state of certain industries 
changes in any of the above factors could have a significant affect on the calculation of the allowance for loan losses in any given period 
non interest income 
in addition to net interest income  united generates significant non interest income from a range of retail banking services  including mortgage banking activities and service charges for deposit services 
non interest income increased by 
million  or  in to million compared to million in  primarily due to the continued increase in gain on sale of loans from the real estate production activity at the banks in non interest income increased million  or  in to million compared to million in this increase was directly the result of additional real estate loan production activity at the banks during non interest expense 
non interest expense increased 
million  or  to million in  and increased million  or  to million in salary and employee benefit expense increased 
million in largely from salary and bonus increases 
occupancy and equipment expenses increased 
million in salary and employee benefit expense represented 
million of the increase and was the result of additional staffing and salary increases for existing employees 
the remaining 
million increase in was primarily due to higher occupancy expense due in part to significantly higher utility costs in as well as additional costs at the new branch locations 
income taxes 
income tax expense increased 
million in both and  to million for and to million for the increase is consistent with the increase in income before taxes 
income tax expense averages approximately of income before income taxes

the banks had million and million of participation and purchased loans as of december  and  respectively 
heritage bank sells and retains servicing for a portion of its residential real estate loans to agencies of montana such as the montana board of investments and the montana board of housing 
heritage bank recognizes mortgage servicing rights as an asset regardless of whether the servicing rights are acquired or retained on loans originated and subsequently sold 
the mortgage servicing rights are assessed for impairment based on the fair value of the mortgage servicing rights 
in november  heritage bank entered into an agreement with an unrelated third party to sell all of its servicing rights associated with montana board of housing loans existing at november  which had outstanding principal balances of approximately million 
the sales price was of the outstanding principal balance at close of business november   or approximately  a gain on the sale of approximately 
million is included in other non interest income for the year ended december  at december   heritage bank had a receivable related to the sale of approximately 
million  which was collected in march the receivable is included in other assets in the consolidated statement of financial condition 
as of december  and  the carrying value of originated servicing rights was approximately 
million and 
million  respectively 
heritage bank s servicing portfolio as of december  was million and as of december  was million

united also recorded an unrealized gain in market values of approximately 
million in and a realized gain on sales of 
million 
united has identified its accounting method for securities available for sale to be a critical accounting policy 
securities available for sale are carried at fair value and unrealized gains and losses net of related tax effects are excluded from earnings and reported as a separate component of stockholders equity 
while fair values are determined per market quotes from independent brokers and not subject to management estimation  the carrying value of the securities is subject to market variations 
at december   and  the unrealized gain loss on securities available for sale to mark them to market was million  
million and 
million  respectively

cash and cash equivalents increased million during to million at december  from million at december  net cash used by operating activities  or net income adjusted for non cash items  was million in net cash provided by investing activities such as the net decrease in loans receivable and the net decrease in securities available for sale was million in net cash used in financing activities such as increases in deposits  net changes in borrowings and dividends paid to stockholders was million  for a net increase in cash and cash equivalents for of million 
other assets 
real estate and other personal property owned decreased 
million during to 
million at december  from 
million at december  the decrease resulted from the depreciation of real estate held for investment and a decrease in other personal property 
the balance held at december  is primarily a previous banking facility which united was required by its regulators to reclassify to real estate owned in at december  this facility had a net carrying value of 
million and is generating an annual cash flow from rental activities of approximately 
million 
premises and equipment increased million during due to the 
million construction addition to a building in great falls  montana for a new branch location opened in  and 
million in furniture and fixtures purchased for the branch 
a total of 
million was used to purchase a building and related land in libby  montana to upgrade the libby loan production office to a full service branch opening in purchases of other premises and equipment totaling 
million consisted of equipment and computer upgrades at the main facilities and various branch locations 
the purchases were offset by 
million in depreciation expense on existing premises and equipment 
at december   united had million of recorded goodwill which in accordance with its current accounting policies  is no longer amortized to expense during the year ended december   but rather is reviewed annually by management for any impairment writedown 
this accounting policy for goodwill is considered a critical one for united because of the significant accounting estimates made by management in assessing any potential impairment writedown 
such accounting estimates can be significant due to the possibility that future events affecting them may differ from management s current judgements 
see part iv  item notes to consolidated financial statements goodwill and other intangible assets 
deposits and borrowings 
united experienced a net increase in deposits of million or in as deposits grew to million in from million in the increase in deposits resulted from a combination of competitive rates on all deposit offerings  and united s commitment to community banking  both of which have attracted depositors 
lower interest rates offered on deposits in in part impacted the lower growth rate in deposits in compared to fhlb advances and securities sold under agreements to repurchase decreased million in to million from million in united was able to repay million in fhlb advances in and received proceeds of million on new fhlb advances  for a net decrease of million 
securities sold under agreement to repurchase increased million while line of credit borrowings and federal funds purchased had a net decrease of million

nonperforming assets 
when a borrower fails to make a scheduled payment on a loan and does not cure the delinquency within days  united s policy is to contact the borrower between the th and th day of delinquency to establish a repayment schedule 
if a loan is not current  or a realistic repayment schedule is not being followed by the th day of delinquency  united will generally proceed with legal action to foreclose the property after the loan has become contractually delinquent days 
loans contractually past due days are classified as nonperforming 
however  not all loans past due days automatically result in the non accrual of interest income 
if a days past due loan has adequate collateral  or is fha insured or va guaranteed  and management concludes that loss of principal and interest would likely not be realized  then interest income will continue to be accrued

adequate valuation allowances are required to be established for assets classified as substandard or doubtful in accordance with gaap 
if an asset is classified as a loss  the institution must either establish a specific valuation allowance equal to the amount classified as loss or charge off such amount

asset liability management 
united s earnings depend to a large extent on the level of its net interest income 
net interest income depends upon the difference referred to as interest rate spread between the yield on united s loan and investment portfolios and interest earning cash balances interest earning assets  and the rates paid on its deposits and borrowings interest bearing liabilities 
net interest income is further affected by the relative amounts of united s interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities 
in recent years  united s interest earning assets have exceeded interest bearing liabilities 
however  when interest earning assets decrease as a result of non accrual loans and investments in non interest earning assets  net interest income and interest rate spread also decrease and any continued decrease in the level of interest earning assets would generally result in a negative impact on earnings 
one of the primary objectives of united s management has been to restructure united s balance sheet to reduce its vulnerability to changes in interest rates interest rate risk 
savings institutions historically have suffered from a mismatch in the term to maturity of their assets and liabilities  with mortgage loan assets tending to be of a much longer term than deposits  the primary liabilities of savings institutions 
in periods of rising interest rates  this mismatch can render savings institutions vulnerable to increases in costs of funds deposits and borrowings that can outstrip increases in returns on longer term fixed rate loans and investments  resulting in a decrease in positive interest rate spread and lower earnings 
several strategies have been employed by united to minimize the mismatch of asset and liability maturities 
for the past several years  heritage bank has maintained a policy of selling the majority of newly originated long term to year maturity fixed rate mortgage loans to the secondary market 
these loans are sold at their outstanding principal balance  which is the prearranged contract purchase price  and therefore  no gain or loss is realized at sale 
united promotes the origination and retention of loans providing for periodic interest rate adjustments  shorter terms to maturity or balloon provisions 
united also emphasizes investment in adjustable rate or shorter term mortgage backed securities and other interest earning investments 
when maturities of loans increase  united offsets the increased interest rate risk with matching funds and maturities with fhlb borrowings 
the following tables provide information regarding the maturity of loans included in united s portfolio as of december  the amounts reflected in the following table give no effect to assumptions regarding loan prepayments or payoffs 
loans with variable rates of interest are classified as due when the loan principal balances are contractually due  not when the interest rate reprices

stockholders equity at december  was million  or of total assets  an increase of million from million  or of total assets  at december  at december   book value was per share 
the increase in stockholders equity is primarily due to net income of million for and an increase in net unrealized gain on securities available for sale of 
million 
these increases were offset by the payment of million in dividends on ufc s common stock 
liquidity and capital resources 
united s primary sources of funds are deposits  repurchase agreements  fhlb borrowings  proceeds from loan sales  and loan and mortgage backed securities repayments 
while maturities and scheduled amortization of loans and mortgage backed securities are a predictable source of funds  deposit flows and mortgage prepayments are greatly influenced by market interest rates  economic conditions and competition 
in a period of declining interest rates  it is anticipated that mortgage prepayments would increase 
as a result  these proceeds from mortgage prepayments generally would be invested in lower yielding loans or other investments which have the effect of reducing interest income 
in a period of rising interest rates  it is anticipated that mortgage prepayments would decrease and the proceeds from such prepayments generally would be invested in higher yielding loans or investment which would have the effect of increasing interest income 
united s liquidity  represented by cash and cash equivalents  is a result of its operations  investing and financing activities

during  and  investing activities were funded primarily by principal repayments on loans and securities available for sale  the maturity of securities available for sale  and the sales of loans and securities available for sale totaling million  million  and million  respectively 
the major sources of cash flows from financing activities are deposits into savings accounts and additional borrowings 
the major uses of cash flows from financing activities are withdrawals from savings accounts  payments on borrowings  purchases of common stock  and payment of dividends to stockholders 
for the years ended december    and the net increase decrease in cash flows from financing activities was million  million and million  respectively 
the banks most liquid assets are cash and cash in banks and highly liquid  short term investments 
the levels of these assets are dependent on the banks operating  financing  lending  and investing activities during any given period 
liquidity management of the banks is both a daily and long term function of united s management strategy 
excess funds are generally invested in fhlb overnight funds 
if the banks should require funds beyond their ability to generate them internally  additional sources of funds are available through the use of fhlb advances 
at december  the banks had outstanding borrowings of million which included million of fhlb advances  million of securities sold under agreements to repurchase and 
million of other borrowed money

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk 
market risk is the risk of loss in a financial instrument arising from adverse changes in market rates prices such as interest rates  foreign currency exchange rates  commodity prices and equity prices 
since united s earnings depend on its level of interest rate spread  its primary market risk exposure is interest rate risk irr 
interest rate risk 
united has established a formal irr policy  and the banks have an asset liability management committee alco and an investment committee  which meet at least quarterly to review and report on management s efforts to minimize irr 
several asset liability management strategies have been employed by united to minimize its exposure to irr 
these include selling most newly originated long term fixed rate mortgages  promoting the origination and retention of loans providing for periodic interest rate adjustments  shorter terms to maturity or balloon provisions  and investing in adjustable rate or shorter term mortgage backed securities and other interest earning investments 
the asset liability management committee utilizes an institutional funds management service detailed simulation model to quantify the estimated exposure of net interest income nii to sustained interest rate changes 
the model predicts the impact of changing interest rates on the interest income received and interest expense paid on assets and liabilities 
this sensitivity analysis is compared to alco policy limits which specify a maximum tolerance level for nii given a basis point bp rise or decline in interest rates 
the following summarizes the sensitivity analysis for the banks as of december   the most recent information available 
management believes there has been no material change in interest rate risk since december  for additional information  see management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations included herein in item heritage bank estimated increase decrease in net interest income bp bp days   days   years   years   valley bank estimated increase decrease in net interest income bp bp days   days   years   years   the preceding sensitivity analysis does not represent a forecast and should not be relied upon as being indicative of expected operating results 
these hypothetical estimates are based upon numerous assumptions  including the nature and timing of interest rate levels including yield curve shape  prepayments on loans and securities  deposit decay rates  pricing decisions on loans and deposits  reinvestment replacement of assets and liability cash flows and others 
sensitivity analysis does not reflect actions that united might take in responding to or anticipating changes in interest rates 
interest rate sensitivity of the economic value of equity 
mismatches of interest rate repricing between assets and liabilities create interest rate risk 
interest rate risk affects the market value of equity  also called the economic value of equity eve 
measurement of the eve is an attempt to establish a methodology to gauge the potential for the reduction of future earnings and stockholders equity resulting from both lower net interest income nii and lower eve caused by changes in market interest rates 
eve is the difference between united s depository portfolio value and its loans receivable portfolio value 
eve thus provides a leading indicator of future potential changes in both nii and stockholders equity 
heritage bank and valley bank have both established maximum percentage changes for eve at of total assets  given an basis point change in interest rates 
eve  as a percent to total assets  was as follows eritage bank valley bank percent to total assets not available heritage bank periodically reviews and makes changes to established limits for eve changes due to mergers and other market factors 
though valley bank was slightly over of assets in  management considers this to be within prudent standards and continues to monitor the ratio 
the eve calculation contains a significant number of assumptions  some of which are not always reliable 
management does not consider this to be a significant departure from policy 
the preceding sensitivity analysis does not represent a forecast and should not be relied upon as being indicative of expected operation results 
these hypothetical estimates are based upon numerous assumptions  including the nature and timing of interest rate levels including yield curve shape  prepayments on loans and securities  deposit decay rates  pricing decisions on loans and deposits  reinvestment replacement of assets and liability cash flows and others 
the eve analysis does not reflect actions that heritage bank or valley bank might take in responding to or anticipating changes in interest rates
