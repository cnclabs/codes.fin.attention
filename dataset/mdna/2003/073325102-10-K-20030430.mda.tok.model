item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
overview bea is the world s leading application infrastructure software provider 
our weblogic enterprise platform delivers a highly reliable  scalable software infrastructure for customers to bring new services to market quickly  to lower operational costs by automating processes  and to automate relationships with suppliers and distributors 
the bea weblogic enterprise platform consists of bea weblogic server  the world s leading jee application server  which includes security  management  development and deployment features  as well as support for web services protocols  bea weblogic integration  a standards based solution for application integration  business process management  business to business integration and web services  bea weblogic portal  an infrastructure for building and deploying robust personalized enterprise portals  bea weblogic workshop  an integrated development framework for jee applications and web services  bea jrockit jvm  a server centric java virtual machine jvm  and bea liquid data for weblogic  a solution for providing information integration and data aggregation from various sources in distributed computer systems 
our products are marketed and sold worldwide primarily through our direct sales force  and also through systems integrators sis  independent software vendors isvs and hardware vendors that are our partners and distributors 
our products have been adopted in a wide variety of industries  including telecommunications  commercial and investment banking  securities trading  government  manufacturing  retail  airlines  package delivery  pharmaceuticals and insurance 
the bea weblogic enterprise platform provides application infrastructure for building and deploying distributed  integrated information technology it environments  allowing customers to integrate private client server networks  the internet  intranets  extranets  virtual private networks  and mainframe and legacy systems as system components 
our products serve as a platform  integration tool or portal framework for applications such as billing  provisioning  customer service  electronic funds transfers  atm networks  securities trading and settlement  online banking  internet sales  inventory management  supply chain management  enterprise resource planning  scheduling and logistics  and hotel  airline and rental car reservations 
licenses for our products are typically priced on a per central processing unit basis  but we also offer licenses priced on other bases 
seasonality 
our first quarter sales are typically lower than sales in the immediately preceding fourth quarter because most of our customers begin a new fiscal year on january and it is common for capital expenditures to be lower in an organization s first quarter than in its fourth quarter 
our commission structure and other sales incentives also tend to result in fewer sales in the first quarter than the fourth quarter 
we anticipate that the negative impact of seasonality on our first quarter will continue 
investment in integration technologies 
in the spring of  we announced a new focus on developing products to address the integration market 
to address this market  we introduced bea weblogic integration in july  and a series of bea branded  sold and supported adapters in august bea also partners with complementary technology providers to supplement its integration solutions 
in addition  we continue to develop 
table of contents further integration technologies and features  both inside the weblogic integration product and in the other elements of the weblogic enterprise platform 
new versions of various bea products are in beta from time to time 
our strategy for the integration market is characterized by three approaches that we believe are different than how the market was previously being addressed i a standards based approach  built on the jee messaging and connectivity standards  in contrast to other vendors proprietary approaches  ii using the application server to provide essential capabilities and underlying services  such as scalability and transaction processing  in contrast to the messaging approaches offered by most other integration vendors  and iii providing web services support  business process management  business to business integration  application integration  information integration  development tools and a run time framework all in a single tightly integrated platform product  rather than providing them as separate products with separate tools and separate deployment frameworks 
some of our competitors in the integration market have recently announced a variety of initiatives similar to one or more of these approaches 
investment in developer programs 
our products are a platform for java application development and deployment  both packaged applications built and sold by isvs and custom applications built by our customers and si partners 
success in a platform market requires that a large number of developers are trained on and actively using our platform 
as a result  we have made a substantial investment in building programs to attract and retain java developers 
in addition  bea weblogic workshop is designed to allow developers who are not trained in java  such as developers who primarily use visual basic  power builder or cobol  to quickly and easily become productive in java and on the bea weblogic platform 
as a result  we are investing in programs to go beyond the current community of java developers and attract developers currently using non java platforms 
there can be no assurance that our investment in these programs will be successful 
acquisitions 
throughout our history  we have acquired product lines  development teams  distributors and companies to expand our business 
our strategy is to continue to grow our business through acquisitions 
our acquisition strategy is focused primarily on using cash or stock to purchase development teams or technologies to add features or products that complement or expand our products 
critical accounting policies and estimates our financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states  which require us to make estimates and judgments that significantly affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
we regularly evaluate these estimates  and believe that the following accounting policies are critical to understanding the company s historical and future performance  as these policies relate to the more significant areas involving our judgments and estimates revenue recognition  allowance for doubtful accounts  income taxes  facilities consolidation charges  intangible assets and considerations regarding our land lease 
we base these estimates and judgments on historical experience and on assumptions that are believed by management to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results may differ from these estimates  which may impact the carrying values of assets and liabilities 
our management has reviewed our critical accounting policies  our critical accounting estimates  and the related disclosures with our audit committee 
these policies  and our procedures related to these policies  are described in detail below 
in addition  please refer to note of the notes to consolidated financial statements for a further description of our accounting policies 
revenue recognition 
our revenue recognition policy is significant because our revenue is a key component of our results of operations 
we follow detailed guidelines discussed below and in note of the notes to our consolidated financial statements 
we recognize revenue in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles  which have been prescribed for the software industry 
the accounting rules related to revenue recognition are complex and are affected by interpretations of the rules and an understanding of industry practices  both of which are subject to change 
consequently  the revenue recognition accounting rules require management to make significant judgments 

table of contents for software license sales that do not require significant modification or customization of the underlying software  we recognize revenue when i there is evidence of an arrangement  ii we have delivered the products or performed the services  iii the payment is considered to be fixed or determinable and not subject to refund or adjustment and iv collection is probable 
the majority of our license revenues are recognized in this manner 
we do not record revenue on sales to customers whose ability to pay is in doubt at the time of sale 
rather  revenue is recognized from these customers as cash is collected 
the determination of a customer s ability to pay requires significant judgment  including an assessment of their financial condition  past payment history  business and industry outlook and other factors 
in addition  revenues in certain countries or regions where the collection risk is generally considered to be high  such as latin america  korea and china  are recognized on a cash basis 
the judgments that we make regarding collection risk for specific customers  countries or regions can materially impact the timing of recognition of revenues 
revenue arrangements with extended payment terms are generally considered not to be fixed or determinable and  accordingly  we do not generally recognize revenue on these arrangements until the customer payment becomes due 
the determination of whether extended payment terms are fixed or determinable requires significant judgment by management  including assessing such factors as the past payment history with the individual customer and evaluating the risk of concessions over an extended payment period 
the determinations that we make can materially impact the timing of recognition of revenues 
allowance for doubtful accounts 
we record allowances for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
we assess the credit worthiness of our customers based on multiple sources of information and analyze such factors as our historical bad debt experiences  industry and geographic concentrations of credit risk  current economic trends and changes in customer payment terms 
this assessment requires significant judgment 
if the financial condition of our customers were to worsen  additional allowances may be required  resulting in future operating losses that are not included in the allowance for doubtful accounts at january  to date  our actual credit losses have been within our expectations 
income taxes 
realization of our deferred tax assets is primarily dependent on future taxable income  the timing and amount of which are uncertain in part due to the potential impact of future stock option deductions 
accordingly  a valuation allowance  in an amount equal to the net deferred tax assets dependent upon future taxable income at january  and has been established to reflect these uncertainties 
as of january   the unrecognized deferred tax assets are primarily attributable to accumulated stock option tax deduction benefits 
accordingly  in the event that we were to determine that we would be able to realize our deferred tax assets in the future in excess of the recorded amount  an adjustment to the net deferred tax asset would be credited to additional paid in capital when realized  rather than taken as a reduction of income tax expense 
facilities consolidation charges 
in fiscal  we recorded a charge of million for our estimated future lease commitments on excess facilities  net of estimated future sublease income 
in determining the amount of the facilities consolidation charge  we estimated such factors as future vacancy rates  the time required to sublet properties  sublease rates and the willingness of landlords to negotiate termination fees 
these estimates are reviewed on a quarterly basis and would be revised if estimated future vacancy rates and sublease rates vary from our original estimates 
the remaining balance of accrued future lease commitments on excess facilities  net of estimated future sublease income  is approximately million as of january  to the extent that our new estimates vary adversely from our original estimates  we may incur additional losses that are not included in the accrued balance at january  conversely  unanticipated improvements in vacancy rates or sublease rates  or termination settlements for less than our accrued amounts  may result in a reversal of a portion of the accrued balance and a benefit on our statement of operations in a future period 
such reversals would be reflected as a credit to facilities consolidation charges 
the maximum future cost associated with these excess facilities  assuming that no future sublease income is realized on these properties  other than for subleases that have been executed prior to january   and assuming that the landlords are unwilling to negotiate early lease termination arrangements  is estimated to be approximately million  which exceeds the accrued balance at january  by million 

table of contents intangible assets and goodwill 
we record intangible assets when we acquire other companies 
the cost of an acquisition is allocated to the assets and liabilities acquired  including identified intangible assets  with the remaining amount being classified as goodwill 
certain intangible assets such as purchased technology and non compete agreements are amortized over time  while in process research and development is recorded as a one time charge on the acquisition date 
goodwill is not amortized but rather it is periodically assessed for impairment 
the allocation of the acquisition cost to intangible assets and goodwill therefore has a significant impact on our future operating results 
the allocation process requires the extensive use of estimates and assumptions  including estimates of future cash flows expected to be generated by the acquired assets 
further  when impairment indicators are identified with respect to previously recorded intangible assets  the values of the assets are determined using discounted future cash flow techniques  which are based on estimated future cash flows 
significant management judgment is required in the forecasting of future operating results which are used in the preparation of projected discounted cash flows and should different conditions prevail  material write downs of net intangible assets and of other long lived assets could occur 
we periodically review the estimated remaining useful lives of these assets 
a reduction in our estimate of remaining useful lives  if any  could result in increased amortization expense in future periods 
we test goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit level reporting unit at least annually on november of each year and more frequently if events merit 
we perform this test in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets fas 
we have determined that we have only one reporting segment and one reporting unit 
accordingly  goodwill is tested for impairment in a two step process 
firstly  we determine if the carrying amount of our reporting unit exceeds the fair value of the reporting unit based on quoted market prices of our common stock  which may initially indicate that goodwill could be impaired 
if we determine that such impairment could have occurred  we would compare the implied fair value of the goodwill as defined by fas to its carrying amount to determine the impairment loss  if any 
land lease 
we lease a parcel of land adjacent to our corporate headquarters in san jose  california under an operating lease arrangement that is commonly referred to as an off balance sheet or synthetic lease 
we plan to have corporate offices and research and development facilities constructed for us on the property 
the terms of the lease and the methods of accounting for the lease are described in detail below under liquidity and capital resources and in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
under the land lease  we are obligated for a residual value guarantee of approximately million at the end of the lease term 
if the fair value of the property at the end of the lease term is less than the residual value guarantee  we are obligated to pay any shortfall to the lessor 
we are required to periodically assess whether it is probable that a deficiency exists between the estimated fair value of the property at the end of the lease term and the residual value guarantee 
to the extent such a probable deficiency is determined to exist  we would expense the estimated deficiency over the remaining term of the lease 
the determination of whether such a probable deficiency exists is highly subjective and requires significant management judgment 
we estimate the fair value of the property at the end of the lease term by consulting with real estate industry sources and developing valuation models that incorporate numerous assumptions  including projected future office lease rates and occupancy rates in the san jose area  bea s future requirements for facilities in san jose  how the property will be developed  future economic conditions and growth rates  and historical trends in local property values 
our current assessment is that it is not probable that a deficiency under the residual value guarantee will exist at the end of the lease term 
this assessment is based on significant assumptions that could change adversely over time  resulting in material charges to future earnings of an amount up to the residual value guarantee of approximately million

the number of product transactions increased to approximately  in fiscal compared to  in fiscal  an increase in transaction volume of approximately percent 
the decrease in license revenues from fiscal to fiscal was primarily due to further reductions in it spending on a worldwide basis and the continued economic downturn 
many large enterprises implemented aggressive cost cutting measures  including reductions in it spending  in the second half of calendar  especially after the terrorist events of september  in the current economic and it spending environment  customer spending continues to be extremely cautious and it purchases are subject to rigorous internal review and approvals  resulting in some customers canceling or postponing it projects  postponing it purchases or placing smaller orders

customer support revenues consist of fees for annual maintenance contracts  which are recognized ratably over the term of the agreement generally one year 
customer support is typically priced as a percentage of license fees 
the significant increases in customer support revenues from fiscal to fiscal and from fiscal to fiscal were driven by maintenance renewals on our existing installed base of software licenses as well as new maintenance contracts sold together with new sales of software licenses 
consulting and education revenues decreased significantly from fiscal to fiscal and from fiscal to fiscal  as the economic slowdown and general reductions in it spending on a worldwide basis impacted our business 
in addition  we executed our strategy of having strategic partners provide consulting services related to the deployment and use of our software products  which began to impact our consulting and education revenues in late fiscal 
table of contents on february   the company adopted emerging issues task force eitf issue no 
income statement characterization of reimbursements received for out of pocket expenses incurred eitf 
eitf requires that certain out of pocket expenses that are charged to customers be recorded as service revenues  rather than as an offset to cost of services  which had been the company s prior practice 
the adoption of eitf had no impact on our gross margin  but it did cause both service revenues and cost of services to increase by approximately million for fiscal the adoption did not have a material impact on our financial position  results of operations or cash flows and  accordingly  we did not reclassify prior period results 
the reclassification of prior period results would have resulted in an immaterial increase in both service revenues and cost of service revenues

the amortization of acquired intangible assets consists of amortization of purchased technology  non compete agreements  customer base  patents and trademarks and distribution rights 
the decrease in amortization from fiscal to fiscal was primarily due to a portion of our acquired intangible assets becoming fully amortized in fiscal the decrease from fiscal to fiscal was primarily due a portion of our acquired intangible assets being written off in fiscal  offset by the amortization of acquired intangible assets that arose from a number of small acquisitions in the latter half of fiscal and during fiscal in the future  amortization expense associated with intangible assets recorded prior to january  is currently expected to total approximately million and million for the fiscal years ending january  and  respectively 
we periodically review the estimated remaining useful lives of our intangible assets

the increase in sales and marketing expenses from fiscal to fiscal was due to increased commissions paid to our sales force on our increased revenues  increases in marketing personnel and marketing programs to build brand awareness

amortization of goodwill decreased in fiscal from fiscal due primarily to the million write off of goodwill in the third quarter of fiscal commencing february   amortization of goodwill ceased in accordance with new accounting guidelines 
acquisition related charges 
in connection with the acquisition of the workflow automation corporation in the first quarter of fiscal  we acquired and expensed the cost of a number of research projects that were in process on the acquisition date  which amounted to million 

table of contents other charges facilities consolidation and severance charges 
during the third quarter of fiscal  we approved a plan to consolidate certain facilities in regions including the united states  canada  and germany 
a facilities consolidation charge of million was calculated using management s best estimates and was based upon the remaining future lease commitments and brokerage fees for vacant facilities from the date of facility consolidation  net of estimated future sublease income 
the facilities consolidation charge also included the write off of million of leasehold improvements 
the estimated costs of abandoning these leased facilities  including estimated costs to sublease  were based on market information and trend analyses  including information obtained from third party real estate industry sources 
as of january   million of lease termination costs  net of anticipated sublease income  remains accrued and is expected to be fully utilized by fiscal in calculating this charge  certain assumptions were made relating to such factors as the estimated time periods of vacancy and sublease rates and opportunities 
if actual circumstances prove to be materially worse than management has estimated  our total charges for these vacant facilities could be significantly higher 
additionally  during the fourth quarter of fiscal  we reduced the scope and re evaluated the timing of the planned construction of facilities at our san jose  california headquarters  resulting in an additional facilities related charge of million 
adjustments to the accrued facilities consolidation charge will be made in future periods  if necessary  based upon then current actual events and circumstances 
during the third and fourth quarters of fiscal  we reduced our workforce by approximately percent and  accordingly  we recorded total severance charges of million  of which million was paid in fiscal and million was paid in fiscal the employee reductions were across all business functions  operating units and major geographic regions

in the third quarter of fiscal  we recorded asset impairment charges totaling million against certain acquired intangible assets and goodwill  million of which was a write down of certain acquired intangible assets that is included in cost of revenues and million of which was a write down of goodwill that is included in operating expenses 
the acquired intangible assets and goodwill that were impaired primarily originated from the acquisitions of the theory center  inc theory center acquired in november and bauhaus technologies  inc bauhaus acquired in october during the third quarter of fiscal  we observed indicators that the acquired intangible assets and goodwill from the theory center and bauhaus were possibly impaired and  accordingly  performed an assessment for impairment under statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of 
with respect to the theory center  we made product and strategic changes during the third quarter that significantly decreased the 
table of contents importance and value of the technology acquired from the theory center  including the decision to discontinue the use of certain technology acquired from the theory center 
with respect to bauhaus  we observed a significant downturn in our consulting business during the third quarter of fiscal  and in particular the consulting business of bauhaus  which indicated possible impairment 
with the assistance of third party valuation experts  we performed asset impairment tests at the lowest operational level that had separately identifiable cash flows related to the theory center and bauhaus intangible assets and goodwill 
the tests were performed by comparing the expected undiscounted cash flows over a month period for the theory center and a month period for bauhaus to the carrying amounts of the long lived assets resulting from the acquisitions 
the conclusion of these tests was that the decline in value of the theory center and bauhaus intangible assets and goodwill was significant and other than temporary 
the impairment loss was measured as the amount by which the carrying values of such assets exceeded their fair values 
measurement of fair value was based on analyses of the discounted future cash flows at the theory center and bauhaus level 
in performing these analyses  we used the best information available under the circumstances  including assumptions and projections of future operating results that we consider to be both reasonable and supportable 
the discount rates used in the analyses were percent for the theory center and percent for bauhaus  which were based on historical risk premiums required by investors for companies of our size  industry and capital structure and included risk factors specific to the sectors in which the theory center and bauhaus operated 
the analyses indicated that the intangible assets and goodwill for the theory center were impaired by an amount totaling million and for bauhaus by an amount totaling million 
in addition  an impairment charge of million was recorded during the third quarter of fiscal  which related to the write off of goodwill associated with a small foreign sales operation that was disposed

accounting for income taxes fas  deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the difference between financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities and are measured using the enacted tax rates and laws that will be in effect when the differences are expected to reverse 
fas provides for the recognition of deferred tax assets if realization of such assets is more likely than not 
based upon the available evidence  which includes our historical levels of us operating earnings and stock option deductions  we have provided a valuation allowance against our net deferred tax assets to the extent that they are dependent upon future taxable income for realization 
we intend to evaluate the realizability of the deferred tax assets on a quarterly basis

the overall net positive impact of changes in certain operating assets and liabilities on total operating cash flow in fiscal was relatively small at approximately million 
accordingly  total operating cash flow of million for fiscal is primarily attributable to net income adjusted to exclude certain non cash items of approximately million 
net income adjusted to exclude certain non cash items was lower in fiscal than in  but total operating cash flow of million was higher in fiscal because the overall net positive impact of changes in certain operating assets and liabilities on total operating cash flow in fiscal was approximately million  compared to only approximately million in fiscal 
table of contents cash used in investing activities increased by million from million in fiscal to million in fiscal this increase was primarily due to an increase of million in net purchases of available for sale short term investments  as we executed our strategy during fiscal of holding investments with slightly longer maturities  which results in a greater portion of our cash resources being classified as short term investments 
this increase was partially offset by cash received from the repayment in fiscal of a note receivable of million from wp equity partners  inc  a related party see related party transactions below 
we also used million less cash in fiscal than in fiscal for purchases of property and equipment and million less cash for net payments for acquisitions and equity investments 
cash used in investing activities increased by million from million in fiscal to million in fiscal this increase was primarily due to an increase of million in net purchases of short term investments plus an increase in property and equipment purchases of million  offset by a decrease in cash used for acquisitions and other equity investments of million

as of january   our outstanding short and long term debt obligations were million  essentially the same as at january  at january   our outstanding obligations consisted of million of convertible notes and million of other obligations 
the million convertible subordinated notes due december  may be settled in cash or stock  depending upon future prices of our common stock see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements for a description of the terms of the convertible notes 
if  during the period from february  to december   the price of our common stock exceeds for at least trading days within a period of consecutive trading days  we have the option of redeeming the notes for shares of stock per  face value of the bond equivalent to a stock price of per share or cash plus a premium of up to  at the option of the bondholder 
for the period from december  to maturity on december   we have the option of redeeming the notes for shares of stock per  face value of the bond or cash plus a premium of up to  at the option of the bondholder  if the price of our common stock  as calculated above  exceeds 
if our stock price  as calculated above  does not exceed during the period from february  to december   and if the price does not exceed during the period from december  to december   then we will likely be required to repay the notes in cash on the maturity date of december  the following table of minimum contractual obligations has been prepared assuming that the convertible notes will be repaid in cash upon maturity in thousands payments due in minimum contractual obligations total payments due fiscal fiscal and fiscal and fiscal and thereafter convertible notes other obligations operating leases total contractual obligations the above table excludes obligations related to accounts payable and accrued liabilities incurred in the ordinary course of business and also excludes any amounts that could be payable under the land lease agreement pursuant to the residual value guarantee of approximately million  as explained in the following paragraph 

table of contents during the first quarter of fiscal  we entered into a lease agreement for the lease of approximately acres of land adjacent to our san jose  california headquarters the land lease and we plan to have constructed additional corporate offices and research and development facilities on the land 
this lease is commonly referred to as synthetic lease 
a synthetic lease represents a form of off balance sheet financing under which an unrelated third party funds the costs of the acquisition of the asset and leases the asset to a lessee bea  and at least percent of the third party funds represent at risk equity 
we have an option to renew the land lease agreement  purchase the land at the end of the lease term or earlier for the outstanding lease balance  or  to arrange for the sale of the land to a third party 
if we elect to renew the lease or arrange for the sale of the land  we are obligated to pay any shortfall between the fair value or sales price and the outstanding land lease balance under a residual value guarantee of approximately million 
under the land lease agreement  the lessor agreed to finance up to million of land and associated costs 
as of january   the outstanding lease balance was approximately million 
total minimum lease payments are estimated to be approximately million per year  and are included in the table above  commencing in fiscal through fiscal  and are based on the variable london interbank offering rate libor 
actual payments will fluctuate from time to time depending on changes in libor 
in the future  we may lengthen the land lease  have additional improvements built on the land  purchase the land under our purchase option  or arrange to sell the land  or parcels of the land 
if we determine to not pursue  completely or in part  the construction of additional corporate offices  this could result in a material charge to earnings 
under generally accepted accounting principles in the united states we are required to establish a liability for exposure  if any  under the residual value guarantee from the point such exposure is probable to the end of the lease by recording rent expense in excess of our cash rental payments 
the amount of the additional monthly rent expense equals the expected residual value guarantee exposure divided by the number of months remaining on the lease 
as of january   we believe that there has been no impairment in the fair value of the land that we lease under the synthetic lease wherein we believe that we would be required to pay any amount under the residual value guarantee 
we will continue to assess the fair value of the underlying property and the use of the property for impairment on an annual basis 
see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding the land lease 
as part of the land lease agreement  we must maintain a minimum restricted cash balance consisting of united states government securities as defined in the lease  which was million as of january  this amount represents collateral for specified obligations to the lessor under the lease 
the restricted cash cannot be withdrawn and is managed by a third party subject to certain limitations 
we have classified this amount as a long term restricted asset on our consolidated balance sheet at january  we also must maintain certain covenants  including liquidity  leverage and profitability ratios 
as of january   we were in compliance with all financial covenants of the land lease agreement 
in the event of a default  the lessor may demand payment equal to the lessor s outstanding lease balance  require us to purchase the land  facilitate the sale of the property or surrender the property 
if we chose to purchase the land  this could materially decrease our cash available for working capital  could make other sources of financing more difficult to obtain  and would require us to capitalize the land on our balance sheet 
no bea officers or employees have any direct financial interest with regards to the land lease agreement 
in september  the board of directors approved a share repurchase program for the company to repurchase up to million of its common stock the september share repurchase program 
an insignificant number of shares were repurchased in fiscal in fiscal  million shares were repurchased at a total cost of approximately million 
in february and march under the september share repurchase program  we repurchased an additional million shares at a total cost of approximately million 
in march  the board of directors approved an additional repurchase of up to million of our common stock 
our principal source of liquidity is our cash  cash equivalents and short term investments  as well as the cash flow that we generate from our operations 
the company s liquidity could be negatively impacted by a decrease in demand for the company s products  which are subject to rapid technological changes  or a reduction of capital expenditures by the company s customers as a result of a downturn in the global economy  among 
table of contents other factors 
we believe that our existing cash  cash equivalents  short term investments and cash generated from operations  if any  will be sufficient to satisfy our currently anticipated cash requirements through january  however  we may make acquisitions or license products and technologies complementary to our business or we may decide to purchase the land held under lease  and may need to raise additional capital through future debt or equity financing to the extent necessary to fund any such acquisitions  licenses  or purchase 
there can be no assurance that additional financing will be available  at all  or on terms favorable to us

no borrowings were outstanding under this secured line of credit at january  or in september  we issued an unsecured line of credit to alfred chuang  an executive officer of the company  in the amount of million 
no borrowings were outstanding under this line of credit at january  or loans to executives we have secured notes receivable from four other executives totaling approximately million and million at january  and  respectively  which are included in other long term assets 
these notes receivable originated prior to june  and are secured by real property

table of contents effect of new accounting pronouncements in june  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities fas 
fas addresses financial accounting and reporting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities and nullifies emerging issues task force eitf issue no 
 liability recognition for certain employee termination benefits and other costs to exit an activity including certain costs incurred in a restructuring and must be applied for exit or disposal activities that are initiated after december  fas requires that a liability for a cost associated with an exit or disposal activity be recognized and measured initially at fair value when the liability is incurred rather than when the exit or disposal plan is approved 
the adoption of fas did not have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations 
in november  the eitf reached a consensus on issue no 
 revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables 
eitf issue no 
provides guidance on how to account for arrangements that involve the delivery or performance of multiple products  services and or rights to use assets 
the provisions of eitf issue no 
will apply to revenue arrangements entered into in fiscal periods beginning after june  we are currently evaluating the effect that the adoption of eitf issue no 
will have on our results of operations and financial condition 
in november  the fasb issued interpretation no 
fin  guarantor s accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees  including indirect guarantees of indebtedness of others 
fin requires that a liability be recorded in the guarantor s balance sheet upon issuance of a guarantee 
in addition  fin requires disclosures about the guarantees that an entity has issued  including a reconciliation of changes in the entity s product warranty liabilities 
the initial recognition and initial measurement provisions of fin are applicable on a prospective basis to guarantees issued or modified after december  the disclosure requirements of fin are effective for financial statements of interim or annual periods ending after december  we have adopted the disclosure requirements for our financial statements included in this form k 
the provisions related to recognizing a liability at inception of the guarantee do not apply to product warranties or to indemnification provisions in our software license arrangements 
however  the accounting profession and regulatory agencies continue to discuss various provisions of this pronouncement with the objective of providing additional guidance on its application 
these discussions and the issuance of any new interpretations  once finalized  could lead to an unanticipated impact on our future financial results 
therefore  although we currently do not believe these provisions will have a material effect on our operating results or financial position  we will continue to evaluate the impact of fin the only significant guarantees issued to third parties by the company are the product warranty and indemnification provisions in our software license agreements and the residual value guarantee of approximately million  which is pursuant to our synthetic land lease transaction 
in december  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
fas  accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure an amendment of fasb statement no 
fas no 
amends fasb statement no 
fas  accounting for stock based compensation  to provide alternative methods of transition for an entity that voluntarily changes to the fair value based method of accounting for stock based employee compensation 
it also amends the disclosure provisions of that statement to require prominent disclosure about the effects on reported net income and earnings per share and the entity s accounting policy decisions with respect to stock based employee compensation 
certain of the disclosure requirements are required for all companies  regardless of whether the fair value method or intrinsic value method is used to account for stock based employee compensation arrangements 
we continue to account for our employee incentive stock option plans using the intrinsic value method in accordance with the recognition and measurement principles of accounting principles board opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees 
the amendments to fas will be effective for financial statements for fiscal years ended after december  and for interim periods beginning after december  accordingly  we adopted the disclosure provisions of this statement in our fourth quarter of fiscal year 
table of contents in january  the fasb issued interpretation no 
 consolidation of variable interest entities fin 
this interpretation of accounting research bulletin no 
 consolidated financial statements  addresses consolidation by business enterprises of variable interest entities 
under current practice  two enterprises generally have been included in consolidated financial statements because one enterprise controls the other through voting interests 
fin defines the concept of variable interests and requires existing unconsolidated variable interest entities to be consolidated by their primary beneficiaries if the entities do not effectively disperse risks among the parties involved 
this interpretation applies immediately to variable interest entities created after january  it applies in the first fiscal year or interim period beginning after june   to variable interest entities in which an enterprise holds a variable interest that it acquired before february  for these variable interest entities  the assets  liabilities and non controlling interest of the variable interest entity would be initially measured at their carrying amounts  with any difference between the net amount added to the balance sheet and any previously recognized interest being recognized as the cumulative effect of an accounting change 
if determining the carrying amounts is not practicable  fair value at the date fin first applies may be used to measure the assets  liabilities and non controlling interest of the variable interest entity 
if it is reasonably possible that an enterprise will consolidate or disclose information about a variable interest entity when fin becomes effective  the enterprise shall disclose information about those entities in all financial statements issued after january  the interpretation may be applied prospectively with a cumulative effect adjustment as of the date on which it is first applied or by restating previously issued financial statements for one or more years with a cumulative effect adjustment as of the beginning of the first year restated 
we are evaluating the impact of applying fin and have not yet completed this analysis 
we have not yet concluded whether the current land lease structure would be consolidated upon our adoption of fin because the rules are recent and contain numerous complicated provisions that the accounting profession continues to analyze 
the impact of consolidating the land held under lease at carrying value would be an increase to assets and liabilities of approximately million 
it is possible that the final determination under fin will be that the land must be capitalized on our balance sheet at current fair market value  which could be less than the outstanding lease balance in the near term 
this could result in a material charge to earnings  equal to the difference between the current fair market value of the property and the outstanding lease balance at the time such determination is made 
alternatively  we could elect to restructure the financing arrangement or exercise the purchase option  which could also result in us recording the land on our balance sheet at current fair market value  resulting in a material charge to earnings as described above 
risk factors that may impact future operating results we operate in a rapidly changing environment that involves numerous risks and uncertainties 
the following section lists some  but not all  of these risks and uncertainties  which may have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition or results of operations 
investors should carefully consider the following risk factors in evaluating an investment in our common stock 
significant unanticipated fluctuations in our actual or anticipated quarterly revenues and operating results may prevent us from meeting securities analysts or investors expectations and may result in a decline in our stock price although we have experienced significant annual revenue growth in recent years and our revenues grew in each of the quarters of fiscal  our revenues have historically fluctuated 
for example  in the quarters ended october  and april   our revenues declined as compared to the previous fiscal quarter  and in the quarters ended april  and july  our revenues declined as compared to the same quarterly periods in the prior fiscal year 
if our revenues  operating results  earnings or future projections are below the levels expected by investors or securities analysts  our stock price is likely to decline 
our stock price is also subject to the substantial volatility generally associated with internet  software and technology stocks and may also be affected by broader market trends unrelated to our performance  such as the substantial declines in the prices of many such stocks from march through the present 

table of contents we expect to experience significant fluctuations in our future quarterly revenues and operating results as a result of many factors  including on going adverse economic conditions  particularly within the technology industry  as well as economic uncertainties arising out of the recent us military activity in iraq  recent and possible future terrorist activities  and other potential military and security actions in the middle east  and geopolitical instability in markets such as korea and other parts of asia  all of which have increased the likelihood that customers will unexpectedly delay  cancel or reduce the size of orders  resulting in revenue shortfalls  difficulty predicting the size and timing of customer orders  changes in our competitors product offerings and pricing policies  and customer order deferrals in anticipation of new products and product enhancements from us or our competitors  any increased price sensitivity by our customers  particularly in the face of current adverse economic conditions and increased competition  introduction or enhancement of our products or our competitors products  the adverse impact of that the recent sars severe acute respiratory syndrome outbreak may have our worldwide business  particularly in asian countries such as china where the outbreak has been most widespread  our ability to develop  introduce and market new products on a timely basis and whether any new products are accepted in the market  our ability to further control costs and expenses  particularly in the face of the on going current adverse economic conditions  changes in the mix of products and services that we sell or the channels through which they are distributed  the performance of our international business  which accounts for a significant part of our consolidated revenues 
the degree of success  if any  of our strategy to further establish and expand our relationships with distributors  any slowdown in use of the internet for business or commerce  the structure  timing and integration of acquisitions of businesses  products and technologies  the terms and timing of financing activities  potential fluctuations in demand or prices of our products and services  the lengthy sales cycle for our products  technological changes in computer systems and environments  our ability to meet our customers service requirements  costs associated with acquisitions  including expenses charged for any impaired acquired intangible assets and goodwill  loss of key personnel  and fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates 

table of contents our quarterly revenues and operating results are difficult to forecast because of the composition and timing of our customer orders a material portion of our revenues has been derived from large orders  as major customers deployed our products 
increases in the dollar size of some individual license transactions increases the risk of fluctuation in future quarterly results because the unexpected loss of a small number of larger orders can create a significant revenue shortfall 
the majority of our revenue originates from a large number of small orders with the potential to turn into large deployments 
if we cannot generate a sufficient number of large customer orders  turn development orders into large deployments or if customers delay or cancel such orders in a particular quarter  it may have a material adverse effect on our revenues and  more significantly on a percentage basis  our net income or loss in that quarter 
moreover  we typically receive and fulfill most of our orders within the quarter  with a substantial portion of our orders typically received in the last month of each fiscal quarter 
as a result  we may not learn of revenue shortfalls until late in a fiscal quarter  after it is too late to adjust expenses for that quarter 
this is particularly relevant at this time because we have previously implemented significant cost cutting measures  thereby making incremental additional cost cutting more difficult to achieve 
moreover  on going adverse economic conditions worldwide  particularly those related to the technology industry and the economic and political uncertainties arising out of the recent us military activity in iraq  recent and possible future terrorist activities  other potential military and security actions in the middle east  and instability in markets such as korea and other parts of asia  all of which have increased the likelihood that customers will unexpectedly delay  cancel or reduce orders  resulting in revenue shortfalls 
in addition  the recent sars severe acute respiratory syndrome outbreak may have an adverse impact on our worldwide business  particularly in asian countries such as china where the outbreak has been most widespread  and canada 
in response to the sars outbreak  many of people have restricted their travel in the affected regions  which impedes our ability to conduct sales operations and other company functions in these areas 
if the outbreak were to continue or worsen  these adverse effects could grow  as well as possibly impact the economies of the affected countries overall  particularly china  thereby potentially adversely our sales 
the risk of delayed or cancelled orders is particularly relevant with respect to large customer orders  which are more likely to be cancelled  delayed or reduced and also have a greater financial impact on our operating results 
a number of technology companies  particularly software companies that  like us  sell enterprise wide software solutions  have announced in recent quarters that these conditions have adversely affected their financial results 
any revenue shortfall below our expectations could have an immediate and significant adverse effect on our results of operations 
if we do not effectively compete with new and existing competitors  our revenues and operating margins will decline the market for application server and integration software  and related software components and services  is highly competitive 
our competitors are diverse and offer a variety of solutions directed at various segments of this marketplace 
these competitors include operating system vendors such as ibm and sun microsystems and database vendors such as oracle 
in addition  microsoft has released products that include some application server functionality and has announced that it intends to include improved application server and integration functionality in future versions of its products 
in addition  certain application vendors  enterprise application integration vendors and other companies are developing or offering application server  enterprise application integration and portal software products and related services that directly compete with products that we offer 
further  software development tool vendors typically emphasize the broad versatility of their tool sets and  in some cases  offer complementary software that supports these tools and performs basic application server and integration functions 
these tool vendors offer products that may compete with some of the features of our own product offerings 
finally  internal development groups within prospective customers organizations may develop software and hardware systems that may substitute for those we offer 
a number of our competitors and potential competitors have longer operating histories  substantially greater financial  technical  marketing and other resources  greater name recognition and a larger installed base of customers than us 
some of our current principal competitors are also hardware vendors who bundle their own application server  integration software and tool products  or similar products  with their computer systems and database 
table of contents vendors that advocate client server networks driven by the database server 
ibm and sun microsystems are the primary hardware vendors who offer a line of application server and integration solutions for their customers 
ibm s sale of application server and integration functionality along with its proprietary hardware systems requires us to compete with ibm  particularly with regard to its installed customer base  where ibm has certain inherent advantages due to its much greater financial  technical  marketing and other resources  greater name recognition and the integration of its enterprise application server and integration functionality with its proprietary hardware and database systems 
these inherent advantages allow ibm to bundle  at a discounted price  application functionality with computer hardware  software and related service sales 
in addition  ibm global services  a division of ibm and a large provider of consulting and information technology services  can influence their service customers choice of software products in favor of ibm s 
due to these factors  if we do not sufficiently differentiate our products based on functionality  reliability  ease of development  interoperability with non ibm systems  performance  total cost of ownership and return on investment and establish our products as more effective solutions to customers technological and economic needs  our business  operating results  and financial condition will suffer 
microsoft has announced that it intends to include certain application server and integration functionality in its 
net initiative 
microsoft s 
net initiative is a proprietary programming environment that competes with the java based environment of our products 
a widespread acceptance of microsoft s 
net initiative  particularly among the large and mid sized enterprises from which most of our revenues are generated  could curtail the use of java and therefore adversely impact the sales of our products 
the 
net initiative and the bundling of competing functionality in versions of windows requires us to compete with microsoft  which has certain inherent advantages due to its much greater financial  technical  marketing and other resources  its greater name recognition  very large developer community  its substantial installed base and the integration of its broad product line and features into a web services environment 
we need to differentiate our products from microsoft s based on scalability  functionality  interoperability with non microsoft platforms  performance  total cost of ownership  return on investment  ease of development and reliability  and need to establish our products as more effective solutions to customers technological and economic needs 
we may not be able to successfully or sufficiently differentiate our products from those offered by microsoft  and microsoft s continued efforts in the application server  integration and web services markets and their proposed 
net alternative to java could materially adversely affect our business  operating results and financial condition 
in addition  current and potential competitors may make strategic acquisitions or establish cooperative relationships among themselves or with third parties  thereby increasing the ability of their products to address the needs of their current and prospective customers 
accordingly  it is possible that new competitors or alliances among current and new competitors may emerge and rapidly gain significant market share 
such competition could materially adversely affect our ability to sell additional software licenses and maintenance  consulting and support services on terms favorable to us 
further  competitive pressures could require us to reduce the price of our products and related services  which could materially adversely affect our business  operating results and financial condition 
we may not be able to compete successfully against current and future competitors and any failure to do so would have a material adverse effect upon our business  operating results and financial condition 
the recent us military activity in iraq and terrorist activities could adversely affect our revenues and operations the recent us military activity in iraq  recent terrorist activities  and related military and security operations  have significantly disrupted economic activity throughout the united states and much of the world 
this significantly adversely impacted our operations and our ability to generate revenues 
an unfavorable course of events related to the us military activity in iraq  any future terrorist activities or any other military or security operations  particularly with regard to the in the middle east involving iraq  and the geopolitical tension in korea could have a similar or worse effect on our operating results  particularly if such attacks or operations occur in the last month or weeks of our fiscal quarter or are significant enough to further weaken the us or global economy 
in particular  such activities and operations could result in reductions in information technology spending  deferrals  and reductions or cancellations of customer orders for our products and services 

table of contents our revenues are derived primarily from a single group of similar and related products and related services  and a decline in demand or prices for these products or services could substantially adversely affect our operating results we currently derive the majority of our license and service revenues from bea weblogic server  bea tuxedo and from related products and services 
we expect these products and services to continue to account for the majority of our revenues in the immediate future 
as a result  factors adversely affecting the pricing of or demand for bea weblogic server  bea tuxedo or related services  such as a continued or worsened general economic slowdown  future terrorist activities or military actions  competition  product performance or technological change  could have a material adverse effect on our business and consolidated results of operations and financial condition 
as we have increased our focus on using strategic partners to provide services related to the deployment and use of our software solutions  we previously experienced a slowdown in the growth of our services revenue  particularly revenue derived from our consulting services 
this trend could resume  particularly if the continued industry wide oversupply in software infrastructure consultants further increases the willingness and ability of our strategic partners to provide such services or if the current economic slowdown continues or worsens 
conversely if this trend were to reverse as in the quarter ended october  when we experienced an increase from the previous fiscal quarter in our consulting revenues it may adversely affect our overall operating margins since our consulting revenue margins are lower than our license revenue margins as well as our other services revenue margins 
in addition  as we introduce new versions of our main products  such as weblogic server  any delay or failure of these new versions to gain market acceptance among new and existing customers would have an adverse affect on our revenues and other operating results 
if we do not successfully develop and market our recently introduced new products  our revenues will be adversely affected we have recently introduced and updated our weblogic workshop tools product and related developer initiatives to help broaden the base of developers who can utilize our technologies and products 
if weblogic workshop and these related initiatives are not successful  or less successful than we anticipate  it will have an adverse impact on our sales of bea weblogic products  the principal driver of our revenue  and related products and services  as well as adversely affect our profit margins 
in addition  we are investing substantial and increased resources into further developing and marketing our weblogic integration products as well as continued significant investment in our weblogic liquid data products 
if any of these efforts are not successful  or less successful than we anticipate  due to such factors as technological problems  competition  market shifts or market acceptance  it will have an adverse impact on our sales and profit margins 
changes in accounting regulations and related interpretations and policies  particularly those related to revenue recognition  could cause us to defer recognition of revenue or recognize lower revenue and profits although we use standardized license agreements designed to meet current revenue recognition criteria under generally accepted accounting principles  we must often negotiate and revise terms and conditions of these standardized agreements  particularly in larger license transactions 
negotiation of mutually acceptable terms and conditions can extend the sales cycle and  in certain situations  may require us to defer recognition of revenue on the license 
while we believe that we are in compliance with statement of position  software revenue recognition  as amended  the american institute of certified public accountants continues to issue implementation guidelines for these standards and the accounting profession continues to discuss a wide range of potential interpretations 
additional implementation guidelines  and changes in interpretations of such guidelines  could lead to unanticipated changes in our current revenue accounting practices that could cause us to defer the recognition of revenue to future periods or to recognize lower revenue and profits 
moreover  policies  guidelines and interpretations related to revenue recognition  accounting for acquisitions  our operating lease for real estate in san jose  california  income taxes  facilities consolidation charges  allowances for doubtful accounts and other financial reporting matters require difficult judgments on 
table of contents complex matters that are often subject to multiple sources of authoritative guidance 
to the extent that management s judgment is incorrect  it could result in an adverse impact on the company s financial statements 
some of these matters are also among topics currently under reexamination by accounting standards setters and regulators  such as revenue recognition and our operating lease for real estate in san jose  california 
these standard setters and regulators could promulgate interpretations and guidance that could result in material and potentially adverse changes to our accounting policies 
in addition  there has been an ongoing public debate whether employee stock option and employee stock purchase plan shares should be measured at their fair value and treated as a compensation expense and  if so  how to properly value such charges 
if we were to elect or were required to record and expense for our stock based compensation plans using the fair value method  we could have significant compensation charges 
for example  in fiscal year  had we accounted for stock based compensation plans under fasb statement no 
 as amended by fasb statement no 
 diluted earnings per share would have been reduced by per share 
although we are currently not required to record any compensation expense using the fair value method in connection with option grants that have an exercise price at or above fair market value and for shares issued under our employee stock purchase plan  it is possible that future laws or regulations will require us to treat all stock based compensation as a compensation expense using the fair value method 
see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
the seasonality of our sales typically adversely affects our revenues in our first fiscal quarter our first quarter sales are typically lower than sales in the immediately preceding fourth quarter because most of our customers begin a new fiscal year on january and it is common for capital expenditures to be lower in an organization s first quarter than in its fourth quarter 
our commission structure also tends to result in lower sales in the first quarter than the fourth quarter 
we anticipate that the negative impact of seasonality on our first quarter will continue 
any failure to maintain on going sales through distribution channels could result in lower revenues to date  we have sold our products principally through our direct sales force  as well as through indirect sales channels  such as computer hardware companies  packaged application software developers  independent software vendors isvs  systems integrators sis and independent consultants  independent software tool vendors and distributors 
our ability to achieve revenue growth in the future will depend in large part on our success in maintaining existing relationships and further establishing and expanding relationships with distributors  isvs  original equipment manufacturers oems and sis 
in particular  we have an on going initiative to further establish and expand relationships with our distributors through these sales channels  especially isvs and sis 
a significant part of this initiative is to recruit and train a large number of consultants employed by sis and induce these sis to more broadly use our products in their consulting practices  as well as to embed our technology in products that our isv customers offer 
we intend to continue this initiative and to seek distribution arrangements with additional isvs to embed our weblogic server and other products in their products 
it is possible that we will not be able to successfully expand our distribution channels  secure agreements with additional sis and isvs on commercially reasonable terms or at all  and otherwise adequately continue to develop and maintain our relationships with indirect sales channels 
moreover  even if we succeed in these endeavors  it still may not increase our revenues 
in particular  we need to carefully monitor the development and scope of our indirect sales channels and create appropriate pricing  sales force compensation and other distribution parameters to help ensure these indirect channels do not conflict with or curtail our direct sales 
if we invest resources in these types of expansion and our overall revenues do not correspondingly increase  our business  results of operations and financial condition will be materially and adversely affected 
in addition  we already rely on formal and informal relationships with a number of consulting and systems integration firms to enhance our sales  support  service and marketing efforts  particularly with respect to implementation and support of our products as well as lead generation and assistance in the sales process 
we 
table of contents will need to expand our relationships with third parties in order to support license revenue growth 
many such firms have similar  and often more established  relationships with our principal competitors 
it is possible that these and other third parties will not provide the level and quality of service required to meet the needs of our customers  that we will not be able to maintain an effective  long term relationship with these third parties  and that these third parties will not successfully meet the needs of our customers 
we only recently reported net income  and could report a net loss again we only recently first reported significant net income under generally accepted accounting principles for the quarter ended july  however  despite this  we subsequently reported a net loss under generally accepted accounting principles for the quarter ended october  this was due in part to the asset impairment charges of million related to prior acquisitions 
we also implemented a planned consolidation of various facilities and a planned reduction in work force of approximately percent in the third and fourth quarters of our fiscal year ended january  and took charges of million and million  respectively  related to these actions 
because of such factors as our limited operating history and on going expenses associated with our prior acquisitions  the possibility of future impairment charges and the possibility of future charges related to any future facilities consolidation or work force reductions  we may again experience net losses in future periods 
if we are required to remit significant payroll taxes it will have an adverse impact on our future financial results when our employees exercise certain stock options  we are subject to employer payroll taxes on the difference between the price of our common stock on the date of exercise and the exercise price 
these payroll taxes are determined by the tax rates in effect in the employee s taxing jurisdiction and are treated as an expense in the period in which the exercise occurs 
during a particular period  these payroll taxes could be material  in particular if an increase in our stock price causes a significant number of employees to exercise their options 
however  because we are unable to predict our stock price  the number of exercises  or the country of exercise during any particular period  we cannot predict the amount  if any  of employer payroll tax expense that will be recorded in a future period or the impact on our future financial results 
the price of our common stock may fluctuate significantly the market price for our common stock may be affected by a number of factors  including developments in the internet  changes in the software or technology industry  general market and economic conditions  an unfavorable course of action related to the us military activity in iraq  further terrorist activities  other military actions in the middle east involving iraq  geopolitical instability in korea and other parts of asia and other factors  including factors unrelated to our operating performance or our competitors operating performance 
in addition  stock prices for bea and many other companies in the internet  technology and emerging growth sectors have experienced wide fluctuations including recent rapid rises and declines in their stock prices that often have not been directly related to the operating performance of such companies  such as the declines in the stock prices of many such companies from march through the present 
such factors and fluctuations  as well as general economic  political and market conditions  such as recessions  may materially adversely affect the market price of our common stock 
because the technological  market and industry conditions in our business can change very rapidly  if we do not successfully adapt our products to these changes our revenue and profits will be harmed the market for our products and services is highly fragmented  competitive with alternative computing architectures  and characterized by continuing technological developments  evolving and competing industry standards  and changing customer requirements 
the introduction of products embodying new technologies  the emergence of new industry standards or changes in customer requirements could render our existing products obsolete and unmarketable 
as a result  our success depends upon our ability to timely and effectively enhance 
table of contents existing products such as our weblogic server products and web services features  respond to changing customer requirements  and develop and introduce in a timely manner new products such as our weblogic integration  weblogic workshop  weblogic liquid data and weblogic portal products that keep pace with technological and market developments and emerging industry standards 
in addition  the widespread continued adoption of java technologies and standards is critical to driving sales of our products because they operate in a java based environment 
the widespread acceptance of microsoft s 
net initiative  which competes with java based environments and technologies  could curtail the use of java 
a decline in the ability or willingness of sun microsystems  inc  the creator and licensor of a substantial portion of the basic technologies and standards comprising java  to devote resources to promote and facilitate the adoption and further development of java technologies and standards  as well as to make these java technologies and standards available on sufficiently favorable terms  could also curtail the use of java by the software industry  including us 
if the rate of adoption of java technologies and standards were to slow or decline  and we were unable to successfully adapt our products to other technologies and standards  it would adversely affect the sales of our products and services 
it is possible that our products will not adequately address the changing needs of the marketplace and that we will not be successful in developing and marketing enhancements to our existing products or products incorporating new technology on a timely basis 
failure to develop and introduce new products  or enhancements to existing products  in a timely manner in response to changing market conditions or customer requirements  or lack of customer acceptance of our products  will materially and adversely affect our business  results of operations and financial condition 
in addition  our success is increasingly dependent on our strategic partners ability to successfully develop and integrate their software with the bea products with which it interoperates or is bundled  integrated or marketed 
if their software performs poorly  contains errors or defects or is otherwise unreliable  or does not provide the features and benefits expected or required  it could lower the demand for our solutions  result in negative publicity or loss of our reputation and our products and services and adversely affect our revenues and other operating results 
third parties could assert that our software products and services infringe their intellectual property rights  which could expose us to increased costs and litigation it is possible that third parties  including competitors  technology partners  and other technology companies  could successfully claim our current or future products  whether developed internally or acquired  infringe their rights  including their trade secret  copyright and patent rights 
any such claims  with or without merit  could cause costly litigation that could absorb significant management time  as well as impede our sales efforts due to any uncertainty as to the outcome  all of which could materially adversely affect our business  operating results and financial condition 
these types of claims could cause us to pay substantial damages or settlement amounts  cease offering of any subject technology or products altogether  require us to enter into royalty or license agreements  compel us to license software under unfavorable terms  and damage our ability to sell products due to any uncertainty generated as to intellectual property ownership 
if required  we may not be able to obtain such royalty or license agreements  or obtain them on terms acceptable to us  which could have a material adverse effect upon our business  operating results and financial condition  particularly if we are unable to ship key products 
if the markets for application servers  application integration and application component software and web services do not grow as quickly as we expect  our revenues will be harmed we sell our products and services in the application server  application integration and application component markets 
these markets are emerging and are characterized by continuing technological developments  evolving industry standards and changing customer requirements 
our success is dependent in large part on acceptance of our products by large customers with substantial legacy mainframe systems  customers establishing or building out their presence on the web for commerce  and developers of web based commerce applications 
our future financial performance will depend in large part on the continued growth in the use of the web to run software applications and continued growth in the number of companies extending their mainframe based  mission critical applications to an enterprise wide distributed computing environment 
table of contents and to the internet through the use of application server and integration technology 
the markets for application server and integration technology and related services may not grow and could decline 
even if they do grow they may grow more slowly than we anticipate  particularly in view of the recent economic downturn affecting the technology sector in the united states  asia and europe 
if these markets fail to grow  grow more slowly than we currently anticipate  or decline  our business  results of operations and financial condition will be adversely affected 
our international operations expose us to greater management  collections  currency  intellectual property  tax  regulatory and other risks revenues from markets outside of the americas accounted for percent  percent and percent of our total revenues in fiscal  and respectively 
we sell our products and services through a network of branches and subsidiaries located in countries worldwide 
in addition  we also market our products through distributors 
we believe that our success depends upon continued expansion of our international operations 
our international business is subject to a number of risks  including unexpected changes in regulatory practices and tariffs  greater difficulties in staffing and managing foreign operations  greater difficulties in maintaining us accounting standards  longer collection cycles  seasonality  potential changes in tax laws  greater difficulty in protecting intellectual property rights and the impact of fluctuating exchange rates between the us dollar and foreign currencies in markets where we do business 
in particular  we are periodically subject to tax audits by government agencies in foreign jurisdictions 
to date  the outcomes of these audits have not had a material impact on us 
it is possible  however  that future audits could result in significant assessments against us or our employees for transfer taxes  payroll taxes  income taxes  or other taxes as well as related employee and other claims which could adversely effect our operating results 
general economic and political conditions in these foreign markets  including the military action in the middle east and geopolitical instabilities in korea and other parts of asia  may also impact our international revenues  as such conditions may cause decreases in demand  or impact our ability to collect payment from our customers 
there can be no assurances that these factors and other factors will not have a material adverse effect on our future international revenues and consequently on our business and consolidated financial condition and results of operations 
if we cannot successfully integrate our past and future acquisitions  our revenues may decline and expenses may increase from our inception in january  we have made a substantial number of strategic acquisitions 
in connection with acquisitions completed prior to january   we recorded approximately million as intangible assets and goodwill of which approximately million has been amortized or written off as of january  in the third quarter of fiscal  we recorded asset impairment charges totaling million against certain acquired intangible assets and goodwill 
if future events cause additional impairment of any intangible assets acquired in our past or future acquisitions  we may have to record additional charges relating to such assets sooner than we expect which would cause our profits to decline 
in addition  integration of acquired companies  divisions and products involves the assimilation of potentially conflicting operations and products  which diverts the attention of our management team and may have a material adverse effect on our operating results in future quarters 
it is possible that we may not achieve any of the intended financial or strategic benefits of these transactions 
while we intend to make additional acquisitions in the future  there may not be suitable companies  divisions or products available for acquisition 
our acquisitions entail numerous risks  including the risk that we will not successfully assimilate the acquired operations and products  retain key employees of the acquired operations  or execute successfully the product development strategy driving the acquisition 
there are also risks relating to the diversion of our management s attention  and difficulties and uncertainties in our ability to maintain the key business relationships that the acquired entities have established 
in addition  we may have product liability or intellectual property liability associated with the sale of the acquired company s products 
acquisitions also expose us to the risk of claims by terminated employees  from shareholders of the acquired companies or other third parties related to the transaction 
finally  if we undertake future acquisitions  we may issue dilutive securities  assume or incur additional debt obligations  incur large one time expenses  utilize 
table of contents substantial portions of our cash  and acquire intangible assets that would result in significant future amortization expense 
any of these events could have a material adverse effect on our business  operating results and financial condition 
on june   the financial accounting standards board the fasb eliminated pooling of interests accounting for acquisitions 
the effect of this change could be to increase the portion of the purchase price for any future acquisitions that must be charged to bea s cost of revenues and operating expenses in the periods following any such acquisitions 
as a consequence  our results of operations in periods following any such acquisition could be materially adversely affected 
although these changes will not directly affect the purchase price for any of these acquisitions  they will have the effect of increasing the reported expenses associated with any of these acquisitions 
to that extent  these changes may make it more difficult for us to acquire other companies  product lines or technologies 
also on june   the fasb pronounced under statement of financial accounting standards no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets fas that purchased goodwill should not be amortized  but rather  it should be periodically reviewed for impairment 
such impairment could be caused by internal factors as well as external factors beyond our control 
the fasb has further determined that at the time goodwill is considered impaired an amount equal to the impairment loss should be charged as an operating expense in the statement of operations 
the timing of such an impairment if any of goodwill acquired in past and future transactions is uncertain and difficult to predict 
our results of operations in periods following any such impairment could be materially adversely affected 
we are required to determine whether goodwill and any assets acquired in past acquisitions have been impaired in accordance with fas and  if so  charge such impairment as an expense 
in the quarter ended october   we took an asset impairment charge of million related to past acquisitions 
we have remaining net goodwill and net acquired intangible assets of approximately million at january   so if we are required to take such additional impairment charges  the amounts could have a material adverse effect to our results of operations 
the lengthy sales cycle for our products makes our revenues susceptible to substantial fluctuations our customers typically use our products to implement large  sophisticated applications that are critical to their business  and their purchases are often part of their implementation of a distributed or web based computing environment 
customers evaluating our software products face complex decisions regarding alternative approaches to the integration of enterprise applications  competitive product offerings  rapidly changing software technologies and standards and limited internal resources due to other information systems requirements 
for these and other reasons  the sales cycle for our products is lengthy and is subject to delays or cancellation over which we have little or no control 
we have recently experienced an increase in the number of million and multi million dollar license transactions 
in some cases  this has resulted in more extended customer evaluation and procurement processes  which in turn have lengthened the overall sales cycle for our products 
the on going economic downturn in our key markets has also contributed to increasing the length of our sales cycle  and there is a risk that this will continue or worsen 
this delay or failure to complete large orders and sales in a particular quarter could significantly reduce revenue that quarter  as well as subsequent quarters over which revenue for the sale would likely be recognized 
if we fail to adequately protect our intellectual property rights  competitors may use our technology and trademarks  which could weaken our competitive position  reduce our revenues and increase our costs our success depends upon our proprietary technology 
we rely on a combination of patent  copyright  trademark and trade secret rights  confidentiality procedures and licensing arrangements to establish and protect our proprietary rights 
it is possible that other companies could successfully challenge the validity or scope of our patents and that our patents may not provide a competitive advantage to us 
as part of our confidentiality procedures  we generally enter into non disclosure agreements with our employees  distributors and corporate partners and into license agreements with respect to our software  documentation and other proprietary information 
despite these precautions  third parties could copy or otherwise obtain and use our products or technology without authorization  or develop similar technology independently 
in particular  we have  in the 
table of contents past  provided certain hardware oems with access to our source code  and any unauthorized publication or proliferation of this source code could materially adversely affect our business  operating results and financial condition 
it is difficult for us to police unauthorized use of our products  and although we are unable to determine the extent to which piracy of our software products exists  software piracy is a persistent problem 
effective protection of intellectual property rights is unavailable or limited in certain foreign countries 
the protection of our proprietary rights may not be adequate and our competitors could independently develop similar technology  duplicate our products  or design around patents and other intellectual property rights that we hold 
if we are unable to manage growth  our business will suffer we have experienced substantial growth since our inception in that has placed a strain on our administrative and operational infrastructure 
overall  we have increased the number of our employees from employees in three offices in the united states at january  to approximately  employees in offices in countries at january  our ability to manage our staff and growth effectively requires us to continue to improve our operational  financial  disclosure and management controls  reporting systems and procedures  and information technology infrastructure  particularly in light of the recent enactment of the sarbanes oxley act of and related regulations 
in this regard  we are continuing to update our management information systems to integrate financial and other reporting among our multiple domestic and foreign offices 
in addition  we may continue to increase our staff worldwide and continue to improve the financial reporting and controls for our global operations 
we are also continuing to develop and roll out information technology initiatives 
it is possible that we will not be able to successfully implement improvements to our management information  control systems  reporting systems and information technology infrastructure in an efficient or timely manner and that  during the course of this implementation  we could discover deficiencies in existing systems and controls  as well as past errors resulting therefrom 
if we are unable to manage growth effectively  our business  results of operations and financial condition will be materially adversely affected 
we have a real estate leasing structure  which could result in substantial charges to our consolidated statement of operations  a substantial increase in liabilities on our consolidated balance sheet and substantial cash payments in connection with a lease transaction for real estate in san jose  california that we entered into in the first quarter of fiscal for the construction of additional corporate offices  we have restricted approximately million out of our total cash  cash equivalents and investment securities as of january   as collateral for specified obligations to the lessor under the lease 
the investment securities are restricted as to withdrawal and are managed by a third party subject to a number of limitations 
commencing in fiscal  we are required under this real estate transaction to make annual lease payments of approximately million  which will fluctuate from time to time depending on short term interest rates 
during our quarter ended january   we re evaluated the scope and timing of our construction for additional corporate offices  which resulted in our recognizing a charge of million 
we continuously reevaluate the scope and timing of the construction project 
if we determine to not pursue  completely or in part  the construction  we may be required to recognize a material charge to earnings if the then current fair value of the land is less than our residual value guarantee of approximately million 
under the land lease agreement a third party lessor agreed to finance up to million of land and associated costs 
the land lease has an initial term of five years  and we have an option to renew the lease agreement  to purchase the land at any time during the lease for the outstanding lease balance or to arrange for the sale of the land to a third party 
if we elect to arrange for the sale of the land  we are obligated to pay any shortfall between the sales price and the outstanding lease balance under a residual value guarantee 
this payment could materially decrease our cash available for working capital and make other sources of financing more difficult to obtain 
if it became probable that the value of the leased land would be less than the outstanding lease balance at lease termination  the estimated deficiency would be expensed ratably over the remaining term 
table of contents of the lease which expires in our current assessment is that it is not probable that a deficiency will exist at the end of the lease term  however  we will continue to assess the fair value of the land to assess whether it is probable that a liability will be incurred under the residual value guarantee 
this type of assessment is highly subjective and involves a detailed understanding of such factors as the current real estate market conditions as well as future expectations for the market 
due to historical and expected volatility of the real estate market  there may be a time at which management is unable to reasonably estimate the fair value of the property at the end of the lease term or management may determine that it is probably that the fair value at lease termination will be less than the residual value guarantee of approximately million 
accordingly  we may be required to record a liability under our residual value guarantee related to the land lease at a future date  which may have a material adverse effect on our operating results 
in addition  if we choose to purchase the land or restructure the financing arrangement  for any reason  this could materially decrease our cash available for working capital  could make other sources of financing more difficult to obtain  and would require us to capitalize the land on our balance sheet 
it is possible under such a scenario that the land would be capitalized on our balance sheet at then current fair market value  which could be less than the outstanding lease balance in the near term 
this could result in a material charge to earnings  equal to the difference between the current fair market value of the property and the outstanding lease balance at the time such determination is made 
we have a high debt balance and large interest obligations  which constrict our liquidity and could result in substantial future expenses and adverse cash outflows at january   we had approximately million of convertible notes outstanding 
as a result of this indebtedness  we have substantial principal and interest payment obligations 
the degree to which we are leveraged could significantly harm our ability to obtain financing for working capital  acquisitions or other purposes and could make us more vulnerable to industry downturns and competitive pressures 
our ability to meet our debt service obligations will be dependent upon our future performance  which will be subject to financial  business and other factors affecting our operations  many of which are beyond our control 
we will require substantial amounts of cash to fund scheduled payments of interest on the convertible notes  payment of the principal amount of the convertible notes  payment of principal and interest on our other indebtedness  the lease payments discussed above  future capital expenditures  payments on our other leases and any increased working capital requirements 
to the extent our stock price does not  by december exceed per share or between december and december exceed for a requisite number of trading days to permit us to effectively force the conversion of the convertible notes  we will be required to pay up to million to repay our convertible notes in december if we are unable to meet our cash requirements out of cash flow from operations  there can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain alternative financing 
in the absence of such financing  our ability to respond to changing business and economic conditions  to make future acquisitions  to absorb adverse operating results or to fund capital expenditures or increased working capital requirements would be significantly reduced 
if we do not generate sufficient cash flow from operations to repay the notes at maturity  we could attempt to refinance the notes  however  no assurance can be given that such a refinancing would be available on terms acceptable to us  if at all 
any failure by us to satisfy our obligations with respect to the notes at maturity with respect to payments of principal or prior thereto with respect to payments of interest or required repurchases would constitute a default under the indenture and could also cause a default under agreements governing our other indebtedness 
if we lose key personnel or cannot hire enough qualified personnel  it will adversely affect our ability to manage our business  develop new products and increase revenue we believe our future success will depend upon our ability to attract and retain highly skilled personnel  including our chairman  chief executive officer and president  alfred chuang  and other key members of management 
competition for these types of employees is intense  and it is possible that we will not be able to 
table of contents retain our key employees and that we will not be successful in attracting  assimilating and retaining qualified candidates in the future 
as we seek to expand our global organization  the hiring of qualified sales  technical and support personnel will be difficult due to the limited number of qualified professionals 
failure to attract  assimilate and retain key personnel would have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
if our products contain software defects  it could harm our revenues and expose us to litigation the software products we offer are internally complex and  despite extensive testing and quality control  may contain errors or defects  especially when we first introduce them 
we may need to issue corrective releases of our software products to fix any defects or errors 
any defects or errors could also cause damage to our reputation and result in loss of revenues  product returns or order cancellations  or lack of market acceptance of our products 
accordingly  any defects or errors could have a material and adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
our license agreements with our customers typically contain provisions designed to limit our exposure to potential product liability claims 
it is possible  however  that the limitation of liability provisions contained in our license agreements may not be effective as a result of existing or future federal  state or local laws or ordinances or unfavorable judicial decisions 
although we have not experienced any product liability claims to date  sale and support of our products entails the risk of such claims  which could be substantial in light of customers use of such products in mission critical applications 
if a claimant brings a product liability claim against us  it could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
our products interoperate with many parts of complicated computer systems  such as mainframes  servers  personal computers  application software  databases  operating systems and data transformation software 
failure of any one of these parts could cause all or large parts of computer systems to fail 
in such circumstances  it may be difficult to determine which part failed  and it is likely that customers will bring a lawsuit against several suppliers 
even if our software is not at fault  we could suffer material expense and material diversion of management time in defending any such lawsuits 
we have adopted a preferred stock rights plan which has anti takeover effects we have implemented a preferred stock rights plan 
the plan has the anti takeover effect of causing substantial dilution to a person or group that attempts to acquire us on terms not approved by our board of directors 
the existence of the plan could limit the price that certain investors might be willing to pay in the future for shares of our common stock and could discourage  delay or prevent a merger or acquisition that a stockholder may consider favorable

quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk foreign exchange our revenues originating outside the americas were percent  percent and percent of total revenues in fiscal  and  respectively 
international revenues from each individual country outside of the united states were less than percent of total revenues in fiscal and the only individual country outside of the united states with revenues greater than percent of total revenues in fiscal was the united kingdom with million or percent 
international sales were made mostly from our foreign sales subsidiaries in the local countries and are typically denominated in the local currency of each country 
these subsidiaries also incur most of their expenses in the local currency 
accordingly  foreign subsidiaries use the local currency as their functional currency 
our international operations are subject to risks typical of an international business  including  but not limited to  differing economic conditions  changes in political climate  differing tax structures  other regulations 
table of contents and restrictions  and foreign exchange volatility 
accordingly  our future results could be materially adversely impacted by changes in these or other factors 
effective february   the we adopted the financial accounting standards board statement no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  which establishes accounting and reporting standards for derivative instruments  including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts and for hedging activities 
all derivatives  whether designated in hedging relationships or not  are required to be recorded on the balance sheet at fair value 
if the derivative is designated as a fair value hedge  the changes in the fair value of the derivative and of the hedged item attributable to the hedged risk are recognized in earnings 
if the derivative is designated as a cash flow hedge  the effective portions of changes in the fair value of the derivative are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income loss 
we use derivative instruments to manage certain exposures to foreign currency 
our objectives in holding derivatives are to minimize the risks using the most effective methods to eliminate or reduce the impacts of these exposures 
our exposure to foreign exchange rate fluctuations arises in part from intercompany accounts between our parent company in the united states and our foreign subsidiaries 
these intercompany accounts are typically denominated in the functional currency of the foreign subsidiary in order to centralize foreign exchange risk with our parent company in the united states 
we are also exposed to foreign exchange rate fluctuations as the financial results of foreign subsidiaries are translated into us dollars for consolidation purposes 
as exchange rates vary  these results  when translated  may vary from expectations and may adversely impact overall financial results 
we have a program to reduce the effect of foreign exchange gains and losses from recorded foreign currency denominated assets and liabilities 
this program involves the use of forward foreign exchange contracts in certain european  asian and latin and north american currencies 
a forward foreign exchange contract obligates us to exchange predetermined amounts of specified foreign currencies at specified exchange rates on specified dates or to make an equivalent us dollar payment equal to the value of such exchange 
under this program  foreign currency gains and losses due to exchange rate fluctuations are partially offset by gains and losses on the forward contracts 
we do not use foreign currency contracts for speculative or trading purposes 
all foreign currency transactions and all outstanding forward contracts are marked to market on a monthly basis with realized gains and losses included in interest income and other  net 
net losses resulting from foreign currency transactions were approximately  for fiscal our outstanding forward contracts as of january  are presented in the table below 
this table presents the net notional amount in us dollars using the spot exchange rate in january and the weighted average contractual foreign currency exchange rates 
notional weighted average exchange rates are quoted using market conventions where the currency is expressed in units per us dollar 
all of these forward contracts mature within days or less as of january  net sales of foreign currency are stated as a positive net notional amount and net purchases of foreign currency are stated as a negative net notional amount

we account for our investment instruments in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities fas 
all of the cash equivalents  short term investments and short term and long term restricted cash are treated as available for sale under fas investments in both fixed rate and floating rate interest earning instruments carry a degree of interest rate risk 
fixed rate securities may have their market value adversely impacted due to a rise in interest rates  while floating rate securities may produce less income than expected if interest rates fall 
due in part to these factors  our future investment income may fall short of expectations due to changes in interest rates or we may suffer losses in principal if forced to sell securities which have seen a decline in market value due to changes in interest rates 
however  we reduce our interest rate risk by investing our cash in instruments with remaining

the annual lease expense will fluctuate from time to time depending on changes in the london interbank offering rate libor 
a percent increase in libor will generate an increase in annual lease expense of approximately million 
we are also exposed to changes in short term interest rates through our invested balances of cash equivalents  restricted cash and short term investments  the yields on which will fluctuate with changes in short term interest rates 
the annual interest rate on our million convertible notes is fixed at percent through the maturity date in december a percent decrease in short term interest rates would result in an annual reduction of interest income of approximately million
