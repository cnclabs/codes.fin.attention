item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview we are committed to being the innovator and commercial leader in providing products for the diagnosis and treatment of patients with functional somatic syndromes  such as fibromyalgia syndrome  or fms  and other related chronic pain and central nervous system disorders 
our goal is to be the first to market a product approved in the united stated for the treatment of fms  the focus of our initial efforts in the area of functional somatic syndromes 
our business strategy is focused on combining novel technology and clinical development of well characterized drugs that we believe offer strong potential to help patients with functional somatic syndromes 
we licensed our first clinical candidate for the treatment of fms  milnacipran  in august of from pierre fabre 
we commenced a phase ii clinical trial in the first quarter of to evaluate milnacipran in the treatment of fms 
the phase ii trial was completed in the first quarter of  and we are in the process of completing a report to present the final results of the trial to the food and drug administration 
we have in the past evaluated various possible strategic transactions  including seeking a partner to assist us in the development and commercialization of milnacipran  potential acquisitions of products  technologies and companies  private and public financings and other alternatives that we believe may enhance stockholder value 
we expect to continue to do so in the future 
as of december   we had working capital of approximately million and an accumulated deficit of approximately million 
our future success depends on our ability to develop and market new products for the treatment of functional somatic syndromes  such as fms  and other related chronic pain and central nervous system disorders 
prior to december   we were engaged in the product development and marketing of the prosorba column  a medical device  which was marketed for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis and idiopathic thrombocytopenia purpura 
on january   we sold to fresenius hemocare  or fresenius  most of our assets related to the prosorba column  including the united states food and drug administration pre market approval and applications for the prosorba column 
fresenius is now solely responsible for all ongoing clinical trials  regulatory support  and the marketing and distribution of the prosorba column as discussed below 
on january   we restructured our agreement with fresenius  which provided fresenius with an exclusive license to distribute the prosorba column in the united states  europe and latin america and  subject to certain conditions  japan and select asian countries  referred to as the first restructured agreement 
pursuant to the terms of the first restructured agreement  fresenius assumed all of the sales  marketing and clinical efforts associated with the prosorba column worldwide 
we received an upfront payment of million  a portion of which reflected prepaid royalties on the sales of  prosorba columns in any year during the initial five years of the agreement 
the first restructured agreement eliminated certain profit sharing and expense sharing provisions  and we were entitled to receive additional royalties for any sales in excess of the  prosorba columns 
pursuant to the first restructured agreement  we also transferred to fresenius most of our assets associated with the prosorba column 

table of contents in light of lower sales than we and fresenius anticipated  we and fresenius determined to implement a different set of economic terms 
as a result  the agreement was further restructured on february   referred to as the second restructured agreement 
under the second restructured agreement  we agreed that the million upfront fee would cover all sales of the prosorba column in the initial seven year period commencing january and that it was nonrefundable under any circumstances 
we are not entitled to any additional royalty payments during the initial seven year period of the agreement 
in addition  whereas under the first restructured agreement  we were entitled to certain royalty payments on sales of the prosorba column after january  pursuant to the terms of the second restructured agreement  a contingent payment is due to us in the amount of million if sales during the first seven years exceed  units  million if they exceed  units and none if the sales are less than  units 
such payment  if any  will be due on january  and is nonrefundable prior to these modifications  we had accounted for the initial million payment as deferred revenue  and had amortized this amount on a straight line basis over five years  at the rate of  per quarter 
as a result of these modifications  we recognized the remaining deferred revenue  which amounted to million at december   as revenue in the first quarter of results of operations comparison of years ended december  and revenues revenues for the year ended december  totaled million compared to million for the year ended december  pursuant to the second restructured agreement with fresenius  the agreement was modified to clarify that the million upfront fee received under the first restructured agreement was not refundable under any circumstances and therefore  the entire million of remaining deferred revenue as of december  was recognized as revenue in the first quarter of revenues for consisted of the first year of amortization of the upfront payment 
for the year  this upfront payment was recognized as revenue on a straight line basis over a five year term  and we recognized  of revenue each quarter for a total of million in as a result of the modification to our agreement with fresenius reflected in the second restructured agreement  the and revenues are not comparable 
in addition  as a result of this modification  we will not recognize additional revenue  if any  under our agreement with fresenius until at the earliest  january   when we may receive a one time payment of million  million or no payment at all 
we currently do not have any other agreements pursuant to which we may receive any revenue 
research and development research and development expenses were million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the increase in research and development expenses for the year ended december  compared to the same period in was due to the costs associated with the commencement of the phase ii clinical trial for milnacipran  including expenses for clinical research organization and trial consultants  pre clinical research and the costs of clinical supplies for the phase ii trial 
additionally  we incurred costs related to a reformulation and new product agreement entered into with collegium pharmaceutical  inc in august  including an upfront payment as well as a project management fee 

table of contents general and administrative general and administrative expenses were million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the decrease in general and administrative expenses was primarily due to lower business development costs in compared to in  we experienced significant business development activity related to the execution of our license agreement with pierre fabre and our efforts to license other potential drug candidates for fms 
in  our efforts were primarily focused on our phase ii clinical trial for our licensed compound  milnacipran 
compensation expense variable stock options in june  we implemented an option cancel and re grant program  which resulted in variable accounting for the newly issued options under financial accounting standards board interpretation no 
fin  accounting for certain transaction involving stock compensation an interpretation of apb as a result  we recorded stock compensation expense totaling approximately  for the year ended december  during  the intrinsic value of the common stock underlying the options declined  which means that our stock price declined 
in accordance with fin  we reversed approximately  of the cumulative  charge 
we will continue to record similar non cash charges in future quarters to reflect the intrinsic value of the re granted options to purchase common stock  until each of the options held under the cancel and re grant program has been exercised or is terminated 
interest income interest income was approximately  and  for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the decrease in interest income was primarily due to lower rates offered for our cash investments 
interest expense interest expense was approximately  and  for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the decrease in interest expense of approximately  in compared to the same period in was due to lower outstanding debt in the remaining balance on a prior outstanding term loan was paid in full in july comparison of years ended december  and revenues revenues for the year ended december  totaled million compared to million for the year ended december  this decrease for is attributable to the restructuring of the agreement with fresenius in january pursuant to the first restructured agreement and the resulting change in the method of revenue recognition 
revenues for consisted of amortization of the upfront payment of million that we received under the first restructured amendment in january for the fiscal year  this upfront payment was recognized as revenue on a straight line basis over a five year term  at the rate of  per quarter 
the unamortized amount of the upfront payment was recorded as deferred revenue 
in contrast  revenue from the fresenius agreement for the year ended december  consisted of our pro rata share of prosorba column sales by fresenius as determined under the original fresenius agreement 
our pro rata share of prosorba column sales was determined as a total 
table of contents of allowable reimbursable expenses incurred by us for royalty  research and development  and sales and marketing expenses plus our share of any remaining net profit generated under the agreement 
our share of remaining net profit was calculated as the gross profit from prosorba column sales less reimbursed expenses incurred by us and fresenius 
as a result of the amendments to our agreement with fresenius and the related changes in the structure of our prosorba business  revenues for the years ended december  and are not directly comparable 
production costs production costs were and  for the years ended december  and  respectively 
in april  fresenius purchased our prosorba column manufacturing facility and related assets 
however  we remained responsible for paying royalties to certain third parties based on the sales of the prosorba column prior to january when we entered into the first restructured agreement 
therefore  production costs in represented royalties incurred by us for prosorba column sales payable to third parties 
no production costs were incurred in as we changed our business focus and no longer were engaged in the product development and marketing of the prosorba column 
sales and marketing sales and marketing costs were and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the decrease in sales and marketing costs for the year ended december  compared to the same period in reflects the transfer of the all sales and marketing responsibilities and costs related to the prosorba column to fresenius in january pursuant to the first restructured agreement 
during  we jointly marketed with fresenius the prosorba column in the united states 
research and development research and development expenses were million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the increase in research and development costs for the year ended december  compared to the same period in was primarily due to the following i a million licensing fee to pierre fabre for the licensing of milnacipran  ii the costs associated with filing the ind application with the fda filed in december of  iii the costs of launching our fms genomic research program  and iv implementation of a database for our physician and patient registries focused on patients with fms and physicians that treat patients with fms 
these cost increases were partially offset by the assumption of the research and development activities related to the prosorba column by fresenius 
all of the costs related to the prosorba column after january  are the obligation of fresenius 
the increase in research and development costs from the year to the year was due to a shift in our focus from maintenance of the prosorba column in the year to the licensing and development of milnacipran for the treatment of fms in the year general and administrative general and administrative expenses were million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the increase in general and administrative expenses of approximately million in from the same period in was primarily due to business 
table of contents development activity associated with the execution of our license agreement with pierre fabre and our efforts to license other product candidates for the treatment of the fms 
compensation expense variable stock options in connection with the option cancel and re grant program implemented in june  which resulted in variable accounting for the newly issued options under fin  we recorded stock compensation expense totaling approximately  for the year ended december  no such program existed in we will continue to record similar non cash charges in future quarters to reflect the intrinsic value of the re granted options to purchase common stock  until each of the options held under the cancel and re grant program has been exercised or is terminated 
interest income interest income was approximately  and  for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the decrease in interest income of approximately  in from the same period in was primarily due to lower interest rates offered for our cash investments and lower cash and cash equivalent balances maintained during interest expense interest expense was approximately  and  for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the decrease in interest expense of approximately  in compared to the same period in was due to a lower outstanding borrowing base in resulting from the repayment of the convertible debentures and repayment of the maturing portion of the term loan 
the remaining convertible debentures were due and repaid in full in march liquidity and capital resources our cash and cash equivalents and short term investments balance at december  totaled million compared to million at december  the net increase in cash and cash equivalents and short term investments was due to the net proceeds of approximately million from the private placement of our common stock and warrants to purchase our common stock completed in march  offset by cash used in operations of million for the year ended december  working capital at december  totaled million compared to a deficit of million at december  on august   we entered into a license agreement and a trademark agreement with pierre fabre 
the license agreement was amended and restated on november  the license agreement provides us with an exclusive license to develop and sell any products with the compound milnacipran as an active ingredient for the treatment of fms and related chronic pain syndromes in the united states and canada 
we also have an option to include other indications in these markets 
we paid pierre fabre upfront payments of million and additional payments to pierre fabre of up to a total of million will be due to pierre fabre based on meeting certain clinical and regulatory milestones 
if the product is commercialized  pierre fabre will manufacture the active ingredients used in the commercial product  and we will pay pierre fabre a transfer price and royalties based on net sales 
pierre fabre retains the right to sell products developed by us for fms and related chronic pain syndromes outside the united states and canada and will pay us a royalty based on net sales for such rights 

table of contents in august  we entered into a reformulation and new product agreement with collegium pharmaceutical  inc pursuant to which collegium will attempt to develop reformulations of milnacipran and new products that are analogs of milnacipran 
we paid collegium an upfront payment  which has been expensed pursuant to sfas no 
 accounting for research and development costs  as the ultimate commercialization of the products is uncertain and the technology has no alternative uses 
additionally  we paid a project management fee to collegium  and we agreed to pay their out of pocket expenses 
during a specified time period during the agreement  in the event we exercise our option to acquire an exclusive license to technology developed under this agreement  we would be obligated to pay collegium certain milestone payments  as well as potential royalty payments based on the net sales of reformulated or new products 
additionally  in october  we entered into a common stock issuance agreement with collegium  pursuant to which collegium may elect to be issued shares of our common stock  subject to certain conditions  in lieu of cash  for milestone payments 
based on our current business plan  we believe our cash and cash equivalents and short term investments balance at december  is sufficient to fund operations through the end of our expected primary cash needs on both a short term and long term basis are for clinical development of milnacipran  working capital and other general corporate purposes 
in order to successfully continue to develop milnacipran and acquire or develop additional products for the diagnosis and treatment of functional somatic syndromes  including fms  we will be required to raise additional capital 
the amount of capital we require is dependent upon many factors  including the following the costs associated with the research  development and potential commercialization of milnacipran  the costs of in licensing drug candidates for the treatment of functional somatic syndromes  the costs and results associated with the clinical trials designed for any new developed and or acquired product  results of our research and development efforts  the fda regulatory process  and the costs of commercialization of any future products 
because we are unable to predict the outcome of the foregoing factors  some of which are beyond our control  we are unable to estimate with certainty our mid to long term capital needs 
although we will seek to raise additional capital through equity or debt financings or through collaborations  we may not be able to raise additional capital through such sources and the funds we raise  if any  may not allow us to maintain our current and planned operations 
if we are unable to obtain additional capital  we will be required to delay  scale back or eliminate some or all of our planned research and development activities related to the development of milnacipran or any future additional product candidates 
contractual obligations and commercial commitments future minimum payments for all contractual obligations for years subsequent to december  are as follows total capital leases  including interest payments operating leases total other commercial commitments include certain potential milestone and royalty payments to pierre fabre and collegium discussed in the liquidity and capital resources section 

table of contents critical accounting policies and estimates our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to revenue recognition  technology licenses for research and development  stock based compensation and income taxes 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
management has discussed the development  selection and disclosure of these estimates with the audit committee of our board of directors 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following are some of the more critical accounting policies that affect the significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our financial statements see also the notes to our financial statements 
revenue recognition in accordance with staff accounting bulletin sab no 
 revenue recognition in financial statements  revenues are recognized when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred or services have been rendered  the price is fixed and determinable and collectibility is reasonably assured 
revenue is deferred for fees received before earned 
the only agreement pursuant to which we may receive revenue in the future is our agreement with fresenius 
under the terms of the first restructured agreement  we received million in january in exchange for granting a license to fresenius  which was royalty free for the first  units of sales for each of the first five years  and a royalty of per unit on sales exceeding  units in any year 
we were entitled to receive royalties on all unit sales after the fifth year 
we originally deferred the recognition of this payment over the initial prepaid period of five years 
in february  we and fresenius amended certain provisions of the license agreement in the form of the second restructured agreement 
under the second restructured agreement  the initial million payment received in january was made nonrefundable under any circumstances 
the second restructured agreement also eliminated the payment of royalties on prosorba column sales in excess of  in the first five years of the agreement and eliminated all royalties on prosorba column sales beyond five years 
a contingent nonrefundable payment is due to us on january  in the amount of million if sales during the first seven years exceed  units  and million if they exceed  units 
we will not receive any payment if the sales are less than  units 
as a result of this amendment  we recognized the remaining deferred revenue  which amounted to million as of december   as revenue during the first quarter of technology licenses for research and development we expense research and development costs as they are incurred pursuant to sfas no 
 accounting for research and development costs  as the ultimate commercialization of the related products is uncertain and the technology has no alternative uses 
we currently have agreements with pierre fabre and collegium pursuant to which we have made certain payments and are obligated under certain circumstances to make additional payments 
in connection with our agreement with pierre fabre  we paid upfront fees of million and are also obligated to make additional payments based on meeting certain clinical and regulatory milestones 
the total payments to date of million   of which was paid as of december  and the remaining  was accrued as of december  and paid in the first quarter of  have been expensed pursuant to sfas no 
if the drug is 
table of contents commercialized  we will pay pierre fabre a transfer price and royalties based on net sales 
pierre fabre retains the right to sell products developed by us for fms and other related chronic pain syndromes outside the united states and canada and will pay us a royalty based on net sales for such rights 
additionally  in connection with our agreement with collegium  the upfront and project management fees paid to collegium have been expensed pursuant to sfas no 
pursuant to the agreement with collegium  during a specified time period during the agreement  in the event that we exercise our option to acquire an exclusive license to technology developed under the agreement  we would be obligated to pay collegium certain milestone payments  as well as potential royalty payments based on the net sales of reformulated or new products 
stock based compensation we grant stock options for a fixed number of shares to employees in accordance with accounting principles board opinion no 
apb  accounting for stock issued to employees  as amended by sfas no 
fas  accounting for stock based compensation 
accordingly  we ordinarily recognize no compensation expense for stock option grants to employees provided that the option exercise price is not less than the fair market value of the underlying stock on the date of grant 
the value of options or stock awards issued to non employees have been determined in accordance with fas and emerging issues task force no 
 accounting for equity instruments that are issued to other than employees for acquiring or in conjunction with selling goods and services  and are periodically re measured as the options vest 
for the years ended december  and  we recorded compensation expense of  and  respectively  related to options issued to consultants 
in june  we entered into an option cancel and re grant program  which resulted in variable accounting for the newly issued options under financial accounting standards board interpretation no 
fin  accounting for certain transaction involving stock compensation an interpretation of apb pursuant to fin  the intrinsic value of the options to purchase common stock will be re measured at the end of each period for the term of the option and amortized over the vesting period 
as a result  we recorded stock compensation totaling  for the year ended december  during the year ended december   the intrinsic value of the common stock underlying the options declined  which means our stock price declined  resulting in a reversal of  of the cumulative compensation charge of  in the event our stock price is above closing price on december  on march   we will record additional compensation charges 
pursuant to the option cancel and re grant program  the exercise price of certain options held by certain of our employees  including executive officers  and directors were exchanged for options with an exercise price of  the fair market value of our common stock on june   the date the program was effected 
valuation allowance for deferred tax assets a valuation allowance is provided for deferred tax assets if it is more likely than not these items will either expire before we are able to realize their benefit  or that future deductibility is uncertain 
in general  companies that have a history of operating losses are faced with a difficult burden of proof on their ability to generate sufficient future taxable income within the next two years in order to realize the benefit of the deferred tax assets 
we have recorded a full valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets in the amount of million as of december  based on our history of losses 
the deferred tax assets are still available for us to use in the future to offset taxable income  which would result in the recognition of a tax benefit and a reduction to our effective tax rate

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk we invest our excess cash in united states government securities and money market funds with strong credit ratings 
as a result  our interest income is most sensitive to changes in the general level of united states interest rates 
we do not use derivative financial instruments  derivative commodity instruments or other market risk sensitive instruments  positions or transactions in any material fashion 
accordingly  we believe that  while the investment grade securities we hold are subject to changes in the financial standing of the issuer of such securities  we are not subject to any material risks arising from changes in interest rates  foreign currency exchange rates  commodity prices  equity prices or other market changes that affect market risk sensitive instruments 
a hypothetical adverse move in interest rates along the entire interest rate yield curve would not materially affect the fair value of our financial instruments that are exposed to changes in interest rates
