with respect to its properties in operation  the company endeavors to maintain its high occupancy levels while increasing rental rates 
the company pursues development opportunities that it believes will create value and yield high returns 
the company also acquires properties which it believes will create long term value  and disposes of properties which no longer fit within the company s strategic objectives or in situations where it can optimize cash proceeds 
the company s operating results depend primarily upon income from rental operations and are substantially influenced by rental demand for the properties in operation 
in  the continued general slowdown in the economy negatively affected occupancy rates 
additionally  the imbalance between supply and demand  resulted in a general decline in market rental rates 
although the company has realized increases on some renewal and replacement leases  the negative occupancy and rental rate trend has been continuing for several quarters and as a result  property level operating income from the same store group of properties has decreased 
additionally  tenant improvement and lease transaction costs on renewal and replacement leases have increased with the resultant effect of increasing property investment requirements 
the continued economic slowdown has also limited the company s ability to achieve growth in operating income from its development pipeline activity 
the decline in demand for real estate has reduced the amount of development the company is undertaking 
the size of the development pipeline has continued to decrease as speculative development has been significantly reduced and build to suit activity has declined

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the following discussion about the company s risk management includes forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
actual results could differ materially from the results discussed in the forward looking statements 
the company s primary market risk exposure is to changes in interest rates 
the company is exposed to market risk related to its million credit facility and certain other indebtedness as discussed in management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations liquidity and capital resources 
the interest on the million credit facility and such other indebtedness is subject to fluctuations in the market 
the company also uses long term and medium term debt as a source of capital 
these debt instruments are typically issued at fixed interest rates 
when these debt instruments mature  the company typically refinances such debt at then existing market interest rates which may be more or less than the interest rates on the maturing debt 
in addition  the company may attempt to reduce interest rate risk associated with a forecasted issuance of new debt 
in order to reduce interest rate risk associated with these transactions  the company occasionally enters into interest rate protection agreements 
if the interest rates for variable rate debt were basis points higher or lower during  the company s interest expense would have been increased or decreased by approximately million 
if the interest rate for the fixed rate debt maturing in was basis points higher or lower than its current rate of  the company s interest expense would be increased or decreased by approximately  the sensitivity analysis above assumes no changes in the company s financial structure 
it also does not consider future fluctuations in interest rates or the specific actions that might be taken by management to mitigate the impact of such fluctuations 
the company is also exposed to currency risk on its million investment in the united kingdom 
the company does not believe that this currency risk exposure is material to its financial statements
