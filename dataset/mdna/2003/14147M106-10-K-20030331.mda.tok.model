overview since our incorporation in  we have been engaged in the design  research  development  manufacturing  testing and marketing of microcatheter systems for the mapping and ablation of cardiac arrhythmias 
we have generated revenues of approximately million from inception to december  prior to  these revenues were generated primarily in europe and japan from sales of our pathfinder and tracer microcatheter systems for diagnosing ventricular tachycardia and our revelation microcatheter system for diagnosing atrial fibrillation  as well as ancillary products such as the venaport guiding catheters 
since  and the fda s clearance of certain of our products  sales in the united states consist primarily of our pathfinder and revelation lines of microcatheters for diagnosing ventricular tachycardia and atrial fibrillation 
to date  our international sales have been made through our small direct sales force and distributors who sell our products to physicians and hospitals 
european sales consist primarily of the revelation and revelation tx microcatheters for treatment of atrial fibrillation following receipt of ce mark for those products in august and december  respectively 
we obtained the right to affix the ce mark to our pathfinder  pathfinder mini and tracer microcatheter systems for mapping ventricular tachycardia and our revelation and revelation tx microcatheter systems for both mapping and ablation of atrial fibrillation  permitting us to market those products in the member countries of the european union 
we received k clearances for the revelation microcatheter for mapping of atrial fibrillation and the pathfinder mini microcatheter for mapping ventricular tachycardia and the vueport balloon guiding catheter in july in addition  we received k clearance for our tracer catheter for mapping of ventricular tachycardia and our naviport deflectable tip guiding catheter 
we will be required to conduct clinical trials  demonstrate safety and effectiveness and obtain pma approval from the fda in order to sell any of our products for treating atrial fibrillation or ventricular tachycardia in the united states 
specifically  pma approval will be required prior to the introduction in the united states of the revelation tx  revelation t flex and revelation helix microcatheter systems for treatment of atrial fibrillation 
we completed our phase iii clinical trial in the united states to treat atrial fibrillation of the revelation tx microcatheter system for the treatment of atrial fibrillation and on september  submitted our pma application to the fda 
on november   our pma was accepted by the fda and we were granted expedited review status 
on march   we were notified by the fda that we would meet with the circulatory systems device panel on may  following the closing on march  of our private placement  we have cash and cash equivalents of approximately million 
our management believes that our cash balances as of march   will be sufficient to fund planned expenditures through the middle of june although our management recognizes the need to raise funds in the near future and is currently negotiating with certain third parties the terms and conditions of financing transactions in addition to the private placement closed on march   there can be no assurance that we will be successful in consummating any such transaction  or  if we do consummate such a transaction  that the terms and conditions of such financing will not be unfavorable to us 
any failure by us to 
table of contents obtain additional funding will have a material effect upon us and will likely result in our inability to continue as a going concern 
our independent auditors have concluded that there is substantial doubt as to our ability to continue as a going concern for a reasonable period of time  and have  therefore  modified their report in the form of an explanatory paragraph describing the events that have given rise to this uncertainty 
we have a limited history of operations and have experienced significant operating losses since inception 
we expect that our operating losses will continue for the foreseeable future as we continue to invest substantial resources in product development  pre clinical and clinical trials  obtaining regulatory approval  sales and marketing and manufacturing 
critical accounting policies use of estimates we have prepared our financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states  which requires management to make estimates and assumptions that effect the amounts reported in financial statements and accompanying notes 
actual results could differ from these estimates 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue when products are shipped 
we recognize revenue from two types of customers  end users and distributors 
revenue is recognized upon the shipment of product  provided that the title of products has been transferred at the point of shipment  there is persuasive evidence of an agreement  the payment for the product is reasonably assured  and no substantive obligations to the customer remain 
customers are not entitled to rights of product return 
inventories our inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market 
cost is based on actual costs computed on a first in  first out basis 
inventory amounts are shown net of reserves for excess and obsolete inventory at the lower of cost or market 
we reserve for inventory amounts by considering the potential excess inventory in relation to sales forecasts and the obsolescence of inventory as a result of technological advancements 
stock based compensation the company has elected to follow accounting principles board opinion no apb  accounting for stock issued to employees and related interpretations in accounting for its employee stock options  including financial accounting standard board interpretation fin accounting for certain transactions involving stock compensation 
compensation expense is based on the difference  if any  between the fair value of the company s common stock and the exercise price of the option or share right on the measurement date  which is basically the date of the grant 
this amount is recorded as deferred stock compensation in the balance sheet and amortized as a charge to operations over the vesting period of the applicable options or share rights 
results of operations years ended december  and net sales for the year ended december   revenues increased to  from  for the same period of us sales remained relatively flat  decreasing only to  from  european sales increased to  from  due to increased therapeutic revenues primarily related to the revelation helix  which was introduced in early sales in the asia pacific market increased to  from  due to higher diagnostic product sales in this region 
sales in the rest of the world remained flat with sales in of  compared to sales of  in in  we expect net sales to be generated from the following geographic regions from sales in the united states  from 
table of contents asia and from europe  with limited clinical revenue and sales from regions of the rest of the world at 
we expect overall net sales to increase in as compared to we have continued to focus our resources on the completion of the phase iii clinical trials and submission of the pma of the revelation tx microcatheter system  while awaiting the outcome of our circulatory systems device panel meeting with the fda on may  we also hope to increase our sales and marketing capabilities in the diagnostic electrophysiology market so that we may increase future revenue opportunities 
because the electrophysiology market is comprised of a focused  specialized group of physicians  we market and distribute our products in the united states with a small direct sales force and we market and distribute our products internationally through a small direct sales force and distributors in selected countries who sell our products to physicians and hospitals 
cost of goods sold cost of goods sold primarily includes raw material costs  catheter fabrication costs  system assembly and testing costs and manufacturing overhead 
cost of goods sold for decreased to  from  for the decrease of cost of goods sold as a percent of net sales was primarily due to the reduced impact of underabsorption of overhead costs due to the  increase in sales volume to  in from  in production operated at approximately of capacity and overall the standard cost has been reduced due to the allocation of fixed costs over an increased number of units produced and tighter controls of costs for purchased material 
we expect costs per unit to continue to decrease as we plan to increase sales and related production volume  which will further allocate fixed costs over an increased number of units produced 
we expect total cost of good sold to decrease slightly as revenue increases in we will continue to work on process improvements to provide greater manufacturing flexibility and cost savings in the production of our microcatheter systems 
research and development expenses research and development expenses decreased to  in from  in the decrease was due to lower costs associated with revelation tx product development  which was partially offset by higher product development expenses for the revelation helix and the cardima ablation system which received fda clearance in early as part of the surgical ablation system 
we continue to experience cost savings associated with our efforts to focus on key research and development projects  maintaining our focus on our atrial fibrillation products and clinical trials 
we expect total research and development expenses in to decrease as compared to  while costs associated with clinical and regulatory expenses will increase as compared to the costs associated with research and pre clinical programs and clinical development programs were approximately in thousands december  research and preclinical programs clinical development programs total research and development we currently are engaged in the clinical development of the products listed below 
we have completed phase iii clinical trials for our atrial fibrillation ablation products and gathered data for the completion and submission of our pma application to the fda 
currently  we hope to receive fda approval for our revelation tx during the first half of we must receive pma approval before marketing our products for ablation in the united states 
clinical trials of our products have required substantial financial and management resources 
in addition  the clinical trials may identify significant technical or other obstacles that we 
table of contents will have to overcome before obtaining the necessary regulatory approvals or market acceptance 
our failure to complete our clinical trials  demonstrate product safety and clinical effectiveness  and obtain regulatory approval for the use of our microcatheter system for the ablation of atrial fibrillation would have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
uncertainties relating to clinical trials  demonstrating product safety and clinical effectiveness and obtaining regulatory approval for the use of our microcatheter system in ablation make it difficult for us to accurately predict the time or cost until completion of the following current projects therapeutic products description indication us regulatory status international regulatory status revelation tx guidewire based eight electrode microcatheter system with tissue temperature sensors designed to map and create long  thin  continuous  linear  transmural lesions in the atrium

factors affecting future results you should carefully consider in their entirety the following risk factors and all other information in this report before purchasing our common stock 
investing in our common stock involves a high degree of risk 
the risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones facing us 
additional risks and uncertainties that are not yet identified or that we currently think are immaterial also may have a materially adverse affect on our business 
if any of the following risks actually occur  our business  financial condition or results of operations would likely suffer  the trading price of our common stock would likely decline and in some instances might adversely affect our ability to continue as a going concern 
in addition to historical information  this prospectus contains forward looking statements 
these forward looking statements involve certain risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those contemplated in such forward looking statements 
if we fail to raise additional capital to develop and market our microcatheter systems  our business will fail 
we will need to raise additional capital through public or private financings or other arrangements in order to complete our clinical trials and market our microcatheter systems 
in addition  we may be required to expend greater than anticipated funds if unforeseen difficulties arise in the course of completing the development and marketing of our products or in other aspects of our business 
we cannot assure you that additional capital will be available to us when needed  if at all  or  if available  on terms attractive to us 
if we cannot obtain sufficient 
table of contents capital  we may be forced to delay  scale back or eliminate some or all of our product research and development programs  to limit the marketing of our products  or to license to third parties the rights to commercialize our products or technologies that we would otherwise develop and market ourselves 
furthermore  debt financing  if available  may involve restrictive covenants that could affect our ability to raise additional capital 
our failure to raise capital when needed could cause us to cease our operations 
we have financed our operations since inception primarily through the private placement of equity securities  proceeds from our initial public offering in june  loan facilities and the sale of certain of our patents and other intellectual property 
as of december   our cash balance was approximately  with total receivables of approximately  following the closing on march  of our private placement  we have cash and cash equivalents of approximately million

our independent auditors believe that there is substantial doubt as to our ability to continue as a going concern 
as a result of our losses to date  working capital deficiency and accumulated deficit  our independent auditors have concluded that there is substantial doubt as to our ability to continue as a going concern for a reasonable period of time  and have modified their report in the form of an explanatory paragraph describing the events that have given rise to this uncertainty 
our continuation as a going concern will depend upon our ability to generate or obtain sufficient cash to meet our obligations on a timely basis and ultimately to attain profitable operations 
our independent auditors going concern modification may make it more difficult for us to obtain additional funding to meet our obligations or adversely affect the terms of any additional funding we are able to obtain 
we anticipate that we will continue to incur significant losses until successful commercialization of one or more of our products 
there can be no assurance that we can or will operate profitably in the future  or that we will continue as a going concern 
our need to raise additional capital in the future could have a dilutive effect on your investment 
in order to complete the required regulatory approval process and commercialize our products  we will need to raise additional capital 
one possibility for raising additional capital is the public or private sale of our common stock

in addition  the price per share of the common stock sold in the december  and the january  closings of our private placement and the exercise price of the warrants issued to the investors who participated in the closings were discounted from the closing price of our common stock on those dates 
also  the price per share of the common stock sold in the march  private placement was at a discount to the closing price of our common stock on that date 
it is possible that we may close future private placements involving the issuance of securities at a price per share that represents a discount to the closing price of our common stock 
depending upon the price per share of securities that we sell in the future  your interest in us could be further diluted by any adjustments to the number of shares and the applicable exercise price required pursuant to the terms of the agreements under which certain shares of our common stock and certain warrants were issued 
currently  the number of shares of our common stock issued to the investors who participated in the december  and january  closings of our recent private placement and the number of shares of common stock issuable upon the exercise of warrants held by those investors and the number of shares of common stock issuable upon exercise of warrants held by the participants in our and private placements have antidilution protections that may be triggered in certain instances 

table of contents we have entered into engagement letters in connection with our actual and proposed private placements that have in the past and may in future lead to disputes and also may lead to additional payments of cash or issuances of securities in connection with past or future sales of our securities 
in connection with our private placement of units of common stock and warrants in  we entered into a letter agreement in april  or the letter agreement  with a financial advisor 
this financial advisor  or the advisor  assisted us with our private placement of units and received a commission in connection with the offering 
the advisor has the right to continue to provide certain services to us in connection with the development of potential strategic alliances 
on july   we retained a different financial advisor  or the july advisor  in connection with a proposed offer and sale of shares of our common stock and warrants to purchase shares of our common stock 
the letter agreement with the july advisor  or the july letter agreement  provides for the payment of fees to the july advisor equal to of the gross proceeds of the offering 
in addition to the cash fee  the july advisor has the right to receive warrants to purchase that number of shares of our common stock equal to of the number of shares sold in the offering 
the july advisor will also receive cash proceeds equal to of the aggregate exercise price of any warrants issued to the investors in the offering and subsequently exercised 
shortly before the august  closing of our august private placement which was arranged by the july advisor  the advisor communicated to us that it believes that it is entitled under the letter agreement to fees and warrants in connection with the august private placement 
we strongly disagree with the advisor s interpretation of the letter agreement 
even if the advisor s interpretation is determined to be correct  we believe that the advisor waived any rights to compensation it might have in connection with the august private placement 
we sent to the advisor on august  a termination letter relating to the letter agreement 
pursuant to the terms of the letter agreement  our obligations to pay the advisor a commission or to issue to it warrants in connection with sales of our securities terminated thirty days from the date of this termination letter  or september  on august   the advisor sent to us an invoice for cash commissions and warrants that the advisor claims are owed to it pursuant to the letter agreement as a result of the closing of the august private placement 
on september   we sent a letter to the advisor to express our position that no fees or warrants are due to the advisor in connection with the closings of the august private placement 
on september  we received a letter from legal counsel to the advisor reasserting the advisor s claim that it must receive payment of commissions and warrants in connection with the august private placement 
in the event the advisor prevails on any claims in connection with the august private placement  we would be required to pay to the advisor  or of the gross proceeds that we received from the sale of shares of common stock  and issue to the advisor warrants to purchase up to  shares of common stock  or of the number of shares of common stock sold in the august private placement 
in the event of the warrants issued to the investors in the august private placement are exercised  we would be required to pay to the advisor an additional cash amount equal to  or of the aggregate exercise price of those warrants 
any payments to the advisor or warrants issued to the advisor would be in addition to placement fees and warrants paid to the july advisor in connection with the terms of the july letter agreement 
on november   we retained a party to act as our financial advisor and finder in connection with a proposed offer and sale of shares of our common stock and warrants to purchase shares of our common stock 
the letter agreement with this advisor  or the november advisor  provides for  among other things  the payment of fees to the november advisor equal to of the gross proceeds of the offering  including any proceeds from the exercise of the warrants 
in addition to the cash fee  the november advisor has the right to receive warrants to purchase a number of shares equal to of the number of securities sold in such offering and a break up fee of  for financings or transactions undertaken by us without the november advisor s assistance 
the december and january closings of our private placements were undertaken without the november advisor s assistance 

table of contents on december   we retained another party as our financial advisor and finder in connection with a proposed offer and sale of shares of our common stock and warrants to purchase shares of our common stock 
the letter agreement with this advisor  or the december advisor  provides for  among other things  the payment of fees to the december advisor equal to of the gross proceeds of the offering  including any proceeds from the exercise of the warrants 
in addition to the cash fee  the december advisor has the right to receive warrants to purchase a number of shares equal to of the number of securities issued in such offering 
on december   we retained another party to act as our financial advisor and finder in connection with the offer and sale of shares of company common stock and warrants to purchase shares of our common stock that closed on december  and january  the letter agreement with this finder  or the december finder  provides for the payment of fees to the december finder equal to of the gross proceeds of the december  and january  closings of the private placement  including any proceeds from the exercise of the warrants 
in addition to the cash fee  the december finder will receive warrants to purchase a number of shares equal to of the number of shares sold in the december  and january  closings of the private placement 
the december finder received a cash finder s fee of  and warrants to purchase  shares of our common stock at a price per share of in connection with the december  and january  closings of our private placements 
on march   we retained another party as our financial advisor in connection with a proposed debt or equity financing 
the letter agreement with this advisor  or the march advisor  provides for  among other things  the payment of fees to the advisor equal to of the gross proceeds of the offering 
in addition to the cash fee  the advisor has the right to receive warrants to purchase a number of shares equal to of the number of securities issued in such offering at of the market price 
despite the termination letter that we delivered to the advisor on august  terminating our obligations to pay the advisor a commission or to issue them warrants in connection with sales of our securities after september   we received on january   a letter from the advisor asserting that it also is owed i approximately  plus ii five year warrants to purchase approximately  shares of the our common stock at an exercise price of per share  in each case arising in connection with a private placement of securities consummated by us in december in addition  on february  we received another letter from the advisor asserting that it is also owed i approximately  plus ii five year warrants to purchase approximately  shares of our common stock at an exercise price of per share  in each case in connection with the january  closing of our recent private placement 
any payments to the advisor or warrants issued to the advisor would be in addition to placement fees and warrants paid to the december finder pursuant to the terms of our letter agreement with the december finder 
the july advisor received a cash finder s fee of  and warrants to purchase  shares of our common stock at a price per share of in connection with the march  closing of our private placement 
due to the existence of these various letter agreements  there is a possibility that we may be obligated to pay fees  cash commissions  and issue warrants to one or more financial advisors in connection with the closing of any of our private placements 
in addition  we may in the future enter into further agreements with financial advisors  finders or placement agents  similar to those discussed above  in connection with private placements of our securities 
there is the possibility that we might agree to pay to these parties a commission on any sales of securities to investors introduced to us by such parties or a commission based upon the exercise price of any warrants exercised by investors introduced to us by such parties  and that such commissions will be in addition to commissions payable to other financial advisors  finders and placement agents working on our behalf 
in addition  we may agree to issue to these additional financial advisors  finders and placement agents warrants to purchase shares of our common stock 
we also may be obligated to pay termination or break up fees to our current or future financial advisors  finders and placement agents in connection with the recent closings of our private placement or subsequent placements 
these commissions paid or warrants issued to the may be in addition to the commissions payable or warrants issuable to other financial advisors  finders or placement agents in respect of the same transaction 

table of contents we have sold a limited number of our microcatheter products  and we will continue to incur substantial costs in bringing our microcatheter products to market 
we have sold only a limited number of our microcatheter systems 
in addition  we will continue to incur substantial losses into the foreseeable future because of research and product development  clinical trials  manufacturing  sales  marketing and other expenses as we seek to bring our microcatheters to market 
since our inception  we have experienced losses  and we expect to experience substantial net losses into the foreseeable future 
our net losses were approximately million  million and for the years ended december   and  respectively 
as of december   our accumulated deficit was approximately million 
our limited sales history makes it difficult to assess our future results 
we cannot be certain that we will ever generate substantial revenue or achieve profitability 
our failure to generate substantial revenues would harm our business 
we have limited sales and limited experience in the sale  marketing and distribution of our products 
our failure to establish an effective direct or indirect sales and marketing force will cause our revenues to decline 
we have only limited experience marketing and selling our products in commercial quantities 
in january  we signed an exclusive three year distribution agreement with st 
jude medical corporation whereby st 
jude s daig division was to distribute our diagnostic products in the united states 
st 
jude did not meet the first year minimum annual sales quota under the distribution agreement 
in june  we mutually agreed with st 
jude to terminate the agreement and to allow for a transition period to transfer customer accounts by the termination date of september  as a result  we expanded our own small sales force to three sales representatives in the united states 
therefore  we will be solely responsible for marketing and distributing our products in the united states 
if we receive fda approval of our pma  we may not have an adequate marketing and sales force to adequately sell our product 
expanding our marketing and sales capability to support sales in commercial quantities adequately will require substantial effort and require significant management and financial resources 
our failure to establish an effective sales and marketing force will prevent us from being able to generate significant revenues from the sale of our products 
we also have terminated several distribution arrangements in europe because of the distributors failure to meet minimum sales levels under those agreements 
our ability to operate a remote sales force effectively will require additional resources  time and expense  which could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we cannot be certain that we will be able to build a european distribution or direct business  that it will be cost effective or that its efforts will be successful 
failure to establish an adequate business in europe would harm our business 
currently  sales and marketing of our pathfinder  pathfinder mini  revelation and tracer microcatheter systems are conducted through a number of exclusive distributors in certain european countries and japan and a small direct sales force in europe 
we have sold only a limited number of pathfinder  pathfinder mini  revelation and tracer microcatheter systems through these distributors 
we have approval to sell the revelation  revelation tx  revelation t flex  revelation helix and revelation helix st in the european union  hong kong and canada 
we cannot be certain that these distributors will be able to effectively market and sell our products in these markets 
in addition  we cannot assure you that we will be able to enter into additional agreements with desired distributors on a timely basis or at all  or that these distributors will devote adequate resources to selling our products 
our failure to establish and maintain appropriate distribution relationships would harm our business 

table of contents we rely on multiple third parties to conduct and collect data for the clinical trials of our products 
if we are unable to access this data or the fda refuses to accept the data in a filing  the commercialization of our products will be delayed and our business will be harmed 
we often rely on multiple third parties  such as hospitals and universities  to conduct and collect data for our clinical trials 
we depend on these third parties to provide access to data and cooperate with us in completing regulatory filings for the approval or clearance of our products 
in order for the fda and other regulatory agencies to accept and rely on the data of a filing  the data collection  analysis and summarization must meet certain standards 
we cannot be certain that the clinical data collected by the third parties meet the standards of the fda or other regulatory agencies 
if we are unable to rely on the clinical data collected by third parties  or if these third parties do not perform their contractual obligations  the fda or other regulatory agencies may require us to gather additional clinical data 
this could significantly delay commercialization of our products  require us to spend additional capital on our clinical trials and harm our business 
we cannot assure the safety or effectiveness of our products 
to date  we have received from the fda k pre market clearances with respect to our pathfinder and pathfinder mini microcatheter systems for venous mapping of ventricular tachycardia  and our revelation microcatheter system for mapping the atria of the heart 
we also received fda k clearance for our venaport  vueport and naviport guiding catheters and our tracer microcatheter for mapping ventricular tachycardia 
we are in the final stages of developing  testing and obtaining regulatory approval for our revelation tx microcatheter systems designed for ablation of atrial fibrillation 
we completed the mapping phase of this atrial fibrillation feasibility study in august and the ablation feasibility study in december we received approval of an investigational device exemption  or ide  supplement in december allowing us to expand the ablation study 
in june  we received permission from the fda to expand the clinical trial to phase iii pivotal study with up to patients at up to centers 
on september   we submitted to the fda our pma application for our revelation tx microcatheter system  data from a trial involving patients and follow up data relating to those patients for the six months after completion of the trial 
as part of the submission of the pma application  we have asked the fda for an expedited review of our pma 
on november   the fda accepted our request for expedited review 
on march   we were notified by the fda that we would meet with the circulatory systems device panel on may  currently we are targeting approval for our revelation tx microcatheter system in the second quarter of we must receive pma approval before marketing our products for ablation in the united states 
additionally  in august  we began a clinical trial in germany involving our revelation helix microcatheter in the treatment of atrial fibrillation originating from the pulmonary veins 
enrollment in this study was completed in june by december  all enrolled study subjects had completed the six month follow up 
data from the six month follow up on these subjects will be analyzed and prepared for publication targeted for the first half of in december   the revelation helix received the ce mark allowing sales in the european economic area 
we also received in december approval for an ide to begin clinical testing of our therastream microcatheter system for ablation of ventricular tachycardia and during calendar year approval to expand that trial  however  we have postponed the clinical feasibility trial for the therastream microcatheter system for ablation of ventricular tachycardia to focus on completing our revelation tx clinical trial for atrial fibrillation 
we have no estimate as to when  or if  we will resume the clinical trial for our therastream microcatheter system 
if we resume the clinical trial for our therastream microcatheter system  the completion of this clinical trial could take several years 
clinical trial of our microcatheter systems will require substantial financial and management resources 
in addition  the clinical trials may identify significant technical or other obstacles that we will need to overcome before obtaining the necessary regulatory approvals or market acceptance 
our failure to complete our clinical trials  demonstrate product safety and clinical effectiveness  or obtain regulatory approval for the use of our 
table of contents microcatheter system for the ablation of atrial fibrillation would have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
our microcatheter products and their related procedures are novel to the market and will require the special training of physicians 
if the market does not accept our products and procedures  our revenues will decline 
our microcatheter systems represent a novel approach to diagnosing and treating atrial fibrillation and ventricular tachycardia 
acceptance of our products and procedures by physicians  patients and health care payors will be necessary in order for us to be successful 
if the market does not accept our products and the procedures involved in their use  our business would be harmed and our revenues would decline 
our microcatheter products must be safe  effective and cost efficient in order for them to effectively compete against more established treatments 
if we cannot compete with these treatments  our revenues will decline 
the market for catheters to diagnose or treat atrial fibrillation and ventricular tachycardia is highly competitive 
our microcatheter systems for the mapping and ablation of atrial fibrillation and ventricular tachycardia are new technologies 
safety  cost efficiency and effectiveness are the primary competitive factors in this market 
other competitive factors include the length of time required for products to be developed and receive regulatory approval and  in some cases  reimbursement approval 
existing treatments with which we must compete include conventional catheters using the drag and burn or dot to dot technique  anti arrhythmic and anti coagulant drugs  external electrical shock to restore normal heart rhythms and defibrillation  implantable defibrillators  purposeful destruction of the atrio ventricular node followed by implantation of a pacemaker  and open heart surgery known as the maze procedure 
physicians will not recommend the use of our microcatheter systems unless they can conclude that our systems provide a safe  effective and cost efficient alternative to current technologies for the mapping and ablation of atrial fibrillation or ventricular tachycardia 
if our clinical data and other studies do not show that our products are safe and effective  the fda will not approve our products for sale 
if our products are not approved  we will not be able to enter the market and we will not be able to generate revenues from their sale 
none of our ablation products have received regulatory approval in the united states 
our failure to receive these approvals will harm our business 
to date  none of our products in development for the ablation of atrial fibrillation or ventricular tachycardia has received regulatory approval in the united states 
if we cannot gain us regulatory approval  our business will be materially harmed 
even if our ablation products are successfully developed and we obtain the required regulatory approvals  we cannot be certain that our ablation products and their associated procedures will ultimately gain market acceptance 
because our sole product focus is to design and market microcatheter systems to map and ablate atrial fibrillation and ventricular tachycardia  our failure to successfully commercialize these systems would materially harm our business 
reuse of our single use products could cause our revenues to decline 
although we label all of our microcatheter systems for single use only  we are aware that some physicians potentially may reuse these products 
reuse of our microcatheter systems could reduce revenues from product sales and could cause our revenues to decline 
in addition  such misuse of our products could result in personal injury and death 
see factors affecting future results we may face product liability claims related to the use or misuse of our products 

table of contents we must obtain governmental approvals or clearances before we can sell our products 
our products are considered to be medical devices and are subject to extensive regulation in the united states and internationally 
these regulations are wide ranging and govern  among other things product design and development  product testing  product labeling  product storage  premarket clearance and approval  advertising and promotion  and product sales and distribution 
before we can market any of our products in the united states or europe  we must demonstrate that our products are safe and effective and obtain approval or clearance from the applicable governmental authorities 
in the united states  we must obtain from the fda k pre market notification clearance or a pma in order to market a product 
we have received k pre market notification clearances for our pathfinder  pathfinder mini and tracer microcatheter systems for mapping ventricular tachycardia and for the revelation microcatheter system for mapping atrial fibrillation 
currently  the process for k clearance is approximately days and pma approval is six to twelve months 
however  the timing of such process can be uncertain and may involve significantly more time 
we cannot guarantee either the timing or receipt of regulatory approval or clearance for any of our products in development 
these products may require a pma  and the fda may request extensive clinical data to support either k clearance or a pma 
we are required to seek a pma for our ablation products  including the revelation tx microcatheter 
the process of obtaining a pma is much more expensive  lengthy and uncertain than the k pre market notification clearance process 
in order to complete our pma application  we will be required to complete clinical trials to demonstrate the safety and effectiveness of these products 
in december  the fda approved a patient atrial fibrillation feasibility study for mapping and ablation with the revelation tx 
in june  we received conditional approval from the fda and full approval in august for our phase iii clinical trial 
in march  the fda allowed us to file a modular pma for our revelation tx in phase iii clinical trial 
under the modular pma submission  we filed four of five modules in the fifth module is the clinical data and formal pma application 
three of the first four modules have been accepted and closed by the fda and the remaining module will be left open for reference during the review of the clinical data in the fifth and final module 
on september   we submitted our pma application to the fda with the fifth module containing data on more than patients treated with our revelation tx microcatheter system 
subsequently  on november   we announced that the fda had accepted our filing and granted our request for expedited review 
on march   we were notified by the fda that we would meet with the circulatory systems device panel on may  the modular pma submission process may reduce the time for fda approval by allowing an applicant to submit data on pre clinical testing while clinical testing is occurring 
in addition  dialogue with the fda during the modular submission process allows us to improve our final submission 
closure and acceptance of any one module does not allow marketing of any part of the product 
we are restricted from selling the product until the entire pma process is complete and approved by the fda 
no assurance can be given that we will ever be able to obtain a pma for any of our ablation products 
our failure to obtain a pma on a timely basis would have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we filed an ide application for a feasibility trial with the therastream microcatheter system in december and received permission to expand that trial in july we have postponed the therastream clinical trial while we focus our resources on completing our atrial fibrillation phase iii clinical trial 
there can be no assurance that any additional clinical studies that we may propose will be permitted 
table of contents by the fda  will be completed or  if completed  will provide data and information that supports a pma 
furthermore  we cannot assure you that our phase iii clinical trial for ablation of atrial fibrillation will provide us with data and information that supports a pma 
regulatory agencies may limit the indications for which they approve or clear any of our products 
further  the fda may restrict or withdraw approval or clearance of a product if additional information becomes available to support such action 
delays in the approval or clearance process  limitation of our labeling claims or denial of our applications or notifications would cause our business to be materially and adversely affected 
pre clinical and clinical trials are inherently unpredictable 
if we do not successfully conduct these trials  we may be unable to market our products and our revenues may decline 
through pre clinical studies and clinical trials  we must demonstrate that our products are safe and effective for their indicated uses 
results from pre clinical studies and early clinical trials may not allow us to predict results in later stage testing 
no assurance can be given that our future clinical trials will demonstrate the safety and effectiveness of any of our products or will result in regulatory approval to market our products 
as a result  if we are unable to commence and complete our clinical trials as planned  or demonstrate the safety and effectiveness of our products  our business will be harmed 
in addition  no assurance can be given that we can begin any future clinical trials or successfully complete these trials once started 
we may never meet our development schedule for any of our products in development 
even if a product is successfully developed and clinically tested  we cannot be certain that it will be approved by the fda on a timely basis or at all 
if the fda does not approve our products for commercial sales  our business will be harmed 
delays in enrolling patients in our clinical trials could increase our expenses and harm our business 
the rate at which we may complete our pre clinical and clinical trials is dependent upon  among other things  the rate of patient enrollment 
patient enrollment depends on many factors  including the size of the patient population  the nature of the procedure  the proximity of patients residences to clinical sites  the eligibility criteria for the study and impact of other clinical studies competing for the same patient population and or the same physicians time and research efforts 
delays in planned patient enrollment may result in increased costs and delays  which could cause our business results to suffer 
if we do not comply with applicable domestic laws and regulations after obtaining approvals or clearances  our business results may suffer 
after initial regulatory approval or clearance of our products  we will continue to be subject to extensive domestic regulatory requirements 
our failure to comply with applicable regulatory requirements can result in enforcement actions by the fda  including  but not limited to fines  injunctions  recall or seizure of products  withdrawal of marketing approvals or clearances  refusal by the fda to grant clearances or approvals  and civil and criminal penalties 
we also are required to demonstrate and maintain compliance with the fda s quality system regulations for all of our products 
the fda enforces the quality system regulations through periodic inspections  including a pre approval inspection for pma products 
the quality system regulations relates to product testing and quality assurance  as well as the maintenance of records and documentation 
if we do not  or any third party 
table of contents manufacturer of our products does not  comply with the quality system regulations and cannot be brought into compliance  we will be required to find alternative manufacturers 
identifying and qualifying alternative manufacturers would likely be a long and difficult process 
we also are required to provide information to the fda on deaths or serious injuries alleged to have been associated with the use of our medical devices  as well as product malfunctions that could contribute to death or serious injury 
if we fail to comply with these applicable regulations  our business results may suffer 
if we do not comply with foreign regulatory requirements to market our products outside the united states  our business will be harmed 
sales of medical devices outside the united states are subject to international regulatory requirements that vary from country to country 
the time required for approval varies from country to country and may be longer or shorter than the time required in the united states 
in order to market any of our products in the member countries of the european union  we are required to obtain ce mark certification 
ce mark certification is an international symbol of adherence to quality assurance standards and compliance with the european medical device directives 
we have received ce mark certification to sell our pathfinder  pathfinder mini  revelation  revelation tx  revelation helix  and tracer microcatheters and venaport  vueport and naviport guiding catheters for mapping in the european union 
we received approval to sell our pathfinder  pathfindermini  revelation  and tracer in japan and australia  and to sell our pathfinder  tracer  venaport  vueport and naviport in canada 
we also received ce mark certification to sell our revelation  revelationtx and revelation t flex  revelation helix and revelation helix st microcatheters for ablation of atrial fibrillation in the european union 
in july  we announced that we submitted to the fda a k pre market notification application for a surgical ablation system for use in minimally invasive cardiac surgery 
this new system is designed to use a cardima surgical probe using multi electrode linear array microcatheter technology  a novel power channeling device  the intellitemp  which allows the surgeon to apply rf energy to any or all of the individual electrodes on the probe and commercially available electro surgical radio frequency rf generators 
we intend to submit data in support of additional ce mark applications 
however  there can be no assurance we will be successful in obtaining or maintaining the ce mark for these products  as the case may be 
failure to receive or maintain approval to affix the ce mark would prohibit us from selling these products in member countries of the european union  and would require significant delays in obtaining individual country approvals 
no assurance can be given that we will ever obtain or maintain such approvals 
if we do not receive or maintain these approvals  our business could be harmed 
difficulties presented by international factors could negatively affect our business 
a component of our strategy is to expand our international sales revenues 
we believe that we will face risks in doing business abroad that we do not face domestically 
among the international risks we believe are most likely to affect us are export license requirements for our products  exchange rate fluctuations or currency controls  changes in the regulation of medical products by the european union or other international regulatory agencies  the difficulty in managing a direct sales force from abroad  the financial condition  expertise and performance of our international distributors and any future international distributors  
table of contents domestic or international trade restrictions  or changes in tariffs 
any of these factors could damage our business results 
we derive a portion of our revenues from the sale of our products in the european union 
the adoption of the eurodollar presents uncertainties for our international business 
all european countries that are part of the european monetary union  or emu  began operating with the new euro currency in a significant amount of uncertainty exists as to the effect the euro will have on the marketplace in general 
in particular  as a portion of our sales revenue is derived from sales to emu countries  the adoption by these participating countries of a single currency could result in greater price transparency  making the emu a more competitive environment for our products 
we have assessed the effect the introduction of the euro could possibly have on our internal accounting systems and potential sales of our products 
recently  we have routinely updated our accounting and financial software  which included appropriate accounting for foreign currencies  including the euro 
this issue and its related costs could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we may be unable to successfully commercialize our microcatheter products  as the industry for them is highly competitive 
the market for catheters to map and or ablate atrial fibrillation and ventricular tachycardia is highly competitive 
several of our competitors are developing different approaches and products for these procedures 
these approaches include mapping systems using contact mapping  single point spatial mapping and non contact  multi site electrical mapping technologies  and ablation systems using radio frequency  ultrasound  microwave  laser and cryoblation technologies 
other companies are also developing surgical procedures that could allow physicians to perform the open heart surgical maze procedure for the treatment of atrial fibrillation in a minimally invasive manner 
if any of these new approaches or products proves to be safe  effective and cost effective  our products could be rendered non competitive or obsolete  which would harm our business 
many of our competitors have an established presence in the field of interventional cardiology and electrophysiology  or the study of the electrical system of the heart 
these competitors include boston scientific  through its ep technologies and cardiac pathways divisions  cr bard  inc  johnson johnson  through its biosense webster division  st 
jude medical  inc  through its daig division  and medtronic  inc 
these competitors have substantially greater financial and other resources than we do  including larger research and development staffs and greater experience and capabilities in conducting clinical trials  obtaining regulatory approvals  and manufacturing  marketing and distributing products 
in addition  other companies are developing proprietary systems for the diagnosis and treatment of cardiac arrhythmias  including biosense webster  a division of johnson johnson  and endocardial solutions  inc other companies are also developing  marketing and selling alternative approaches for the treatment of atrial fibrillation and ventricular tachycardia  including manufacturers of implantable defibrillators such as guidant corporation  medtronic  inc and st 
jude medical  inc we cannot be certain that we will succeed in developing and marketing technologies and products that are safer  more clinically effective and cost effective than the more established treatments or the new approaches and products being developed and marketed by our competitors 
furthermore  there can be no assurance that we will succeed in developing new technologies and products that will be available before those of our competitors 
our failure to demonstrate the competitive advantages and achieve market acceptance of our products would significantly harm our business 
we license portions of our product technology from potential competitors  and the termination of any of these licenses would harm our business 
we rely on license agreements for some of our product technology from potential competitors 
a license from target therapeutics  inc  a subsidiary of boston scientific corporation  is the technological basis for our 
table of contents microcatheter systems for mapping and ablation 
boston scientific corporation currently has research efforts in the field of electrophysiology that may compete with our products 
under the target therapeutic license agreement we have an exclusive license under specific issued united states patents 
the exclusive license from target therapeutic covers the diagnosis and treatment of electrophysiological disorders in areas other than the central nervous system 
in addition  we have obtained a non exclusive license to use target therapeutic s technology  provided we have made a substantial improvement of such technology  for the diagnosis or treatment of diseases of the heart  other than by balloon angioplasty 
the license will terminate upon the expiration or invalidation of all claims under the underlying patents 
in addition  target therapeutic has the right to terminate the license earlier if we fail to comply with various commercialization  sublicensing  insurance  royalty  product liability  indemnification  non competition and other obligations 
furthermore  either party can terminate the license if a material breach remains uncured for thirty days or if either party ceases to be actively engaged in its present business for a period of twelve months 
the loss of our exclusive rights to the target therapeutic based microcatheter technology would significantly harm our business 
in december  we sold certain patents and related intellectual property pertaining to intravascular sensing and signal detection to medtronic  inc  which currently has research efforts in the field of electrophysiology that may compete with our products 
we received a perpetual  worldwide license at no cost from medtronic to use these patents and related intellectual property in our products for mapping and ablation of arrhythmia causing tissue 
in addition  medtronic agreed not to sublicense the patents within our field of use to any non affiliated party 
we have also licensed a proprietary surface coating material from another vendor used on certain of our microcatheters 
we cannot be certain that these licenses will continue to be available to us or will be available to us on reasonable terms 
the loss of or inability to maintain any of these licenses could result in delays in commercial shipments until we could internally develop or identify  license and integrate equivalent technology 
these delays would have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we may not be able to commercialize our products under development if they infringe existing patents or patents that have not yet issued 
we have conducted searches to determine whether our patent applications interfere with existing patents 
based upon these searches  we believe that our patent applications and products do not interfere with existing patents 
however  we cannot be sure that relevant patents have not been issued that could block our ability to obtain patents or commercialize our products 
moreover  because us patent applications are not a matter of public record  a patent application could currently be on file that would prevent us from obtaining a patent issuance 
in addition  congress recently amended the us patent laws to exempt physicians  other health care professionals and affiliated entities from infringement liability for medical and surgical procedures performed on patients 
the issuance of any potentially competing patent could harm our business 
although we have not received any letters from others threatening to enforce intellectual property rights against us  we cannot be certain that we will not become subject to patent infringement claims or litigation  interference proceedings in the us patent and trademark office to determine the priority of inventions  or oppositions to patent grants in foreign countries 
an adverse determination in litigation  interference or opposition proceedings could subject us to significant liabilities to third parties  require us to cease using such technology  or require us to license disputed rights from third parties 
however  we cannot be certain that at such time any licenses will be available to us  or if available  on commercially reasonable terms 
our inability to license any disputed technology could materially delay the commercialization of our products and harm our business 
our license with target therapeutics  does not provide us with indemnification against claims brought by third parties alleging infringement of patent rights 
consequently  we would bear the liability resulting from such claims 
we cannot be certain that we will have the financial resources to protect and defend our intellectual property  as such defense is often costly and time consuming 
our failure to protect our patent rights  trade secrets  know how or other intellectual property would harm our business 

table of contents if healthcare providers do not receive adequate reimbursement for procedures using our products  the market may not accept our products and our revenues may decline 
us healthcare providers  including hospitals and physicians  that purchase microcatheter products generally rely on third party payors  principally federal medicare  state medicaid and private health insurance plans  to reimburse all or a part of the costs and fees associated with the procedures performed using our products 
the success of our products will depend upon the ability of healthcare providers to obtain satisfactory reimbursement for medical procedures in which our microcatheter systems are used 
if these healthcare providers are unable to obtain reimbursement from third party payors  the market may not accept our products and our revenues may decline 
third party payors may deny reimbursement if they determine that a prescribed device has not received appropriate regulatory clearances or approvals  is not used in accordance with cost effective treatment methods as determined by the payor  or is experimental  unnecessary or inappropriate 
if we receive fda clearance or approval  third party reimbursement also would depend upon decisions by the united states health care financing administration for medicare  as well as by individual health maintenance organizations  private insurers and other payors 
reimbursement systems in international markets vary significantly by country and by region within some countries  and reimbursement approvals may be obtained on a country by country basis 
many international markets have government managed health care systems that control reimbursement for new devices and procedures 
in most markets  there are private insurance systems as well as government managed systems 
there can be no assurance that reimbursement for our products will be available domestically or internationally  if available  that such reimbursement will be available in sufficient amounts in the united states or in international markets under either government or private reimbursement systems  or that physicians will support and advocate reimbursement for procedures using our products 
failure by hospitals and other users of our products to obtain reimbursement from third party payors or changes in government and private third party payor policies toward reimbursement for procedures employing our products would harm our business 
moreover  we are unable to predict what additional legislation or regulation  if any  relating to the health care industry or third party coverage and reimbursement may be enacted in the future  or what effect such legislation or regulation would have on our business 
we cannot be certain that we will be able to manufacture our products in high volumes at commercially reasonable costs 
we currently manufacture our microcatheter systems in limited quantities for us and international sales and for pre clinical and clinical trials 
however  we have limited experience manufacturing our products in the amounts necessary to achieve significant commercial sales 
we currently believe that our manufacturing capacity will be sufficient through december we expect that if us sales for the pathfinder and revelation microcatheter systems increase or if we receive fda clearance or approvals for other products  we will need to expend significant capital resources and develop additional manufacturing capacity to establish large scale manufacturing capabilities 
however  we could encounter problems related to capacity constraints  production yields  quality control  and shortages of qualified personnel 
such problems could affect our ability to adequately scale up production of our products and fulfill customer orders on a timely basis  which could harm our business 
our manufacturing facilities are subject to periodic inspection by regulatory authorities 
our operations must either undergo quality system regulations compliance inspections conducted by the fda or receive an fda exemption from such compliance inspections in order for the fda to permit us to produce products for sale 
table of contents in the united states 
our facilities and manufacturing processes are subject to inspections from time to time by the fda  the state of california and european notified bodies 
we have demonstrated compliance with en iso or iso quality standards  as well as compliance with eec  the medical device directive 
we comply with procedures to produce products for sale in europe 
any failure by us to comply with the quality system regulations requirements or to maintain our compliance with en iso or iso standards and eec  the medical device directive  will require us to take corrective actions  such as modification of our policies and procedures 
in addition  we may be required to cease all or part of our operations for some period of time until we can demonstrate that appropriate steps have been taken to comply with quality system regulations or en iso or iso standards 
there can be no assurance that we will be found in compliance with the quality system regulations by regulatory authorities  or that we will maintain compliance with en iso or iso standards in future audits 
our failure to comply with state or fda quality system regulations  maintain compliance with en iso or iso standards  or develop our manufacturing capability in compliance with such standards  would have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
our facilities and manufacturing processes have undergone a successful annual re certification inspection by the european notified body in november and a successful annual inspection in november in november and in january  the fda conducted a qsit audit of our quality system  which we successfully passed 
there is no assurance that our manufacturing facilities will continue to meet such compliance audits and will maintain such compliance standards 
if our sole source suppliers are unable to meet our demands  our business results will suffer 
we purchase certain key components for some of our products  from sole  single or limited source suppliers 
for some of these components  there are relatively few alternative sources of supply 
establishing additional or replacement suppliers for any of the numerous components used in our products  if required  may not be accomplished quickly and could involve significant additional costs 
any supply interruption from vendors or failure to obtain alternative vendors for any of the numerous components used to manufacture our products would limit our ability to manufacture our products 
any such limitation on our ability to manufacture our products would cause our business results to suffer 
we are dependent upon our key personnel and will need to hire additional key personnel in the future 
our ability to operate successfully depends in significant part upon the continued service of certain key scientific  technical  clinical  regulatory and managerial personnel  and our continuing ability to attract and retain additional highly qualified personnel in these areas 
competition for such personnel is intense  especially in the san francisco bay area 
we cannot be certain that we can retain such personnel or that we can attract or retain other highly qualified scientific  technical  clinical  regulatory and managerial personnel in the future  including key sales and marketing personnel 
we may face product liability claims related to the use or misuse of our products 
we face an inherent business risk of product liability claims in the event that the use or misuse of our products results in personal injury or death 
we cannot be certain  in particular after commercial introduction of our products  that we will not experience losses due to product liability claims 
we currently have general liability insurance with coverage in the amount of million per occurrence  subject to a million annual limitation 
we have product liability insurance with coverage in the amount of million per occurrence  subject to a million annual limitation 
we cannot be certain that such coverage will be adequate or continue to be available to us on reasonable terms  if at all 
in addition  there can be no assurance that all of the activities encompassed within our business are or will be covered under our policies 
although we label our microcatheter products for single use only  we are aware that some physicians are re using such products 
moreover  despite labeling our microcatheters for diagnostic use only  we believe that physicians are using such mapping 
table of contents microcatheters for ablation 
multiple use or off label use of our microcatheters could subject us to increased exposure to product liability claims  which could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we may require additional product liability coverage if we significantly expand commercialization of our products 
such additional coverage is expensive  difficult to obtain and may not be available in the future on acceptable terms  if at all 
any claims or series of claims against us  regardless of their merit or eventual outcome  could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we do not intend to pay cash dividends on our stock 
we have never paid cash dividends on our capital stock and do not anticipate paying cash dividends in the foreseeable future 
instead  we intend to retain future earnings for reinvestment in our business 
our stock may become subject to penny stock rules  which may make it more difficult for investors to sell their shares and may lead to financial penalties under certain of our agreements 
currently  our common stock trades on the nasdaq smallcap market 
during the past year  our stock  at times  traded below per share 
the nasd advised us that beginning on april   our common stock would no longer be listed on the nasdaq smallcap market 
we appealed the nasd s decision  met the continued listing requirements and on june   the nasd notified us that our common stock would continue to trade on the nasdaq smallcap market 
nasdaq listing rules provide that if the closing bid price of a company s stock is below for more than thirty consecutive trading days  the company faces possible delisting from nasdaq 
on october   we received notification from the nasd that our common stock had closed below the minimum per share required for continued inclusion on the nasdaq for a period of more than thirty consecutive trading days 
in its notification  the nasd informed us that we have calendar days  or until april   to comply with nasd marketplace rule c 
in order to comply with this rule  the bid price of our common stock must close at per share or more for a minimum of ten consecutive trading days at any time before april  as of january   the closing bid price of our common stock had remained equal to per share or greater for more than ten consecutive trading days 
on january   we received affirmative notification from nasdaq that we had regained compliance with rule c  and that the matter was therefore closed 
we cannot assure you that the closing bid price of our common stock will remain equal to or greater than per share in the future 
if the closing bid price of our common stock again falls below for more than thirty consecutive trading days  we will be subject to delisting by nasdaq  and required to regain compliance with rule c in order to maintain our listing on the nasdaq smallcap market 
if we were to be delisted from the nasdaq smallcap market  our common stock would be considered a penny stock under regulations of the securities and exchange commission and would therefore be subject to rules that impose additional sales practice requirements on broker dealers who sell our securities 
the additional burdens imposed upon broker dealers by these requirements could discourage broker dealers from effecting transactions in our common stock  which could severely limit the market liquidity of the common stock and your ability to sell our securities in the secondary market 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to maintain our listing on the nasdaq smallcap market 
in addition  the purchase agreements signed in connection with the december  and the january  closings of our recent private placement provide that if at any time during the two year period beginning on the respective closing dates of that placement our common stock is delisted from the nasdaq national smallcap market for any reason  the investors shall receive an amount in cash equal to of the aggregate purchase
