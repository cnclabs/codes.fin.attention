item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview general 
the company s core focus is providing operating leases of aftermarket commercial aircraft engines and other aircraft related equipment 
as of december   the company had a total portfolio of lessees in countries and its total lease portfolio consisted of engines and related equipment  six commuter aircraft and four spare parts packages with an aggregate net book value of million 
the company actively manages its portfolio and structures its leases in order to enhance residual values of leased assets 
the company s leasing business focuses on popular stage iii commercial jet aircraft engines manufactured by cfm  general electric  pratt whitney  rolls royce and international aero engines 
these engines are the most widely used aircraft engines in the world  powering airbus  boeing  and mcdonnell douglas aircraft 
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of consolidated financial statements requires the company to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an ongoing basis  the company evaluates its estimates  including those related to residual values  estimated asset lives  bad debts  income taxes  and contingencies and litigation 
the company bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
the company believes the following critical accounting policies affect its more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements 
leasing related activities 
revenue from leasing of aircraft equipment is recognized as operating lease or finance lease revenue over the terms of the applicable lease agreements 
where collection cannot be reasonably assured  for example  upon a lessee bankruptcy  the company does not recognize revenue 
the company also estimates and charges to income a provision for bad debts based on its experience in the business and with each specific customer and the level of past due accounts 
the financial condition of the company s customers may deteriorate and result in actual losses exceeding the estimated allowances 
in addition  any deterioration in the financial condition of the company s customers may adversely effect future lease revenues 
the vast majority of the company s leases are accounted for as operating leases 
under an operating lease  the company retains title to the leased equipment  thereby retaining the potential benefit and assuming the risk of the residual value of the leased equipment 
the company generally depreciates engines on a straight line basis over years to a residual value 
spare parts packages are generally depreciated on a straight line basis over years to a residual value 
aircraft are generally depreciated on a straight line basis over years to a residual value 
for assets that are leased with an intent to disassemble upon lease termination  the company depreciates the assets over their estimated lease term to a residual value based on an estimate of the wholesale value of the parts after disassembly 
if useful lives or residual values are lower than those estimated by the company  upon sale of the equipment  a loss may be realized 
a change in either of these estimates would cause an associated change in depreciation expense 
at the lease commencement  the company often collects  in advance  security deposits normally equal to at least one month s lease payment and  both at lease commencement and on an ongoing basis  maintenance reserves from the lessee based on the creditworthiness of the lessee 
the security deposit is returned to the lessee after all lease conditions have been met 
maintenance reserves are accumulated in accounts maintained by the company or the company s lenders and are used when normal repair associated with engine use or maintenance is required 
in many cases  to the extent that cumulative maintenance reserves are inadequate to fund normal repairs required prior to return of the engine to the company  the lessee is obligated to cover the shortfall 
recovery is therefore dependent on the financial condition of the lessee 
sales related activities 
for equipment sold out of the company s lease portfolio  the company recognizes the gain or loss associated with the sale as revenue 
gain consists of sales proceeds less the net book value of the equipment sold and any costs directly associated with the sale 
additionally  to the extent that any deposits or reserves are not included in the sale and the purchaser of the equipment assumes any liabilities associated therewith  such deposits and reserves are included in the gain on sale 
asset valuation 
the company periodically reviews its portfolio of assets for impairment in accordance with sfas  accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
such review necessitates estimates of current market values  residual values and component values 
the estimates are based on currently available market data and are subject to fluctuation from time to time 
the company initiates its review whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of a long lived asset may not be recoverable 
recoverability of an asset is measured by comparison of its carrying amount to the expected future undiscounted cash flows without interest charges that the asset is expected to generate 
any impairment to be recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds its fair market value 
significant management judgment is required in the forecasting of future operating results which are used in the preparation of projected undiscounted cash flows and should different conditions prevail  material write downs may occur 
for further information on these and other accounting policies adopted by the company  refer to note of the notes to consolidated financial statements

liquidity and capital resources historically  the company has financed its growth through borrowings secured by its equipment lease portfolio 
cash of approximately million  million and million  in the years ended december   and  respectively  was derived from this activity 
in these same time periods million  million and million  respectively  was used to pay down related debt or capital lease obligations 
on november   net proceeds from a private placement of common stock and options were approximately million 
cash flow from operating activities generated million  million and million in the years ended december   and respectively 
the company s primary use of funds is for the purchase of equipment for lease 
approximately million  million and million of funds were used for this purpose in the years ended december   and  respectively 
cash flows from operations are driven significantly by changes in revenue 
while the company has experienced some deterioration in lease rates  these have been offset by reductions in interest rates such that the spread between lease rates and interest rates has remained relatively constant throughout the lease revenue stream  in the short term  is at fixed rates while a substantial amount of the company s debt is at variable rates 
if interest rates increase it is unlikely the company could increase lease rates in the short term and this would cause a reduction in the company s earnings 
revenue is also affected by the amount of equipment off lease 
approximately  by book value  of the company s assets were off lease at december   compared to approximately at december   however  the average utilization rate for the year ended december   was compared to in the prior year 
the increased percentage of off lease equipment the company experienced was due to the overall condition of the airline industry  with many airline customers having difficulty forecasting their spare engine requirements 
increases in off lease rates as well as deterioration in lease rates that are not offset by reduction in interest rates  will have a negative impact in earnings and cash flows from operations 
at december   notes payable consists of bank loans totaling million payable over periods of to years with current interest rates varying between approximately and excluding the effect of the company s interest rate hedges 
the significant facilities are described below 
at december   the company had a million revolving credit facility to finance the acquisition of aircraft engines and spare parts for lease as well as for general working capital purposes 
as of december   this facility was fully drawn 
the facility matures in may the interest rate on this facility at december  was libor plus 
under the million revolver facility  all subsidiaries except wlfc ac and willis engine funding llc wef jointly and severally guarantee payment and performance of the terms of the loan agreement 
the maximum guarantee is million plus any accrued and unpaid interest  fees or reimbursements but is limited at any given time to the sum of the principal outstanding plus interest and fees 
the guarantee would be triggered by a default under the agreement and the lenders making a call under the guarantee 
the lenders have the option to make either a call to make up a payment or performance deficiency or it could be a full call of the loan 
during the quarter ended september   the company replaced its million debt warehouse facility with a million debt warehouse facility on similar terms but with a different group of lenders 
in december   the facility was increased to million 
a wholly owned special purpose entity  wef was created for the purpose of financing jet aircraft engines acquired by such finance subsidiary from the company 
the facility has a year revolving period ending september   followed  if not renewed  by a year amortization period 
however  the million increase in the facility is only available to be drawn up until march  the facility s structure is designed to facilitate public or private securitized notes intended to be issued by the special purpose finance subsidiary 
there is no assurance that a securitization can be completed or completed on terms that are favorable or acceptable to the company 
if a securitization cannot be completed  the company will be required to renegotiate this facility with its lenders 
refer to factors that may affect future results for further discussion of the risks the company faces 
the facility notes are divided into million class a notes and million class b notes 
the company has a guarantee to the class b noteholders determined by a formula in the debt agreement 
the maximum amount of the guarantee is million 
if wef defaults on its obligations  the full amount of the class b notes outstanding together with any accrued interest and fees is due and payable immediately 
at december  the guarantee is approximately million 
the assets of wef and any associated owner trust are not available to satisfy the obligations of the company or any of its affiliates  until all obligations are repaid 
the subsidiary is consolidated for financial statement presentation purposes 
at december   million is available under the facility 
interest on the class a notes is currently a commercial paper rate plus a weighted average spread of approximately 
interest on the class b notes is currently libor plus a weighted average spread of 
the spreads will increase by pre determined amounts during the loan to maximum average spreads of and  respectively  by september at december   the company had a million term loan facility available to a wholly owned consolidated subsidiary of the company  wlfc ac inc  for the financing of jet aircraft engines sold by the company to such subsidiary 
the facility is a five year term loan with final maturity of june  the interest rate is libor plus 
this facility is fully drawn 
the company has guaranteed the obligations of wlfc ac under the terms of this facility 
the lenders have the ability  upon default  to either call the full amount of the loan or draw upon the guarantee to cure a deficiency 
the maximum amount of the guarantee is therefore the principal sum outstanding plus any accrued and unpaid interest and fees 
in the fourth quarter ended december   the company repaid a million revolving credit facility with a financial institution 
borrowings under the facility accrued interest at a rate of libor plus per annum and were secured by specific engines and leases pledged to the lender 
the loan was repaid at a discount generating a net gain on prepayment of million 
at december   libor was approximately and the commercial paper rate was approximately 
at december   the rates were approximately and  respectively 
approximately million of the company s debt is repayable during such repayments consist of scheduled installments due under term loans 
the table below summarizes the company s contractual commitments at december  contractual payments due in thousands contractual obligation thereafter total debt operating leases on company premises purchase of equipment approximately million of the above debt is subject to the company continuing to comply with the covenants of each financing  including debt equity ratios  minimum tangible net worth and minimum interest coverage ratios  and other eligibility criteria including customer and geographic concentration restrictions 
in addition  the company can typically borrow between to of an engine purchase price and only between to of an aircraft or spare parts purchase price under these facilities  so the company must have other available funds for the balance of the purchase price of any new equipment to be purchased or it will not be permitted to draw on these facilities for a particular purchase 
the facilities are also cross defaulted 
if the company does not comply with the covenants or eligibility requirements  the company may not be permitted to borrow additional funds and accelerated payments may become necessary 
additionally  debt is secured by engines on lease to customers and to the extent that engines are returned from lease early or are sold  repayment of that portion of the debt could be accelerated 
the company was in compliance with all covenants at december  as a result of the floating rate structure of the majority of the company s borrowings  the company s interest expense associated with borrowings will vary with market rates 
in addition  commitment fees are payable on the unused portion of the facilities 
the company s lease of its office premises in sausalito expires on december  the sublease of company premises in san diego expires in november the company also has commitments to purchase equipment for delivery during  totaling approximately million 
the company also holds a interest  accounted for under the cost method  in a joint venture in china  sichuan snecma aero engine maintenance co 
ltd 
the company has invested million to date 
the company believes that its current equity base  internally generated funds and existing debt facilities are sufficient to maintain the company s current level of operations 
a decline in the level of internally generated funds such as could result if off lease rates increase or a decrease in the availability under the company s existing debt facilities would impair the company s ability to sustain its current level of operations 
the company is currently discussing additions to its debt base with its commercial and investment banks 
if the company is not able to access additional debt  its ability to continue to grow its asset base consistent with historical trends will be impaired and its future growth limited to that which can be funded from internally generated capital 
management of interest rate exposure at december   million of the company s borrowings were on a variable rate basis at various interest rates tied to libor or commercial paper rates 
the company s equipment leases are generally structured at fixed rental rates for specified terms 
increases in interest rates could narrow or eliminate the spread  or result in a negative spread  between the rental revenue the company realizes under its leases and the interest rate that the company pays under its borrowings 
to mitigate exposure to interest rate changes  the company has entered into interest rate swap agreements which have notional outstanding amounts of million  with remaining terms of between and months and fixed rates of between and 
the company has also purchased during  a number of forward commencing caps with notional amounts totaling million  terms of years  effective dates commencing in and rates capped at 
the fair value of the swaps at december  and was negative million and million respectively  representing a liability of the company 
the fair value of the caps at december  was positive million  representing an asset of the company 
interest expense for the year ended december   was increased due to the company s interest rate hedges by approximately million compared to million in the comparable period in for the year ended december   interest expense was reduced due to the company s interest rate hedges by approximately million 
the company will be exposed to risk in the event of non performance of the interest rate hedge counter parties 
the company anticipates that it may hedge additional amounts of its floating rate debt during the next several months  and has entered into a further swap contract in january with a million notional  fixed rate and a year term 
related party and similar transactions the company continues to use pgtc llc s services to repair refurbish engines prior to sale or re lease 
the company also sells engines to avioserv 
the company has also entered into put option arrangements regarding certain engines scheduled to be run to the end of their useful lives to sell them at the company s discretion  to avioserv at pre determined prices 
the company notified avioserv of its intention to exercise put options with respect to four engines and expects to close the puts during  subject to satisfactory resolution of a contract dispute with avioserv 
the company also leases office space from avioserv with the lease term expiring november the company entered into a business cooperation period with flightlease ag and sr technics group srt originally scheduled to end on november   however flightlease is now in liquidation  and srt has sold its interest in sr technics switzerland  to a group consisting of i an investment company and srt s management  and as a result  the cooperation agreement was terminated january  during the years ended december  and  respectively  there were no transactions initiated by either party 
flightlease and srt are members of flighttechnics  an entity that owns of the company s common stock 
the company leases engines to sr technics switzerland having a book value of approximately million with lease terms expiring in up to eight years 
the lease revenue represents less than of total revenues and sr technics switzerland is the single largest lessee of the company 
during the year ended december   the company entered into a contractor s agreement with a former executive of flightlease and current director of the company  hans joerg hunziker 
the agreement is for a one year term  ending september  to provide strategic advice and investigation into additional sources of capital 
factors that may affect future results except for historical information contained herein  the discussion in this report contains forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties  such as statements of the company s plans  objectives  expectations and intentions 
forward looking statements give the company s expectations about the future and are not guarantees 
forward looking statements speak only as of the date they are made  and the company does not undertake any obligation to update them to reflect changes that occur after that date 
the company s actual results could differ materially from those discussed herein 
factors that could cause or contribute to such differences include those discussed below 
the cautionary statements made in this report should be read as being applicable to all related forward looking statements wherever they appear in this report or in other written or oral statements by the company 
the business in which the company is engaged is capital intensive 
accordingly  the company s ability to successfully execute its business strategy and to sustain its operations is dependent  in large part  on the availability of debt and equity capital 
there can be no assurance that the necessary amount of capital will continue to be available to the company on favorable terms or at all 
the company s inability to obtain sufficient capital  or to renew its credit facilities could result in increased funding costs and would limit the company s ability to i add new equipment to its portfolio  ii fund its working capital needs  and iii finance possible future acquisitions 
the company s inability to obtain sufficient capital would have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and or results of operations 
the company retains title to the equipment that it leases to third parties 
upon termination of a lease  the company will seek to re lease or sell the equipment 
the company also engages in the selective purchase and resale of commercial aircraft engines 
on occasion  the company purchases engines without having a firm commitment for their lease or sale 
numerous factors  many of which are beyond the company s control  may have an impact on the company s ability to re lease or sell equipment on a timely basis  including the following i general market conditions  ii the condition of the equipment upon termination of the lease  iii the maintenance services performed during the lease term and  as applicable  the number of hours remaining until the next major maintenance is required  iv regulatory changes particularly those imposing environmental  maintenance and other requirements on the operation of aircraft engines  v changes in the supply of  or demand for  or cost of aircraft engines  and vi technological developments 
there is no assurance that the company will be able to re lease or sell equipment on a timely basis or on favorable terms 
the failure to re lease or sell aircraft equipment on a timely basis or on favorable terms could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and or results of operations 
the company experiences fluctuations in its operating results 
such fluctuations may be due to a number of factors  including i general economic conditions  ii the timing of sales of engines  iii financial difficulties experienced by airlines  especially us airlines  iv interest rates  v downturns in the air transportation industry  including the impact of september  events and changes in fuel prices vi unanticipated early lease termination or a default by a lessee  vii the timing of engine acquisitions  viii engine marketing activities  ix fluctuations in market prices for the company s assets  x downward pressure on lease rates  and xi the present possibility of war in iraq 
the company anticipates that fluctuations from period to period will continue in the future 
as a result  the company believes that comparisons to results of operations for preceding periods are not necessarily meaningful and that results of prior periods should not be relied upon as an indication of future performance 
as of december   approximately by value of the company s equipment available for lease was either off lease  on month to month leases or on leases expiring in at december   approximately by value of the company s equipment was similarly categorized 
the ability of the company to successfully remarket this equipment will have a significant impact on the company s future results and on its ability to draw under certain of its credit facilities 
a lessee may default in performance of its lease obligations and the company may be unable to enforce its remedies under a lease 
the company s inability to collect receivables due under a lease or to repossess aircraft equipment in the event of a default by a lessee could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and or results of operations 
various airlines have experienced financial difficulties in the past  certain airlines have filed for bankruptcy and a number of such airlines have ceased operations 
in the united states where a debtor seeks protection under chapter of title of the united states code the bankruptcy code  creditors are automatically stayed from enforcing their rights 
in the case of united states certificated airlines  section of the bankruptcy code provides certain relief to lessors of aircraft equipment 
the scope of section has been the subject of significant litigation and there is no assurance that the provisions of section will protect the company s investment in an aircraft  aircraft engines or parts in the event of a lessee s bankruptcy 
in addition  section does not apply to lessees located outside of the united states and applicable foreign laws may not provide comparable protection 
leases of spare parts may involve additional risks 
for example  it is likely to be more difficult to recover parts in the event of a lessee default and the residual value of parts may be less ascertainable than an engine 
the company s leases are generally structured at fixed rental rates for specified terms while many of the company s borrowings are at floating rates 
increases in interest rates could narrow or eliminate the spread  or result in a negative spread  between the rental revenue the company realizes under its leases and the interest rate the company pays under its borrowings  and have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and or results of operations 
for the twelve months ended december   of the company s lease revenue was generated by leases to foreign customers 
such international leases may present greater risks to the company because certain foreign laws  regulations and judicial procedures may not be as protective of lessor rights as those which apply in the united states 
all leases require payment in united states us currency

the markets for the company s products and services are extremely competitive  and the company faces competition from a number of sources 
these include aircraft  engine and aircraft parts manufacturers  aircraft and aircraft engine lessors and airline and aircraft service and repair companies 
certain of the company s competitors have substantially greater resources than the company  including greater name recognition  a broader range of material  complementary lines of business and greater financial  marketing and other resources

while the company has been able to purchase surplus inventory in this manner successfully in the past  there is no assurance that surplus aircraft and engines of the type required by the company s customers will be available on acceptable terms when needed in the future or that the company will continue to compete effectively in the purchase of such surplus equipment

such hedging activities may limit the company s ability to participate in the benefits of any decrease in interest rates  but may also protect the company from increases in interest rates
