the company consists of key technology  inc which directly owns four subsidiaries key technology fsc  inc  a foreign sales corporation fsc  key holdings usa llc  key technology australia pty 
ltd  and key technology amvc llc inactive 
key holdings usa llc owns suplusco holdings bv  its european subsidiary  which owns key technology bv key technology amvc llc owns applied laser system  inc inactive 
the company manufactures products in walla walla  washington  redmond  oregon  and beusichem  the netherlands 
the company acquired farmco and amvc on june  and july   respectively 
the operations of the acquired entities have been integrated into the operations of the company and are included in the consolidated financial statements from their respective acquisition dates 
application of critical accounting policies the company has identified its critical accounting policies  the application of which may materially affect the financial statements  either because of the significance of the financial statement item to which they relate  or because they require management judgment to make estimates and assumptions in measuring  at a specific point in time  events which will be settled in the future 
the critical accounting policies  judgments and estimates  which management believes have the most significant effect on the financial statements are set forth below revenue recognition allowances for doubtful accounts valuation of inventories long lived assets and statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
allowances for warranties accounting for income taxes management has discussed the development  selection and related disclosures of these critical accounting estimates with the audit committee of the company s board of directors 
revenue recognition 
the company recognizes revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred or services have been provided  the sale price is fixed or determinable  and collectibility is reasonably assured 
additionally  the company sells its goods on terms which transfer title and risk of loss at a specified location  typically shipping point  port of loading or port of discharge  depending on the final destination of the goods 
accordingly  revenue recognition from product sales occurs when all factors are met  including transfer of title and risk of loss  which occurs either upon shipment by the company or upon receipt by customers at the location specified in the terms of sale 
revenue earned from services is recognized ratably over the contractual period or as the services are performed 
if all conditions of revenue recognition are not met  the company defers revenue recognition 
in the event of revenue deferral  the sale value is not recorded as revenue to the company  accounts receivable are reduced by any amounts owed by the customer  and the cost of the goods or services deferred is carried in inventory 
the company believes that revenue recognition is a critical accounting estimate because the company s terms of sale vary significantly  and management exercises judgment in determining whether to defer revenue recognition 
such judgments may materially affect net sales for any period 
management exercises judgment within the parameters of accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america gaap in determining when contractual obligations are met  title and risk of loss are transferred  the sales price is fixed or determinable and collectibility is reasonably assured 
at september   the company had deferred million of revenue compared to million for the year ended september  allowances for doubtful accounts 
the company establishes allowances for doubtful accounts for specifically identified  as well as anticipated  doubtful accounts based on credit profiles of customers  current economic trends  contractual terms and conditions  and customers historical payment patterns 
factors that affect collectibility of receivables include customer satisfaction and general economic or political factors in certain countries that affect the ability of customers to meet current obligations 
the company actively manages its credit risk by utilizing an independent credit rating and reporting service  by requiring certain percentages of down payment and progress payments on significant customer projects and by requiring secured forms of payment for customers with uncertain credit profiles or located in certain countries 
forms of secured payment could include irrevocable letters of credit  bank guarantees  third party leasing arrangements or ex im bank guarantees  each utilizing uniform commercial code filings  or the like  with governmental entities where possible 
the company believes that the accounting estimate related to allowances for doubtful accounts is a critical accounting estimate because it requires management judgment in making assumptions relative to customer or general economic factors that are outside the company s control 
as of september  the balance sheet included allowances for doubtful accounts of  actual charges to the allowance for doubtful accounts for fiscal and were  and  respectively 
accruals for bad debt expense increases in the allowance for fiscal and were  and  respectively 
if the company experiences actual bad debt expense in excess of estimates  or if estimates are adversely adjusted in future periods  the carrying value of accounts receivable would decrease and charges for bad debts would increase  resulting in decreased net earnings 
valuation of inventories 
inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market 
the company s inventory includes purchased raw materials  manufactured components  purchased components  work in process  finished goods and demonstration equipment 
provisions for excess and obsolete inventories are made after periodic evaluation of historical sales  current economic trends  forecasted sales  estimated product lifecycles and estimated inventory levels 
the factors that contribute to inventory valuation risks are the company s purchasing practices  electronic component obsolescence  accuracy of sales and production forecasts  introduction of new products  product lifecycles and the associated product support 
the company actively manages its exposure to inventory valuation risks by maintaining low safety stocks and minimum purchase lots  utilizing just in time purchasing practices  managing product end of life issues brought on by aging components or new product introductions  and by utilizing such inventory minimization strategies as vendor managed inventories 
the company believes that the accounting estimate related to valuation of inventories is a critical accounting estimate because it is susceptible to changes from period to period due to the requirement for management to make estimates relative to each of the underlying factors ranging from purchasing to sales to production to after sale support 
at september   cumulative inventory adjustments to lower of cost or market totaled million compared to million for the year ended september  if actual demand  market conditions or product lifecycles are adversely different from those estimated by management  inventory adjustments to lower market values would result in a reduction to the carrying value of inventory  an increase in inventory write offs  a decrease to gross margins and may adversely affect the borrowing base available under the company s credit facilities 
long lived assets and sfas no 
the company regularly reviews all of its long lived assets  including property  plant and equipment  goodwill and other intangible assets  for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
if the total of future undiscounted cash flows is less than the carrying amount of assets  an impairment loss  if any  based on the excess of the carrying amount over the fair value of the assets  is recorded 
as of september   the company held million of property  plant and equipment  goodwill and other intangible assets  net of depreciation and amortization 
estimates of future cash flows arising from the utilization of these long lived assets and estimated useful lives associated with the assets are critical to the assessment of fair values 
the company believes that the accounting estimate related to long lived assets is a critical accounting estimate because it is susceptible to change from period to period due to the requirement for management to make assumptions about future sales and cost of sales generated throughout the lives of several product lines over extended periods of time  and the potential effect that recognizing an impairment could have on the assets reported on the company s balance sheet and the potential material adverse effect on reported earnings or loss 
changes in these estimates could result in a determination of asset impairment  which would result in a reduction to the carrying value  a charge to income from continuing operations and a reduction to net earnings in the affected period  and may affect the company s ability to meet the tangible net worth covenant of its credit facilities 
the company elected to adopt sfas no 
prior to its filing of its first quarter financial statements on form q for the quarter ending december  sfas no 
requires  among other things  the discontinuance of goodwill amortization 
in addition  the standard includes provisions for the reclassification of certain existing recognized intangibles  reclassification of certain intangibles out of previously reported goodwill  and the identification of reporting units for purposes of assessing potential future impairments of goodwill 
as a result of the implementation of this change in accounting principle  the company recorded an impairment charge associated with goodwill for the automated inspection systems reporting unit  effective at the beginning of fiscal  of million  and related income tax benefits of  the company determined there was no impairment to the million of goodwill associated with the process systems reporting unit 
the impairment of goodwill was reported as a change in accounting principle  which is reported separately from the results of continuing operations  and included separate earnings per share disclosures 
any impairment of intangible assets subsequent to the adoption of sfas no 
would be reported as a charge to income from continuing operations and a reduction in net earnings in the affected period 
the company recorded no impairment charge in fiscal allowances for warranties 
the company s products are covered by warranty plans that extend between days and years  depending upon the product and contractual terms of sale 
the company establishes allowances for warranties for specifically identified  as well as anticipated  warranty claims based on contractual terms  product conditions and actual warranty experience by product line 
company products include both manufactured and purchased components  and therefore warranty plans include third party sourced parts which may not be covered by the third party manufacturer s warranty 
ultimately  the warranty experience of the company is directly attributable to the quality of its products 
the company actively manages its quality program by using a structured product introduction plan  process monitoring techniques utilizing statistical process controls  vendor quality metrics  a quality training curriculum for every employee and feedback loops to communicate warranty claims to designers and engineers for remediation in future production 
warranty expense has varied widely in the past due to such factors as significant new product introductions containing defects and design errors on individual projects 
the company believes that the accounting estimate related to allowances for warranties is a critical accounting estimate because it is susceptible to significant fluctuation period to period due to the requirement for management to make assumptions about future warranty claims relative to potential unknown issues arising in both existing and new products  which assumptions are derived from historical trends of known or resolved issues  and risks associated with third party supplied components being manufactured using processes that the company does not control 
as of september   the balance sheet included warranty reserves of  while million of warranty charges were incurred during the fiscal year then ended  compared to warranty reserves of  and warranty charges of million for the year ended september  if the company s actual warranty costs are higher than estimates  warranty plan coverages are adversely varied  or estimates are adversely adjusted in future periods  reserves for warranty would decrease  warranty expense would increase and gross margins would decrease 
accounting for income taxes 
the company s provision for income taxes and the determination of the resulting deferred tax assets and liabilities involves a significant amount of management judgment 
the quarterly provision for income taxes is based partially upon estimates of pre tax financial accounting income for the full year and is affected by various differences between financial accounting income and taxable income 
judgment is also applied in determining whether the deferred tax assets will be realized in full or in part 
in management s judgment  when it is more likely than not that all or some portion of specific deferred tax assets such as foreign tax credit carryovers will not be realized  a valuation allowance must be established for the amount of the deferred tax assets that are determined not to be realizable 
there was no valuation allowance at september   due to anticipated utilization of all tax deferred tax assets 
during the period  income tax expense was reduced by approximately  due primarily to changes in tax laws which re characterized previously non deductible items 
the company believes that the accounting estimate related to income taxes is a critical accounting estimate because it relies on significant management judgment in making assumptions relative to temporary and permanent timing differences of tax effects  estimates of future earnings  prospective application of changing tax laws in multiple jurisdictions  and the resulting ability to utilize tax assets at those future dates 
if the company s operating results were to fall short of expectations  thereby affecting the likelihood of realizing the deferred tax assets  judgment would have to be applied to determine the amount of the valuation allowance required to be included in the financial statements established in any given period 
establishing or increasing a valuation allowance would reduce the carrying value of the deferred tax asset  increase tax expense and reduce net earnings 
currently  congress is deliberating legislative action to replace the current extra territorial income exclusion act of eti  due to rulings by the world trade organization that it was an illegal export subsidy 
potential legislation could adversely affect the company by eliminating or reducing the eti exclusions  thereby increasing its effective tax rate or changing corporate tax rates which could require revaluation of the company s deferred tax benefits 
tax benefits to the company as part of this legislation could potentially offset some  if not all  of these adverse consequences  although not necessarily in the same fiscal year 
results of operations fiscal year compared to fiscal year net sales increased to million in fiscal  up million from million in fiscal sales growth occurred over all three of the company s major product lines 
the company handled two large projects totaling million in fiscal that added to both automated inspection system and process system sales 
automated inspection systems sales were higher than in the previous year with increases in the tegra  optyx  and tobacco sorter product lines 
process systems sales grew by in year over year comparison helped by vibratory product line growth as well as strong growth in the company s netherlands subsidiary

gross profit increased million to million  or of net sales  in fiscal from million  or of net sales  in the gross profit  as a percentage of net sales in fiscal as compared to fiscal  improved due to the growth in higher margin parts sales  favorable manufacturing efficiencies due to volume  and cost reductions primarily in warranty expenses

other income and expense includes interest income and expense  royalty income and other income or expense from miscellaneous sources 
total other income and expense reflected million in expenses for fiscal compared to million expenses for fiscal interest expense in fiscal dropped million due to lower interest bearing debt levels  and foreign currency transaction gains of million were recognized 
in fiscal  the company recognized million associated with the withdrawal of a tender offer for the redemption of preferred stock  and million in losses from the early retirement of debt that did not repeat in the company s effective income tax rate was in fiscal  compared to in fiscal the effective tax rate varies from the statutory rate of due to permanent differences arising from extra territorial income exclusions  research and development tax credits  and other permanent differences  plus the inclusion of the effective state income tax rate 
in fiscal  the effective rate was also reduced by due to changes in tax laws which re characterized previously non deductible expenses

sales of parts and service contracts increased by  which was more than offset by decreases in sales of automated inspection systems and process systems of and  respectively  in fiscal compared to fiscal acquired product lines  exclusive of parts and service  contributed approximately and of the systems sold in fiscal and  respectively 
the acquisition of amvc also helped the company s strategy of diversification  as net sales of non food systems  principally to the tobacco industry  rose to represent and of system sales in fiscal and  respectively 
the incremental net sales from acquired product lines were partially offset by decreased net sales from the company s traditional business  the food processing industry in the united states  during both fiscal and fiscal the soft markets experienced in fiscal continued through much of fiscal as sales to the food processing industry continued to be unfavorably affected by market factors  including the consolidation among food processors and softness in the vegetable industry 
gross profit was and of net sales in fiscal and  respectively 
the gross profit  as a percentage of net sales in fiscal as compared to fiscal  benefited from improvements in efficiencies across most product lines  including improvements in utilization of production and service capacity  and cost cutting measures taken during fiscal and the first quarter of fiscal automated inspection systems gross profit  as a percent of net sales  increased by seven percentage points in fiscal over fiscal  principally as the result of a decrease in other costs of sale  largely due to improved utilization of manufacturing facilities  with a lesser contribution coming from decreased warranty costs 
the gross profit for process systems between fiscal and fiscal was comparable with improvements in manufacturing efficiencies offset by increases in warranty expenses  due principally to two french fry projects in europe 
parts and service contracts gross profit  as a percent of net sales  increased by eight percentage points in fiscal from fiscal  principally as the result of improved utilization of field service personnel 
operating expenses decreased by to million in fiscal from million in fiscal  and represented  and of net sales in each such year  respectively

activities in fiscal focused on extending the capabilities and applications of the technologies contained in optyx  tegra and prism  and development of new inspection technologies 
the reduced levels of research and development expenses experienced in fiscal were the result of the full integration of the research and development activities of the acquired companies 
general and administrative expenses decreased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal  and represented of net sales in each such year  respectively 
general and administrative expenses decreased in fiscal compared to fiscal as a result of elimination of nonrecurring and redundant costs experienced in fiscal as the company integrated the acquisitions made in fiscal these cost savings were partially offset by increased accounting and legal costs incurred during fiscal with regard to the sfas no 
implementation and work on alternatives to meet the potential preferred stock redemption obligation 
the decrease in amortization of intangibles  representing of net sales  for fiscal when compared to fiscal is the result of implementation of sfas no 
 which eliminated amortization of goodwill and certain intangible assets 
the company obtained independent appraisals of the fair market value of the amvc intangible assets acquired 
acquired intangible assets  including patents  existing technologies  trademarks  trade names and purchased customer development  are amortized over the shorter of their remaining lives or periods of years 
other income and expense includes interest income and expense  royalty income and other income or expense from miscellaneous sources 
net interest expense in fiscal was  compared to million in fiscal the decrease in net interest expense in fiscal compared to fiscal resulted from decreases in interest rates  both as a result of reductions in prime rate and reduced rates on refinanced debt  and decreases in total debt 
during fiscal  as part of the company s efforts to establish alternatives to meet the potential obligation arising from the redemption of preferred stock  the company embarked upon a tender offer to holders of that stock 
with the success of the refinance of the company s credit facilities  which provided funds for redemption  the tender offer was discontinued and  of associated costs was charged to other expense 
the company also recognized loan amortization costs of  for fiscal while fiscal had no such costs 
during fiscal  the company received royalty payments of  compared to total royalty income of  in fiscal during fiscal  the company recognized foreign currency transaction gains totaling  on cash and accounts receivable held primarily in euros and dutch guilders 
this compares to foreign currency transaction gains of  in fiscal during the second quarter of fiscal  the company restructured its credit facility with its senior lender and  in the fourth fiscal quarter  refinanced its credit facility with a new senior lender 
each of these activities resulted in the expensing of unamortized loan origination fees 
in addition  during the third quarter of fiscal  the company sold its surplus manufacturing facility in medford  oregon  moved its medford staff into a smaller leased portion of that same facility and paid off the mortgage secured by that facility 
the early payoff of the mortgage resulted in a prepayment penalty and write off of associated unamortized loan costs 
the total charge for these items during fiscal was  compared to no such charges in fiscal on october   the company completed the sale of its wholly owned subsidiary  ventek  inc  which supplied machine vision systems to the forest products industry

net earnings from continuing operations for fiscal was million  or per diluted share  compared with a net loss from continuing operations of million  or per diluted share  for fiscal net earnings or loss for each period is adjusted by the accretion of mandatorily redeemable preferred stock in calculating the associated earnings per share 
the increase in net income from continuing operations in fiscal was due to the cost cutting measures employed in late fiscal and early to reduce spending and return the company to profitability  and improvements in gross margins and operating expenses from the non recurrence of merger related and integration charges incurred in fiscal  which totaled million  or million after tax 
the company reported a net loss for fiscal of million  or per diluted share  after giving effect to earnings from a discontinued operation and the losses due to the change in accounting principle

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company has assessed its exposure to market risks for its financial instruments and has determined that its exposures to such risks are generally limited to those affected by the strength of the us dollar against the euro and to a lesser extent the australian dollar 
the terms of sales to european customers are typically denominated in either euros  us dollars  or to a far lesser extent  the respective legacy currencies of its european customers 
the terms of sales to customers in australia are typically denominated in their local currency 
the company expects that its standard terms of sale to international customers  other than those in europe and australia  will continue to be denominated in us dollars 
for sales transactions between international customers  including european customers  and the company s domestic operations which are denominated in currencies other than us dollars  the company assesses its currency exchange risk and may enter into a currency hedging transaction to minimize such risk 
at september   the company was not a party to any currency hedging transaction 
as of september   management estimates that a change in foreign exchange rates would affect net income before taxes by approximately  on an annual basis as a result of converted cash and accounts receivable denominated in foreign currencies 
during the company s fiscal  the euro gained a net of in value against the us dollar 
the effect of the weaker dollar on the operations and financial results of the company were translation adjustments of  net of income tax  were recognized as a component of comprehensive income in the company s consolidated statement of shareholders equity as a result of converting the euro denominated balance sheet of key technology bv into bv dollars 
foreign exchange gains of  were recognized in the other income and expense section of the consolidated income statement as a result of conversion of euro and other foreign currency denominated receivables and cash carried on the balance sheet of the us operations  as well as the result of the conversion of other non functional currency receivables  payables and cash carried on the balance sheet of the european operations 
a relatively weaker us dollar on the world markets makes the company s us manufactured goods relatively less expensive to international customers when denominated in us dollars or potentially more profitable to the company when denominated in a foreign currency 
a relatively weaker us dollar on the world markets  especially as measured against the euro  may favorably affect the company s market and economic outlook for international sales
