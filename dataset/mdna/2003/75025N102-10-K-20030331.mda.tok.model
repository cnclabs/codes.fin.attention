item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements of the company including the notes thereto contained elsewhere in this report 
overview the company derives its revenues primarily from the sale of integrated systems  including software  hardware and related support and professional services 
in addition  the company offers implementation and integration services which are primarily billed on a per diem basis 
the company also derives revenues from fixed fee services arrangements that are recognized under the percentage of completion method of accounting 
the company s revenues from its various technology solutions are  for the most part  dependent on the number of installed sites for a client 
accordingly  while the typical sale is the result of a long  complex process  the company s clients usually continue installing additional sites over an extended period of time 
revenues from software and systems sales are recognized as products are shipped  provided that collection is probable  persuasive evidence of an agreement exists  the fee is fixed or determinable and no significant post shipment vendor obligations remain 
revenues from client support  maintenance and other services are generally recognized as the service is performed 
in  the company began developing its new generation of management systems products radiant e enterprise productivity suite  formerly wave 
this product architecture is designed to combine and expand the functionality of the company s site management systems and headquarters based management systems 
the company s architecture and platforms for these products are entirely web based  which the company believes will enable it to increase the functionality while decreasing the costs of implementing and maintaining technology solutions for retailers 
management believes that these products will strengthen the company s offerings by providing integrated  end to end solutions that span from the consumer to the supply chain 
the radiant e enterprise productivity suite was generally released during the first quarter of the company offers its radiant e enterprise productivity suite both through the application service provider  or asp  delivery model as well as through installations directly in client locations as client hosted systems 
in instances where clients select the asp delivery model  the company will remotely host applications from an off site central server that users can access over dedicated lines  virtual private networks or the internet 
the company is continuing to establish strategic relationships to facilitate sales of its radiant e enterprise productivity suite 
in connection with its strategy to develop asp delivered products  in april the company began offering certain new and existing products on a subscription based pricing model 
under this subscription based pricing model  clients pay a fixed  monthly fee for use of these products  as well as the radiant e enterprise productivity suite and the necessary hosting services to utilize those applications and solutions 
this subscription based offering represents a change in the company s historical pricing model in which clients were charged an initial licensing fee for use of the company s products and additional fees for continuing maintenance and support during the license period 
to date  the company continues to derive a majority of its revenue from these legacy products under its traditional sales model of one time software license fees  hardware sales and software maintenance and support fees 
based on this historical trend  the company anticipates that clients purchasing the company s legacy products will continue to favor the one time software license and hardware purchases over the subscription based pricing model for the foreseeable future 
although the company s subscription based revenues to date have been immaterial to total revenues  the company expects that the radiant e enterprise productivity suite will lead to an increase in the percentage of recurring revenues coming from subscription based offerings 
as a result of offering clients a subscription based pricing model and the anticipated decline of revenues from legacy site management and headquarters solutions  the company expects to see a decline in the one time revenues from legacy software license fees  replaced over time by monthly subscription fees 
in addition  the company expects revenues from maintenance and support from existing clients to decline and to be replaced by subscription fees should existing clients convert to the subscription based pricing model 
although the company anticipates that most sales of the radiant e enterprise productivity suite will be under the subscription based pricing model  market demands may require the company  or the company may decide  to sell the enterprise product software under its traditional sales model of one time software license fees along with on going software maintenance and support fees 
this change in the company s product strategy to develop and offer asp delivered and internet solutions and the transition to a subscription based pricing model involve certain risks and assumptions 
there can be no assurance that the company will successfully implement these changes in its organization  product strategy or pricing model  that clients will embrace an internet based product or that the changes will not have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition or results of operations 
to date  the company s primary source of revenues has been large client rollouts of the company s products  which are typically characterized by the use of fewer  larger contracts 
these contracts typically involve longer negotiating cycles  require the dedication of substantial amounts of working capital and other resources  and in general require costs that may substantially precede recognition of associated revenues 
during the third quarter ended september   the company began to experience a decline in revenues and negative operating results 
the company attributed this decline primarily to the global economic environment at that time and the product transition the company was undertaking in advance of the general release of the radiant e enterprise productivity suite 
in response to these circumstances  during the latter part of the third quarter and throughout the fourth quarter of  the company  in addition to other measures  downsized its personnel by in order to contain its operating costs 
in conjunction with the company s efforts to reduce its operating costs  in the fourth quarter of the company initiated a change in compensation to its senior management team 
under this plan  each individual was granted a certain number of stock options in return for a specified reduction in salary compensation 
as part of this plan  in return for annual salary reductions of approximately million through mid october  the company issued approximately  options to the senior management team at an exercise price of per share 
the options vest in various increments over months from their issue date 
although the company s revenues have increased during the year ended december  compared to revenues over the same period a year ago  if the company s product transition or industry acceptance of the radiant e enterprise productivity suite progresses slower than currently anticipated or if the economic downturn continues or worsens  the company believes it could again experience a decline in revenues and negative operating results 
additionally  during the fourth quarter of  salaries previously forfeited by the company s senior leadership team were reinstated  which results in an additional ongoing expense of approximately  per quarter 
on april  the company effected a for stock split 
all historical share data and weighted average shares have been restated to account for this split

critical accounting estimates general the company s discussion and analysis of its financial condition and results of operations are based upon its consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires the company s management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  the company evaluates its estimates  including those related to revenue recognition  product returns  bad debts  inventories  intangible assets  and income taxes 
the company bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
an accounting estimate is a critical accounting estimate for purposes of this disclosure only if it meets two criteria 
first  the accounting estimate must require the company to make assumption about matters that are highly uncertain at the time of the accounting estimate is made 
second  it must be the case that different estimates that the company reasonably could have used for the accounting estimate in the current period  or changes in the accounting estimate that are reasonably likely to occur from period to period  would have a material impact on the presentation of the company s financial condition  changes in financial condition or results of operations 
management believes the following critical accounting policies affect its more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition the company s revenue is generated primarily through software and system sales  support and maintenance  and other services 
the company recognizes revenue using the guidance from aicpa statement of position sop  software revenue recognition  as amended by sop  modification of sop  software revenue recognition  with respect to certain transactions  sop  accounting for performance of construction type and certain production type contracts sop  accounting research bulletin arb no 
 long term construction type contracts arb  sec staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition in financial statements and emerging issues task force no 
  application of aicpa statement of position to arrangements that include the right to use software stored on another entity s hardware 
under these guidelines  the company recognizes revenue when the following criteria are met persuasive evidence of an agreement exists  delivery of the product has occurred  the fee is fixed or determinable  collectibility is reasonably assured  and remaining obligations under the agreement are insignificant 
under multiple element arrangements  where each element is separately stated  sold and priced  the company allocates revenues to the various elements based on vendor specific objective evidence vsoe of fair value 
the company s vsoe of fair value is determined based on the price charged when the same element is sold separately 
if evidence of fair value does not exist for all elements in a multiple element arrangement  the company recognizes revenue using the residual method 
under the residual method  the fair value of the undelivered elements is deferred and the remaining portion of the arrangement is recognized as revenue 
under contracts where revenue is recognized using the percentage of completion method under the provisions of sop  the company measures its progress to completion by using input measures  primarily labor hours 
the company continually updates and revises estimates of its input measures 
if those estimates indicate a loss will be incurred  the entire loss is recognized in that period 
allowance for doubtful accounts the company maintains allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of clients to make required payments 
estimates are developed by using standard quantitative measures based on historical losses  adjusting for current economic conditions and  in some cases  evaluating specific client accounts for risk of loss 
the establishment of reserves requires the use of judgment and assumptions regarding the potential for losses on receivable balances 
though the company considers these balances adequate and proper  if the financial condition of its clients or channel partners were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
inventories inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market value 
cost is principally determined by the first in  first out method 
the company records adjustments to the value of inventory based upon its forecasted plans to sell its inventories 
the physical condition eg  age and quality of the inventories is also considered in establishing its valuation 
these adjustments are estimates  which could vary significantly  either favorably or unfavorably  from actual requirements if future economic conditions  client inventory levels or competitive conditions differ from expectations 
intangible assets the company has significant intangible assets related to goodwill and other acquired intangibles as well as capitalized software costs 
the determination of related estimated useful lives and whether or not these assets are impaired involves significant judgments 
changes in strategy and or market conditions could significantly impact these judgments and require adjustments to recorded asset balances 
in accordance with sfas no 
the company evaluates the carrying value of goodwill during the fourth quarter of each year and between annual evaluations if events occur or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of the reporting unit below its carrying amount 
such circumstances could include  but are not limited to  a significant adverse change in legal factors or in business climate  unanticipated competition  or an adverse action or assessment by a regulator 
when evaluating whether goodwill is impaired  the company compares the fair value of the reporting unit to which the goodwill is assigned to its carrying amount  including goodwill 
if the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value  then the amount of the impairment loss must be measured 
the impairment loss would be calculated by comparing the implied fair value of reporting unit goodwill to its carrying amount 
in calculating the implied fair value of goodwill  the fair value of the reporting unit is allocated to all of the other assets and liabilities of that unit based on their fair values 
the excess of the fair value of a reporting unit over the amount assigned to its other assets and liabilities is the implied fair value of goodwill 
an impairment loss would be recognized when the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds its implied fair value 
the company s evaluation of goodwill completed during in accordance with sfas no 
resulted in no impairment losses 
the company s software development processes and procedures determine the timing of capitalization of certain development costs 
in addition  these software development processes and procedures determine whether the cost is classified as development expense or cost of license fees 
management is required to use its judgment in determining whether development costs meet the criteria for immediate expense or capitalization 
income taxes the company has significant amounts of deferred tax assets that are reviewed for recoverability and valued accordingly 
these assets are evaluated by using estimates of future taxable income streams and the impact of tax planning strategies 
valuations related to tax accruals and assets could be impacted by changes to tax codes  changes in statutory tax rates and the company s future taxable income levels
