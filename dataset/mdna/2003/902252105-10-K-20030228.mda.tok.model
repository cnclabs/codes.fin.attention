critical accounting policies and estimates our discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states gaap 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements  the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
the notes to the consolidated financial statements contained herein describe our significant accounting policies used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates  including  but not limited to  those related to intangible assets  bad debts and our long term service contracts 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements revenue recognition 
we recognize revenues in accordance with the provisions of the american institute of certified public accountants statement of position sop  software revenue recognition  as amended by sop and sop  as well as technical practice aids issued from time to time by the american institute of certified public accountants  and in accordance with the sec staff accounting bulletin no 
revenue recognition in financial statements 
our revenues are derived from software licenses  hardware  postcontract customer support maintenance and services that typically range from installation  training and basic consulting to software modification and customization to meet specific customer needs 
for multiple element software arrangements  which do not entail the performance of services that are considered essential to the functionality of the software  we generally record revenue when the delivered products or performed services result in a legally enforceable claim 
we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts  sales adjustments and estimated cost of product warranties  which are provided at the time the revenue is recognized 
since most of our customers are governmental entities  we rarely incur a loss resulting from the inability of a customer to make required payments 
occasionally  customers may become dissatisfied with the functionality of the software products and or the quality of the services and request a reduction of the total contract price or similar concession 
while we engage in extensive product and service quality assurance programs and processes  our allowances for these contract price reductions may need to be revised in the future 
in connection with our customer contracts and the adequacy of related allowances and measures of progress towards contract completion  our project managers are charged with the responsibility to continually review the status of each customer on a specific contract basis 
also  management at our corporate offices as well as at our operating companies review on at least a quarterly basis significant past due accounts receivable and the adequacy of related reserves 
events or changes in circumstances that indicate that the carrying amount for the allowances for doubtful accounts  sales adjustments and estimated cost of product warranties may require revision  include  but are not limited to  deterioration of a customer s financial condition  failure to manage our customer s expectations regarding the scope of the services to be delivered  and defects or errors in new versions or enhancements of our software products 
for those minimal number of software arrangements that include customization of the software  which is considered essential to its functionality  and for substantially all of our real estate appraisal outsourcing projects  we recognize revenue and profit as the work progresses using the percentage of completion method 
this method relies on estimates of total expected contract revenue  billings and collections and expected contract costs 
we follow this method since reasonably dependable estimates of revenue and costs applicable to various stages of a contract can be made 
at times  we perform additional and or non contractual services for little to no incremental fee  to satisfy customer expectations 
if changes occur in delivery  productivity or other factors used in developing our estimates of expected costs or revenues  we revise our cost and revenue estimates  and any revisions are charged to income in the period in which the facts that give rise to that revision first become known 
intangible assets and goodwill 
our business acquisitions typically result in the creation of goodwill and other intangible asset balances  and these balances affect the amount and timing of future period amortization expense  as well as expense we could possibly incur as a result of an impairment charge 
the cost of acquired companies is allocated to identifiable tangible and intangible assets based on estimated fair value  with the excess allocated to goodwill 
accordingly  we have a significant balance of acquisition date intangible assets  including software  customer base and goodwill 
in addition  we capitalize software development costs incurred subsequent to the establishment of technological feasibility on a specific software project 
certain of these intangible assets are amortized over their estimated useful lives 
all intangible assets with definite and indefinite lives are reviewed for impairment annually or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
recoverability of goodwill is generally measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to its fair value generally determined by estimated future net cash flows expected to be generated by the asset 
recoverability of other intangible assets is generally measured by comparison of the carrying amount to estimated undiscounted future cash flows 
the assessment of recoverability or of the estimated useful life for amortization purposes will be affected if the timing or the amount of estimated future operating cash flows is not achieved 
events or changes in circumstances that indicate the carrying amount may not be recoverable include  but are not limited to  a significant decrease in the market value of the business or asset acquired  a significant adverse change in the extent or manner in which the business or asset acquired is used or a significant adverse change in the business climate 
in addition  products  capabilities  or technologies developed by others may render our software products obsolete or non competitive

software license revenues increased million  or  for the year ended december   compared to during  we recognized approximately million in license revenues from four customers for real estate appraisal software  while we recorded minimal license revenues from appraisal software in the remainder of the increase in software license revenues was related to expansion of our financial and city solutions software products into the midwest and the western united states  and was aided by the release of several new financial and city solutions products and enhancements 
our financial and city solutions software products automate accounting systems for cities  counties  school districts  public utilities and not for profit organizations 
software services revenues 
for the year ended december   software services revenues increased million  or  compared to the increase in software services is primarily related to higher software license sales 
typically  contracts for software licenses include services such as installation of the software  conversion of customer data to be compatible with the new software and training customer personnel to use the software 
in addition  software services revenues for included approximately million for services performed under an million contract signed with the state of minnesota in july to install our new odyssey court case management system 
the minnesota contract includes both software license and software services but no license revenues were recognized under the contract in approximately of the installation is expected to be performed by late the remainder of the installation is expected to be performed from through maintenance revenues 
for the year ended december   maintenance revenue increased million  or  from million for we provide maintenance and support services for our software products  third party software and hardware 
the maintenance revenue increase was due to growth in our installed customer base and slightly higher rates 
during  we received and recorded as revenue a one time settlement of approximately  from a third party provider of maintenance services relating to past services 
excluding this settlement  maintenance revenue increased approximately for the year ended december  compared to the prior year 
appraisal services revenues 
appraisal services revenues increased million  or  for the year ended december   compared to the increase was primarily related to our contract with lake county  indiana  which was first awarded in december the contract to provide professional services and technology to reassess real property in lake county is valued at million  of which million relates to appraisal services  and is expected to be completed by late during  appraisal services revenue also included million of appraisal revenue related to our contract with the nassau county  new york board of assessors nassau county  which was comparable to the amount recognized in substantially all of the work related to nassau county contract had been completed as of december  cost of revenues cost of software license revenues 
for the year ended december   cost of software license revenues increased million  or  compared to the prior year  primarily due to higher amortization expense of software development costs 
in  we had several products in the development stage  which were released beginning in the third quarter of once a product is available for general release  we begin to expense the costs associated with the development generally over the estimated useful life of the product 
development costs mainly consist of personnel costs  such as salary and benefits paid to our software developers  rent for related office space and capitalized interest costs 
cost of software service and maintenance revenues 
for the year ended december   cost of software services and maintenance revenues increased million  or  compared to this increase is consistent with the higher software services and maintenance revenues for the same period  although software services and maintenance revenues grew at a higher rate than the cost of those revenues  which is reflective of more efficient utilization of our support and maintenance staff and economies of scale 
as a percentage of related revenues  cost of software services and maintenance was in compared to in cost of appraisal services revenues 
for the year ended december   cost of appraisal service revenue increased approximately million  or  compared to the year ended december  this increase is consistent with the increase in appraisal services revenue  which also rose compared to the prior year 
cost of appraisal services revenues as a percentage of appraisal services revenue was for compared to for gross profit for the years ended december  and  our overall gross margin was and  respectively 
the gross margin benefited from a product mix that included more software license revenues and higher maintenance revenues than the prior year 
software license revenues have lower associated costs than other revenues such as software and appraisal services  third party software and hardware 
in addition  utilization of our personnel that provide services and support has improved  which has increased our overall gross profit 
the increase in our gross profit was offset slightly by higher software development amortization during selling  general and administrative expenses selling  general and administrative expenses  or sg a  increased million  or  for the year ended december  compared to the prior year 
as a percentage of revenues  sg a was in compared to in the million increase in sg a was related primarily to higher costs with respect to sales commissions  and increases in health and other insurance expenses 
amortization of acquisition intangibles our amortization of acquisition intangibles for the year ended december  amounted to million  including million for amortization of goodwill and workforce costs 
effective january   we adopted statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
as a result of adopting sfas no 
 we ceased amortizing goodwill and workforce after december  the remaining amortization consisted of those costs allocated to our customer base and acquisition date software 
see further discussion of the effect of adopting sfas no 
in note in notes to the consolidated financial statements 
interest income expense our cash balances have increased significantly during due to cash generated from operations  the receipt of proceeds from the sale of certain discontinued businesses and the exercise of stock options 
in we invested excess cash in money market investments 
offsetting interest income from these money market investments was  of interest expense for an outstanding million note payable 
as a result  we had net interest income of  for the year ended december  compared to net interest expense of  for in addition  during the years ended december  and  we capitalized  and  respectively  of interest costs related to capitalized software development costs 
income tax provision we had an effective income tax rate of for the year ended december  for the year ended december   we had an effective income tax rate of 
our effective income tax rate in both years exceeded the federal statutory rate of due primarily to the net effect of state income taxes and items that are non deductible for federal income tax purposes  including certain non tax deductible goodwill amortization in periods prior to discontinued operations discontinued operations consists of the operating results of the information and property records services segment which we discontinued in december  two non operating subsidiaries relating to a formerly owned subsidiary that we sold in december and an automotive parts distributor that we sold in march on september   we sold certain net assets of kofile  inc and another subsidiary  our interest in a certain intangible work product  and a building and related building improvements the kofile sale for a cash sale price of million 
effective december   we sold for cash our land records business unit  consisting of business resources corporation resources  to an affiliate of affiliated computer services  inc acs the resources sale 
the resources sale was valued at approximately million 
concurrent with the resources sale  our management  with our board of directors approval  adopted a formal plan of disposal for the remaining businesses and assets of the information and property records services segment 
this restructuring program was designed to focus our resources on our software systems and services segment and to reduce debt 
the businesses and assets divested or identified for divesture were classified as discontinued operations in the accompanying consolidated financial statements in and the prior periods financial statements were restated to report separately their operations in compliance with apb opinion no 
the net gain on the kofile sale and the resources sale amounted to approximately million net of an income tax benefit of million 
our formal plan of disposal provided for the remaining businesses and assets of the information and property records services segment to be disposed of by december  the estimated loss on the disposal of these remaining businesses and assets at december  amounted to million after an income tax benefit of million 
this loss consisted of an estimated loss on disposal of the businesses of million net of an income tax benefit of million and a provision of million after an income tax benefit of million for anticipated operating losses from the measurement date of december  to the estimated disposal dates 
on may   we sold all of the common stock of one of the remaining businesses in the discontinued information and property records services segment 
in connection with the sale  we received cash proceeds of  approximately  shares of tyler common stock  a promissory note of  payable in monthly installments at an interest rate of  and other contingent consideration 
on september   we sold all of the common stock of capital commerce reporter  inc for million in cash 
we renegotiated certain aspects of the may  sale transaction and as a result of this renegotiation in march  we received additional cash of approximately  and a subordinated note receivable for  to fully settle the promissory note and other contingent consideration received in connection with this sale 
the subordinated note is payable in equal quarterly principal payments with interest at a rate of 
because the subordinated note receivable is highly dependent upon future operations of the buyer  we are recording its value when the cash is received which is our historical practice 
during  we received receipts of  on the subordinated note 
during the year ended december   the irs issued temporary regulations  which in effect allowed us to deduct for tax purposes losses attributable to the march sale of our automotive parts subsidiary that were previously not allowed 
the tax benefit of allowing the deduction of this loss amounted to approximately  in addition  we renegotiated a note receivable and certain contingent consideration in connection with a subsidiary sold in and received proceeds of approximately  in we initially assigned no value for accounting purposes to the note receivable and contingent consideration when the loss on the disposal of the discontinued operations was first established in and when the note was first received in in addition  we settled in the fourth quarter of our asbestos litigation for an amount that was approximately  less than the liability initially established for this matter see note in notes to consolidated financial statements 
the aggregate effects of these events  net of the related tax effects  and other minor adjustments to the reserve for discontinued operations  resulted in a credit to discontinued operations of million in in our opinion and based on information available at this time  we believe the net liabilities related to discontinued operations are adequate 
the income tax expense or benefit associated with the gains or losses on the respective sales of the businesses in the information and property records services segment differs from the statutory income tax rate of due to the elimination of deferred taxes related to the basis difference between amounts reported for income taxes and financial reporting purposes and the utilization of available capital loss carryforwards which were fully reserved in the valuation account prior to the respective sales 
one of our non operating subsidiaries is involved in various claims for work related injuries and physical conditions relating to a formerly owned subsidiary that we sold in for the years ended december  and  we expensed and included in discontinued operations  net of related tax effect   and  respectively  for trial and related costs see note in the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
investment security available for sale pursuant to an agreement with two major shareholders of hte  inc hte  we acquired approximately million shares of hte s common stock in exchange for approximately million shares of our common stock

the cost of the investment was recorded at million and is classified as a non current asset 
florida state corporation law restricts the voting rights of control shares  as defined  acquired by a third party in certain types of acquisitions 
these restrictions may be removed by a vote of the shareholders of hte 
on november   the shareholders of hte  other than tyler  voted to deny tyler its right to vote the control shares of hte 
when we acquired the hte shares  hte took the position that all of our shares were control shares and therefore did not have voting rights 
we disputed this contention and asserted that the control shares were only those shares in excess of of the outstanding shares of hte  and it was only those shares that lacked voting rights 
at the time of our acquisition  no court had interpreted the florida control share statute 
on october   hte notified us that  pursuant to the florida control share statute  it had redeemed all million shares of hte common stock owned by us for a cash price of per share 
on october   we notified hte that its purported redemption of our hte shares was invalid and contrary to florida law  and in any event  the calculation by hte of fair value for our shares was incorrect 
on october   hte filed a complaint in a civil court in seminole county  florida requesting the court to enter a declaratory judgment declaring hte s purported redemption of all of our hte shares at a redemption price of per share was lawful and to effect the redemption and cancel our hte shares 
we removed the case to the united states district court  middle district of florida  orlando division  and requested a declaratory judgment from the court declaring  among other things  that hte s purported redemption of any or all of our shares was illegal under florida law and that we had the ability to vote up to of the issued and outstanding shares of hte common stock owned by us 
on september   the court issued an order declaring that hte s purported redemption was invalid 
on september   we entered into a settlement agreement with hte in which hte agreed that it would not attempt any other redemption of our shares 
in addition  hte agreed to dismiss and release us from the tort claims it alleged against us as disclosed in previous filings 
on december   the court issued a further order declaring that all of our hte shares are control shares and therefore none of our shares have voting rights 
the court further ruled that voting rights would be restored to our hte shares if we were to sell or otherwise transfer our hte shares to an unaffiliated third party in a transaction that did not constitute a control share acquisition 
during  approximately  of legal and other related costs associated with these matters were charged to non operating expenses 
under gaap  a investment in the voting stock of another company creates the presumption that the investor has significant influence over the operating and financial policies of that company  unless there is evidence to the contrary 
our management has concluded that we do not have such influence 
accordingly  we account for our investment in hte pursuant to the provisions of sfas no 
 accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities 
these securities are classified as available for sale and are recorded at fair value as determined by quoted market prices for hte common stock 
on february   we entered into an agreement with sungard data systems  inc sds in which we agreed to tender all of our hte shares in a tender offer to be commenced by sds for the acquisition of hte 
on february   sds and hte announced a definitive agreement for the acquisition of all of the shares of hte for per share in cash 
sds and hte also announced that the consummation of the transaction is subject to customary conditions  including the tender of at least a majority of the outstanding shares of hte in the tender offer and the expiration of the waiting period under the hart scott rodino antitrust improvements act of  as amended 
sds and hte further announced that certain shareholders owning approximately of the total outstanding shares of hte had agreed to tender their shares 
according to the press release issued by sds and hte  the acquisition is expected to close in the first quarter of assuming the acquisition is consummated  we will receive approximately million in gross cash proceeds from the sale of our hte shares 
there can be no assurance that the acquisition of hte by sds will be consummated on the terms as disclosed  if at all 
if sds does not acquire hte  we will continue to classify our investment as an available for sale security in accordance with sfas no 
and as a non current asset since the investment was initially made for a continuing business purpose

compared to revenues revenues were million for the year ended december   a increase from revenues of million for the prior year 
software license revenues 
software license revenues increased each quarter during from million in the first quarter to million in the fourth quarter 
for the year ended december   software license revenue was million  compared to million for the year ended december  the increase was due mainly to sales of third party software that provided additional functionality to certain modules of our proprietary software  sales of proprietary software to new customers and in new geographic areas  primarily the midwestern united states  and sales of upgraded financial and utility software modules to existing customers 
the increase was somewhat offset by lower tax and appraisal software sales 
software services revenues 
software services revenues grew to million for the year ended december   from million for the year ended december  the increase was due to higher proprietary software sales  as we offer services  such as installation of the software  conversion of the customers data to be compatible with the software and training of the customer personnel to use the software 
in addition  during  we entered into more service intensive contracts  particularly related to our tax products 
maintenance revenues 
for the year ended december   maintenance revenue increased  to million  from million for higher maintenance revenues were due to an increase in our base of installed software and systems products and maintenance rate increases for several product lines 
maintenance and support services are provided for our software and related products 
appraisal services revenues 
for the year ended december   appraisal services revenues were million  compared to million in the prior year 
the increase for the year in appraisal services revenues was primarily due to our continued progress on our contract with nassau county 
the contract to provide outsourced assessment services for nassau county  together with tax assessment administration software and training  is valued at approximately million 
implementation of the nassau county contract began in september for the year ended december   we recorded million of professional services revenue related to nassau county 
hardware and other revenues 
hardware and other revenues increased million for the year ended december  from million for the same period of approximately  of the increase related to the nassau county contract 
other increases were due to timing of installations of equipment on customer contracts and are dependent on the contract size and on varying customer hardware needs 
cost of revenues for the year ended december   cost of revenues was million compared to million for the year ended december  the increase in cost of revenues was primarily due to the increase in revenues 
gross margin was for the year ended december   compared to for the year ended december  overall gross margin was lower because our revenue mix included more appraisal services compared to historically  gross profit is higher for software licenses than for software and appraisal services due to personnel costs associated with services 
in addition  software license costs increased during compared to  due to increased amortization of software development costs 
we released several new products during the second and third quarters of  at which time we began to amortize the related software development costs 
selling  general and administrative expenses selling  general and administrative expenses for the year ended december  was million compared to million in the prior year 
selling  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenues declined to in from in because such expenses are primarily fixed and therefore did not increase in proportion to our revenue growth 
the decline in selling  general and administrative expenses was due to a reduction in corporate costs following the sale of the information and property records services segment  lower acquisition related costs such as legal and travel expenses and lower research and development costs which are expensed 
amortization of acquisition intangibles we accounted for all of our past acquisitions using the purchase method of accounting for business combinations 
prior to the adoption of sfas no 
 the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the net identifiable assets of the acquired companies goodwill was amortized using the straight line method of amortization over their respective estimated useful lives 
amortization expense of acquisition intangibles was million in and net interest expense net interest expense was  for the year ended december   compared to million for the year ended december  interest expense declined due to a significant reduction in bank debt with the proceeds from the disposal of our former information and property records services segment 
in addition  during we capitalized  of interest costs related to internally developed software products  compared to  for income tax provision for the year ended december   we had income from continuing operations before income taxes of million and an income tax provision of million  resulting in an effective tax rate of 
the high effective income tax rate is primarily attributable to non tax deductible goodwill amortization 
for  we incurred a loss from continuing operations before income tax benefit of million and an income tax benefit of million  resulting in an effective benefit rate of 
net income net income was  in compared to a net loss of million in for  diluted earnings per share was and  for  diluted loss per share was 
income from continuing operations was  or per diluted share in  compared to a loss from continuing operations of million  or per diluted share in accounting pronouncements not yet adopted in june  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for asset retirement obligations 
sfas no 
requires us to record the fair value of an asset retirement obligation as a liability in the period in which it incurs a legal obligation associated with the retirement of tangible long lived assets that result from the acquisition  construction  development  and or normal use of the assets 
a corresponding asset is also recorded and depreciated over the life of the asset 
after the initial measurement of the asset retirement obligation  the obligation will be adjusted at the end of each period to reflect the passage of time and changes in the estimated future cash flows relating to the obligation

we may also require additional financing if we decide to make additional acquisitions 
there can be no assurance  however  that any such opportunities will arise  that any such acquisitions will be consummated or that any needed additional financing will be available when required on terms satisfactory to us 
absent any acquisitions  we anticipate that existing cash balances  cash flows from operations  working capital and available borrowing capacity under our revolving credit facility will provide sufficient funds to meet our needs for at least the next year 
capitalization at december   our capitalization consisted of million of long term obligations including the current portion of those obligations and million of shareholders equity 
our total debt to capital ratio total debt divided by the sum of total shareholders equity and total long term obligations was at december  factors that may affect future results and market price of our stock an investment in our common stock involves a high degree of risk 
investors evaluating our company should carefully consider the factors described below and all other information contained in this annual report 
any of the following factors could materially harm our business  operating results  and financial condition 
additional factors and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently consider immaterial could also harm our business  operating results  and financial condition 
this section should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes and management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations included in this annual report 
we may make forward looking statements from time to time  both written and oral 
we undertake no obligation to revise or publicly release the results of any revisions to these forward looking statements 
our actual results may differ materially from those projected in any such forward looking statements due to a number of factors  including those set forth below and elsewhere in this annual report 
a decline in information technology spending may result in a decrease in our revenues or lower our growth rate 
a decline in the demand for information technology among our current and prospective customers may result in decreased revenues or a lower growth rate for us because our sales depend  in part  on our customers level of funding for new or additional information technology systems and services 
moreover  demand for our solutions may be reduced by a decline in overall demand for computer software and services 
the current technology recession and decline in overall technology spending  terrorist activity  and threats of hostilities in the middle east and asia may cause our customers to reduce or eliminate information technology spending and cause price erosion for our solutions  which would substantially reduce the number of new software licenses we sell and the average sales price for these licenses 
because of these market and economic conditions  we believe there will continue to be uncertainty in the level of demand for our products and services 
accordingly  we cannot assure you that we will be able to increase or maintain our revenues 
we may experience fluctuations in quarterly revenue that could adversely impact our stock price and our operating results 
our actual revenues in a quarter could fall below expectations  which could lead to a decline in our stock price 
our revenues and operating results are difficult to predict and may fluctuate substantially from quarter to quarter 
revenues from license fees in any quarter depend substantially upon our contracting activity and our ability to recognize revenues in that quarter in accordance with our revenue recognition policies 
our quarterly revenue may fluctuate and may be difficult to forecast for a variety of reasons  including the following a significant number of our prospective customers decisions regarding whether to enter into license agreements with us are made within the last few weeks of each quarter  we have historically had a higher concentration of revenues in the second half of our fiscal year due to governmental budget and spending tendencies  the size of license transactions can vary significantly  customers may unexpectedly postpone or cancel orders due to changes in their strategic priorities  project objectives  budget or personnel  customer purchasing processes vary significantly and a customer s internal approval and expenditure authorization process can be difficult and time consuming to complete  even after selection of a vendor  the number  timing  and significance of software product enhancements and new software product announcements by us and our competitors may affect purchase decisions  and we may have to defer revenues under our revenue recognition policies 
fluctuation in our quarterly revenues may adversely affect our operating results 
in each fiscal quarter our expense levels  operating costs  and hiring plans are based on projections of future revenues and are relatively fixed 
if our actual revenues fall below expectations  we could experience a reduction in operating results 
as with other software vendors  we may be required to delay revenue recognition into future periods  which could adversely impact our operating results 
we have in the past had to  and in the future may have to  defer revenue recognition for license fees due to several factors  including whether license agreements include applications that are under development or other undelivered elements  we must deliver services  including significant modifications  customization  or complex interfaces  which could delay product delivery or acceptance  the transaction involves acceptance criteria  the transaction involves contingent payment terms or fees  we are required to accept a fixed fee services contract  or we are required to accept extended payment terms 
because of the factors listed above and other specific requirements under generally accepted accounting principles in the united states for software revenue recognition  we must have very precise terms in our license agreements in order to recognize revenue when we initially deliver and install software or perform services 
negotiation of mutually acceptable terms and conditions can extend the sales cycle  and sometimes we do not obtain terms and conditions that permit revenue recognition at the time of delivery or even as work on the project is completed 
increases in service revenue as a percentage of total revenues could decrease overall margins and adversely affect our operating results 
we realize lower margins on software and appraisal service revenues than on license revenue 
the majority of our contracts involve both the license of software and the provision of professional services 
therefore  an increase in the percentage of software service and appraisal service revenue compared to license revenue could have a detrimental impact on our overall gross margins and could adversely affect operating results 
selling products and services into the public sector poses unique challenges 
we derive substantially all of our revenues from sales of software and services to state  county and city governments  other municipal agencies  and other public entities 
we expect that sales to public sector customers will continue to account for substantially all of our revenues in the future 
we face many risks and challenges associated with contracting with governmental entities  including the sales cycle of governmental agencies may be complex and lengthy  payments under some public sector contracts are subject to achieving implementation milestones  and we have had  and may in the future have  differences with customers as to whether milestones have been achieved  political resistance to the concept of government agencies contracting with third parties to provide information technology solutions  changes in legislation authorizing government s contracting with third parties  the internal review process by governmental agencies for bid acceptance  changes to the bidding procedures by governmental agencies  changes in governmental administrations and personnel  limitations on governmental resources placed by budgetary restraints  which in some circumstances  may provide for a termination of executed contracts because of a lack of future funding  and the general effect of economic downturns and other changes on local governments ability to spend public funds on outsourcing arrangements 
each of these risks is outside our control 
if we fail to adequately adapt to these risks and uncertainties  our financial performance could be adversely affected 
the open bidding process for governmental contracts creates uncertainty in predicting future contract awards 
many governmental agencies purchase products and services through an open bidding process 
generally  a governmental entity will publish an established list of requirements requesting potential vendors to propose solutions for the established requirements 
to respond successfully to these requests for proposals  we must accurately estimate our cost structure for servicing a proposed contract  the time required to establish operations for the proposed client  and the likely terms of any other third party proposals submitted 
we cannot guarantee that we will win any bids in the future through the request for proposal process  or that any winning bids will ultimately result in contracts on favorable terms 
our failure to secure contracts through the open bidding process  or to secure such contracts on favorable terms  may adversely affect our business  financial condition  and results of operations 
fixed price contracts may affect our profits 
some of our present contracts are on a fixed priced basis  which can lead to various risks  including the failure to accurately estimate the resources and time required for an engagement  the failure to effectively manage governmental agencies and other customers expectations regarding the scope of services to be delivered for an estimated price  and the failure to timely complete fixed price engagements within budget to the customers satisfaction 
if we do not adequately assess these and other risks  we may be subject to cost overruns and penalties  which may harm our business  financial condition  or results of operations 
we face significant competition from other vendors and potential new entrants into our markets 
we believe we are a leading provider of integrated solutions for the public sector 
however  we face competition from a variety of software vendors that offer products and services similar to those offered by us  as well as from companies offering to develop custom software 
we compete on the basis of a number of factors  including the attractiveness of the business strategy and services we offer  the breadth of products and services we offer  price  quality of products and service  technological innovation  name recognition  and our ability to modify existing products and services to accommodate the particular needs of our customers 
we believe the market is highly fragmented with a large number of competitors that vary in size  primary computer platforms  and overall product scope 
our competitors include the consulting divisions of national and regional accounting firms  publicly held companies that focus on selected segments of the public sector market  and a significant number of smaller  privately held companies 
certain competitors have greater technical  marketing  and financial resources than us 
we cannot assure you that such competitors will not develop products or offer services that are superior to our products or services or that achieve greater market acceptance 
we also compete with internal  centralized information service departments of governmental entities  which require us to persuade the end user to stop the internal service and outsource to us 
in addition  our customers may elect in the future to provide information management services internally through new or existing departments  which will reduce the market for our services 
we could face additional competition as other established and emerging companies enter the public sector software application market and new products and technologies are introduced 
increased competition could result in price reductions  fewer customer orders  reduced gross margins  and loss of market share 
in addition  current and potential competitors may make strategic acquisitions or establish cooperative relationships among themselves or with third parties  thereby increasing the ability of their products to address the needs of our prospective customers 
it is possible that new competitors or alliances among current and new competitors may emerge and rapidly gain significant market share 
further  competitive pressures could require us to reduce the price of our software licenses and related services 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to compete successfully against current and future competitors  and the failure to do so would have material adverse effect upon our business  operating results  and financial condition 
we must respond to rapid technological changes to be competitive 
the market for our products is characterized by rapid technological change  evolving industry standards in computer hardware and software technology  changes in customer requirements  and frequent new product introductions and enhancements 
the introduction of products embodying new technologies and the emergence of new industry standards can render existing products obsolete and unmarketable 
as a result  our future success will depend  in part  upon our ability to continue to enhance existing products and develop and introduce in a timely manner or acquire new products that keep pace with technological developments  satisfy increasingly sophisticated customer requirements  and achieve market acceptance 
we cannot assure you that we will successfully identify new product opportunities and develop and bring new products to market in a timely and cost effective manner 
further  we cannot assure you that the products  capabilities  or technologies developed by others will not render our products or technologies obsolete or noncompetitive 
if we are unable to develop or acquire on a timely and cost effective basis new software products or enhancements to existing products  or if such new products or enhancements do not achieve market acceptance  our business  operating results  and financial condition may be materially adversely affected 
our failure to properly manage growth could adversely affect our business 
we have expanded our operations rapidly since february  when we entered the business of providing software solutions and services to the public sector 
we intend to continue expansion in the foreseeable future to pursue existing and potential market opportunities 
this rapid growth places a significant demand on management and operational resources 
in order to manage growth effectively  we must implement and improve our operational systems  procedures  and controls on a timely basis 
we must also identify  hire  train  and manage key managerial and technical personnel 
if we fail to implement these systems or employ and retain such qualified personnel  our business  financial condition  and results of operations may be materially and adversely affected 
in addition  a significant portion of our growth has resulted from strategic acquisitions in new product and geographic markets 
although our future focus will be on internal growth  we will continue to identify and pursue strategic acquisitions and alliances with suitable candidates 
our future success will depend  in part  on our ability to successfully integrate past and future acquisitions and other strategic alliances into our operations 
acquisitions may involve a number of special risks  including diversion of management s attention  failure to retain key acquired personnel  unanticipated events or circumstances  legal liabilities  and amortization of certain acquired intangible assets 
some or all of these risks could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  and results of operations 
although we conduct due diligence reviews of potential acquisition candidates  we may not identify all material liabilities or risks related to acquisition candidates 
there can be no assurance that any such strategic acquisitions or alliances will be accomplished on favorable terms or will result in profitable operations 
we may be unable to hire  integrate  and retain qualified personnel 
our continued success will depend upon the availability and performance of our key management  sales  marketing  customer support  and product development personnel 
the loss of key management or technical personnel could adversely affect us 
we believe that our continued success will depend in large part upon our ability to attract  integrate  and retain such personnel 
we have at times experienced and continue to experience difficulty in recruiting qualified personnel 
competition for qualified software development  sales  and other personnel is intense  and we cannot assure you that we will be successful in attracting and retaining such personnel 
we may be unable to protect our proprietary rights 
many of our product and service offerings incorporate proprietary information  trade secrets  know how  and other intellectual property rights 
we rely on a combination of contracts  copyrights  and trade secret laws to establish and protect our proprietary rights in our technology 
we cannot be certain that we have taken all appropriate steps to deter misappropriation of our intellectual property 
in addition  there has been significant litigation in the united states in recent years involving intellectual property rights 
we are not currently involved in any material intellectual property litigation 
we may  however  be a party to intellectual property litigation in the future to protect our proprietary information  trade secrets  know how  and other intellectual property rights 
further  we cannot assure you that third parties will not assert infringement or misappropriation claims against us in the future with respect to current or future products 
any claims or litigation  with or without merit  could be time consuming and result in costly litigation and diversion of management s attention 
further  any claims and litigation could cause product shipment delays or require us to enter into royalty or licensing arrangements 
such royalty or licensing arrangements  if required  may not be available on terms acceptable to us  if at all 
thus  litigation to defend and enforce our intellectual property rights could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  and results of operations  regardless of the final outcome of such litigation 
our products are complex and  as such  we run the risk of errors or defects with new product introductions or enhancements 
software products as complex as those developed by us may contain errors or defects  especially when first introduced or when new versions or enhancements are released 
although we have not experienced material adverse effects resulting from any such defects or errors to date  we cannot assure you that material defects and errors will not be found after commencement of product shipments 
any such defects could result in loss of revenues or delay market acceptance 
our license agreements with our customers typically contain provisions designed to limit our exposure to potential liability claims 
it is possible  however  that the limitation of liability provisions contained in our license agreements may not be effective as a result of existing or future federal  state or local laws or ordinances or judicial decisions 
although we maintain errors and omissions and general liability insurance  and we try to structure our contracts to include limitations on liability  we cannot assure you that a successful claim would not have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  and results of operations 
our application service provider strategy has yet to gain widespread acceptance 
some businesses choose to access enterprise software applications through application service providers  or asps  which are businesses that host applications and provide access to software on a subscription basis 
the public sector market for asp solutions is new and unproven 
acceptance of our asp model depends upon the ability and willingness of different governmental entities to accept and implement asp solutions 
our clients have expressed security and privacy concerns with the asp model  including a concern regarding the confidential nature of the information and transactions available from and conducted with governments and concerns regarding off site storage of such information 
we have limited experience selling our solutions through asps and may not be successful in generating revenue from this distribution channel 
changes in the insurance markets may affect our ability to win some contract awards and may lead to increased expenses 
some of our customers  primarily those for our property appraisal services  require that we secure performance bonds before they will select us as their vendor 
the number of qualified  high rated insurance companies that offer performance bonds has decreased in recent years  while the costs associated with securing these bonds has increased dramatically 
in addition  we are generally required to issue a letter of credit as security for the issuance of a performance bond 
each letter of credit we issue reduces our borrowing capacity under our senior secured credit agreement 
we cannot guarantee that we will be able to secure such performance bonds in the future on terms that are favorable to us  if at all 
our inability to obtain performance bonds on favorable terms or at all could impact our future ability to win some contract awards  particularly large property appraisal services contracts  which could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  and results of operations 
recent volatility in the stock markets  increasing shareholder litigation  the adoption of expansive legislation that redefines corporate controls in particular  legislation adopted to prevent future corporate and accounting scandals  as well as other factors have recently led to significant increases in premiums for directors and officers liability insurance 
the number of insurers offering directors and officers insurance at competitive rates has also decreased in recent years 
we cannot predict when the insurance market for such coverage will stabilize  if at all 
the continued volatility of the insurance market may result in future increases in our general and administrative expenses  which may adversely affect future operating results 
compliance with changing regulation of corporate governance and public disclosure may result in additional expenses 
changing laws  regulations  and standards relating to corporate governance and public disclosure  including the sarbanes oxley act of  new securities and exchange commission regulations and new york stock exchange rules  are creating uncertainty for companies such as ours 
to maintain high standards of corporate governance and public disclosure  we intend to invest all reasonably necessary resources to comply with evolving standards 
this investment may result in increased general and administrative expenses and a diversion of management time and attention from revenue generating activities 
our stock price may be volatile 
the market price of our common stock may be volatile and may be significantly affected by many different factors 
some examples of factors that can have a significant impact on our stock price include actual or anticipated fluctuations in our operating results  announcements of technological innovations  new products  or new contracts by us or our competitors  developments with respect to patents  copyrights  or other proprietary rights  conditions and trends in the software and other technology industries  adoption of new accounting standards affecting the software industry  changes in financial estimates by securities analysts  and general market conditions and other factors 
in addition  the stock market has from time to time experienced significant price and volume fluctuations that have particularly affected the market prices for the common stock of technology companies 
these broad market fluctuations may adversely affect the market price of our common stock 
in the past  following periods of volatility in the market price of a particular company s securities  securities class action litigation has often been brought against that company 
we cannot assure you that similar litigation will not occur in the future with respect to us 
such litigation could result in substantial costs and a diversion of management s attention and resources  which could have a material adverse effect upon our business  operating results  and financial condition 
historically  we have not paid dividends on our common stock 
we have not declared or paid a cash dividend since we entered the business of providing software solutions and services to the public sector in february our credit agreement restricts our ability to pay cash dividends 
we intend to retain earnings for use in the operation and expansion of our business 
we do not anticipate paying any cash dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future 
provisions in our certificate of incorporation  bylaws  and delaware law could deter takeover attempts 
our board of directors may issue up to  shares of preferred stock and may determine the price  rights  preferences  privileges  and restrictions  including voting and conversion rights  of these shares of preferred stock 
these determinations may be made without any further vote or action by our stockholders 
the rights of the holders of our common stock will be subject to  and may be adversely affected by  the rights of the holders of any preferred stock that may be issued in the future 
the issuance of preferred stock may make it more difficult for a third party to acquire a majority of our outstanding voting stock 
in addition  some provisions of our certificate of incorporation  bylaws  and of the delaware general corporation law could also delay  prevent  or make more difficult a merger  tender offer  or proxy contest involving us 
financial outlook 
from time to time in press releases and otherwise  we may publish forecasts or other forward looking statements regarding our results  including estimated revenues or net earnings 
any forecast of our future performance reflects various assumptions 
these assumptions are subject to significant uncertainties  and as a matter of course  any number of them may prove to be incorrect 
further  the achievement of any forecast depends on numerous risks and other factors including those described in this discussion  many of which are beyond our control 
as a result  we cannot be certain that our performance will be consistent with any management forecasts or that the variation from such forecasts will not be material and adverse 
current and potential stockholders are cautioned not to base their entire analysis of our business and prospects upon isolated predictions  but instead are encouraged to utilize our entire publicly available mix of historical and forward looking information  as well as other available information regarding us  our products and services  and the software industry when evaluating our prospective results of operations
