most clients are based in the united states  though a significant portion of investors in the alternative investment products are located outside the united states 
levco acts as the managing general partner of a number of investment partnerships and also acts as an adviser to private investment vehicles organized outside the united states 
with respect to accounts managed pursuant to its value equity strategies  levco generally receives advisory fees based on a percentage of the market value of assets under management  including market appreciation or depreciation and client contributions and withdrawals 
in some cases  levco receives performance based fees from accounts pursuing value equity strategies 
with respect to private investment vehicles and separate accounts managed pursuant to similar strategies  levco is generally entitled to receive both a fixed management fee based on a percentage of the assets under management and a share of net profits 
levco obtains some of its clients for its large cap value product through wrap fee programs sponsored by major financial services companies 
in these programs  clients pay the sponsoring broker an asset based fee that covers brokerage commissions  advisory services  custodial fees  and other reporting and administrative services 
investors are able to select levco from among a limited number of managers participating in the program  and levco receives a portion of the wrap fee paid by the clients who select levco to manage their accounts through the program

following is a comparison of levco s assets under management in millions as defined by product and client type at december  in millions value equity accounts institutional accounts    sub advisory accounts    non institutional accounts    wrap fee accounts    alternative strategies event driven accounts    short biased accounts other private investment funds total    levco also has a wholly owned broker dealer subsidiary that clears through csc on a fully disclosed basis

results of operations year ended december  as compared to year ended december  revenues total revenues for were million  reflecting a decrease of from million in revenues in this decrease was primarily attributable to a decrease in incentive fees and allocations from million to million  which was only partly offset by a increase in investment advisory fees excluding incentive fees and allocations from million to million 
the decrease in incentive fees resulted from a decrease in the performance of the event driven and value equity products  which was only partially offset by an increase in incentive fees and allocations attributable to the short biased products 
incentive fees and general partner allocations are accrued on a quarterly basis but are primarily determined and billed or allocated  as the case may be  at the end of the applicable contract year or upon investor withdrawal 
such accruals may be reversed prior to being earned or allocated as the result of investment performance 
the increase in investment advisory fees was attributable to an increase in the assets managed pursuant to the event driven and short biased strategies  which increase was partially offset by the decline in investment advisory fees attributable to value equity strategies as the result of a decrease in assets under management for these products 
as the result of the decline in assets under management in the value equity strategies over the course  even if assets under management in these strategies in were to remain at december  levels  investment advisory fees from these strategies in could be expected to decline relative to as average assets under management over the course of the year would be lower 
the underperformance of value equity strategies in relative to their benchmarks may also adversely impact bkf s ability to retain existing accounts and attract new accounts in with respect to its value equity products 
net commission income generated by the broker dealer business rose to million in from million in  primarily as the result of increased assets under management in accounts pursuing alternative investment strategies

expenses associated with the grant of restricted stock units rose from  in to million in the increase in compensation expense despite the decrease in revenues is primarily attributable to the exclusion of certain costs and expenses incurred in connection with new product development including compensation and real estate expenses in calculating the percentage of pre tax  pre compensation profits available for compensation under the compensation guidelines approved by the board of directors 
other operating expenses of bkf for were million  reflecting an increase of from million in this increase primarily reflected an increase in professional and consulting fees paid to third parties providing marketing  legal and investment related services  and portfolio management and trading system costs which bear a correlation to the number of accounts managed in wrap fee programs 
it should be noted that portfolio management and trading system costs are determined on a per account basis  so that as the average account size decreases  margins suffer a corresponding decrease

the increase in investment advisory fees is primarily attributable to the increase in assets under management in the large cap value strategy  which experienced a significant increase in assets managed in wrap fee programs  and the event driven product 
the decrease in incentive fees and general partner incentive allocations is primarily attributable to a decrease in the performance of the accounts paying performance based compensation 
incentive fees and general partner allocations are accrued on a quarterly basis but are primarily determined and billed or allocated  as the case may be  at the end of the applicable contract year or upon investor withdrawal

as of year end  approximately million excluding incentive allocations was invested in such strategies 
in  bkf had a net realized and unrealized gain on investments of  which reflects a gain of  on investments in affiliated partnerships excluding incentive allocations and long only equity value portfolios funded by bkf in the fourth quarter of in order to establish track records for developing products  which was offset by a  permanent write down of a historical private placement position that had been part of bkf s portfolio when it was an investment company 
interest and dividend income interest and dividend income was million in  reflecting a decline of from million in this decline resulted from a significant decline in interest rates  which was only partially offset by higher cash balances

in  bkf realized a million capital loss for book purposes relating to an investment that was made when bkf was still an investment company  million of this loss was used in to offset taxable capital gains 
the balance of the unused capital loss was carried back to previous taxable years for federal  state and local income tax purposes to offset prior taxable capital gains

the difference in effective tax rates in and is primarily attributable to state and local taxes due to changes in the allocated income among various taxing jurisdictions 
liquidity and capital resources bkf s current assets as of december  consist primarily of cash  short term investments  advisory fees receivable and marketable equity securities 
while bkf utilizes capital to develop and seed new investment products  bkf s business is not generally capital intensive 
bkf has historically met its cash and liquidity needs through cash generated by operating activities 
at december   bkf had cash and cash equivalents of million  compared to million at december  this decrease in cash and cash equivalents primarily reflects the use of cash to make seed capital investments during the course of investment advisory fees receivable were million at december  and million at december   reflecting the decreases in assets under management and incentive fees 
the increase in investments in affiliated investment partnerships to million at december  from million at december  primarily reflects the investment by bkf of million in conjunction with the development of two affiliated investment partnerships 
approximately million of the investments in affiliated limited partnerships represent general partner incentive allocations that typically are withdrawn within three months following the end of the calendar year to pay compensation and other expenses 
the increase in deferred tax assets to million in from million in is primarily attributable to future tax benefits related to grants of restricted stock units made in prepaid expenses and other assets declined to million at december  from million at december  primarily as the result of the amortization of the pre paid premium on the three year directors and officers errors and omissions liability insurance policy 
investments in securities of million at december   as compared to million at december   represent shares purchased to seed affiliated investment funds 
the decline represents the liquidation of the financial services long only portfolio  a reduction in seed capital allocations through investments in securities but note the increase in investments in affiliated limited partnerships  and a decline in portfolio values 
accrued expenses were million at december   as compared to million at december  this increase is primarily attributable to increases in sales commissions payable to levco salespeople and referral fees payable to third parties 
accrued bonuses were million at december   as compared to million at december  this decrease is primarily attributable to the decrease in revenues during  as well as the payment of certain bonuses during the course of the year 
based upon bkf s current level of operations and anticipated growth  bkf expects that cash flows from operating activities will be sufficient to finance its working capital needs for the foreseeable future 
bkf s business is not seasonal 
except for the lease commitments and related expenditures described below  bkf has no material commitments for capital expenditures 
the company has office space obligations that require monthly payments plus escalations through september at december   the minimum annual rental commitments under the operating leases are as follows thereafter  total minimum payments required  bkf is not currently utilizing its entire facility 
it is anticipated that a portion will be built out and that bkf will incur costs of at least million in connection with such construction  which costs will be amortized over the remaining life of the lease 
in addition  depending on its evaluation of its needs  bkf may sublease a portion of its space  and such a sublease could result in the recognition of a significant loss 
off balance sheet risk levco gp serves as the managing general partner for several affiliated investment partnerships which trade primarily in equity securities or  in the case of one partnership  in distressed corporate debt 
as of december   total partners capital in these partnerships was approximately million 
as of december   the sum total of levco gp s capital accounts in the affiliated investment partnerships was approximately million 
the financial condition and results of operations of these affiliated investment partnerships are not included in bkf s consolidated statements of financial condition except to the extent of levco gp s equity ownership 
levco gp does not maintain control over the affiliated investment partnerships  has not guaranteed any of the affiliated investment partnerships obligations  and does not have any contractual commitments associated with them 
in addition  limited partners in the affiliated investment partnerships have the right to remove the managing general partner at any time 
related party transactions levco earned investment advisory fees from accounts for which four current members of bkf s board of directors of which one is an officer of the company have controlling discretion 
the amounts earned from these accounts were million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
these accounts are managed in levco s routine course of business and do not and will not impact bkf s current and prospective financial position and operating results any differently than similarly sized managed accounts 
critical accounting policies revenue recognition and related expenses with respect to incentive fees and allocations  bkf has elected to accrue income on a quarterly basis  though such fees and allocations are determined and billed or allocated at the end of the applicable measurement period 
such accruals  as well as related compensation and third party referral fees  may be reversed as the result of subsequent investment performance prior to the conclusion of the applicable contract year or investor withdrawal 
alternatively  bkf could have adopted a policy of not recognizing such fees or allocations until the respective payments are fixed at the end of the performance measurement period 
since most incentives fees or allocations are determined as of the end of the calendar year  the adoption of a revenue recognition policy that defers recognition of incentive fees or allocations and associated expenses could result in much lower levels of income  and associated compensation expenses  for periods prior to the fourth quarter 
bkf s annual financial results would not be materially affected  as most of the performance measurement periods conclude on december purchase price allocation in order to account for the acquisition of levco by bkf in utilizing the purchase method of accounting  levco s cost in excess of net assets was reflected in the following intangible items goodwill  employment contracts for key personnel and investment advisory contracts 
the total value of these intangibles at the time of the acquisition was million 
bkf determined that of that amount was attributable to goodwill  to the employment contracts and to the investment contracts 
bkf amortizes the value of the goodwill over a year period  the value of the investment contracts over a ten year period  and amortized the employment contracts  which have all expired  over their respective terms 
pursuant to statement of financial accounting standards no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  commencing in  the net carrying value of the goodwill of million at december   ceased to be amortized 
goodwill is subject to an annual impairment test 
other intangible assets with finite lives  such as investment contracts  will continue to be amortized over their useful lives 
investments in affiliated investment partnerships levco gp serves as the managing general partner for several affiliated investment partnerships which are not consolidated with bkf 
these general partnerships are periodically assessed to determine whether the underlying assets and liabilities should be consolidated 
see item off balance sheet risk 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk since bkf s revenues are largely driven by the market value of levco s assets under management  these revenues are exposed to fluctuations in the equity markets 
management fees for most accounts are determined based on the market value of the account on the last day of the quarter with respect to which the investment advisory fee is charged  so any significant increases or decreases in market value occurring on or shortly before the last day of a quarter may materially impact revenues for the quarter 
furthermore  since levco manages most of its assets in a large cap value style  a general decline in the performance of value stocks could have an adverse impact on levco s revenues 
similarly  a lack of opportunity to implement  or a failure to successfully implement  levco s event driven strategies  could reduce performance based incentive fees and allocations and thereby negatively impact bkf s revenues 
in addition  as of december  and  bkf had invested  and million  respectively  in seed capital for long only value equity products  which investments could be similarly impacted by a decline in the performance of value stocks  and million and million excluding accrued incentive allocations  respectively  in proprietary alternative investment strategies  which are also exposed to market fluctuations
