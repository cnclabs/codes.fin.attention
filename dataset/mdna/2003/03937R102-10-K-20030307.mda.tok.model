environmental the company operates manufacturing facilities throughout the world and as a result is subject to a broad array of environmental laws and regulations in various countries 
the company also implements a variety of voluntary programs to reduce air emissions  eliminate or reduce the generation of hazardous wastes and to decrease the amount of wastewater discharges 
the establishment and implementation of us federal  state and local standards to regulate air and water quality and to govern contamination of land and groundwater has affected  and will continue to affect  substantially all of the company s us manufacturing locations 
federal legislation providing for regulation of the manufacture  transportation  use and disposal of hazardous and toxic substances has imposed additional regulatory requirements on industry in general  and particularly on the chemicals industry 
in addition  the implementation of environmental laws  such as the resource conservation and recovery act  the clean air act and the comprehensive environmental response  compensation and liability act of  as amended by the superfund amendments and reauthorization act of  has required  and will continue to require  new capital expenditures and will increase operating costs 
the distribution agreement specifies that the company is only responsible for certain environmental liabilities at the company s current facilities and certain off site locations 
in connection with the acquisition of hickson  the company acquired certain environmental exposures and potential liabilities of current and past operating sites  all of which have been accrued for in the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
associated costs of investigatory and remedial activities are provided for in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles governing probability and the ability to reasonably estimate future costs 
charges to income for investigatory and remedial efforts were not material to operating results in  and but may be material to net income in future years 
cash outlays for normal plant operations for the disposal of waste and the operation and maintenance of pollution control equipment and facilities to ensure compliance with mandated and voluntarily imposed environmental quality standards were charged to income 
cash outlays for remedial activities are charged to reserves 
historically  the company has funded its environmental capital expenditures through cash flows from operations and expects to do so in the future 
the company has not incurred cash outlays for remedial and investigatory activities associated with certain former olin waste sites and past operations since olin is responsible for these obligations under the distribution agreement 
cash outlays for environmental related activities for  and were as follows years ended december  in millions environmental cash outlays capital projects plant operations remedial activities total environmental cash outlays the company s consolidated balance sheets included liabilities for future environmental expenditures to investigate and remediate known sites amounting to million at december   of which million are classified as current liabilities and million at december   of which million are classified as current liabilities 
the company s estimated environmental liability relates to eight sites  six of which are in the united states and none of which are on the us national priority list 
these amounts did not take into account any discounting of future expenditures  any consideration of insurance recoveries or any advances in technology 
these liabilities are reassessed periodically to determine if environmental circumstances have changed or if the costs of remediation efforts can be better estimated 
as a result of these reassessments  future charges to income may be made for additional liabilities 
annual environmental related cash outlays for site investigation and remediation  capital projects and normal plant operations are expected to range from million to million over the next several years 
while the company does not anticipate a material increase in the projected annual level of its environmental related costs  there is always the possibility that such increases may occur in the future in view of the uncertainties associated with environmental exposures 
a portion of the higher environmental cash outlays during and was associated with a remediation project at the company s conley  ga wood treatment facility 
total cash outlays since its acquisition capital and remedial were approximately million 
the project was complete as of december  environmental exposures are difficult to assess for numerous reasons  including the identification of new sites  developments at sites resulting from investigatory studies and remedial activities  advances in technology  changes in environmental laws and regulations and their application  the scarcity of reliable data pertaining to identified sites  the difficulty in assessing the involvement and financial capability of other potentially responsible parties and the company s ability to obtain contributions from other parties and the lengthy time periods over which site remediation occurs 
it is possible that some of these matters the outcomes of which are subject to various uncertainties may be resolved unfavorably against the company 
at december   the company had estimated additional contingent environmental liabilities of million 
legal matters there are a variety of non environmental legal proceedings pending or threatened against the company 
in connection with the acquisition of hickson  the company assumed certain legal obligations  including a trial court judgment of approximately million plus interest  in a lawsuit associated with a raw material spillage in in  the judgment was reversed on the successful appeal by the company and remanded for a new trial on damages 
in  a new trial resulted in a judgment of million plus interest 
this judgment is being appealed 
the judgment and related interest is included in accrued liabilities in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets 
in  the company received notification of a potential product claim by a customer related to a discontinued product 
this claim was settled in the third quarter of and the company paid a total of million  exclusive of insurance proceeds 
total insurance proceeds of million are expected to be received in the first quarter of five putative class action lawsuits have been filed in various state and federal courts against several chromated copper arsenate cca manufacturers  including the company s cca formulating subsidiary  arch wood protection  inc  the company  several cca customers and various retailers regarding the marketing and use of cca treated wood 
generally  the proposed class members purport to include persons who purchased  possess or own cca treated wood products or properties upon which cca treated wood products were stored or installed 
none of the putative class actions currently alleges personal injury 
in one case  the federal district court ruled that the requirements for a class action have not been met and has denied class action status to the lawsuit 
one other case has been denied class action status as a result of plaintiffs failure to timely request class certification and has been subsequently dismissed without prejudice 
another case has been dismissed at the plaintiffs request 
in neither of the other two cases has a class been certified by the court 
these putative class action lawsuits variously allege conspiracy  breach of contract  breach of implied warranties  violation of consumer protection and or unfair trade practices statutes  unjust enrichment  strict liability  nuisance  negligence and intentional tort  seek remedies  such as refunds of the price of product sold  the cost of removal and replacement of cca treated wood and the cost of soil testing and purported remediation of allegedly contaminated soil and do not specify an amount of monetary damages requested 
these lawsuits are in their early stages of discovery 
in addition  there are eight other cca related lawsuits naming one or more of the company s subsidiaries  and in some cases  the company  as a defendant 
these additional eight cases are not putative class actions 
the company and its subsidiaries deny the material allegations of all the various cca related claims and has vigorously defended and will continue to vigorously defend them 
as a result  legal defense and related costs associated with these cases were substantial in and may increase in the future 
all cca related cases are subject to a number of uncertainties  including in the case of the putative class actions  whether and to what extent any will be certified as class actions 
as a result  their impact  if any  is difficult to assess 
based on the information currently available to the company  however  the company does not believe the resolution of these cases is likely to have a material adverse effect on its consolidated financial condition  cash flow or results of operations 
income taxes the company provides for deferred taxes on temporary differences between the financial statement and tax bases of assets using the enacted tax rates  which are expected to apply to taxable income when the temporary differences are expected to reverse 
prior to the distribution  the company s operations were included in the us federal consolidated income tax returns of olin 
the provision for income taxes prior to the distribution includes the company s allocated share of olin s consolidated income tax provision and is calculated on a separate company basis consistent with the requirements of statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for income taxes 
olin and the company entered into a tax sharing agreement that provides that olin is responsible for the federal tax liability of the company for each year that the company and its subsidiaries were included in olin s consolidated federal income tax return  and for state  local and foreign taxes of the company and its subsidiaries attributable to periods prior to the distribution  in each case including tax subsequently assessed pursuant to the audit of  or other adjustment to  previously filed tax returns 
business and credit concentrations sales of the company s microelectronic materials products segment are dependent upon the economic conditions of the semiconductor industry 
changes in this industry may significantly affect management s estimates of current and future operating results 
a significant portion of sales of the treatment products segment approximately is dependent upon two customers  one of which accounts for a significant portion of the sales of the hth water products business and the other of which accounts for a significant portion of the sales of the personal care and industrial biocides businesses 
sales to these two customers are individually less than of the company s consolidated sales 
however  the loss of either of these customers could have a material adverse effect on the sales and operating results of the respective segment and businesses if such customer was not replaced 
in february  the company announced a voluntary transition from cca  a traditional wood preservative used for the past years to protect treated wood against termites and rotting  to a new generation of wood preservatives for use in non industrial wood products after december  in connection with the transition  the company simultaneously requested epa s consent to an amendment of its registration for cca  which would limit the approved uses of cca to industrial  non residential applications 
although the company views this as a growth opportunity for its wood protection business  a risk exists that new sales of the cca alternative product will not replace historical sales of the cca product 
sales of the hth water products segment are seasonal in nature as its products are primarily used in the us residential pool market 
historically  approximately of the sales in the hth water products business occur in the second quarter of the fiscal year  as retail sales in the us residential pool market are concentrated between memorial day and the fourth of july 
therefore  interim results for this segment are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for the entire fiscal year 
in addition  in the hth water products segment changed its distribution strategy from utilizing distributors to directly shipping to retail channels  which has made the hth water product sales even more concentrated in the second and third quarters 
liquidity  investment activity and other financial data cash flow data years ended december  in millions provided by used for sale of accounts receivable change in working capital net operating activities from continuing operations change in net assets held for sale capital expenditures businesses acquired  net of cash proceeds from sales of land proceeds from sale of business net investing activities debt borrowing repayments  net net financing activities for  the million increase in cash flow provided by net operating activities from continuing operations was primarily attributable to the sale of accounts receivable and lower restructuring payments
