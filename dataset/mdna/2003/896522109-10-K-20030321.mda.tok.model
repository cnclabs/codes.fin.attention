item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
general management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations discusses our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
on an on going basis  management evaluates its estimates and judgments  including those related to bad debts  inventories  property  plant and equipment  goodwill  income taxes  warranty obligations  insurance  restructuring costs  and contingencies and litigation 
management bases its estimates and judgments on historical experience and on various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
management believes the following critical accounting policies  among others  affect its more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements 
inventory we are required to state our inventories at the lower of cost or market 
in assessing the ultimate realization of inventories  we are required to make judgments as to future demand requirements and compare that with the current or committed inventory levels 
we have recorded significant changes in inventory carrying values in recent periods due to discontinuance of product lines as well as changes in market conditions due to changes in demand requirements 
it is possible that changes in required inventory reserves may continue to occur in the future due to current market conditions in the railcar business 
goodwill we are required  at least annually  to evaluate goodwill related to acquired businesses for potential impairment indicators that are based on legal factors  market conditions in the united states and europe and operational performance of our acquired businesses 
future events could cause us to conclude that impairment indicators exist and that goodwill associated with our acquired businesses is impaired 
any resulting impairment loss could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations 
warranties we provide for the estimated cost of product warranties at the time we recognize revenue 
we base our estimates on historical product failure rates 
we also provide for specifically identified warranty obligations 
should actual product failure rates differ from our estimates  revisions to the estimated warranty liability would be required 
insurance we effectively self insure for workers compensation claims 
a third party administrator processes all such claims 
we accrue our workers compensation liability based upon an independent actuarial study 
to the extent actuarial assumptions change and claims experience rates differ from historical rates  our liability may change 
contingencies and litigation we are currently involved in certain legal proceedings 
as discussed in note of our consolidated financial statements  as of december   we have accrued our estimate of the probable settlement or judgment costs for the resolution of these claims 
this estimate has been developed in consultation with outside counsel handling our defense in these matters and is based upon an analysis of potential results  assuming a combination of litigation and settlement strategies 
we do not believe these proceedings will have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position 
it is possible  however  that future results of operations for any particular quarterly or annual period could be materially affected by changes in our assumptions related to these proceedings 
basis of presentation in september  we changed our year end from march to december unless stated otherwise  all references to fiscal year shall mean the full fiscal year ended march  the nine months ended december  covers the period from april  to december  the information for the year ended december  and the nine months ended december  are unaudited and have been included herein for informational and comparison purposes

year ended december  compared with the nine months ended december  results of operations we changed our year end in from march to december and  as a result  our most recent statement of operations is for the twelve months ended december  as compared to the nine months ended december  compared to the nine month period  revenues improved million due to having an additional three months of operation offset by a drop in revenues for the rail group caused by the reduction in north american railcar shipments 
operating profit improved to a profit of million compared from a loss of million for the nine month period 
the nine month period included unusual charges of million

interest expense also increased as a result of increased debt incurred 
our management discussion and analysis which follows is based on a comparison of the twelve months ended december  to the unaudited comparable twelve months ended december year ended december  compared with the year ended december  results of operations revenues decreased million to  million for the twelve months ended december  compared to  million for the twelve months ended december   a decrease of 
the decline in revenues was primarily due to the reduction in north american railcar shipments  exiting certain lines of business in the construction products group  all other groups  and the structural towers business 
the following table reconciles the revenue amounts discussed under each segment with the consolidated total revenues shown in the selected financial data in millions

reduced revenues of million and unabsorbed overhead due primarily to lower north american railcar volumes caused operating losses in the rail group 
operating profit for inland barge group was adversely impacted by million in cost incurred related to litigation and related issues initiated by a tank barge customer in may 
the operating loss in the industrial products group was impacted by a million reserve established for a long term lpg equipment lease receivable from a customer who began operating under bankruptcy protection during the second quarter 
improved operating profits in the construction products and all other groups were due to exiting unprofitable product lines 
selling  engineering and administrative expenses decreased million to million for the twelve months ended december  compared to million for the comparable period in  a decrease of 
the decrease was a result of lower head count  cost reduction efforts and special charges of million recorded in the prior year 
interest expense  net of interest income increased million to million for the twelve months ended december  compared to million for the same period in  an increase of 
the increase was attributed to higher debt levels  to charging off debt issuance costs of million related to debt that was replaced with other credit facilities in the current period and lower interest income 
other  net was million for the twelve months ended december  compared to an expense of million for the comparable period of the decrease in expense was due to gains on sale of property  plant and equipment in the current period compared to the same period last year and foreign exchange losses in the current period compared to gains in the prior year period 
net loss for the twelve months ended december  was million  or per diluted share as compared to a net loss of million  or per diluted share  the same period in trinity rail group twelve months ended december  in millions revenues operating loss operating loss margin revenues declined for the twelve months ended december  compared to the same period in this decline is due to the current downturn in the north american railcar market 
north american railcar shipments dropped approximately compared to the prior year to approximately  cars 
operating profit loss for the twelve months ended december  included restructuring charges of million see unusual charges 
operating profit loss margins  excluding unusual charges  were impacted by lower production levels and price pressures in the current competitive environment 
shipments for north america in fiscal year are expected to improve 
in the twelve months ended december   railcar sales to trinity industries leasing company included in the trinity rail group results were million compared to million in the comparable period in with operating profit of million in compared to million for the same period in sales to trinity industries leasing company and related profits are eliminated in consolidation 
construction products group twelve months ended december  in millions revenues operating profit operating profit margin revenues declined for the twelve months ended december  compared to the same period in the decrease in revenues consisted of approximately million attributable to closing under performing concrete and aggregate locations in louisiana in the second quarter and exiting the sheet pile  flange and valve product lines and approximately million due to reduced demands in several business lines 
revenue also declined by million due to inclement weather in the fourth quarter 
these decreases were offset by price increases aggregating million 
operating profit for the twelve months ended december  included other charges of million see unusual charges 
operating profit margins increased as a result of cost reductions in the concrete and aggregate business  elimination of unprofitable products  and efficiency improvements in the bridge business partially offset by steel cost increases in the highway safety business not passed on to customers 
inland barge group twelve months ended december  in millions revenues operating profit operating profit margin revenues increased for the twelve months ended december  compared to the same period in the increase in revenues was attributable to increased deliveries of hopper barges and sale of barges in argentina 
operating profit was lower primarily due to cost incurred related to litigation initiated by two customers in and related issues of million and higher prior year margins due to a one time steel panel contract of million 
we believe the barge industry will experience a significant decline in demand in  which may cause plant closures and lay offs at some of the company s facilities 
industrial products group twelve months ended december  in millions revenues operating profit operating profit margin revenues decreased for the twelve months ended december  compared to the same period in the decrease in revenues is primarily due to a reduction in heads sales offset by an increase in mexico lpg transport equipment sales 
operating income in was impacted by a million reserve established for a long term lpg equipment lease receivable from a customer who began operating under bankruptcy protection during the second quarter 
railcar leasing and management services group twelve months ended december  in millions revenues operating profit operating profit margin revenues for this group include railcar lease revenue and management fees as well as sales of railcars from our lease fleet 
railcar lease revenue and management fees increased million over prior year due to the increase in the size of the lease fleet that includes both company owned railcars and railcars we lease under operating leases 
operating profit is down due to the increased size of the fleet that we lease compared to the fleet we own 
this shift resulted from the fact that  in the march quarter of  we were building a substantial portfolio of lease cars that were subsequently moved from owned cars to leased cars later in the year in a sale leaseback transaction 
the reason that leased cars result in lower operating profit margins is that operating lease expense on the railcars we lease includes both a depreciation component and an interest component that is charged to operating expense 
for owned cars  only a depreciation component is charged to operating expense 
selling  engineering and administrative expense also increased due to our strategy to grow both the lease fleet and the managed car fleet 
for the year  the operating profit margin on lease revenue and management fees declined  of which was due to pricing and utilization  due to increased maintenance expenses and due to the growth in the lease fleet and marketing expenses 
revenues from the sale of railcars from the lease fleet were million in the twelve months ended december  and million in operating profits on these sales were million for the twelve months ended december  and million in all other revenues in all other decreased to million in the twelve months ended december  from million for the twelve months ended december  this decrease is due to discontinuing the concrete mixer and related products business of million in a decline in the structural tower business of million also contributed to lower revenues 
operating loss was million for the twelve months ended december   and million in the same period in restructuring charges included in the twelve months ended december  were million primarily related to exiting the concrete mixer and related products business referred to above and environmental liabilities 
excluding restructuring charges  a larger operating loss was recorded in the same period in due primarily to operating losses associated with concrete mixer and related products business 
nine months ended december  compared with nine months ended december  results of operations revenues decreased million to  million for the nine months ended december  compared to  million for the nine months ended december   a decrease of 
the decline in revenues was primarily due to the reduction in railcar shipments and prices offset by increased revenues of million due to the thrall merger 
the following table reconciles the revenue amounts discussed under each segment with the consolidated total revenues shown in the selected financial data in millions 
nine months ended nine months ended december  december  revenues revenues outside intersegment total outside intersegment total unaudited trinity rail group construction products group inland barge group industrial products group trinity railcar leasing and management services group all other eliminations corporate items consolidated total     operating loss increased million to million for the nine months ended december  compared to million for the same period in the increase was caused by a million decrease in operating profits because of lower revenues  higher cost of revenues and the additional thrall costs of million offset by lower selling  engineering and administrative expenses 
additionally  special charges for the nine months ended december  were million lower than the amount recorded for the same period in selling  engineering and administrative expenses decreased million to million for the nine months ended december  compared to million for the period in  a decrease of 
the decrease was a result of lower head counts  cost reduction efforts and a lesser amount of special charges 
interest expense  net of interest income  increased million to million for the nine months ended december  compared to million for the same period in  an increase of 
the increase was primarily attributable to lower interest income 
other  net decreased million to million for the nine months ended december  from million for the same period in  a decrease 
this decrease was due to the write down of equity investments during the nine months ended december  the current year effective tax rate of is due to lower foreign tax rates and valuation allowances 
net loss for the nine months ended december  was million  or per diluted share as compared to a net loss of million  or per diluted share  for the same period in trinity rail group nine months ended december  in millions revenues operating profit loss operating profit loss margin revenues declined for the nine months ended december  compared to the same period in this decline is due to the current downturn in the north american railcar industry offset by increased revenues of million due to the thrall merger 
railcar units shipped dropped compared to the prior period to approximately  cars 
operating profit margins were impacted by the inefficiencies of lower production levels  costs associated with more frequent changeovers to different car types and sizes  price pressures in the current competitive environment  additional costs from thrall  and restructuring charges see unusual charges 
in the nine months ended december  railcar sales to trinity industries leasing company included in the rail group results were million compared to million in the same period in with profit of million compared to million for the same period in sales to trinity industries leasing company and related profits are eliminated in consolidation 
construction products group nine months ended december  in millions revenues operating profit operating profit margin revenues declined for the nine months ended december  compared to the same period in the decrease in revenues was primarily attributable to exiting the flange and valve business offset by increased revenue and profits related to improved weather conditions in the concrete and aggregate and bridge business 
operating profit margins increased as a result of cost reduction associated with the consolidation of plants  elimination of unprofitable products and other charges see unusual charges 
inland barge group nine months ended december  in millions revenues operating profit operating profit margin revenues increased for the nine months ended december  compared to the same period in the increase in revenues was attributable to increased deliveries of tank barges offset by lower volumes in hopper barge sales 
the decrease in inland barge operating profit margin is mainly due to competitive price pressures for both hopper barges and tank barges 
industrial products group nine months ended december  in millions revenues operating profit operating profit margin revenues declined for the nine months ended december  compared to the same period in the decline in revenues is primarily attributable to reduced demand from gas distributors and pricing pressures in the mexico liquefied petroleum gas market 
sales of propane cylinders in mexico have been negatively affected by a temporary halt in purchasing by mexican propane distributors related to price controls and other matters 
when these issues will be resolved  and the impact on trinity s consolidated profits  cannot be determined 
railcar leasing and management services group nine months ended december  in millions revenues operating profit operating profit margin revenues declined for the nine months ended december  compared to the same period in the decrease in revenues was due to a decline in quantity of railcars sold offset by increases in lease revenues from net additions to the lease fleet and an increase in the fleet managed under management agreements 
included in the results of this group are revenues from the sale of railcars from the lease fleet of million in the nine months ended december  and million in the same period in  and operating profits of million in the nine months ended december  and million in the same period in all other revenues in all other increased from million in the nine months ended december  to million in the nine months ended december   due primarily to recording wind tower revenues for the entire period compared to the prior period start up year 
this increase is partially offset by discontinuing the operations of temco during the same period in temco produced concrete mixers  concrete batch plants and component parts for concrete related industries 
operating loss was for the nine months ended december   and in the same period in restructuring charges included in the nine months ended december  were million primarily related to exiting the temco business referred to above and environmental liabilities 
restructuring charges for the nine months ended december  were million primarily related to exiting our internet related business and to our wind tower business which has been affected by the enron bankruptcy 
excluding restructuring charges  a larger operating loss was recorded in the same period in due primarily to operating losses associated with temco 
liquidity and capital resources net cash provided by operating activities for the year ended december  was million compared to million for the same period in capital expenditures for the year ended december  were million  of which million was for additions to the lease portfolio 
this compares to million of capital expenditures for the same period last year  of which million was for additions to the lease portfolio 
proceeds from the sale of property  plant and equipment were million for the year ended december  composed primarily of the sale of closed facilities in  compared to million for the same period in consisting primarily of proceeds from sale leaseback financing 
as disclosed in note on page  the projected benefit obligation for the employee retirement plans exceed the plans assets by million as of december  as compared to million as of december  approximately one third of the change was due to changing actuarial assumptions in line with current market conditions 
specifically  the discount rate used in the actuarial assumptions was lowered to from a previous rate of and the compensation increase rate was lowered to from a previous rate of 
the remaining difference was primarily due to market losses on our pension assets 
we expect to incur pension expense of million for the year ending  compared to a million expense for the year ended december  employer contributions for the year ending december  are expected to be million compared to million for the year ended december  in june  the company completed a secured credit agreement for million 
the agreement includes a million year revolving commitment and a million year term commitment 
the agreement calls for quarterly payments of principal on the term debt in the amount of thousand beginning september  through june  and million beginning on september  and ending on the maturity date 
amounts borrowed under the revolving commitment bear interest at libor plus at december  
amounts borrowed under the term commitment bear interest at libor plus at december  
the agreement is secured by a portion of the company s accounts receivable and inventory and a portion of its property  plant and equipment 
the agreement limits the amount of capital expenditures related to the company s leasing business  requires maintenance of ratios related to interest coverage  leverage  asset coverage  and minimum net worth and restricts the amount of dividend payments 
at december   million was borrowed under this agreement and million was available under the facility 
at december   the most restrictive of the debt covenants based on trailing twelve month calculations as defined by the debt agreements allow approximately million additional principal and approximately million additional annual interest expense 
in june tilc through a newly formed  wholly owned  business trust entered into a million nonrecourse warehouse facility to finance or refinance railcars acquired or owned by tilc 
the facility is secured by specific railcars and the underlying leases 
advances under the facility may not exceed of the fair market value of the railcars securing the facility less any excluded assets as defined by the agreement 
advances under the facility bear interest at libor plus at december  and are due no later than months from the commence ment date of the facility 
at december   million was available under this facility 
on december   standard poor s rating services lowered the company s corporate credit rating to bb with stable outlook 
this downgrade in the company s credit rating had the effect of increasing the interest rate under the company s bank lines by which is approximately thousand of additional interest expense per year based on debt levels at december   restricting up to million of future cash flows from the company s off balance sheet railcar financing arrangement  and in the current environment  could impact interest rates on any new financing arrangements but would not result in acceleration of any obligations 
should moody s investors service downgrade the company s credit rating  it would result in a increase in our interest rate on the revolving commitment 
we expect to finance future operating requirements with cash flows from operations  and depending on market conditions  long term and short term debt and privately placed equity 
sale leaseback transaction during the nine months ended december   we completed an off balance sheet financing arrangement for million in railcars 
we sold the railcars to an independent trust 
the trust financed the purchase of the railcars with million in debt and million in equity provided by large independent financial institutions 
the equity investor in the trust has the risk of ownership of the assets in the trust except for the million of cash collateral discussed herein 
trinity has made no guarantees with respect to amounts at risk 
an independent trustee for the trust has the authority for the appointment of the railcar fleet manager 
trinity  through a newly formed  wholly owned  qualified subsidiary  leased the cars from the trust and subleased the railcars to independent third party customers 
future operating lease obligations of our subsidiary under the lease agreement are as follows in millions     and thereafter 
future minimum rental revenues from subleased railcars as of december  are as follows in millions      and thereafter 
under the terms of the operating lease agreement  trinity has the option to purchase the railcars from the trust at the end of sixteen years at a predetermined  fixed price 
trinity also has an option to purchase the railcars at the end of the lease agreement at the then fair market value of the railcars 
at the expiration of the operating lease agreement  trinity has no further obligation or ownership interest in the assets of the trust 
included in our accompanying consolidated balance sheet are cash and company owned railcars totaling million which are in the qualified subsidiary and pledged as collateral for the duration of the lease obligations to the trust and an additional million of cash which is pledged as collateral for the equity investor s investment 
trinity  under the terms of a servicing and remarketing agreement  will endeavor  consistent with customary commercial practice as would be used by a prudent person  to maintain railcars under lease for the benefit of the trust 
trinity also receives management fees under the terms of the agreement 
certain ratios must be maintained in order for excess cash flow  as defined  from the leases to third parties  to be available to trinity 
the sale of the railcars by trinity to the trust was accounted for as a sale leaseback transaction 
no revenue or profit was recorded at the time of the transaction and all profit was deferred and is being amortized over the term of the operating lease 
neither the assets  the liabilities nor equity of the trust are reflected on the consolidated balance sheet of trinity 
contractual obligation and commercial commitments 
as of december   we had the following contractual obligations in millions payments due by period year after contractual obligations total or less years years years long term debt operating leases other total as of december   we had the following other commercial commitments in millions amount of commitment expiration per period total amounts year after other commercial commitments committed or less years years years letters of credit operating leases under sale leaseback transaction inflation changes in price levels of products and services did not significantly affect our operations during the year ended december   the nine months ended december  or in fiscal year recent accounting pronouncements in june  the fasb issued statement no 
accounting for asset retirement obligations sfas 
sfas addresses financial accounting and reporting for obligations associated with the retirement of tangible long lived assets and the associated asset retirement costs 
it applies to legal obligations associated with the retirement of long lived assets that result from the acquisition  construction  development and or the normal operation of a long lived asset  except for certain obligations of lessees 
sfas is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after june  the company will adopt sfas on january  the company does not expect that sfas will have a material effect on its consolidated financial condition or results of operations 
in october  the fasb issued statement no 
accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets sfas 
sfas supersedes fasb statement no 
accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of sfas  however it retains the fundamental provisions of that statement related to the recognition and measurement of the impairment of long lived assets to be held and used 
in addition  sfas provides more guidance on estimating cash flows when performing a recoverability test  requires that a long lived asset group to be disposed of other than by sale eg abandoned be classified as held and used until it is disposed of  and establishes more restrictive criteria to classify an asset group as held for sale 
the adoption of sfas did not have a material impact on the company s consolidated financial condition or results of operations 
in june  the fasb issued statement no 
 accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities sfas 
sfas nullifies emerging issues task force issue no 
liability recognition for certain employee termination benefits and other costs to exit an activity including certain costs incurred in a restructuring 
sfas applies to costs associated with an exit activity that does not involve an entity newly acquired in a business combination or with a disposal activity covered by sfas sfas is effective for exit or disposal activities that are initiated after december   with earlier application encouraged 
the company does not expect that sfas will have a material effect on its consolidated financial condition or results of operations but it will impact the timing of charges which could impact comparability of results among reporting periods 
during november  the fasb issued interpretation no 
guarantor s accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees  including indirect guarantees of indebtedness of others fin 
fin requires certain guarantees to be recorded at fair value 
the initial recognition and measurement provisions of fin are applicable  on a prospective basis  to guarantees issued or modified after december  fin also requires a guarantor to make significant new disclosures 
the disclosure requirements are effective for financial statements ending after december  fin did not have a material impact on the company s consolidated financial statements 
in december  the fasb issued statement no 
accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosures sfas which amends fasb statement no 
accounting for stock based compensation sfas 
sfas provides alternative methods of transition for a voluntary change to the fair value based method of accounting for stock based employee compensation 
in addition  sfas amends the disclosure requirements of sfas to require more prominent and more frequent disclosures in financial statements about the effects of stock based compensation 
the transition guidance and annual disclosure provisions of sfas are effective for fiscal years ending after december  the interim disclosure provisions are effective for financial reports containing financial statements for interim periods beginning after december  during january  the fasb issued interpretation no 
consolidation of variable interest entities fin 
the consolidation requirements of fin apply immediately to variable interest entities created after january  and apply to existing variable interest entities in the first fiscal year or interim period beginning after june  until now  one company generally has included another entity in its consolidated financial statements only if it controlled the entity through voting interests 
interpretation requires a variable interest entity to be consolidated by a company if that company is subject to a majority of the risk of loss from the variable interest entity s activities or entitled to receive a majority of the entity s residual returns or both 
a company that consolidates a variable interest entity is called the primary beneficiary of that entity 
certain of the disclosure requirements apply in all financial statements issued after january   regardless of when the variable interest entity was established 
we are currently evaluating whether or not trinity would be designated the primary beneficiary of the independent trust which purchased railcars from us in a sale leaseback transaction as described above 
currently  we believe  based on preliminary analysis  that the company is not the primary beneficiary and therefore will not be required to consolidate the trust 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our earnings are affected by changes in interest rates due to the impact those changes have on our variable rate debt obligations  which represented approximately of our total debt as of december  we have hedged a portion of this exposure with interest rate swaps leaving approximately of our total debt exposed to fluctuations in interest rates 
if interest rates average one percentage point more in fiscal year than they did during the year ended december   our interest expense would increase by approximately million 
in comparison  at december   we estimated that if interest rates averaged one percentage point more in fiscal year than they did during the nine months ended december   interest expense would have increased by approximately million 
the impact of an increase in interest rates was determined based on the impact of the hypothetical change in interest rates and scheduled principal payments on our variable rate debt obligations as of december  and in addition  we are subject to market risk related to our net investments in our foreign subsidiaries 
the net investment in foreign subsidiaries as of december  is million 
however  the impact of such market risk exposures as a result of foreign exchange rate fluctuations has not been material to us
