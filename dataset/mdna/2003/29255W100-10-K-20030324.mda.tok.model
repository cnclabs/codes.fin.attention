item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations special note regarding forward looking statements our disclosure and analysis in this report contains some forward looking statements 
forward looking statements give our current expectations or forecasts of future events 
you can identify these statements by the fact that they do not relate strictly to historical or current facts 
these statements may include words such as anticipate  estimate  expect  project  intend  plan  believe  and other words and terms of similar meaning in connection with any discussion of future operating or financial performance 
in particular  these include  among other things  statements relating to amount  nature  and timing of capital expenditures  drilling of wells  timing and amount of future production of oil and natural gas  increases in proved reserves  operating costs and other expenses  cash flow and anticipated liquidity  prospect exploitation and property acquisitions  and marketing of oil and natural gas 
any or all of our forward looking statements in this report may turn out to be wrong 
they can be affected by inaccurate assumptions we might make or by known or unknown risks and uncertainties 
many factors mentioned in our discussion in this report would be important in determining future results 
actual future results may vary materially 
factors that could cause our results to differ materially from the results discussed in the forward looking statements include the following the risks associated with operating in one or two major geographic areas  the risks associated with drilling of oil and natural gas wells in our exploitation efforts  our ability to find  acquire  market  develop  and produce new properties  oil and natural gas price volatility  uncertainties in the estimation of proved reserves and in the projection of future rates of production and timing of exploitation expenditures  operating hazards attendant to the oil and natural gas business  drilling and completion risks that are generally not recoverable from third parties or insurance  potential mechanical failure or underperformance of significant wells  climatic conditions  availability and cost of material and equipment  actions or inactions of third party operators of our properties  our ability to find and retain skilled personnel  availability of capital  the strength and financial resources of our competitors  regulatory developments  environmental risks  and general economic conditions 
when you consider these forward looking statements  you should keep in mind these risk factors and the other cautionary statements in this report 
description of critical accounting policies oil and natural gas properties we utilize the successful efforts method of accounting for our oil and natural gas properties 
under this method  all development and acquisition costs of proved properties are capitalized and amortized on a unit of production basis over the remaining life of proved developed reserves or proved reserves  as applicable 
exploration expenses  including geological and geophysical expenses and delay rentals  are charged to expense as incurred 
costs of drilling exploratory wells are initially capitalized  but charged to expense if and when the well is determined to be unsuccessful 
expenditures for repairs and maintenance to sustain or increase production from the existing producing reservoir are charged to expense as incurred 
expenditures to recomplete a current well in a different or additional proven or unproven reservoir are capitalized pending determination that economic reserves have been added 
if the recompletion is not successful  the expenditures are charged to expense 
expenditures for redrilling or directional drilling in a previously abandoned well are classified as drilling costs to a proven or unproven reservoir for determination of capital or expense 
significant tangible equipment added or replaced is capitalized 
expenditures to construct facilities or increase the productive capacity from existing reserves are capitalized 
internal costs directly associated with the development and exploitation of properties are capitalized as a cost of the property and are classified accordingly in the company s financial statements 
natural gas volumes are converted to equivalent barrels at the rate of six mcf to one barrel 
the company is required to assess the need for an impairment of capitalized costs of oil and natural gas properties and other long lived assets whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value of those assets may not be recoverable 
if impairment is indicated based on a comparison of the asset s carrying value to its undiscounted expected future net cash flows  then it is recognized to the extent that the carrying value exceeds fair value 
any impairment charge incurred is recorded in accumulated depletion  depreciation  and amortization dd a to reduce our recorded basis in the asset 
each part of this calculation is subject to a large degree of management judgment  including the determination of property s reserves  future cash flows  and fair value 
management s assumptions used in calculating reserves or regarding the future cash flows or fair value of our properties are subject to change in the future 
any change could cause impairment expense to be recorded  reducing our net income and our basis in the related asset 
future prices received for production and future production costs may vary  perhaps significantly  from the prices and costs assumed for purposes of calculating reserve estimates 
there can be no assurance that the proved reserves will be developed within the periods estimated or that prices and costs will remain constant 
actual production may not equal the estimated amounts used in the preparation of reserve projections 
as these estimates change  the amount of calculated reserves change 
any change in reserves directly impacts our estimate of future cash flows from the property  as well as the property s fair value 
additionally  as management s views related to future prices change  this changes the calculation of future net cash flows and also affects fair value estimates 
changes in either of these amounts will directly impact the calculation of impairment 
dd a expense is also directly affected by the company s reserve estimates 
any change in reserves directly impacts the amount of dd a expense the company recognizes in a given period 
assuming no other changes  such as an increase in depreciable base  as the company s reserves increase  the amount of dd a expense in a given period decreases and vice versa 
changes in future commodity prices would likely result in increases or decreases in estimated recoverable reserves 
additionally  the company s independent reserve engineers estimate our reserves once a year at december this results in a new dd a rate which the company uses for the preceding fourth quarter and the subsequent three quarters of the new year 
net profits interests a major portion of our acreage position in the cedar creek anticline is subject to net profits interests npi ranging from to 
the holders of these net profits interests are entitled to receive a fixed percentage of the cash flow remaining after specified costs have been deducted from revenues 
the net profits calculations are contractually defined  but in general  net profits are determined after considering operating expense  overhead expense  interest expense  and drilling costs 
the amounts of reserves and production calculated to be attributable to these net profits interests are deducted from our reserves and production data  and our revenues are reported net of npi payments 
the reserves and production that are attributed to the npis are calculated by dividing estimated future npi payments in the case of reserves or prior period actual npi payments in the case of production by the commodity prices current at the determination date 
fluctuations in commodity prices and the levels of development activities in the cca from period to period will impact the reserves and production attributed to the npis and will have an inverse effect on our reported reserves and production 
hedging and related activities we use various financial instruments for non trading purposes to manage and reduce price volatility and other market risks associated with our crude oil and natural gas production 
these arrangements are structured to reduce our exposure to commodity price decreases  but they can also limit the benefit we might otherwise receive from commodity price increases 
our risk management activity is generally accomplished through over the counter forward derivative contracts executed with large financial institutions 
prior to january   these agreements were accounted for as hedges using the deferral method of accounting 
unrealized gains and losses were generally not recognized until the physical production required by the contracts was delivered 
at the time of delivery  the resulting gains and losses were recognized as an adjustment to oil and natural gas revenues 
the cash flows related to any recognized gains or losses associated with these hedges were reported as cash flows from operations 
if the hedge was terminated prior to maturity  gains or losses were deferred and included in income in the same period as the physical production required by the contracts was delivered 
we also use derivative instruments in the form of interest rate swaps  which hedge our risk related to interest rate fluctuation 
prior to january   these agreements were accounted for as hedges using the accrual method of accounting 
the differences to be paid or received on swaps designated as hedges were included in interest expense during the period to which the payment or receipt related 
the cash flows related to recognized gains or losses associated with these hedges were reported as cash flows from operations 
effective january   the company adopted statement of financial accounting standards no 
sfas  accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
this standard required us to recognize all of our derivative and hedging instruments in our statements of financial position as either assets or liabilities and measure them at fair value 
if a derivative does not qualify for hedge accounting  it must be adjusted to fair value through earnings 
however  if a derivative does qualify for hedge accounting  depending on the nature of the hedge  changes in fair value can be offset against the change in fair value of the hedged item through earnings or recognized in other comprehensive income until such time as the hedged item is recognized in earnings 
to qualify for cash flow hedge accounting  the cash flows from the hedging instrument must be highly effective in offsetting changes in cash flows due to changes in the underlying items being hedged 
in addition  all hedging relationships must be designated  documented  and reassessed periodically 
most of the company s derivative financial instruments qualify for hedge accounting 
the only exceptions at december  are a written oil put contract representing bbls d for and several interest rate swap contracts 
in accordance with the provisions of sfas  these are marked to market through earnings each quarter 
if oil prices or libor interest rates were to change dramatically and cause a material increase or decrease in the market value of these contracts  the change would be recognized in earnings immediately 
currently  all of the company s derivative financial instruments that qualify for hedge accounting are designated as cash flow hedges 
these instruments hedge the exposure of variability in expected future cash flows that is attributable to a particular risk 
the effective portion of the gain or loss on these derivative instruments is recorded in other comprehensive income in stockholders equity and reclassified into earnings in the same period in which the hedged transaction affects earnings 
any ineffective portion of the gain or loss is recognized into earnings immediately 
while management does not anticipate changing the designation of any of our current derivative contracts as hedges  factors beyond our control could preclude the use of hedge accounting 
one example would be variability in the nymex price for oil or natural gas  upon which many of our commodity derivative contracts are based  that does not coincide with changes in the spot price for oil and natural gas that we are paid 
another example would be if the counterparty to a derivative contract was deemed no longer deemed creditworthy and non performance under the terms of the contract was likely 
if any of our contracts no longer qualify for hedge accounting  this potentially could induce high earnings volatility  as any future changes in the market value of the contract would then be marked to market through earnings 
new accounting standards in august  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
sfas  accounting for asset retirement obligations  which the company will be required to adopt as of january  this statement requires us to record a liability in the period in which an asset retirement obligation aro is incurred 
also  upon initial recognition of the liability  we must capitalize additional asset cost equal to the amount of the liability 
in addition to any obligations that arise after the effective date of sfas  upon initial adoption we must recognize a liability for any existing aros  capitalized cost related to the liability  and accumulated depletion  depreciation  and amortization on that capitalized cost 
the adoption of sfas resulted in a january  cumulative effect adjustment to record i a million increase in the carrying values of proved properties  ii a million decrease in accumulated depletion  depreciation  and amortization  and iii a million increase in other non current liabilities  and iv a gain of million  net of tax  as a cumulative effect of accounting change on january  in april  the fasb issued sfas  rescission of fasb statements no 
  and  amendment of fasb statement no 
 and technical corrections 
under statement  all gains and losses from extinguishment of debt were required to be aggregated and  if material  classified as an extraordinary item  net of related income tax effect 
this statement eliminates statement and  thus  the exception to applying opinion to all gains and losses related to extinguishments of debt 
as a result  gains and losses from extinguishment of debt should be classified as extraordinary items only if they meet the criteria in opinion applying the provisions of opinion will distinguish transactions that are part of an entity s recurring operations from those that are unusual or infrequent or that meet the criteria for classification as an extraordinary item 
this statement is effective for encore beginning january   at which time the extraordinary loss on extinguishment of debt recorded in the second quarter of will be reclassified to operating income 
comparison of to set forth below is our comparison of operations during the year ended december  with the year ended december  revenues and production 
for the year ended december   revenues increased million 
the following table illustrates the primary components of oil and natural gas revenue for the years ended december  and  as well as each year s respective oil and natural gas volumes in thousands except per unit amounts year ended december  difference revenue unit revenue unit revenue unit revenues oil wellhead    oil hedges    total oil revenues    natural gas wellhead    gas hedges    total gas revenues    average average average nymex nymex nymex production unit production unit production unit other data oil bbls    gas mcf   combined boe    oil revenues increased million in over primarily due to an increase in oil volumes  while the net wellhead price received remained relatively flat 
oil volumes increased  mbbls from to due to the central permian and paradox basin acquisitions  as well as increased production from the company s successful development drilling program 
wellhead oil revenues were reduced by million and million in and  respectively  for the net profits interests payments held by others in the cca 
total oil revenues were further increased by a decrease in hedge payments  which were million lower 
natural gas revenues decreased in by million due to a decrease in the net wellhead price received  from in to in  with essentially flat production 
this price decline is consistent with the nymex decline from to over the same period 
the company recovered a portion of the natural gas price decline through its hedges  which generated net receipts of million in versus net payments of million in these hedging receipts are a direct result of the decrease in the average nymex price for natural gas 
for we anticipate increased production related to our anticipated million capital drilling program 
unless changes are made to our planned drilling activities or another acquisition is made  production should be approximately million boe for prices received for oil and natural gas production are largely based on current market prices  which are beyond our control 
during  prices were trending upward 
the nymex strip pricing at december  indicates higher oil and natural gas prices in we have based our forecasts on the assumptions of per bbl and per mcf nymex prices 
at these assumed prices  we have forecasted hedge contract payments of approximately million for oil and receipts of million for natural gas 
however  these amounts will change directly with any change in the market price of oil and natural gas and with any change in our outstanding hedge positions 
additionally  we have anticipated net profits interests payments of million for oil and million for natural gas 
these payments are highly dependent on the level of drilling in the cca and commodity prices  and thus  any change in the level of drilling or market fluctuation in commodity prices will have a direct impact on the amount of payments we are required to make 
if commodity prices are significantly lower than our forecasted prices of for oil and for natural gas  the company will not be able to fund the budgeted million drilling program for through internally generated cash flow and available cash 
in this case  the company would have to borrow money under our existing revolving credit facility  seek additional equity  or curtail the capital program 
if drilling is curtailed or ended  future cash flows could be materially negatively impacted 
direct lifting costs 
direct lifting costs of the company for the year ended december  increased as compared to by million 
the increase in direct lifting costs resulted from the increase in volumes as a result of our central permian and paradox basin acquisitions and our successful drilling program 
see revenues and production on page on a per boe basis  direct lifting costs increased from in to in primarily due to higher per boe lifting costs for our acquisitions 
for we anticipate an increase in total direct lifting costs  as well as on a per boe basis 
we anticipate this increase due to a full year of production at our paradox basin properties which have a higher per boe operating costs than our company s historical average for direct lifting costs  as well as expected higher electricity costs  one of the largest components of direct lifting costs  on our permian and cca properties 
we have projected total direct lifting costs of approximately million or per boe for production  ad valorem  and severance taxes 
production  ad valorem  and severance taxes for the year ended december  increased as compared to by approximately million 
the increase is a direct result of the increase in wellhead revenue 
see revenues and production on page as a percentage of oil and natural gas revenues excluding the effects of net profits and hedges  production  ad valorem  and severance taxes increased slightly from to from to for total production  ad valorem  and severance taxes will depend in a large part on prevailing prices 
however  the production  ad valorem  and severance tax rate should remain relatively constant at an estimated of wellhead revenues 
as production is forecast to increase  similar prices in as in would cause an increase in total production  ad valorem  and severance taxes 
additionally  if prices continue to stay above per bbl we will temporarily lose production and severance tax incentives in montana and north dakota  which would cause our tax rates to increase in depletion  depreciation  and amortization dd a expense 
dd a expense increased by approximately million in this increase was due to a mmboe increase in production volumes  partially offset by a decrease in the dd a rate per boe 
see comparison of and revenues and production on page the average dd a rate decreased from per boe of production during to per boe in the increase in volumes caused a million increase in related dd a expense  while the decrease in the dd a rate caused a million decrease 
the decrease is attributable to upward reserve revisions due to higher prices 
we anticipate the total dd a expense in to increase due to increased production resulting from the paradox basin acquisition and our planned capital expenditures of million 
assuming capital expenditures that do not differ significantly from our budgeted amount  we expect our dd a rate for to be approximately per boe 
this per boe decrease from is primarily due to the effects of statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for asset retirement obligations and higher proved reserve volumes at december  this rate could vary significantly based on actual capital expenditures  production rates  and any acquisition that closes in additionally  changes in the market price for oil and natural gas could affect the level of our reserves 
as the level of reserves change  the dd a rate is inversely affected 
general and administrative g a expense 
g a expense increased million in excluding non cash stock based compensation of million in 
the increase in g a resulted from the additional staff necessary after the permian and paradox basin acquisitions to manage  expand  and exploit our growing asset base 
on a per boe basis  g a expense remained relatively flat at during as compared to during we have forecast approximately million for general and administrative expenses in this represents a modest increase of to million from the increase will result from higher insurance  rent  salaries  and hiring additional support staff necessary for our growing asset base 
other operating expense 
other operating expense for the year ended december  increased as compared to by approximately million 
this amount primarily consists of severance payment obligations to former employees of the company  as well as transportation costs  namely pipeline fees paid to third parties  geological and geophysical expenses  and delay rentals 
the increase is due to higher transportation costs and geological and geophysical expenses in  which more than offset the lack of severance payments in for  we anticipate other operating expense to be approximately to million 
interest expense 
interest expense for the year ended december  increased million over the increase in interest expense is primarily due to increased levels of debt  amortization of hedge loss see below  and a higher weighted average interest rate in as compared to on june   the company issued million in senior subordinated notes  and used most of the proceeds to repay all amounts outstanding under the previous credit facility  terminated the previous credit facility  and entered into a new revolving credit facility 
see liquidity and capital resources on page for  the weighted average debt balance was million  compared with million for additionally  the weighted average interest rate  including hedges  in was  while it was in the higher weighted average interest rate is due to a higher fixed rate on these notes as compared to the floating rate debt outstanding previously 
at the time the previous credit facility was terminated  the company had three interest rate swaps outstanding  with a notional amount of million each  which swapped libor based floating rates for fixed rates 
according to the provisions of sfas  these no longer qualified for hedge accounting 
the unrealized loss of million at june   which was recognized in accumulated other comprehensive income  is being amortized to interest expense over the original life of the swaps 
we amortized million of this loss to interest expense during the following table illustrates the components of interest expense for and in thousands difference senior subordinated notes   facilities    burlington note hedge settlements  hedge loss amortization   debt issuance cost fees and other total    non cash stock based compensation expense 
non cash stock based compensation expense decreased from million for to zero in this non cash stock based compensation expense is associated with the purchase by our management stockholders of class a common stock under our management stock plan adopted in august and was recorded as compensation in accordance with variable plan accounting under accounting principles board opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees apb 
the million of non cash compensation expense recorded in the first quarter of represents the final amount of expense to be recorded related to the class a stock 
at the end of the fourth quarter of  the company issued  shares of restricted stock to all current employees 
of these   shares vest over a five year period evenly in years three  four  and five and depend only on continued employment for future issuance 
these represent a fixed award per apb and compensation expense will be recorded over the related service period as shown in the table below 
the remaining  shares were issued to four members of senior management and also vest over a five year period evenly in years three  four  and five 
however  these shares not only depend on the passage of time and continued employment  but on certain performance measures for their future issuance 
these represent a variable award under apb  and thus  the full amount of compensation expense to be recorded for these shares will not be known until their eventual issuance 
the table below reflects the estimated expense related to the restricted stock grant to be recorded in the future by year based on the company s stock price at december  in thousands 
estimated fixed variable total compensation compensation compensation period expense expense expense total   derivative fair value gain loss 
the derivative fair value gain of million in represents the ineffective portion of the mark to market loss on our derivative hedging instruments  as well as the mark to market loss on our two short puts outstanding at december  and our interest rate swap settlements subsequent to the issuance of the senior subordinated notes on june  see item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk commodity price sensitivity on page currently this line item on the statement of operations is primarily dependent on the futures price of oil and libor interest rates 
this is due to the fact that  currently  the main components are the mark to market movement and settlements of our short oil put and our interest rate swaps 
bad debt expense 
on december   enron corp 
and certain subsidiaries  including enron north america corp 
enron  each filed voluntary petitions for relief under chapter of title of the united states bankruptcy code 
prior to this date  the company had entered into oil and natural gas hedging contracts with enron  many of which were set to expire at december   however  others related to and as a result of the chapter bankruptcy declaration and pursuant to the terms of the company s contract with enron  we terminated all outstanding oil and natural gas derivative contracts with enron as of december  according to the terms of the contract  enron is liable to the company for the mark to market value of all contracts outstanding on that date  which totaled million 
additionally  enron failed to make timely payment of million in hedge settlements 
both of these amounts remained outstanding as of december  due to the uncertainty of future collection of any or all of the amounts owed to us by enron  for the year ended december   we have recorded a charge to bad debt expense for the full amount of the receivable  million  and recorded a related allowance on the receivable of million 
any ultimate recovery on the enron receivable will be recognized in earnings if and when management believes recovery of the asset is probable 
at the time of termination  the market price of our commodity contracts with enron exceeded their amortized cost on our balance sheet  giving rise to a gain 
according to the provisions of sfas  this gain must be recorded in other comprehensive income until such time as the original hedged production affects income 
as a result  at december   we had million in gross unrecognized gains in other comprehensive income that are being reversed into earnings during and the following table illustrates the current and future amortization of this amount to revenue in thousands period oil gas total total    impairment of oil and gas properties 
throughout  futures prices for oil and natural gas continued to decline from their december  levels 
the sec price case used for our reserve estimate was per bbl and per mcf dropping to per bbl and per mcf for the estimate 
although the sec price case does not necessarily coincide with management s estimates of future prices  this indicated the need to assess our oil and natural gas properties for any possible impairment 
thus  we compared the undiscounted future cash flows for each of our oil and natural gas properties to their net book value  which indicated the need for an impairment charge on certain properties 
we then compared the net book value of the impaired assets to their estimated fair value  which resulted in a write down of the value of proved oil and gas properties of million 
fair value was determined using estimates of future production volumes and estimates of future prices we might receive for these volumes discounted back to a present value using a rate commensurate with the risks inherent in the industry 
we performed a similar review at december  and and determined no impairment charge was necessary 
future impairment charges could result based on changes in the company s estimated reserves  management s estimate of future prices  or management s fair value estimate of our properties 
if oil and natural gas prices were to decrease in the future  our reserves could be negatively impacted and or management s estimate of either future cash flows or fair value of our properties could change 
any of these results could indicate the need for additional impairment charges 
comparison of to set forth below is our comparison of operations during the year ended december  with the year ended december  revenues and production

oil volumes increased mbbls from to due to a full year of production from the acquisitions completed during  as well as increased production from the company s successful development drilling program 
this increase in production added million in wellhead revenue despite a decrease of per barrel in the wellhead price received 
the decrease in wellhead price resulted primarily from a decrease in the overall market price for oil in as reflected in the per bbl decrease in the average nymex price from to oil revenues were reduced by million and million in and  respectively  for the net profits interests payments held by others in cca 
the decrease in net profits interests payments in was due to increased capital activity  which reduces the net profits interests payments 
the decrease in wellhead oil revenues was offset by a decrease in payments made for hedging  which decreased million 
the company s hedging activities are not a component of the expenses deducted in calculating net profits interest payments 
the decrease in hedging payments is a direct result of the decrease in the average nymex price for oil 
natural gas revenues increased from to by million due to a  mmcf increase in production  while net price received decreased by 
the increase in volumes is due to a full year of production for the acquisitions completed in  as well as increased production in the cca and crockett county properties due to successful development drilling 
wellhead price received decreased per mcf  while the average nymex price increased per mcf 
this is the result of higher prices received in relation to nymex for natural gas in the cca versus the price discount received in the indian basin verden areas 
hedging payments decreased per mcf due to different hedges being in effect during than direct lifting costs 
direct lifting costs of the company for the year ended december  increased as compared to by million

see comparison of to revenues and production on page on a per boe basis  direct lifting costs increased from in to in due to higher workover and contract labor costs in the cca resulting from to the relatively harsh winter and the increased cost for services 
additionally  the company invested million related to workovers in bell creek  which was acquired in december production  ad valorem  and severance taxes 
production  ad valorem  and severance taxes for the year ended december  decreased as compared to by approximately million 
the decrease is a direct result of the decrease in wellhead revenue 
see comparison of to revenues and production on page as a percentage of oil and natural gas revenues excluding the effects of hedges  production  ad valorem  and severance taxes decreased from to from to this decrease was the result of a higher production  ad valorem  and severance tax rate in montana associated with our cca asset versus the lower tax rates in texas  north dakota  new mexico  and oklahoma associated with our crockett county  lodgepole  and indian basin verden assets

we anticipate that our capital expenditures will total approximately million for the level of these and other future expenditures is largely discretionary  and the amount of funds devoted to any particular activity may increase or decrease significantly  depending on available opportunities and market conditions 
we plan to finance our ongoing development and acquisition expenditures using internally generated cash flow  available cash  and our existing credit agreement 
at december   the company had total assets of million 
total capitalization was million  of which was represented by stockholders equity and by senior debt 
on june   the company sold million of senior subordinated notes maturing on june  the notes in a private offering exempt from registration requirements of the securities act of as amended 
the offering was made through a private placement pursuant to rule a 
the company received net proceeds of million from the sale of the notes  after deducting debt issuance costs 
the proceeds were used to repay and retire the company s prior credit facility million  to pay the fees and expenses related to the new revolving credit facility million  and to hold in reserve for the paradox basin acquisition million 
in connection with the issuance of the notes  we entered into a registration rights agreement  dated june   with the initial purchasers of the notes and entered into an indenture governing the notes 
the indenture limits our ability  among other things  to incur additional indebtedness  pay dividends on our capital stock or redeem  repurchase or retire our capital stock or subordinated indebtedness  make investments  incur liens  create any consensual limitation on the ability of our restricted subsidiaries to pay dividends  make loans or transfer property  engage in transactions with affiliates  sell assets  including capital stock of our subsidiaries  and consolidate  merge or transfer assets 
pursuant to the registration rights agreement  we filed a registration statement on form s a with the sec  which was declared effective on december   with respect to the exchange of the notes for registered notes having terms substantially identical in all material respects 
on january   all of the notes were exchanged for the registered notes  encore s registered senior subordinated notes due june  were issued and the notes were cancelled 
the company did not receive any proceeds from the exchange 
the registered notes are senior subordinated unsecured obligations of encore 
the registered notes mature on june  we pay interest on the registered notes semiannually on june and december  beginning on december  the registered notes rank equal in right of payment with any of our future senior subordinated indebtedness and are subordinated in right of payment to our obligations under our revolving credit facility see next paragraph and of our other existing and future senior indebtedness 
the payment of principal  interest  and premium on the registered notes is fully and unconditionally guaranteed  jointly and severally  on a senior subordinated basis  by our existing and some of our future restricted subsidiaries 
we are entitled to redeem the registered notes in whole or in part on or after june  for the redemption price set forth in the registered notes 
prior to june   we are entitled to redeem the registered notes  in whole but not in part  at a redemption price equal to the principal amount of the registered notes plus a premium 
there is no sinking fund for the notes 
if we fail to comply with some of our obligations under the registration rights agreement relating to the registered notes  we will pay additional interest on the registered notes 
concurrently with the issuance of the notes  we entered into a new revolving credit facility with a syndicate of banks  which replaced our prior credit facility 
all of our subsidiaries are guarantors of our revolving credit facility 
the maximum amount available under our revolving credit facility is million  which is secured by a first priority lien on our proved oil and natural gas reserves representing at least of the present discounted reserve value 
as of december   the amount available to us under our revolving credit facility is million which may be increased and decreased subject to a borrowing base calculation 
as of december   million was outstanding under the new revolving credit facility 
the maturity date is june we may choose between two base loan interest rates 
the first base interest rate the abr rate is a rate calculated as the highest of the annual rate of interest announced by the agent bank as its base rate  and the federal funds effective rate plus  plus a margin of to based upon the level of borrowing 
the second base rate the libor rate is equal to the london interbank offered rate plus a margin of to based upon the level of borrowing 
in addition to the foregoing rates  we must pay a commitment fee on unused portions of the available borrowing base 
interest on abr rate loans is paid quarterly in arrears 
at our election  interest periods for libor rate loans are one  three  six or twelve months  and interest is payable at the end of each interest period and at the end of each succeeding three month period 
borrowings under our revolving credit facility are guaranteed by each of our subsidiaries and are secured by a mortgage of our oil and natural gas properties and a pledge of the capital stock and equity interests of our subsidiaries 
we pay customary fees to the various banks and agents 
the borrowing base is to be redetermined each june and december the bank syndicate has the ability to request one additional borrowing base redetermination per year  and we are permitted to request two additional borrowing base redeterminations per year 
generally  if amounts outstanding ever exceed the borrowing base  we must reduce the amounts outstanding to the redetermined borrowing base within six months  provided that if amounts outstanding exceed the borrowing base as a result of any sale of our assets  we must reduce the amounts outstanding immediately upon consummation of the sale 
our revolving credit facility contains a number of negative and financial covenants  all of which we were in compliance with as of december  these covenants include  among others a prohibition against incurring debt in excess of million  except for borrowings under our revolving credit facility  the outstanding notes  and the exchange notes  a prohibition against paying dividends or purchasing or redeeming capital stock or prepaying indebtedness including the outstanding notes and the exchange notes  a restriction on creating liens on our assets  restrictions on merging and selling assets outside the ordinary course of business  restrictions on use of proceeds  investments  transactions with affiliates  changing our principal business  and incurring funding obligations under erisa  a provision limiting oil and natural gas hedging transactions to a volume not exceeding of anticipated production from proved reserves  a requirement that we maintain a ratio of consolidated current assets to consolidated current liabilities of not less than to  and a requirement that we maintain a ratio of consolidated ebitda as defined in our revolving credit facility agreement to the sum of consolidated net interest expense plus our letter of credit fees of not less than to based on current commodity conditions  the company believes that its capital resources are adequate to meet the requirements of its business through based on our anticipated capital investment programs  we expect to invest our internally generated cash flow to replace production and enhance our development programs 
during  we plan to invest approximately million to exploit and develop existing core properties 
the million budgeted does not include the possible million for additional high pressure air injection capital 
see item business and properties present activities cedar creek anticline high pressure air injection limited scale program on page additional capital may be required to pursue acquisitions or other capital projects 
substantially all of these expenditures are discretionary and will be undertaken only if funds are available and the projected rates of return are satisfactory 
future cash flows are subject to a number of variables including the level of oil and natural gas production and prices 
operations and other capital resources may not provide cash in sufficient amounts to maintain planned levels of capital expenditures 
additionally  we are required to maintain margin amounts and or letters of credits on our outstanding hedges with our counter parties if the hedges reach a certain negative value 
at december   the company had an outstanding letter of credit with a counterparty in the amount of million  which expired on january  if oil prices continue to rise  we could be required to make margin deposits or increase our outstanding letters of credits 
also  subsequent to december   the company cash settled the two outstanding million interest rate swaps at a cost of million 
the following table illustrates the company s contractual obligations outstanding at december  payments due by period contractual obligations total thereafter notes   revolving credit facility   operating leases   totals     inflation and changes in prices while the general level of inflation affects certain of our costs  factors unique to the petroleum industry result in independent price fluctuations 
historically  significant fluctuations have occurred in oil and natural gas prices 
in addition  changing prices often cause costs of equipment and supplies to vary as industry activity levels increase and decrease to reflect perceptions of future price levels 
although it is difficult to estimate future prices of oil and natural gas  price fluctuations have had  and will continue to have  a material effect on us 
the following table indicates the average oil and natural gas prices received for the years ended december    and average equivalent prices for   and were decreased by   and per boe  respectively  as a result of our hedging activities

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk hedging policy 
we have adopted a formal hedging policy 
the purpose of our hedging program is to mitigate the negative effects of declining commodity prices on our business 
the hedging policy is set by the president with input from the chief executive officer and the chief financial officer 
trades are executed by the director of corporate planning 
the treasury department handles the administration functions  which entail tracking existing trades  confirming new trades  and conducting monthly settlements 
our accounting department records the transactions in the financial statements 
we plan to continue in the normal course of business to hedge our exposure to fluctuating commodity prices 
these arrangements will not exceed of anticipated production from proved producing reserves 
for the first six months of  we have approximately of our estimated oil production placed in floors  capped  and in swap agreements and for the last six months of  we have approximately in floors and capped 
for the first six months of  we have approximately of our oil production placed in floors and capped and for the last six months of  we have approximately in floors and capped 
in addition  for  we have approximately of our estimated natural gas placed in floors  capped  and in swap agreements and for we have approximately in floors and capped 
our hedging policy does not permit us to engage in hedging transactions for speculation for our own account 
counterparties 
the company s counterparties to hedging contracts include bank of america  bnp paribas  deutche bank  morgan stanley  credit lyonnais  j 
aron company  a wholly owned subsidiary of goldman  sachs co  and cibc world markets cibc  the marketing arm of the canadian imperial bank of commerce 
approximately   and of estimated oil production hedged is committed to j 
aron company  morgan stanley  and credit lyonnais  respectively 
approximately   and of our hedged gas production is contracted with morgan stanley  j 
aron company  and bnp paribas  respectively 
performance on all of j 
aron company s contracts with the company is guaranteed by their parent goldman  sachs co 
we feel the credit worthiness of our current counterparties is sound and we do not anticipate any non performance of contractual obligations 
as long as each counterparty maintains an investment grade credit rating  pursuant to our hedging contracts  no collateral is required 
in order to mitigate the credit risk of financial instruments  the company enters into master netting agreements with significant counterparties 
the master netting agreement is a standardized  bilateral contract between the company and a given counterparty 
instead of treating separately each financial transaction between the company and its counterparty  the master netting agreement enables the company and its counterparty to aggregate all financial trades and treat them as a single agreement 
this arrangement benefits the company in three ways 
first  the netting of the value of all trades reduces the requirements of daily collateral posting by the company 
second  default by a counterparty under one financial trade can trigger rights for the company to terminate all financial trades with such counterparty 
third  netting of settlement amounts reduces the company s credit exposure to a given counterparty in the event of close out 
commodity price sensitivity 
the tables in this section provide information about derivative financial instruments to which we were a party as of december  that are sensitive to changes in oil and natural gas commodity prices 
the company hedges commodity price risk with swap contracts  put contracts  and collar contracts 
swap contracts provide a fixed price for a notional amount of sales volumes 
put contracts provide a fixed floor price on a notional amount of sales volumes while allowing full price participation if the relevant index price closes above the floor price 
collar contracts provide a floor price on a notional amount of sales volumes while allowing some additional price participation if the relevant index price closes above the floor price 
additionally  we occasionally we sell short put contracts with a strike price well below the floor price of the collar 
these short put contracts do not qualify for hedge accounting under sfas  and accordingly  the mark to market change in the value of these contracts is recorded as fair value gain loss in the statement of operations 
at december   we had one such contract in place representing bbls d with a strike price of per barrel 
the unrealized mark to market loss on our outstanding commodity derivatives at december  was approximately million 
the fair market value of our oil hedging contracts was million and the fair market value of our natural gas hedging contracts was million

  interest rate sensitivity 
at december   the company had total debt of million 
of this amount  million bears interest at a fixed rate of 
the remaining outstanding debt balance of million is under our credit agreement and is subject to floating market rates of interest 
borrowings under the credit agreement bear interest at a fluctuating rate that is linked to libor 
we have entered into interest rate swap agreements to hedge the impact of interest rate changes on a portion of our floating rate debt 
as of december   we had interest rate swaps as follows fair market value encore at december  notional swap amount start date end date encore pays receives in thousands in thousands  december  march  libor   november  november  libor   june  june  libor  subsequent to december   the company cash settled the two outstanding million interest rate swaps at a cost of million
