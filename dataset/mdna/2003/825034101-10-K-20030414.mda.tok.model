item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
overview the company derives revenue from hotel room sales at its sumner suites hotels through july  and company owned shoney s inn and guesthouse inns suites hotels 
the company also receives management fees for services it performs for eighteen franchised shoney s inns and guesthouse inns suites hotels 
the company derives additional revenue from franchise fees it receives as the exclusive franchiser of shoney s inns and guesthouse inns suites hotels 
on may   the company became 
table of contents the exclusive franchiser of the guesthouse inns suites brand guesthouse 
guesthouse operates in the mid market limited service segment  with rooms typically priced between and per night 
the properties range in size from to rooms  and in most cases  contain meeting rooms 
they are designed to appeal to both business and leisure travelers 
the company is in the process of converting all shoney s inns to the guesthouse brand 
no additional shoney s inns will be developed or franchised in the future 
the shoney s and guesthouse brands will be discussed as a combined brand due to these factors and due to the fact than many of the shoney s inns both company owned and operated and franchised have already been converted to guesthouse 
the company s hotel operations have historically been seasonal in nature  reflecting higher occupancy rates during spring and summer months  which may be expected to cause fluctuations in the company s quarterly revenues and earnings from hotel operations 
the company s fiscal year ends on the last sunday of the calendar year 
the company s hotel operations have been supplemented by contract revenues from construction and development of hotels and other real estate projects for third parties  including related parties 
revenues from these activities have varied widely from period to period  depending upon whether the company s construction and development activities were primarily focused on its own facilities or on outside projects 
construction revenues are recognized on the percentage of completion basis 
fourth quarter adjustments the company reported a net loss in the fourth quarter of of million 
the losses are primarily the result of write downs of notes and write offs of related accounts receivable due to impaired values of hotels underlying the receivables  losses on the sale and transfer of hotels  and charge offs of construction and development costs on abandoned hotel development projects 
approximately million of the losses are from the write down of notes receivable totaling million secured by first mortgages on hotel properties 
fifteen of the mortgages totaling million are cross collateralized and cross defaulted and mature on july  even though all first mortgage payments on these hotels have been timely received  in late december of the owner notified the company that it is highly unlikely that it will be able to refinance the properties by the notes maturity dates 
consequently  since the company does not desire to extend the maturity dates  the company anticipates that it will be necessary to resume title to the properties 
the owner of the properties agreed in late december of to transfer the hotels back to the company by deeds in lieu of foreclosure 
in anticipation of this  the company began midway through the fourth fiscal quarter to find cash purchasers of the properties in the event the company re acquired ownership 
the company has been greatly disappointed in offers received recently for the fifteen hotels securing the notes receivable 
since the company does not desire to take back ownership and operate the properties  it is likely to sell the properties at values 
table of contents significantly below the balances of the notes receivable and has written down the notes receivable to the estimated net sales prices of the properties 
also  unsecured accounts receivable which related to these properties were deemed to be uncollectible and were written off in the amount of approximately million in the fourth quarter 
separately from the hotels collateralizing notes receivable discussed above  on december   the company sold one and transferred five of its company owned hotels on december   at an after tax charge of approximately million 
the company transferred the five hotels for notes receivable with a maturity of six months 
accordingly  the transaction did not qualify as a sale and the properties will continue to be carried on the company s balance sheet as assets of hotels transferred under contractual agreements notes receivable 
the buyer intends to resell the hotels 
if the buyer is unsuccessful and the hotels ultimately have to be taken back  the company intends to pursue other potential buyers 
the million  net of income tax effect  is reported in discontinued operations as a loss on disposal and transfer of discontinued businesses 
the company constructed two hotels for third parties from which it has been unable to collect the balances due 
one of the contracts receivable is for approximately million and the company received an arbitration award of substantially all of its claim in the fourth quarter to be paid within days of the october  award date 
the owner of the hotel failed to pay the award when due  and on january  filed chapter bankruptcy 
as a result  the company has charged the entire balance off in the fourth quarter 
the other contract receivable is for approximately million  and arbitration proceedings were initiated on january  the owner of the hotel claims damages in excess of the amount owed 
consequently  the company has charged the entire amount off in its fourth quarter 
these two contracts together resulted in a charge off in the fourth quarter of approximately million 
any recovery from these contracts will be recorded as earned when received 
approximately  of other construction contracts receivable was also charged off as uncollectible in the fourth fiscal quarter of the company has incurred development costs related to several sites upon which hotel development for third parties was planned 
in early  the lodging industry anticipated an economic upturn in the second half of the year 
the upturn failed to materialize 
consequently  new hotel development opportunities eroded in late and the development opportunities on all of these sites were lost 
these development costs  which had been previously capitalized  were charged off in the fourth quarter since none of the costs improved the value of the land upon which they were incurred 
the amount of these charge offs in the fourth quarter totaled approximately million

critical accounting policies and practices the company has prepared its financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states  and these statements necessarily include some amounts that are based upon informed judgments and estimates of management 
the company s significant accounting policies are discussed in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
the company s critical accounting policies are subject to judgments and uncertainties which affect the application of such policies 
the company s financial position or results of operations may be materially different when reported under different conditions or when using different assumptions in the application of such policies 
in the event estimates or assumptions prove to be different from reported amounts  adjustments are made in subsequent periods to reflect more current information 
the company s critical accounting policies and practices include impairment of long lived assets  collectibility of accounts and notes receivable  percentage of completion accounting for construction contracts  profit recognition on sale transactions  nonmonetary transactions  and income taxes 
the following is a brief discussion of these more significant accounting policies and practices used by the company 
impairment of long lived assets the company records impairment losses on long lived assets used in operations and finite lived intangibles when indicators of impairment are present and the undiscounted cash flows related to those assets are less than their carrying amounts 
the company records impairment losses on long lived assets under development or held for sale when indications of impairment are present and the estimated fair value less costs to sell is less than the carrying amount 
the company s impairment review process relies on management s judgment regarding the indicators of impairment  the remaining lives of assets used to generate assets undiscounted cash flows  and the fair value of assets at a particular point in time 
under different assumptions or conditions  the asset impairment analysis may yield a different result  which would alter the gain or loss on the eventual disposition of the asset 
collectibility of accounts and notes receivable the company continuously monitors collections from its customers and debtors under notes receivable and maintains allowances for doubtful accounts based upon historical experience and any specific customer collection issues that are identified 
while such credit losses have historically been within the company s expectations  there can be no assurance that the historical experience will continue at the same level in the future 
notes receivable are generally secured by first mortgages on the underlying assets 
the majority of these are from a group of companies that are affiliated with one another  creating a concentration of credit risk 
the company determined in the fourth quarter of that the fair values of the underlying assets were less than the balances of the first mortgage notes and that the notes receivable were under collateralized 
the company  accordingly  recorded a write down of million as previously discussed 

table of contents percentage of completion accounting for construction contracts construction and development revenues earned on fixed price contracts are recognized based upon the percentage of completion method  measured by the percentage of cost incurred to total estimated cost for each contract 
the total estimated cost of each contract involves the use of various estimating techniques to project costs of completion 
these percentage of completion and cost estimates involve various assumptions and projections relative to the outcome of future events  such as price and timing of construction materials  labor costs  and overhead costs 
the company reevaluates its contract cost estimates periodically and reflects changes in estimates in the current and future periods 
profit recognition on sale transactions as prescribed by financial accounting standards board fasb statement no 
 accounting for sales of real estate  profit from the sale of land and hotel properties is recognized at the time the sale is consummated  the minimum down payment is received  and there is no significant continuing involvement 
when the sale involves a leaseback  and otherwise qualifies for sale leaseback accounting  as defined by fasb statement no 
 accounting for leases  the profit is then accounted for in accordance with fasb statements no 
 accounting for leases and no 
 accounting for sales with leasebacks  which generally require deferral and amortization of profits ratably over the related lease terms

 accounting for nonmonetary transactions  fasb statement no 
 business combinations  and emerging issues task force eitf issues no 
 determining whether a nonmonetary transaction involves receipt of productive assets or a business and no 
 interpretations of apb opinion no 
if the hotel received in a nonmonetary exchange of hotels meets the definition of a business  it is accounted for as a purchase at fair value 
if the hotel received does not meet the definition of a business  the guidance of apb no 
 as interpreted by eitf  is followed 
under the general guidelines of apb no 
 an exchange of nonmonetary assets is accounted for at fair value  unless the assets are similar and the other conditions of apb no 
and eitf are met  whereby the transaction is accounted for at historical cost  resulting in no gain recognition 
income taxes the company uses the liability method to account for income taxes 
the preparation of consolidated financial statements involves estimating the company s current tax exposure together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items for tax and accounting purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included within the consolidated balance sheet 
an assessment of the recoverability of the deferred tax assets is made  and a valuation allowance may be established based upon this assessment
