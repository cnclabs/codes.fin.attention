the company s agreement with republic bank provides for the company to receive agency fees from republic bank  though such fees are subject to reduction or offset by the losses from uncollected republic bank loans

table of contents for the year ended june  increase decrease in thousands accounts payable trade accrued salaries and benefits payable to republic bank accrued litigation money transfer payable deferred revenue interest payable interest rate swap restructuring accrual income taxes payable other senior secured notes payable at june  decreased by million from june  due to the company s payment of the fourth annual million installment of principal in november and prepayment of the final million installment of principal in march term advances decreased by a total of million at june   as compared to june   as the result of the company s repayment of those advances 
loan portfolio the company has established a loan loss allowance for its loans receivable which consist of the company s payday loans and its participation interests in outstanding goleta loans at a level that the company s management believes to be adequate to absorb known or probable losses from payday loans made by the company and from the company s participation interests in outstanding goleta loans 
in the first six months of fiscal  the company gradually ceased to offer goleta loans and began to offer state regulated short term loans or deferred deposit transaction services  commonly known as payday loans  at its owned stores 
as of december   goleta loans were no longer offered at any of the company s stores  though the company continued to collect outstanding goleta loans until june  because the company s payday loan product is substantially similar to the goleta loans formerly offered  the company s method for determining its loan loss allowance for both types of loans is the same 
the company s current policy for determining the loan loss allowance is based on historical experience generally as well as the results of management s review and analysis of the payment and collection of the loans within the last fiscal quarter 
the company has determined  based on recent operating history  that it receives payment of approximately for loans maturing in the first  second and fourth fiscal quarters or for loans maturing during tax refund season in the third fiscal quarter of the loan volume  or principal amount of the loans 
therefore  the loan loss allowance is approximately of the principal amount of the loans maturing in the first  second and fourth fiscal quarters and approximately of the principal amount of the loans maturing in the third fiscal quarter 
the company s policy is to charge off all of its payday loans  or participation interests in goleta loans  which are days or more past due or delinquent 
charge offs are applied as a reduction to the loan loss allowance  and any recoveries of previously charged off loans or participation interests in goleta loans are applied as an increase to the loan loss allowance 
at the end of each fiscal quarter  the company s management analyzes the loan loss provision and the allowance that has been computed based on the activity described above to determine if the allowance is adequate based on its understanding of what is occurring in the stores with customers  past loan loss experience  current economic conditions  volume and growth of the loan portfolio  timing of maturity  as well as collections experience 
for this purpose  each renewal of a loan in which no additional principal is advanced is treated as a continuation of the initial loan  and the company includes only its participation interests in the goleta loans instead of the entire amount of the goleta loans 
if necessary  adjustments to the provision and the allowance are made 
an analysis of the loan loss allowance with reference to the company s gross loans receivable which does not include any republic bank loans is as follows 
table of contents year ended june  in thousands gross loans receivable less allowance for losses on loans receivable loans receivable  net of allowance allowance for losses on loans receivable beginning of period provision for loan losses charge offs recoveries end of period net loan charge offs as a percent of volume allowance as a percent of gross loans receivable the reduction in gross loans receivable was primarily the result of the transition during the first half of fiscal from goleta loans to alternative loan products or services  the decrease in the number of stores in which loan products or services were offered  because the company ceased to offer loan products or services in maryland  georgia  north carolina and alabama  and the offering of republic bank loans  rather than the company s own loan product or service  at the company s stores in texas  arkansas  and pennsylvania 
these changes were in turn the result primarily of the company s agreements with the office of the comptroller of the currency and goleta to discontinue offering goleta loans at its stores by december  see cessation of the goleta national bank relationship below 
the schedule below indicates the progression of receipts or collections of each quarterly portfolio of loans consisting of both company payday loans and participation interests in goleta loans 
in this case  a quarterly portfolio is the company s interests in all of the loans that matured in a particular fiscal quarter 
management can track the payment rates at different points of time for each quarterly portfolio 
management has established the following targets regarding each quarterly portfolio receive or collect or in the company s third fiscal quarter of the total volume  or principal amount of loans  by the end of the current quarter ie  by june for the payday loans or participation interests in goleta loans maturing between april and june 
receive or collect a cumulative or in the company s third fiscal quarter by days out ie  by september for the same quarterly portfolio 
receive or collect a cumulative or in the company s third fiscal quarter by days out ie  by december for the same quarterly portfolio 
the company charges off its payday loans or participation interests in goleta loans when they become delinquent for days 
the assumed higher rate of payment in the company s third fiscal quarter is a result of improved collections during the company s tax season  because of borrowers receipt of tax refunds 
collection progression for quarterly loan portfolios collection percentage actual days following quarter target fiscal fiscal fiscal first quarter second quarter third quarter 
table of contents collection progression for quarterly loan portfolios collection percentage actual days following quarter target fiscal fiscal fiscal fourth quarter republic bank loans republic bank loans are not included in the company s loan portfolio or in its loans receivable  because the company serves only as a marketing and servicing agent for republic bank regarding those loans and does not acquire or own any participation interest in any of those loans 
the company s agreement with republic bank provides for the company to receive fees from republic bank  though those fees are subject to reduction or offset by the losses from the republic bank loans that are not collected 
because of the company s economic exposure for losses related to the republic bank loans  the company has established a payable to reflect its anticipated losses related to uncollected republic bank loans that are days or more past due 
though the company has not had any long term experience with republic bank loans  it believes  based on the similarity of those loans to its own payday loans and the goleta loans  that the loss experience with republic bank loans will be similar to the loss experience with those other loans 
accordingly  the payable for amounts due to republic bank for losses regarding republic bank loans has been established at a level similar to the loan loss allowance for the company s other loan products 
as of june   the company provided approximately million for losses on republic bank loans and charged off million related to these loans 
therefore  the balance of the liability for republic bank loan losses reported in accrued liabilities as of june  is million 
cessation of the goleta national bank relationship on october   the company entered into an agreement with the office of the comptroller of the currency the occ  and on november   the company entered into amendment no 
to the master loan agency agreement with goleta  to end the arrangement under which goleta offered goleta loans at the company s stores effective december  accordingly  as of january   goleta loans were no longer offered in any of the company s stores 
as permitted by the two agreements  however  the company continued  through june   to service and collect outstanding goleta loans under the collection servicing agreement between it and goleta 
since january   the company has offered at most of its stores  instead of the goleta loans  other short term loans or deferred deposit transaction services made in accordance with state law and regulations 
that transition has required the company to obtain state licenses in certain states where goleta loans had previously been offered and has prompted the company to enter into the republic bank agreement regarding deferred deposit loans by republic bank offered in the company s stores in arkansas  pennsylvania  and texas 
as of june   the company was offering a state regulated loan product or service in  or approximately  of its owned stores  the company was not offering any loan product or service in any of its stores in alabama  georgia  maryland  and north carolina 
as part of the agreements with the occ and with goleta  the company agreed to indemnify  instead of the previous  of goleta s losses and expenses incurred on or after november  from certain third party claims regarding the goleta loans  including pending lawsuits 
the company s increased level of indemnification of goleta regarding the goleta loans requires and will require it to pay more than it would otherwise have paid to defend or settle and resolve the pending lawsuits  and any other proceedings that may arise  regarding the goleta loans 
in accordance with the agreement with goleta  the company acquired  for nominal amounts  the shares of epacific  that were owned by goleta s corporate parent and the rights to the credit scoring model that goleta used throughout its arrangement with the company to determine eligibility for the goleta loans that were offered at the company s stores

table of contents litigation expenses as indicated in legal proceedings above  the company has been required to defend itself and  in some matters  its directors  officers  and others in various lawsuits and state regulatory proceedings regarding its current and past loan related activities 
the company has incurred significant legal expenses in conducting that defense  and if the proposed settlement in the purdie lawsuit is not finally approved by the court or otherwise implemented  the company may have to incur additional significant legal expenses in defending itself and others  regardless of the company s success in defending or otherwise resolving the various proceedings 
the company is  in accordance with its bylaws  paying the expenses of defense for its directors  officers  and other employees named as additional defendants in these lawsuits 
the company also is  in accordance with the goleta agreement  paying all of the expenses of goleta as a party in these proceedings 
in fiscal  the company s expense of defense  for itself and others  was approximately million 
in light of the pendency of the proposed purdie settlement  and because of the various factors involved in litigation  it is impossible to predict an amount or a range of amounts that the company may have to expend  in fiscal or thereafter  to conduct that defense 
assuming the purdie settlement receives final court approval and is implemented  the company currently estimates that its legal expenses in defending  for itself and others  the various lawsuits will be approximately million during fiscal recently issued accounting pronouncements in december  the financial accounting standards board issued sfas no

critical estimates  uncertainties or assessments in the financial statements the preparation of the company s financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states of america requires the company to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
in applying the accounting principles  management must often make individual estimates and assumptions regarding expected outcomes or uncertainties 
as might be expected  the actual results or outcomes are generally different than the estimated or assumed amounts 
these differences are usually minor and are included in the company s consolidated financial statements as soon as they are known 
estimates  judgments and 
table of contents assumptions are continually evaluated based on available information and experience 
because of the use of estimates inherent in the financial reporting process  actual results could differ from those estimates 
actual results related to the estimates and assumptions made in preparing the company s consolidated financial statements will emerge over periods of time  such as estimates and assumptions underlying the determination of allowance for loan losses and self insurance liabilities 
these estimates and assumptions are monitored and periodically adjusted as circumstances warrant 
for instance  the company s liability for self insurance related to workers compensation  general liability  and medical liability may be adjusted based on higher or lower actual loss experience 
although there is greater risk with respect to the accuracy of these estimates and assumptions because of the period over which actual results may emerge  such risk is mitigated by the ability to make changes to these estimates and assumptions over the same period 
management periodically reviews the carrying value of goodwill and other intangible assets when events and circumstances warrant such a review 
one of the methods used for this review is performed using estimates of future cash flows 
if the carrying value of goodwill or other intangible assets is considered impaired  an impairment charge is recorded for the amount by which the carrying value of the goodwill or intangible assets exceeds its fair value 
the company believes that the estimates of future cash flows and fair value are reasonable 
changes in estimates of such cash flows and fair value  however  could affect the evaluation 
based on an assessment of the company s accounting policies and the underlying judgments and uncertainties affecting the application of those policies  management believes that the company s consolidated financial statements provide a meaningful and fair perspective of the company 
the company does not suggest that other risk factors  such as those discussed elsewhere in this report and the company s other public filings as well as changes in growth objectives  could not adversely impact the consolidated financial position  results of operations and cash flows in future periods 
critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states of america requires the company to make estimates and assumptions in determining the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reported period 
actual results could differ from the company s estimates 
the company believes the most significant estimate made in the preparation of the accompanying consolidated financial statements relates to the determination of its allowance for loan losses 
the next paragraph addresses the company s accounting policy concerning such allowance 
the company maintains an allowance for loan losses and a payable to republic bank at levels it considers sufficient to cover the anticipated losses in the collection of the company s loan portfolio and its liability for republic bank s loan losses 
the allowance for loan losses and payable to republic bank are determined based upon a review of historical and recent loan losses and the loan portfolio  and takes into consideration economic conditions and trends 
the allowance for loan losses and payable to republic bank are periodically reviewed by the company s management with any changes reflected in current operations 
it is at least reasonably possible that actual loan losses may be materially different from the recorded allowance for loan losses or recorded amount payable to republic bank 
operating trends seasonality the company s business is seasonal to the extent of the impact of cashing tax refund checks and tax refund anticipation loan checks 
the impact of these services is in the third and fourth quarters of the company s fiscal year 
the company s loan business declines slightly in the third fiscal quarter as a result of the customers receipt of tax refund checks and tax refund anticipation loans 
impact of inflation management believes the company s results of operations are not dependent upon the levels of inflation

these statements are generally identified by the use of words such as anticipate  expect  estimate  believe  intend  plan  should  would  and terms with similar meanings 
although the

those risks  uncertainties  and other factors could cause the actual results to differ materially from these in the forward looking statements 
those risks  uncertainties  and factors include  but are not limited to ace s relationships with travelers express company  inc and its affiliates  and with ace s bank lenders  with american capital strategies  ltd  and with h r block  ace s relationships with third party providers of products and services offered by ace or property used in ace s operations  federal and state governmental regulation of check cashing  short term consumer lending  and related financial services businesses  the results of litigation regarding short term consumer lending activities  including the possibility that the purdie settlement will not receive final court approval or otherwise be implemented  theft and employee errors  the availability of adequate financing  suitable locations  acquisition opportunities and experienced management employees to implement the ace s growth strategy  increases in interest rates  which would increase ace s borrowing costs  the fragmentation of the check cashing industry and competition from various other sources  such as banks  savings and loans  short term consumer lenders  and other similar financial services entities  as well as retail businesses that offer products and services offered by ace  the terms and performance of third party products and services offered at ace locations  and customer demand and response to products and services offered at ace locations

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company is exposed to financial market risks  particularly including changes in interest rates that might affect the costs of its financing under the former credit agreement and under the credit agreement and the new note purchase agreement  as described in note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
to mitigate the risks of changes in interest rates  the company utilizes derivative financial instruments 
the company does not use derivative financial instruments for speculative or trading purposes 
to reduce its risk of greater interest expense because of interest rate fluctuations  the company has historically entered into interest rate swap agreements  which effectively converted a portion of its floating rate interest obligations to fixed rate interest obligations  as described in note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
the company s last interest rate swap agreement that was effective during the first nine months of fiscal  during the effectiveness of the former bank credit agreement  expired effective december  the terms of the company s new credit agreement and note purchase agreement  however  require the company to enter into one or more interest rate swap agreements to effectively convert to fixed rate obligations the floating rate obligations outstanding under those agreements 
accordingly  on april   the company entered into an interest rate swap agreement with jpmorgan chase bank regarding a notional amount of million  and on june   the company entered into an interest rate swap agreement with national city bank regarding notional amount of million 
both of these swap agreements are scheduled to continue until march  the fair value of the company s existing interest rate swaps was million as of june  based on the average outstanding indebtedness in the previous quarter  a change in interest rates would have changed the company s interest expense by approximately  pre tax for the year ended june  without consideration of the company s interest rate swaps 
the associated underlying debt has exceeded the notional amount for each swap throughout the existence of the swaps  and it is anticipated that it will continue to do so 
the existing swaps are based on the same index as  and repriced on a consistent basis with  their respective underlying debt
