item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and result s of operation overview currently  we develop and market healthcare communication technolog y products 
our technologies are designed to provide connectivity of medica l related information between pocs and hvcis 
our products are designed to improv e the accuracy and the efficiency of the processes of prescribing medications an d the ordering of laboratory tests and the receiving of laboratory results 
our current financial condition is a direct result of the efforts t o develop a commercially viable healthcare connectivity business 
critical accounting policies we have identified the policies below as critical to our busines s operations and the understanding of our results of operations 
the impact an d any associated risks related to these policies on our business operations i s discussed throughout management s discussion and analysis of financial conditio n and results of operations where such policies affect our reported and expecte d financial results 
in the ordinary course of business  we have made a number of estimates an d assumptions relating to the reporting of results of operations and financia l condition in the preparation of our financial statements in conformity wit h accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
actua l results could differ significantly from those estimates under differen t assumptions and conditions 
we believe that the following discussion addresse s our most critical accounting policies  which are those that are most importan t to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations an d require our most difficult  subjective  and complex judgments  often as a resul t of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherentl y uncertain 
revenue recognition our policy is to recognize revenue when the communication transaction ha s been completed by the customer  persuasive evidence of the terms of th e arrangement exist  our fee is fixed and determinable  and collectibility i s reasonably assured 
our plan is that delivery will take place electronicall y when the customer has completed the exchange transmission or receipt of dat a or as monthly service is provided 
revenue will be charged to the customer on a per transaction basis as each transaction is completed or as monthl y subscription services are provided and are billed monthly 
valuation of goodwill in accordance with sfas no 
we no longer amortize goodwill  but rathe r perform an annual assessment as to whether any impairment has occurred 
we als o assess the impairment of goodwill whenever events or changes in circumstance s indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
factors we conside r important that could trigger an impairment review include the following o significant under performance relative to expected historical o r projected future operating results  o significant changes in the manner of our use of the acquired assets o r the strategy for our overall business  o significant negative industry or economic trends  o significant decline in our stock price for a sustained period  and o our market capitalization relative to net book value 
we determine whether the carrying value of goodwill may not be recoverabl e annually and more frequently based upon events and circumstances including th e existence of one or more of the above indicators of impairment 
we determin e whether impairment has occurred by first  comparing the fair value of our onl y reporting unit to the carrying value of the reporting unit 
if the fair value o f the reporting unit is less than the carrying value of the net assets  then th e second step is to initially determine the fair value of the net assets in th e reporting unit exclusive of goodwill  and record any necessary impairment o f assets other than goodwill in accordance with sfas no 
or other applicabl e standards 
the difference in the fair value of the individual net asset s exclusive of goodwill and the reporting unit results in the implied value o f goodwill 
the implied value of goodwill is compared to its carrying value an d the difference is recorded as an impairment charge  if necessary 
we performe d our annual evaluation of goodwill and the fair value of the reporting uni t exceeded its carrying value  therefore  no impairment of goodwill existed 
ne t goodwill amounted to million as of december  software and technology costs we capitalize costs  which primarily include salaries in connection wit h developing software for internal use 
we use judgment in determining whethe r development costs meet the criteria for immediate expense or capitalization direct costs incurred in the development of software are capitalized once th e preliminary project stage is completed  management has committed to funding th e project  and completion and use of the software for its intended purpose ar e probable 
we cease capitalization of development costs once the software ha s been substantially completed and is ready for its intended use 
we capitalize d   and  of costs during the years ended december  and  respectively 
the software development costs capitalize d were amortized over the estimated useful life of the software  which wa s estimated to be five years 
amortization expense was   an d  for the years ended december   and  respectively 
included in software costs are those costs associated with softwar e research and development efforts that have not been capitalized under sop software research and development costs totaled   an d  for the years ended december   and  respectively 
software costs also include the amortization of capitalized software cost s and license fees paid to service providers  which totaled   an d  for the years  ended december   and  respectively 
uncertainties regarding future cash flows did not support the carryin g value of those costs at december  in accordance with sfas no 
 th e company wrote off the remaining  of previously capitalized net cost s during the forth quarter of future performance will be enhanced with th e acquisition of assets formerly used by e physician  the merger of the acquire d technologies with the cymedix technologies and the implementation of the revise d business strategies 
while the company s business model has changed potentially affecting th e company s anticipated near term future operating results  the company believe s its modified plan continues to rely on the same technology that was acquire d from cymedix in accordingly  management does not believe an impairment o f goodwill has occurred and it continues to have a viable long term strategy tha t is supported by its current market capitalization at december   whic h supports the fair value of its only reporting unit 
results of operation comparison of years ended december  and december  at present we are not receiving revenue from the sale of our products 
i n  we recognized  in revenue primarily from the sales of adc hardware a product that we no longer sell 
software and technology costs of  were incurred in  a n increase of  compared to  for the increase i s primarily related to the write off of  of previously capitalized ne t software development costs for which recoverability became uncertain due t o uncertainty in future cash flows 
the increase also reflects additional licens e costs incurred in of  over due to added infrastructure t o support our transaction service capabilities in as we placed a major focu s on deployment of our technologies with pbms during the first three quarters o f amortization of capitalized software development costs increased  while research and development costs decreased by  due to increase d capitalization of costs associated with active projects in selling  general and administrative expenses increased  or fro m  in to  in the increase is primarily attributabl e to  of leasehold abandonment costs incurred in due to the closur e of our california and georgia offices  offset by a reduction in outsid e consulting fees

there were no comparable expenses in interest expense decreased by  due to a decrease in the amount o f debt financing we had outstanding in compared to additionally financing costs decreased in by  as we obtained most of ou r financing through the direct sale of equity securities compared to when shares were issued for conversions and redemptions under the convertibl e notes payable credit facility at modified conversion prices resulting i n financing costs of  shares were issued in private placements i n connection with our note payable credit facility at below market price s resulting in financing costs of  and warrants valued at  were issued in connection with private placements of common stock in connectio n with our note payable credit facility
