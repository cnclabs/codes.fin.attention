item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations statements we make in the following discussion which express a belief  expectation or intention  as well as those that are not historical facts  are forward looking statements that are subject to risks  uncertainties and assumptions 
our actual results  performance or achievements  or industry results  could differ materially from those we express in the following discussion as a result of a variety of factors  including the risks and uncertainties we have referred to under the heading cautionary statement concerning forward looking statements following items and of part i of this report and under the heading factors that may affect our future operating results below 
overview we derive substantially all our revenues from the sale of ready mixed concrete  other concrete products and related construction materials to the construction industry in the united states 
we serve substantially all segments of the construction industry  and our customers include contractors for commercial  industrial  residential and public works and infrastructure construction 
we typically sell ready mixed concrete under daily purchase orders that require us to formulate  prepare and deliver ready mixed concrete to the job sites of our customers 
we recognize our sales from these orders when we deliver the ordered products 
our cost of goods sold consists principally of the costs we incur in obtaining the cement  aggregates and admixtures we combine to produce ready mixed concrete and other concrete products in various formulations 
we obtain most of these materials from third parties and generally have only one day s supply at each of our concrete plants 
our cost of goods sold also includes labor costs and the operating  maintenance and rental expenses we incur in operating our concrete plants and mixer trucks and other vehicles 
our selling expenses include the salary and incentive compensation we pay our sales force  the salaries and incentive compensation of our sales managers and travel  entertainment and other promotional expenses 
our general and administrative expenses include the salaries and benefits we pay to our executive officers  the senior managers of our local and regional operations and administrative staff 
these expenses also include office rent and utilities  communications expenses and professional fees 
we purchased one business in  seven businesses in  six businesses in and businesses in  all of which we have accounted for in accordance with the purchase method of accounting 
factors that may affect our future operating results reflecting the levels of construction activity  the demand for ready mixed concrete is highly seasonal 
results of any individual quarter are not necessarily indicative of results to be expected for the year due principally to the effects that seasonal changes and other weather related conditions can have on construction activity  as a result  on our sales and earnings 
normally  we attain the highest sales and earnings in the second and third quarters and the lowest sales and earnings in the first quarter 
you should not rely on quarterly comparisons of our revenues and operating results as indicators of our future performance or the results of any quarterly period during a year as an indicator of results you may expect for that entire year 
demand for ready mixed concrete and other concrete products depends on the level of activity in the construction industry 
that industry is cyclical in nature  and the general condition of the economy and a variety of other factors beyond our control affect its level of activity 
these factors include  among others 
the availability of funds for public or infrastructure construction  
commercial and residential vacancy levels  
changes in interest rates  
sustained adverse weather conditions  
the availability of short and long term financing  
inflation  
consumer spending habits  and 
employment levels 
the construction industry can exhibit substantial variations in activity across the country as a result of these factors impacting regional and local economies differently 
markets for ready mixed concrete generally are local 
our results of operations are susceptible to swings in the level of construction activity that may occur in our markets 
ready mixed concrete is highly price sensitive 
our prices are subject to changes in response to relatively minor fluctuations in supply and demand  general economic conditions and market conditions  all of which are beyond our control 
because of the fixed cost nature of our business  our overall profitability is sensitive to minor variations in sales volumes and small shifts in the balance between supply and demand 
competitive conditions in our industry also may affect our future operating results 
as we acquire additional businesses in the future  we will include the operating results of those businesses in our consolidated operating results from their respective acquisition dates 
consequently  the magnitude and timing of our future acquisitions will affect our operating results 
we may incur material costs and losses as a result of claims that our products do not meet regulatory requirements or contractual specifications 
we are subject to federal  state and local environmental laws and regulations concerning  among other matters  air emissions and wastewater discharge 
our management believes we are in substantial compliance with applicable environmental laws and regulations 
from time to time  we receive claims from federal and state environmental regulatory agencies and entities asserting that we may be in violation of environmental laws and regulations 
on the basis of our experience and the information currently available  our management believes these claims will not have a material impact on our consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
despite compliance and experience  it is possible that we could be held liable for future charges that might be material  but are not currently known or estimable 
in addition  changes in federal or state laws  regulations or requirements or discovery of currently unknown conditions could require additional expenditures 
we reserved  for remediation costs in connection with the aggregates business we acquired in we currently do not expect the costs of that remediation to exceed that amount 
results of operations the following table sets forth selected historical statement of operations information and that information as a percentage of sales for the years indicated 
except as noted below  our acquisitions in and primarily account for the changes in from  and our acquisitions in primarily account for the changes in from year ended december dollars in thousands sales    cost of goods sold    gross profit    selling  general and administrative expenses    special compensation charge  restructuring and impairments  depreciation  depletion and amortization    income from operations    interest expense  net    other income  net   income loss before income tax provision    income tax provision   income loss before cumulative effect of accounting change    cumulative effect of accounting change  net income loss    compared to sales 
sales increased million  or  from million in to million in the increase is attributable to a full year of revenues associated with businesses we acquired in and revenues of million associated with the aggregates business we acquired in the first quarter of and a modest average ready mixed concrete price increase 
partially offsetting these increases was a decrease in volumes of ready mixed concrete we sold

selling  general and administrative expenses increased million  or  from million in to million in in  charges totaling million relating to the settlement of litigation with del webb california corp 
and its parent company  del webb corporation  increased our selling  general and administrative expenses 
if these litigation charges were removed from expenses  selling  general and administrative expenses for would have increased million from the increase in selling  general and administrative expenses was attributable to the inclusion of a full year of costs associated with businesses we acquired in and selling expenses incurred by the aggregate business we acquired in the first quarter of  increased communication costs in some of our markets  increased professional fees  higher sales compensation costs  higher advertising and travel costs and higher incentive compensation expense 
special compensation charge

 goodwill and other intangible assets  related to two reporting units in our north texas southwest oklahoma and memphis  tennessee northern mississippi markets 
we also recorded charges totaling million related to severance for one employee  lease terminations  other exit costs and asset impairments that were primarily associated with the realignment of our business in the north texas market 
for additional information  see note to our consolidated financial statements in item of this report 
depreciation  depletion and amortization 
depreciation  depletion and amortization expense decreased million  or  from million in to million in in  goodwill was not amortized due to the adoption of sfas no 
if goodwill amortization was removed from expenses  depreciation  depletion and amortization expense for would have increased by million  as a result of fewer additions to property and equipment under operating leases and additional depreciation of property  plant and equipment associated with businesses we acquired in and  as well as depletion of mineral deposits in the aggregates business we acquired in interest expense  net 
interest expense  net  decreased million  or  from million in to million in this decrease was attributable to a lower average interest rate  partially offset by a higher average balance  under our secured revolving credit facility during as of december   we had borrowings totaling million outstanding under our credit facility at a weighted average interest cost of per annum

income tax provision 
we provided for income taxes of million in  a decrease of million from our provision in the decrease in income taxes is principally the result of lower taxable income generated by our operations during the effective tax rate was for and for the change in this rate was due to the operating loss  nondeductible items relating to goodwill impairments see restructuring and impairments above for discussion and state income taxes 
for additional information  see note to our consolidated financial statements in item of this report 
cumulative effect of accounting change 
the net loss includes a cumulative effect of accounting change  net of tax  as a result of our adoption of sfas no 
under sfas no 
 we recorded a transitional goodwill impairment charge of million  net of tax  effective january  this impairment charge was attributable to two reporting units  our divisions in north texas southwest oklahoma and memphis  tennessee northern mississippi 
local market and economic conditions have affected the value of acquisitions made in north texas in and and memphis  tennessee northern mississippi in 
for additional information  see note to our consolidated financial statements in item of this report 
compared to sales 
sales increased million  or  from million in to million in the increase was primarily attributable to revenues associated with companies we acquired since and a average ready mixed concrete price increase 
partially offsetting these increases was a decrease in volumes of ready mixed concrete 
gross profit 
gross profit increased million  or  from million in to million in gross margins decreased from in to in  primarily because of decreases in sales volume in several of our primary markets resulting principally from a slowdown in construction activity attributable to general and local economic conditions and weather conditions in some of our markets 
selling  general and administrative expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased million  or  from million in to million in the increase in selling  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales is primarily attributable to management additions in some of our markets and a pretax charge of million we recorded in the third quarter of to settle the del webb litigation and a million pretax charge in the second quarter of to reserve a portion of our accounts receivable related to the del webb project 
final effectiveness and payment of the settlement occurred in december special charge 
in  we granted additional compensation to members of our management team and some of our key employees in recognition of the overall contribution made by those employees to our various capital raising initiatives 
this special award was in addition to our recurring annual incentive compensation program 
for additional information  see note to our consolidated financial statements in item of this report 
depreciation and amortization 
depreciation and amortization expense increased million  or  from million in to million in this increase includes amortization of the goodwill attributable to our acquisition activity 
at december   the annualized amount of this noncash expense was million 
interest expense  net 
interest expense  net  increased million  or  from million in to million in this increase was attributable to borrowings we made to pay the cash portion of the purchase prices for our acquisitions and the issuance of million of senior subordinated notes in november at december   we had outstanding borrowings totaling million  at a weighted average interest cost of per annum 
based on this weighted average interest rate  the impact of the senior subordinated notes on interest expense is an increase of million  or per share  on an annualized after tax basis 
other income  net 
other income  net  decreased million  or  from million in to million in this decrease is attributable to gains realized in on the sale of a customer contract  a gain from the involuntary conversion of property and other items of income that were not replicated in income tax provision 
we provided for income taxes of million in  a decrease of million from our provision in the decrease in income taxes is principally the result of lower taxable income our operations generated during additionally  the effective tax rate increased from to due to the effect of the non deductible portion of our goodwill amortization on our lower taxable income 
for additional information  see note to our consolidated financial statements in item of this report 
liquidity and capital resources the following key financial measurements reflect our financial position and capital resources at december   and dollars in thousands cash and cash equivalents   working capital    total debt    debt as a percent of capital employed in  we decreased our debt by million  after including the impact associated with million cash consideration funded by our secured credit facility at the beginning of the year 
that reduction in debt was a result of our strong cash flows from operating activities  which generated million  a primary source of our liquidity during the past two years 
cash flow cash provided by operations was million in  as compared to million in  and million in these cash flows were primarily derived from net income loss before deduction of certain noncash charges for depreciation  depletion  amortization and impairments of properties and goodwill 
depreciation  depletion  amortization and impairments for the years ended december   and were as follows in thousands depreciation  depletion and amortization    impairments  impairments cumulative effect of accounting change  total    changes in working capital for included decreases in accounts receivable and accounts payable and increases in inventory levels from lower sales volume  particularly in the fourth quarter  as compared with the prior year period 
the working capital changes included increases in accounts payable and a reduction in receivables from cash management improvements  which were partially offset by increases in other current assets 
other assets and liabilities  net  include changes to both current and noncurrent balance sheet accounts 
net cash used for investing activities was million in  a decrease of million from million in of that amount  we used  net of cash acquired  million for the purchase of one business  compared with million in used for the purchase of seven businesses  and million in used for the purchase of six businesses 
additions to property  plant and equipment  excluding effects of acquisitions  were million in  compared with million and million in and  respectively 
the increase for in those capital expenditures was attributable primarily to fewer additions to property and equipment under operating leases  a full year of expenditures associated with businesses we acquired in and expenditures in the aggregates business we acquired in the first quarter of we expect our expenditures for property  plant and equipment  exclusive of acquisitions and property and equipment acquired under operating leases  to be approximately million and depreciation  depletion and amortization to be approximately million 
we used approximately million of cash for financing activities during  compared with million and million of cash provided by financing activities in and  respectively 
we repaid net indebtedness of million in  compared with incurrences of net indebtedness of million and million in and  respectively 
we paid debt issue costs of million  million and million in  and  respectively 
in  we issued stock to employees  providing million in cash 
cash provided by issuance of common stock  net  was million and million in and  respectively 
capital resources on august   we amended and restated our secured revolving credit facility 
the terms of the facility are substantially unchanged  except that we extended the maturity of the facility from may to may and reduced the size of the facility from million to million 
on june   the size of the facility increased to million with the addition of a new lender 
we had approximately million of outstanding borrowings under our credit facility at december  our borrowing capacity under the facility varies from time to time depending on our satisfaction of several financial tests 
we may use the facility for the following purposes 
financing acquisitions and internal expansion of our operations  
working capital  and 
general corporate purposes 
our subsidiaries have fully and unconditionally guaranteed the repayment of all amounts owing under the facility  and we collateralized the facility with the capital stock and assets of our subsidiaries on a joint and several basis 
the facility 
requires the consent of the lenders for acquisitions  
prohibits the payment of cash dividends on our common stock  
limits our ability to incur additional indebtedness  and 
requires us to comply with financial covenants 
our failure to comply with these covenants and restrictions would constitute an event of default under the facility 
at december   we were in compliance with these covenants 
based on our expected results for the first quarter of and the severe weather in that period  we may not remain in compliance in the first half of we are currently seeking to avoid any potential covenant violations through an amendment of our secured revolving credit facility as well as a similar amendment under the documents relating to our senior subordinated notes 
we expect to finalize these amendments prior to the occurrence of any potential covenant violation 
our availability under the facility is tied to various affirmative and negative financial covenants  including leverage ratios  an asset coverage ratio  a minimum net worth calculation  a limitation on additional indebtedness  lender consent for acquisitions and a prohibition of cash dividends on our common stock 
at december   we had approximately million of remaining capacity under this facility  of which we could borrow approximately million based on our leverage ratio at that date 
our ability to borrow additional amounts would increase to the extent that we use the facility to fund the acquisition of additional businesses with positive cash flow 
on november   we issued and sold to institutional investors in a private placement million aggregate principal amount of our senior subordinated notes due november  these notes 
are mandatorily repayable in equal annual installments of approximately million on november in each of the years through  
are subordinated in right of payment to the indebtedness outstanding under the credit facility  
are guaranteed by our subsidiaries  and 
require us to comply with covenants generally consistent with those required under the credit facility 
we used the net proceeds from our sale of the notes to reduce amounts outstanding under our credit facility 
our management believes  on the basis of current expectations  that our internally generated cash flow and access to existing credit facilities are sufficient to meet the liquidity requirements necessary to fund our operations  capital requirements and debt service payments for at least the next months 
however  our ability to maintain existing credit facilities can be impacted by economic conditions outside of our control 
the continuation of our growth strategy will require substantial capital 
we currently intend to finance future acquisitions through issuances of our equity or debt securities  including convertible securities  and borrowings under our credit facility 
using debt to complete acquisitions could substantially limit our operational and financial flexibility 
the extent to which we will be able or willing to use our common stock to make acquisitions will depend on its market value from time to time and the willingness of potential sellers to accept it as full or partial payment 
if we are unable to obtain additional capital on acceptable terms  we may be unable to grow through significant acquisitions 
we cannot accurately predict the timing  size and success of our acquisition efforts or our associated potential capital commitments 
other commitments as is common in our industry  we have entered into off balance sheet arrangements in the ordinary course of business that result in risks our balance sheet does not directly reflect 
our significant off balance sheet transactions are liabilities associated with noncancellable operating leases and letter of credit obligations 
we enter into noncancellable operating leases for many of our facility  vehicle and equipment needs 
these leases allow us to conserve up front cash requirements by paying a monthly lease rental fee for use of the facilities  vehicles and equipment rather than purchasing them 
at the end of the lease  we have no further obligation to the lessor 
we may decide to cancel or terminate a lease before the end of its term  in which event we typically would be liable to the lessor for the remaining lease payments under the term of the lease 
our long term commitments for debt and minimum lease commitments for all noncancellable operating leases as of december  are as follows in thousands operating debt lease obligations obligations total thereafter    total    we did not have any letters of credit outstanding under our facility at december  in march  we issued a  letter of credit to a municipality in new jersey in connection with our obligation to perform reclamation services on the closure of an aggregates quarry operation that we purchased in january we have accrued the estimated cost of reclamation over the life of the mineral deposits based on the number of tons mined in relation to total estimated tons of reserves 
we currently estimate this life to be approximately years 
in the normal course of business  we are currently contingently liable for performance under million in performance bonds that various states and municipalities have required 
the bonds are principally related to construction contracts  reclamation obligations and mining permits 
three of these bonds totaling million  or of all outstanding performance bonds  relate to specific performance for airport construction projects 
we have indemnified the underwriting insurance company against any exposure under the performance bonds 
in our past experience  no material claims have been made against these bonds 
in connection with one business we acquired in  we entered into a contingent consideration arrangement with former owners of that business 
at december   we estimated no contingent consideration would be payable 
we currently estimate the contingent consideration will consist of common stock valued at  and  in cash 
any contingent consideration  when accrued  will increase the amount of goodwill related to that acquisition 
in january  we entered into an underwriting agreement that allows us to issue up to million shares of our common stock through an underwriter over a two year period 
if we do not use this arrangement to raise an aggregate of million or more  we will be required to pay the underwriter up to  in stand by fees 
the stand by fees will be equal to of the difference between the million and the amount raised under this arrangement 
at our option  we may pay the stand by fees in cash or in shares of our common stock 
related party transactions we enter into transactions in the normal course of business with related parties 
these transactions consist principally of operating leases under which we lease facilities from former owners of our acquired businesses or their affiliates and include transactions with some of our officers and directors or their affiliates 
see note to our consolidated financial statements in item of this report for a description of those transactions 
critical accounting policies we have identified our critical accounting policies based on the significance of the accounting policy to our overall financial statement presentation  as well as the complexity of the accounting policy and its use of estimates and subjective assessments 
we have concluded that our critical accounting policies are the use of estimates in the recording of allowances for doubtful accounts  realization of goodwill  accruals for self insurance  accruals for income tax provision and the valuation and useful lives of property  plant and equipment 
see note to our consolidated financial statements in item of this report for a summary of our accounting policies  including the policies we discuss below 
allowance for doubtful accounts we provide an allowance for accounts receivable we believe we may not collect in full 
a provision for bad debt expense recorded to selling  general and administrative expenses increases the allowance 
accounts receivable that we write off our books decrease the allowance 
we determine the amount of bad debt expense we record each period and the resulting adequacy of the allowance at the end of each period by using a combination of our historical loss experience  customer by customer analyses of our accounts receivable balances each period and subjective assessments of our bad debt exposure 
goodwill effective january   we adopted sfas no 
as result and from that date  we no longer amortize goodwill 
our goodwill amortization was million in at december   our total assets included million of goodwill 
sfas no 
requires us to compare the fair value of the reporting unit to its carrying amount on an annual basis to determine if there is a potential impairment 
if that fair value is less than its carrying value  we would record an impairment loss to the extent of that difference 
we base the fair values of our reporting units on a combination of valuation approaches  including discounted cash flows  multiples of sales and earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation  depletion and amortization and comparisons of recent transactions 
the impairment tests we conducted in resulted in reductions of the carrying value of goodwill for the divisions in north texas southwest oklahoma and memphis  tennessee northern mississippi 
we reported the goodwill reductions as a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle effective january   which resulted in a transitional charge to earnings  net of tax  of million and an impairment charge to income from operations of million in the fourth quarter of  after we conducted an annual valuation test and determined that our divisions in north texas southwest oklahoma and memphis  tennessee northern mississippi had experienced a further decline in value 
insurance programs we maintain third party insurance coverage in amounts and against the risks we believe are reasonable 
under our insurance program  we share the risk of loss with our insurance underwriters by maintaining high deductibles subject to aggregate annual loss limitations 
we fund these deductibles and record an expense for losses we expect under the programs 
we determine the expected losses using a combination of our historical loss experience and subjective assessments of our future loss exposure 
the estimated losses are subject to uncertainty from various sources  including insurance programs we maintain third party insurance coverage in amounts and against the risks we believe are reasonable 
under our insurance program  we share the risk of loss with our insurance underwriters by maintaining high deductibles subject to aggregate annual loss limitations 
we fund these deductibles and record an expense for losses we expect under the programs 
we determine the expected losses using a combination of our historical loss experience and subjective assessments of our future loss exposure 
the estimated losses are subject to uncertainty from various sources  including changes in claims reporting patterns  claims settlement patterns  judicial decisions  legislation and economic conditions 
although we believe that the estimated losses are reasonable  significant differences related to the items noted above could materially affect our insurance obligations and future expense 
income taxes we use the liability method of accounting for income taxes 
under this method  we record deferred income taxes based on temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax basis of assets and liabilities and use enacted tax rates and laws that we expect will be in effect when we recover those assets or settle those liabilities  as the case may be  to measure those taxes 
property  plant and equipment  net we state our property  plant and equipment at cost and use the straight line method to compute depreciation of these assets over the following estimated useful lives buildings and land improvements  from to years  machinery and equipment  from to years  mixers  trucks and other vehicles  from to years  and furniture and fixtures  from to years 
we evaluate the recoverability of our property  equipment and intangible assets in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
we compare the carrying value of long lived assets to our projection of future undiscounted cash flows attributable to those assets 
if the carrying value of the asset exceeds the future undiscounted cash flows  we record an impairment loss equal to the excess of the carrying value over the fair value 
actual useful lives and future cash flows could be different from those estimated by our management 
these differences could have a material effect on our future operating results 
in  we recorded impairment charges totaling million for equipment that was removed from service or held for disposal 
we have included this charge as a component of the restructuring and impairment charges in our consolidated statements of operations 
see note of our consolidated financial statements in item of this report 
in  there were no material changes to or in the application of our critical accounting policies presented in the k  except for the provisions in sfas no 
related to goodwill

fin will require identification of our participation in variable interests entities vies  which are defined as entities with a level of invested equity that is not sufficient to fund future activities to permit them to operate on a stand alone basis  or whose equity holders lack certain characteristics of a controlling financial interest 
for entities identified as vies  fin sets forth a model to evaluate potential consolidation based on an assessment of which party to the vie  if any  bears a majority of the exposure to its expected losses  or stands to gain from a majority of its expected returns 
fin also sets forth certain disclosures regarding interests in vie that are deemed significant  even if consolidation is not required 
as we do not maintain any vie  the adoption of fin will not have a material impact on our consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
inflation as a result of the relatively low levels of inflation during the past three years  inflation did not significantly affect our results of operations in any of those years 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we do not enter into derivatives or other financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes 
because of the short duration of our investments  changes in market interest rates would not have a significant impact on their aggregate fair value 
borrowings under our million revolving credit facility expose us to certain market risks 
interest on amounts drawn under the revolving credit facility varies based on either the prime rate or one  two  three or six month eurodollar rates 
based on the million outstanding balance as of december   a one percent change in the applicable rate would change the amount of interest paid by million for our operations are subject to factors affecting the level of general construction activity  including the level of interest rates and availability of funds for construction 
a significant decrease in the level of general construction activity in any of our market areas may have a material adverse effect on our sales and earnings
