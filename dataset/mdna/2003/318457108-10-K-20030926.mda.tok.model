critical accounting policies valuation of foreclosed real estate held for sale 
foreclosed real estate held for sale is recorded at the lower of cost or fair value less estimated costs to sell  and is evaluated for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate such an evaluation is warranted 
cost is the carrying 
table of contents amount of the receivable at the time of foreclosure net of any allowances 
valuation of foreclosed real estate held for sale is considered a critical accounting estimate because the evaluation of impairment and the determination of fair values involve a number of management assumptions relating to future economic events that could materially affect the determination of the ultimate value  and therefore  the carrying amounts of the company s real estate 
the company periodically reviews its portfolio of foreclosed real estate held for sale using current information including i independent appraisals  ii general economic factors affecting the area where the property is located  iii recent sales activity and asking prices for comparable properties and iv costs to sell and or develop that would serve to lower the expected proceeds from the disposal of the real estate 
gains losses realized on liquidation are recorded directly to operations

 accounting for income taxes  whereby deferred income tax assets and liabilities result from temporary differences 
temporary differences are differences between the tax basis of assets and liabilities and operating loss and tax credit carryforwards and their reported amounts in the consolidated financial statements that will result in taxable or deductible amounts in future years 
at june   the company s gross deferred tax asset was approximately million and the company had net operating loss carryforwards for federal income tax purposes of approximately million 
valuation of the deferred tax asset is considered a critical accounting estimate because the determination of the company s ability to utilize the asset involves a number of management assumptions relating to future operations and acquisition transactions that could materially affect the determination of the ultimate value  and therefore  the carrying amount of the company s deferred tax asset 
based on current business activity and the current status of business acquisitions  management believes it is more likely than not that the company will not realize the benefits of the loss carryforwards 
therefore  a full valuation allowance has been established 
in the event the company expands its business operations through an acquisition  the ability to use the loss carryforwards may change
