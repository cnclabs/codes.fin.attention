all forward looking statements included in this document are based on information available to us on the date hereof  and we assume no obligation to update any such forward looking statements 
our actual results could differ materially from those discussed 
factors that could cause or contribute to such differences include  but are not limited to  those discussed below under the heading business risks  as well as those discussed elsewhere in this report 
overview we are a leading supplier of flash memory semiconductor devices for the digital consumer  networking  wireless communication and internet computing markets 
the semiconductor industry has historically been cyclical  characterized by periodic changes in business conditions caused by product supply and demand imbalance 
when the industry experiences downturns  they often occur in connection with  or in anticipation of  maturing product cycles and declines in general economic conditions 
these downturns are characterized by weak product demand  excessive inventory and accelerated declines of selling prices 
in some cases  downturns  such as the one we have experienced since late  have lasted for more than a year 
our business could be further harmed by industry wide prolonged downturns in the future 
our product sales are made primarily using short term cancelable purchase orders 
the quantities actually purchased by the customer  as well as shipment schedules are frequently revised to reflect changes in the customer s needs and in our supply of product 
accordingly  our backlog of open purchase orders at any given time is not a meaningful indicator of future sales 
changes in the amount of our backlog do not necessarily reflect a corresponding change in the level of actual or potential sales 
we derived  and of our net product revenues during  and  respectively  from product shipments to asia 
additionally  substantially all of our wafer suppliers and packaging and testing subcontractors are located in asia 
our top ten end customers  which excludes transactions through stocking representatives and distributors  accounted for  and of our net product revenues in  and  respectively 
no single end customer  which we define as original equipment manufacturers  or oems  original design manufacturers  or odms  contract electronic manufacturers  or cems  or end users  represented or more of our net product revenues during  and since march  we have been increasing our out sourcing activities for our customer service logistics to support our customers 
currently silicon professional technology ltd  or spt  supports our customers in taiwan  china and other southeast asia countries 
spt provides planning  warehousing  delivery  billing  collection and other logistic functions for us in these regions 
spt is a wholly owned subsidiary of one of our stocking representatives in taiwan  professional computer technology limited  or pct 
please see a description of our relationship with pct under item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations related party transactions 
products shipped to spt are accounted for as consigned inventory  and revenue is recognized when the products have been delivered and are considered as a sale to our end customers by spt 
for the years ended december  and  spt serviced end customer sales accounting for and of our net product revenues recognized 
we ship products to  and have accounts receivable from  oems  odms  cems  stocking representatives  distributors  and our logistics center 
our stocking representatives  distributors and logistics center reship our products to our end customers  including oems  odms  cems and end users 
no stocking representative or distributor serviced more than of our end customer sales in  or as of december   spt  our logistics center  represented of our accounts receivable and actron technology co  a stocking representative  represented of our accounts receivable 
as of december   spt represented of our accounts receivable 
results of operations years ended december   and net revenues net revenues were million in compared to million in and million in net revenues for decreased compared to primarily due to decreased average selling prices for our products  partially offset by increased unit shipments 
net revenues decreased from to due to decreased unit shipments of our products and due to decreased average selling prices 
average selling prices fluctuate due to a number of factors including the overall supply and demand for our products in the marketplace  maturing product cycles and changes in general economic conditions 
product revenues 
product revenues were million in  million in and million in product revenues for decreased compared to primarily due to decreased average selling prices by approximately  partially offset by increased unit shipments of our products by approximately 
the decrease from to was primarily due to decreased unit shipments of our products by approximately and decreased average selling prices for our products of approximately 
shipping volumes fluctuate due to overall industry supply and demand 
license revenues 
revenues from license fees and royalties were million in  million in and million in on october   we announced a settlement in our lawsuit with winbond electronics of taiwan 
during and  winbond paid us million and million  respectively  under a settlement agreement 
no further back royalty payments are required after under this legal settlement 
although the settlement payments have ceased  winbond continues to pay royalties 
the decrease from to was primarily due to the termination of license fees received as part of our legal settlement with winbond during  offset by increases in upfront license fees and royalty payments received from our licensees during the increase from to was primarily due to license fees received from winbond as part of a legal settlement totaling million in we anticipate that license revenues may fluctuate significantly in the future 
gross profit gross profit was million  or gross margin of of net revenues  in  million  or of net revenues  in  and million  or of net revenues  in the increase in gross profit in when compared to is due primarily to a million inventory valuation adjustment recorded in gross profit in was reduced by decreases in average selling prices by approximately and decreases in license revenues by million 
gross profit decreased from to primarily due to inventory valuation adjustments of million recorded in  decreases in unit shipments by approximately  decreases in average selling prices by approximately and increases in anticipated warranty costs 
in  we recorded inventory valuation adjustments of million 
in  we wrote down million of inventory related to lower of cost or market and products that we determined to be excess or obsolete 
product gross margin was in  compared to in and in the increase in product gross margin from to relates to a million inventory valuation adjustment recorded in gross margin in was reduced by decreased average selling prices of our products by approximately 
the decrease in product gross margin from to was primarily due to decreased average selling prices of our products by approximately and a million inventory valuation adjustment recorded in for other factors affecting our gross profit  please also see business risks we incurred significant inventory valuation adjustments in and and we may incur additional significant inventory valuation adjustments in the future 
operating expenses operating expenses consist of research and development  sales and marketing  general and administrative and other expenses 
operating expenses were million  or of net revenues  in  as compared to million or of net revenues  in  and million  or of net revenues  in the decrease from was primarily due to decreases of million in wafer and mask expenses  million in non production engineering material expenses and million in commissions expenses 
the increase from to was due to hiring additional personnel  development of new products  improvements in our infrastructure  an increase in our bad debt expense  and an increase in our legal expenses in connection with the atmel litigation  offset by the lack of profit sharing expenses 
we anticipate that we will continue to devote substantial resources to research and development  sales and marketing and to general and administrative activities  and that these expenses may increase in dollars 
research and development 
research and development expenses include costs associated with the development of new products  enhancements to existing products  quality assurance activities and occupancy costs 
these costs consist primarily of employee salaries and benefits and the cost of materials such as wafers and masks 
research and development expenses were million  or of net revenues  in  as compared to million  or of net revenues  in  and million  or of net revenues  in research and development expenses decreased from to by approximately primarily due to decreases in wafer and mask expenses of approximately million  non production engineering material expenses of approximately million and outside service expenses of approximately  offset by increased headcount and related costs of approximately million 
the increase in research and development expenses from to by approximately was primarily due to increases in headcount and related costs of approximately million  non production engineering material expenses of approximately million  depreciation related to purchases of new engineering equipment of million  design costs of approximately million and increased expenses related to engineering and mask costs of approximately  offset by a decrease in profit sharing expenses of approximately million 
we expect research and development expenses may increase in dollars 
sales and marketing 
sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of commissions  headcount and related costs  as well as travel  entertainment and promotional expenses 
sales and marketing expenses were million  or of net revenues  in  as compared to million  or of net revenues  in  and million  or of net revenues  in the decrease in sales and marketing expenses from to by approximately was primarily due to decreased commissions expenses for the current year of approximately million primarily due to decreased product revenues and decreased marketing expenses of approximately  offset by increased headcount and related costs of approximately million  including a  expense recorded for a bonus to our senior vice president of sales and marketing 
the decrease in sales and marketing expenses from to by approximately was primarily due to decreases in commissions of approximately million and profit sharing expenses of approximately million  offset by increases in headcount related costs of approximately million and patent costs of approximately  we expect sales and marketing expenses may increase in dollars as we continue to expand our sales and marketing efforts 
in addition  fluctuations in revenues will cause fluctuations in sales and marketing expenses as it impacts our commissions expenses 
general and administrative 
general and administrative expenses consist of salaries and related costs for administrative  executive and finance personnel  recruiting costs  professional services and legal fees and allowances for doubtful accounts 
general and administrative expenses were million  or of net revenues  in  as compared to million  or of net revenues  in  and million  or of net revenues  in the decrease in general and administrative expenses from to by approximately was primarily due to decreased professional service expenses of approximately million and decreased bank fees of approximately  offset by increased bad debt expenses of approximately  general and administrative expenses increased from to by approximately primarily due to increases in expenses related to bad debt expenses of approximately million  headcount and related costs of approximately million  and depreciation and amortization of approximately  offset by a decrease in profit sharing expenses of approximately million 
we anticipate that general and administrative expenses may increase in dollars as we scale our facilities  infrastructure  and headcount to support our overall expected growth 
we may also incur additional expenses in connection with the atmel litigation 
for further information on this litigation see legal proceedings 
other operating expenses 
there was no other operating expenses recorded in in  other operating expenses of million  or of net revenues  was comprised of  related to an expense for impairment of intangible assets and a  period charge related to an operating lease for an abandoned building 
this charge represents the estimated difference between the total non discounted future sublease income and our non discounted lease commitments relating to this building 
the charge is an estimate and may be adjusted if we obtain a sublease for the building and the actual sublease income is significantly different from the estimate 
we may be unable to secure subtenants for such space due to the recent decrease in demand for commercial rental space in silicon valley 
if we are not successful in subleasing our unused office space  we may be required to take an additional period charge for the balance of the future lease cost 
a charge of million  or of net revenues  in  relates to the expense for in process research and development incurred during the acquisition of agate semiconductor inc refer also to note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
the fair value of agate s patents  workforce  and the technology then under development was determined by an independent appraiser using the income approach for the patents and technology and the cost approach for the workforce 
the income approach discounts expected future cash flows to present value 
the discount rates used in the present value calculations were derived from a weighted average cost of capital analysis  adjusted upward by a premium of to reflect additional risks inherent in the development life cycle 
we believe that the pricing model relating to this acquisition is consistent within the high technology industry 
we do not expect to achieve a material amount of the expense reductions or synergies as a result of integrating the acquired in process technology 
therefore  the valuation assumptions do not include anticipated cost savings 
in process research and development valued at million consisted of a single project to develop a high density flash memory device targeted for high density  mass data storage applications 
at the time of the acquisition the estimated cost to complete the project was to million and the design of this device was approximately complete 
the risk adjusted discount rate relating to in process technology was determined by the independent appraiser to be 
as of december   the design of this device was completed 
we expected the project to be completed and to begin to generate cash flows within to months from the date of the acquisition 
however  development of this flash memory device and its viability remained a significant risk due to the remaining effort to achieve technical viability  rapidly changing customer markets  uncertain standards for new products and significant competitive threats from numerous companies 
failure to bring this device to market in a timely manner could result in a lost opportunity to capitalize on emerging markets 
failure to achieve the expected levels of revenues and net income from this flash memory device may negatively impact the return on the investment expected at the time of the acquisition and potentially result in impairment of other assets related to the development activities 
during the quarter ended december   due to the delays in completing this first flash memory device using the agate technology  we recorded an expense for impairment of intangible assets of  the assets related to patents acquired as part of the acquisition of agate semiconductor inc in december we reviewed the recoverability of the recorded amounts based on expected future cash flows un discounted and before interest from use of these assets and then determined the impairment loss of  based on the difference between the net book value of the assets and the estimated fair value of the assets 
interest and other income 
interest and other income was approximately million  or of net revenues  during  as compared to million  or of net revenues  during  and million  or of net revenues  during interest income decreased in dollars from to primarily due to decreasing interest rates on invested cash 
interest income decreased from to due to a decrease in cash  cash equivalents and available for sale investments and due to declined interest rates 
interest expense 
interest expense was approximately  during as compared to  during and  during interest expense in and relates to interest and fees under our line of credit and to our notes payable 
we terminated our line of credit in july interest expense in relates to borrowing prior to the completion of a follow on public offering and to fee activity under our line of credit 
impairment of equity investments 
in  we acquired a interest in apacer  a privately held company located in taiwan that designs  manufactures and markets memory modules  for approximately million in cash 
our investment in apacer was valued at cost 
bing yeh  our president and ceo and board director  is a member of apacer s board of directors 
in  we invested an additional million in apacer 
in august  we made an additional investment of  at the end of the third quarter of  we determined that a continued and significant decline in apacer s price per share was other than temporary  and accordingly  in the third quarter of  we recorded a period charge to impairment of equity investments of approximately million to write down our investment in apacer to million which was determined using the price per share paid for the additional investment in august during  kye  a company in which we have an investment  completed an initial public offering on the taiwan stock exchange 
since the initial public offering there had been a significant decline in the market value of the investment 
we had concluded that the decline in value is other than temporary and a write down of million was necessary as of december  the investment was written down to million based on the quoted market price as of december  as of december   the recorded value of our kye investment was approximately million based on the quoted market price as of the balance sheet date 
provision for benefit from income taxes our income tax benefit of million in consisted of a tax rate on our loss before income taxes 
in  our income tax benefit of million consisted of a tax rate on loss before income taxes 
this compares with provision for income taxes of approximately million  or  in in  we plan to implement an international tax structure 
we expect our tax rate for to be zero percent 
our tax rate may change depending on our profitability and the timing of the implementation of certain tax planning strategies 
as of december   we have total short term and long term deferred tax assets of million 
if we continue to incur net losses in the future and the realization of the deferred tax assets through future taxable income becomes uncertain  we may be required to provide a valuation allowance for our deferred tax assets

critical accounting estimates our critical accounting estimates are as follows revenue recognition  allowance for sales returns  allowance for doubtful accounts  allowance for excess and obsolete inventory and lower of cost or market  warranty accrual  litigation costs  valuation of equity investments  and accounting for income taxes 
revenue recognition 
sales to direct customers and foreign stocking representatives are recognized net of an allowance for estimated returns 
when product is shipped to direct customers or stocking representatives  or by our distributors or spt to end users  prior to recognizing revenue  we also require that evidence of the arrangement exists  the price is fixed or determinable and collection is reasonably assured 
our shipping terms are generally fob shipping point and payment terms typically range from to days 
sales to distributors are made primarily under arrangements allowing price protection and the right of stock rotation on merchandise unsold 
because of the uncertainty associated with pricing concessions and future returns  we defer recognition of such revenues  related costs of revenues and related gross profit until the merchandise is sold by the distributor 
product shipped to spt is accounted for as consigned inventory and revenue is recognized when the products have been delivered and are considered as a sale to our end customers by spt 
most of our technology licenses provide for the payment of up front license fees and continuing royalties based on product sales 
for license and other arrangements for technology that we are continuing to enhance and refine and under which we are obligated to provide unspecified enhancements  revenue is recognized over the lesser of the estimated period that we have historically enhanced and developed refinements to the technology  approximately two to three years the upgrade period  or the remaining portion of the upgrade period from the date of delivery  provided all specified technology and documentation has been delivered  the fee is fixed or determinable and collection of the fee is reasonably assured 
from time to time  we reexamine the estimated upgrade period relating to licensed technology to determine if a change in the estimated upgrade period is needed 
revenue from license or other technology arrangements where we are not continuing to enhance and refine technology or are not obligated to provide unspecified enhancements is recognized upon delivery  if the fee is fixed or determinable and collection of the fee is reasonably assured 
royalties received under these arrangements during the upgrade period are recognized as revenue based on the ratio of the elapsed portion of the upgrade period to the estimated upgrade period 
the remaining portions of the royalties are recognized ratably over the remaining portion of the upgrade period 
royalties received after the upgrade period has elapsed are recognized when reported to us  which generally coincides with the receipt of payment 
if we make different judgments or utilize different estimates in relation to the estimated period of technology enhancement and development  the amount and timing of our license and royalty revenues could be materially different 
allowance for sales returns 
we maintain allowances for sales returns for estimated product returns by our customers 
we estimate our allowance for sales returns based on our historical return experience  current economic trends  changes in customer demand  known returns we have not received and other assumptions 
the allowance for sales returns was million  million and million as of december   and  respectively 
if we make different judgments or utilize different estimates  the amount and timing of our revenue could be materially different 
allowance for doubtful accounts 
we maintain allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
we evaluate our allowance for doubtful accounts based on the aging of our accounts receivable  the financial condition of our customers and their payment history  our historical write off experience and other assumptions 
if we were to make different judgments of the financial condition of our customers or the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
the allowance for doubtful accounts was  million and million as of december   and  respectively 
allowance for excess and obsolete inventory and lower of cost or market 
our inventories are stated at the lower of cost determined on a first in  first out basis or market value 
we typically plan our production and inventory levels based on internal forecasts of customer demand  which are highly unpredictable and can fluctuate substantially 
the value of our inventory is dependent on our estimate of future average selling prices  and  if our projected average selling prices are over estimated  we may be required to adjust our inventory value to reflect the lower of cost or market 
our inventories include high technology parts and components that are specialized in nature or subject to rapid technological obsolescence 
we maintain allowance for inventory for potentially excess and obsolete inventories and those inventories carried at costs that are higher than their market values 
some of our customers have requested that we ship them product that has a finished goods date of manufacture that is less than one year old 
in the event that this becomes a common requirement  it may be necessary for us to provide for an additional allowance for our on hand finished goods inventory with a date of manufacture of greater than one year old  which could result in additional inventory write downs 
our allowance for excess and obsolete inventories includes an allowance for our on hand finished goods inventory with a date of manufacture of greater than two years old and for certain products with a date of manufacture of greater than one year old 
if we determine that market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management  such as an unanticipated decline in average selling prices or demand not meeting our expectations  additional inventory write downs may be required 
the allowance for excess and obsolete inventories was million  million and million as of december   and  respectively 
warranty accrual 
our products are generally subject to warranty and we provide for the estimated future costs of repair  replacement or customer accommodation upon shipment of the product in the accompanying statements of operations 
our warranty accrual is estimated based on historical claims compared to historical revenues and assumes that we have to replace products subject to a claim 
for new products  we use our historical percentage for the appropriate class of product 
should actual product failure rates differ from our estimates  revisions to the estimated warranty liability would be required 
litigation costs 
from time to time  we are also involved in other legal actions arising in the ordinary course of business 
we have incurred certain costs associated with defending these matters 
there can be no assurance the atmel complaint or other third party assertions will be resolved without costly litigation  in a manner that is not adverse to our financial position  results of operations or cash flows or without requiring royalty payments in the future which may adversely impact gross margins 
as of december   no estimate can be made of the possible loss or possible range of loss associated with the resolution of these contingencies 
if additional information becomes available such that we estimate that there is a possible loss or possible range of loss associated with these contingencies  then we would record the minimum estimated liability  which could materially impact our results of operations and financial position 
valuation of equity investments 
we hold minority interests in companies having operations in the semiconductor industry 
we record an investment impairment charge when we believe an investment has experienced a decline in value that is other than temporary 
future adverse changes in market conditions or poor operating results of underlying investments could result in losses or an inability to recover the carrying value of the investments  thereby possibly requiring an impairment charge in the future 
the recorded value of our equity investments at december  is million 
accounting for income taxes 
if appropriate  we record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
while we have considered future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for the valuation allowance  in the event we were to determine that we would be unable to realize all or part of our deferred tax assets in the future  an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would be a charge to income in the period such determination was made 
we have not provided any valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets as of december   or as we believe it is more likely than not that such assets will be realized 
recent accounting pronouncements in july  the financial accounting standards board  or fasb  issued statement of financial accounting standards  or sfas  no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  which is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  sfas no 
requires  among other things  the discontinuance of goodwill amortization 
in addition  the standard includes provisions upon adoption for the reclassification of certain existing recognized intangibles as goodwill  reassessment of the useful lives of existing recognized intangibles  reclassification of certain intangibles out of previously reported goodwill and the testing for impairment of existing goodwill and other intangibles 
we adopted sfas no 
during the quarter ended march  the adoption of sfas no 
did not have a significant impact on our financial position or results of operations and goodwill amortization recorded in prior periods was not material 
in july  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for asset retirement obligations  which addresses accounting and reporting for obligations associated with the retirement of tangible long lived assets and the associated asset retirement costs 
sfas no 
is effective for fiscal years beginning after june  we are currently assessing the impact of sfas no 
on our consolidated financial statements 
in october  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
sfas no 
supersedes sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of 
sfas no 
applies to all long lived assets  including discontinued operations  and consequently amends the accounting and reporting provisions of accounting principles board opinion no 
 reporting the results of operations reporting the effects of disposal of a division of a business  and extraordinary  unusual and infrequently occurring events and transactions 
sfas no 
develops one accounting model for long lived assets that are to be disposed of by sale and requires the measurement to be at the lower of book value or fair value less cost to sell 
additionally  sfas no 
expands the scope of discontinued operations to include all components of an entity with operations that can be distinguished from the rest of the entity and will be eliminated from the ongoing operations of the entity in a disposal transaction 
sfas no 
is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  we adopted sfas no 
during the quarter ended march  the adoption of sfas no 
to date has not had a significant impact on our consolidated financial statements 
in june  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for exit or disposal activities 
sfas no 
addresses significant issues regarding the recognition  measurement  and reporting of costs that are associated with exit and disposal activities  including restructuring activities that are currently accounted for under emerging issues task force  or eitf  no 
 liability recognition for certain employee termination benefits and other costs to exit an activity including certain costs incurred in a restructuring 
the scope of sfas no 
also includes costs related to terminating a contract that is not a capital lease and termination benefits that employees who are involuntarily terminated receive under the terms of a one time benefit arrangement that is not an ongoing benefit arrangement or an individual deferred compensation contract 
sfas no 
will be effective for exit or disposal activities that are initiated after december  and early application is encouraged 
we will adopt sfas no 
during the quarter ending march  the provisions of eitf no 
shall continue to apply for an exit activity initiated under an exit plan that met the criteria of eitf no 
prior to the adoption of sfas no 
the effect of adoption of sfas no 
will change on a prospective basis the timing of when restructuring charges are recorded from a commitment date approach to when the liability is incurred 
in november  the fasb issued fasb interpretation  or fin  no 
 guarantor s accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees  including indirect guarantees of indebtedness of others 
fin no 
requires that a liability be recorded in the guarantor s balance sheet upon issuance of a guarantee 
in addition  fin no 
requires disclosures about the guarantees that an entity has issued  including a reconciliation of changes in the entity s product warranty liabilities 
the initial recognition and initial measurement provisions of fin no 
are applicable on a prospective basis to guarantees issued or modified after december   irrespective of the guarantor s fiscal year end 
the disclosure requirements of fin no 
are effective for financial statements of interim or annual periods ending after december  we have adopted the disclosure provision of fin no 
for the year ended december  and we are currently assessing the impact of the recognition and measurement provisions of fin no 
on our consolidated financial statements 
in november  the eitf reached a consensus on issue no 
 accounting for revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables 
eitf issue no 
provides guidance on how to account for arrangements that involve the delivery or performance of multiple products  services and or rights to use assets 
the provisions of eitf issue no 
will apply to revenue arrangements entered into in fiscal periods beginning after june  we are currently assessing the impact of eitf issue no 
on our consolidated financial statements 
in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure an amendment of fasb statement no 
sfas no 
provides alternative methods of transition for a voluntary change to the fair value based method of accounting for stock based employee compensation 
sfas no 
also requires that disclosures of the pro forma effect of using the fair value method of accounting for stock based employee compensation be displayed more prominently and in a tabular format 
additionally  sfas no 
requires disclosure of the pro forma effect in interim financial statements 
the transition and annual disclosure requirements of sfas no 
are effective for fiscal years ended after december  the interim disclosure requirements are effective for interim periods beginning after december  we have chosen to continue to account for stock based compensation using the intrinsic value method prescribed in apb opinion no 
and related interpretations 
accordingly  compensation expense for stock options is measured as the excess  if any  of the estimate of the market value of our stock at the date of the grant over the amount an employee must pay to acquire our stock 
we have adopted the annual disclosure provisions of sfas no 
in our financial reports for the year ended december  and will adopt the interim disclosure provisions for our financial reports for the quarter ending march  as the adoption of this standard involves disclosures only  we do not expect a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
in january  the fasb issued fin no 
 consolidation of variable interest entities  an interpretation of arb no 
fin no 
requires certain variable interest entities to be consolidated by the primary beneficiary of the entity if the equity investors in the entity do not have the characteristics of a controlling financial interest or do not have sufficient equity at risk for the entity to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support from other parties 
fin no 
is effective immediately for all new variable interest entities created or acquired after january  for variable interest entities created or acquired prior to february   the provisions of fin no 
must be applied for the first interim or annual period beginning after june  we are currently reviewing our equity investments and associated relationships to determine if they are variable interest entities as defined by fin no 
it is reasonably possible that we are the primary beneficiary of or hold a significant variable interest in a variable interest entity 
the nature  purpose and activities of the potential variable interest entities is outlined in note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
our maximum exposure to loss as a result of our involvement with the potential variable interest entities is our investment in such entities as we are not obligated to provide any additional financing

in july  we posted a bond in the amount of million for the atmel litigation 
in connection with the bond  we have pledged cash  cash equivalents and available for sale investments in the amount of million 
as of december   this amount is included in restricted cash  cash equivalents and available for sale investments in our balance sheet 
purchase commitments 
as of december   we had outstanding purchase commitments with our foundry vendors of approximately million for delivery in we have recorded a liability of million for adverse purchase commitments 
in december  we committed  subject to certain business conditions  to prepay million to a vendor to secure increased wafer capacity in and we renegotiated this agreement in december and were released from our commitment 
lease commitments 
we have long term  non cancelable building lease commitments 
we are currently seeking subtenants for our unused office space 
during the third quarter of  we recorded a period charge to other operating expense of approximately  relating to an operating lease for an abandoned building 
this charge represents the estimated difference between the total non discounted future sublease income and our non discounted lease commitments relating to this building 
the charge was an estimate and may be adjusted if we obtain a sublease for the building and the actual sublease income is significantly different from the estimate 
we may be unable to secure subtenants for such space due to the recent decrease in demand for commercial rental space in silicon valley 
if we are not successful in subleasing our unused office space  we may be required to take an additional period charge for the balance of the future lease cost 
at december  and  payments made have reduced the recorded liability to  and  respectively 
see also business risks if we are not successful in subleasing our unused office space  we may be required to take a period charge for the difference between the total future sublease income and our lease cost

the purchases may be made in the open market at prevailing market prices or in negotiated transactions off the market  subject to compliance with applicable provisions of the california corporation code and in accordance with applicable federal and state securities laws and regulations 
the stock purchase program was recently extended until october  and will stay in effect unless earlier revoked by our board of directors 
as of december   no shares had been purchased under this program 
operating capital requirements 
we believe that our cash balances  together with funds we expect to generate from operations  will be sufficient to meet our projected working capital and other cash requirements through at least the next twelve months 
however  there can be no assurance that future events will not require us to seek additional borrowings or capital and  if so required  that such borrowing or capital will be available on acceptable terms 
factors that could affect our short term and long term cash used or generated from operations and as a result  our need to seek additional borrowings or capital include the average selling prices of our products  customer demand for our products  the need to secure future wafer production capacity from our suppliers  the timing of significant orders and of license and royalty revenue  and unanticipated research and development expenses associated with new product introductions 
please also see business risks our operating results fluctuate significantly  and an unanticipated decline in revenues may disappoint securities analysts or investors and result in a decline in our stock price 
in addition  on may   the court entered judgment against us in atmel s lawsuit against us in the total amount of million 
in the event our appeal of this lawsuit is unsuccessful  we may have to pay this amount to atmel 
for more information  please also see business risks if we are accused of infringing the intellectual property rights of other parties we may become subject to time consuming and costly litigation 
if we lose  we could suffer a significant impact on our business and be forced to pay damages 
from time to time  we are also involved in other legal actions arising in the ordinary course of business 
we have accrued certain costs associated with defending these matters 
there can be no assurance the atmel complaint or other third party assertions will be resolved without costly litigation  in a manner that is not adverse to our financial position  results of operations or cash flows or without requiring royalty payments in the future which may adversely impact gross margins 
no estimate can be made of the possible loss or possible range of loss associated with the resolution of these contingencies 
as a result  no losses have been accrued in our financial statements as of december  business risks risks related to our business our operating results fluctuate significantly  and an unanticipated decline in revenues may disappoint securities analysts or investors and result in a decline in our stock price 
although we were profitable in  we incurred net losses for and  and in fiscal and our operating results have fluctuated significantly and our past financial performance should not be used to predict future operating results 
our recent quarterly and annual operating results have fluctuated  and may continue to fluctuate  due to the following factors  all of which are difficult to forecast and many of which are out of our control the availability  timely delivery and cost of wafers or other manufacturing and assembly services from our suppliers  competitive pricing pressures and related changes in selling prices  fluctuations in manufacturing yields and significant yield losses  new product announcements and introductions of competing products by us or our competitors  product obsolescence  lower of cost or market  obsolescence or other inventory adjustments  changes in demand for  or in the mix of  our products  the gain or loss of significant customers  market acceptance of products utilizing our superflash technology  changes in the channels through which our products are distributed and the timeliness of receipt of distributor resale information  exchange rate fluctuations  general economic  political and environmental related conditions  such as natural disasters  increases in allowance for doubtful accounts  valuation allowances on deferred tax assets based on changes in estimated future taxable income  difficulties in forecasting  planning and management of inventory levels  unanticipated research and development expenses associated with new product introductions  and the timing of significant orders and of license and royalty revenue 
as recent experience confirms  a downturn in the market for products such as personal computers and cellular telephones that incorporate our products can also harm our operating results 
our operating expenses are relatively fixed  and we order materials in advance of anticipated customer demand 
therefore  we have limited ability to reduce expenses quickly in response to any revenue shortfalls 
our operating expenses are relatively fixed  and we therefore have limited ability to reduce expenses quickly in response to any revenue shortfalls 
consequently  our operating results will be harmed if our revenues do not meet our projections 
we may experience revenue shortfalls for the following reasons sudden drops in consumer demand which may cause customers to cancel backlog  push out shipment schedules  or reduce new orders  possibly due to a slowing economy or inventory corrections among our customers  significant declines in selling prices that occur because of competitive price pressure during an over supply market environment  sudden shortages of raw materials for fabrication  test or assembly capacity constraints that lead our suppliers to allocate available supplies or capacity to other customers which  in turn  harm our ability to meet our sales obligations  and the reduction  rescheduling or cancellation of customer orders 
in addition  political or economic events beyond our control can suddenly result in increased operating costs 
for example  the terrorist attacks of september  have resulted in a substantial increase to our business insurance costs 
in addition  there is considerable public debate as to whether to require companies to record compensation expense on stock option grants 
such requirements  if enacted  would substantially increase our operating costs and impact our earnings per share 
we incurred significant inventory valuation adjustments in and and we may incur additional significant inventory valuation adjustments in the future 
we typically plan our production and inventory levels based on internal forecasts of customer demand  which are highly unpredictable and can fluctuate substantially 
the value of our inventory is dependent on our estimate of future average selling prices  and  if our projected average selling prices are over estimated  we may be required to adjust our inventory value to reflect the lower of cost or market 
as of december   we had million of inventory on hand  a decrease of million  or  from december  total valuation adjustments to inventory were million in  million in and million in due to the large number of units in our inventory  even a small change in average selling prices could result in a significant adjustment and could harm our financial results 
some of our customers have requested that we ship them product that has a finished goods date of manufacture that is less than one year old 
as of december   our allowance for excess and obsolete inventories includes an allowance for our on hand finished goods inventory with a date of manufacture of greater than two years old and for certain products with a date of manufacture of greater than one year old 
in the event that this becomes a common requirement  it may be necessary for us to provide for an additional allowance for our on hand finished goods inventory with a date of manufacture of greater than one year old  which could result in a significant adjustment and could harm our financial results 
cancellations or rescheduling of backlog may result in lower future revenue and harm our business 
due to possible customer changes in delivery schedules and cancellations of orders  our backlog at any particular date is not necessarily indicative of actual sales for any succeeding period 
a reduction of backlog during any particular period  or the failure of our backlog to result in future revenue  could harm our business 
we began to experience a sharp downturn in several of our markets late in the fourth quarter of  as our customers reacted to weakening demand for their products 
although we had improvements in total units shipped in compared to  our revenues declined in due to decreased average selling prices 
our business could be harmed by industry wide fluctuations in the future 
our business may suffer due to risks associated with international sales and operations 
during  and  our export product and licensing revenues accounted for approximately  and of our net revenues  respectively 
our international business activities are subject to a number of risks  each of which could impose unexpected costs on us that would harm our operating results 
these risks include difficulties in complying with regulatory requirements and standards  tariffs and other trade barriers  costs and risks of localizing products for foreign countries  reliance on third parties to distribute our products  extended accounts receivable payment cycles  potentially adverse tax consequences  limits on repatriation of earnings  and burdens of complying with a wide variety of foreign laws 
in addition  we have made equity investments in companies with operations in china  japan and taiwan 
the value of our investments is subject to the economic and political conditions particular to their industry  their countries and to the global economy 
if we determine that a change in the recorded value of an investment is other than temporary  we will adjust the value of the investment 
such an expense could have a negative impact on our operating results 
during we determined that a decline in the value of our investment in apacer was other than temporary and we wrote down the value of our investment by million 
we derived  and of our net product revenues from asia during  and  respectively 
additionally  substantially all of our wafer suppliers and packaging and testing subcontractors are located in asia 
any kind of economic  political or environmental instability in this region of the world can have a severe negative impact on our operating results due to the large concentration of our production and sales activities in this region 
for example  during and  several asian countries where we do business  such as japan  taiwan and korea  experienced severe currency fluctuation and economic deflation  which negatively impacted our revenues and also negatively impacted our ability to collect payments from customers 
during this period  the lack of capital in the financial sectors of these countries made it difficult for our customers to open letters of credit or other financial instruments that are guaranteed by foreign banks 
finally  the economic situation during this period exacerbated a decline in selling prices for our products as our competitors reduced product prices to generate needed cash 
it should also be noted that we are greatly impacted by the political  economic and military conditions in taiwan 
taiwan and china are continuously engaged in political disputes and both countries have continued to conduct military exercises in or near the other s territorial waters and airspace 
such disputes may continue and even escalate  resulting in an economic embargo  a disruption in shipping or even military hostilities 
any of these events could delay production or shipment of our products 
any kind of activity of this nature or even rumors of such activity could harm our operations  revenues  operating results  and stock price 
terrorist attacks and threats  and government responses thereto  could harm our business 
terrorist attacks in the united states or abroad against american interests or citizens  us retaliation for these attacks  threats of additional terrorist activity and the potential for war in iraq has caused our customer base to become more cautious 
any escalation in these events or similar future events may disrupt our operations or those of our customers  distributors and suppliers  and may affect the availability of materials needed to manufacture our products or the means to transport those materials to manufacturing facilities and finished products to customers 
in addition  these events have had and may continue to have an adverse impact on the us and world economy in general and consumer spending in particular  which could harm our business 
we do not typically enter into long term contracts with our customers  and the loss of a major customer could harm our business 
we do not typically enter into long term contracts with our customers 
in addition  we cannot be certain as to future order levels from our customers 
in the past  when we have entered into a long term contract  the contract has generally been terminable at the convenience of the customer 
we depend on stocking representatives and distributors to generate a majority of our revenues 
we rely on stocking representatives and distributors to establish and maintain customer relationships and to sell our products 
these stocking representatives and distributors could discontinue their relationship with us or discontinue selling our products at any time 
the majority of our stocking representatives are located in asia 
the loss of our relationship with any stocking representative or distributor could harm our operating results by impairing our ability to sell our products to our end customers 
we depend on spt  our logistics center  to support many of our customers in asia 
since march  we have been increasing our out sourcing activities for our customer service logistics to support our customers 
currently spt supports our customers in taiwan  china and other southeast asia countries 
spt provides planning  warehousing  delivery  billing  collection and other logistic functions for us in these regions 
spt is a wholly owned subsidiary of one of our stocking representatives in taiwan  pct 
for and  spt serviced end customer shipments accounting for and of our net product revenues recognized 
for further description of our relationships with pct and spt  please refer to item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation related party transactions 
we do not have any long term contracts with spt or pct  and spt or pct may cease providing services to us at any time 
if spt or pct were to terminate their relationship with us we would experience a delay in reestablishing warehousing  logistics and distribution functions  which could impair our ability to collect accounts receivable from spt and may harm our business 
we depend on a limited number of foreign foundries to manufacture our products  and these foundries may not be able to satisfy our manufacturing requirements  which could cause our revenues to decline 
we outsource substantially all of our manufacturing and testing activities 
we currently buy all of our wafers and sorted die from a limited number of suppliers 
substantially all of our products are manufactured by five foundries  tsmc in taiwan  sanyo  seiko epson and yasu in japan  and samsung in korea 
we anticipate that these foundries  together with vanguard in taiwan will manufacture the majority of our products in in march  we invested million in gsmc  a cayman islands company  for a wafer foundry project located in shanghai  china 
we anticipate that gsmc will begin to manufacture some of our products in the second half of if these suppliers fail to satisfy our requirements on a timely basis at competitive prices we could suffer manufacturing delays  a possible loss of revenues or higher than anticipated costs of revenues  any of which could harm our operating results 
our revenues may be impacted by our ability to obtain adequate wafer supplies from our foundries 
the foundries with which we currently have arrangements  together with any additional foundry at which capacity might be obtained  may not be willing or able to satisfy all of our manufacturing requirements on a timely basis at favorable prices 
in addition  we have encountered delays in qualifying new products and in ramping up new product production and we could experience these delays in the future 
we are also subject to the risks of service disruptions  raw material shortages and price increases by our foundries 
such disruptions  shortages and price increases could harm our operating results 
manufacturing capacity has in the past been difficult to secure and if capacity constraints arise in the future our revenues may decline 
in order to grow  we need to increase our present manufacturing capacity 
we currently believe that the existing capacity available to us will be sufficient through however  events that we have not foreseen could arise which would limit our capacity 
similar to our million investment in gsmc  we may determine that it is necessary to invest substantial capital in order to secure appropriate production capacity commitments 
if we cannot secure additional manufacturing capacity on acceptable terms  our ability to grow will be impaired and our operating results will be harmed 
if we are not successful in subleasing our unused office space  we may be required to take a period charge for the difference between the total future sublease income and our lease cost 
we have long term  non cancelable building lease commitments 
we are currently in the process of locating subtenants for our unused office space 
we may be unable to secure subtenants for this space due to the recent decrease in demand for commercial rental space in silicon valley 
during the third quarter of  we recorded a period charge to other operating expense of approximately  relating to an operating lease for an abandoned building 
this charge represents the estimated difference between the total non discounted future sublease income and our non discounted lease commitments relating to this building 
the charge was an estimate and may be adjusted if we obtain a sublease for the building and the actual sublease income is significantly different from the estimate 
if we are unable to secure subtenants  we may be required to take additional period charges for the balance of the future lease cost  and this will harm our operating results 
our cost of revenues may increase if we are required to purchase manufacturing capacity in the future 
to obtain additional manufacturing capacity  we may be required to make deposits  equipment purchases  loans  joint ventures  equity investments or technology licenses in or with wafer fabrication companies 
these transactions could involve a commitment of substantial amounts of our capital and technology licenses in return for production capacity 
we may be required to seek additional debt or equity financing if we need substantial capital in order to secure this capacity and we cannot assure you that we will be able to obtain such financing 
if our foundries fail to achieve acceptable wafer manufacturing yields  we will experience higher costs of revenues and reduced product availability 
the fabrication of our products requires wafers to be produced in a highly controlled and ultra clean environment 
semiconductor companies that supply our wafers from time to time have experienced problems achieving acceptable wafer manufacturing yields 
semiconductor manufacturing yields are a function of both our design technology and the foundry s manufacturing process technology 
low yields may result from marginal design or manufacturing process drift 
yield problems may not be identified until the wafers are well into the production process  which often makes them difficult  time consuming and costly to correct 
furthermore we rely on independent foundries for our wafers which increases the effort and time required to identify  communicate and resolve manufacturing yield problems 
if our foundries fail to achieve acceptable manufacturing yields  we will experience higher costs of revenues and reduced product availability  which could harm our operating results 
if our foundries discontinue the manufacturing processes needed to meet our demands  or fail to upgrade the technologies needed to manufacture our products  we may face production delays and lower revenues 
our wafer and product requirements typically represent a small portion of the total production of the foundries that manufacture our products 
as a result  we are subject to the risk that a foundry will cease production on an older or lower volume manufacturing process that it uses to produce our parts 
additionally  we cannot be certain our foundries will continue to devote resources to advance the process technologies on which the manufacturing of our products is based 
each of these events could increase our costs and harm our ability to deliver our products on time 
our dependence on third party subcontractors to assemble and test our products subjects us to a number of risks  including an inadequate supply of products and higher costs of materials 
we depend on independent subcontractors to assemble and test our products 
our reliance on these subcontractors involves the following significant risks reduced control over delivery schedules and quality  the potential lack of adequate capacity during periods of strong demand  difficulties selecting and integrating new subcontractors  limited warranties on products supplied to us  potential increases in prices due to capacity shortages and other factors  and potential misappropriation of our intellectual property 
these risks may lead to increased costs  delayed product delivery or loss of competitive advantage  which would harm our profitability and customer relationships 
because our flash memory products typically have lengthy sales cycles  we may experience substantial delays between incurring expenses related to research and development and the generation of revenues 
due to the flash memory product cycle we usually require more than nine months to realize volume shipments after we first contact a customer 
we first work with customers to achieve a design win  which may take three months or longer 
our customers then complete the design  testing and evaluation process and begin to ramp up production  a period which typically lasts an additional six months or longer 
as a result  a significant period of time may elapse between our research and development efforts and our realization of revenue  if any  from volume purchasing of our products by our customers 
we face intense competition from companies with significantly greater financial  technical and marketing resources that could harm sales of our products 
we compete with major domestic and international semiconductor companies  many of which have substantially greater financial  technical  marketing  distribution  and other resources than we do 
many of our competitors have their own facilities for the production of semiconductor memory components and have recently added significant capacity for such production 
our memory products  which presently account for substantially all of our revenues  compete principally against products offered by amd  atmel  intel  macronix  sanyo  stmicroelectronics and winbond 
if we are successful in developing our high density products  these products will compete principally with products offered by amd  atmel  fujitsu  hitachi  intel  mitsubishi  samsung  sandisk  sharp electronics  stmicroelectronics and toshiba  as well as any new entrants to the market 
in addition  we may in the future experience direct competition from our foundry partners 
we have licensed to our foundry partners the right to fabricate products based on our technology and circuit design  and to sell such products worldwide  subject to our receipt of royalty payments 
competition may also come from alternative technologies such as fram or other developing technologies 
our markets are subject to rapid technological change and  therefore  our success depends on our ability to develop and introduce new products 
the markets for our products are characterized by rapidly changing technologies  evolving and competing industry standards  changing customer needs  frequent new product introductions and enhancements  increased integration with other functions  and rapid product obsolescence 
to develop new products for our target markets  we must develop  gain access to and use leading technologies in a cost effective and timely manner and continue to expand our technical and design expertise 
in addition  we must have our products designed into our customers future products and maintain close working relationships with key customers in order to develop new products that meet their changing needs 
in addition  products for communications applications are based on continually evolving industry standards 
our ability to compete will depend on our ability to identify and ensure compliance with these industry standards 
as a result  we could be required to invest significant time and effort and incur significant expense to redesign our products and ensure compliance with relevant standards 
we believe that products for these applications will encounter intense competition and be highly price sensitive 
while we are currently developing and introducing new products for these applications  we cannot assure you that these products will reach the market on time  will satisfactorily address customer needs  will be sold in high volume  or will be sold at profitable margins 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to identify new product opportunities successfully  develop and bring to market new products  achieve design wins or respond effectively to new technological changes or product announcements by our competitors 
in addition  we may not be successful in developing or using new technologies or in developing new products or product enhancements that achieve market acceptance 
our pursuit of necessary technological advances may require substantial time and expense 
failure in any of these areas could harm our operating results 
our future success depends in part on the continued service of our key design engineering  sales  marketing and executive personnel and our ability to identify  recruit and retain additional personnel 
we are highly dependent on bing yeh  our president and chief executive officer  as well as the other principal members of our management team and engineering staff 
there is intense competition for qualified personnel in the semiconductor industry  in particular the highly skilled design  applications and test engineers involved in the development of flash memory technology 
competition is especially intense in silicon valley  where our corporate headquarters is located 
we may not be able to continue to attract and retain engineers or other qualified personnel necessary for the development of our business or to replace engineers or other qualified personnel who may leave our employ in the future 
our anticipated growth is expected to place increased demands on our resources and will likely require the addition of new management and engineering personnel and the development of additional expertise by existing management personnel 
the failure to recruit and retain key design engineers or other technical and management personnel could harm our business 
our ability to compete successfully depends  in part  on our ability to protect our intellectual property rights 
we rely on a combination of patent  trade secrets  copyrights  mask work rights  nondisclosure agreements and other contractual provisions and technical measures to protect our intellectual property rights 
policing unauthorized use of our products  however  is difficult  especially in foreign countries 
litigation may continue to be necessary in the future to enforce our intellectual property rights  to protect our trade secrets  to determine the validity and scope of the proprietary rights of others  or to defend against claims of infringement or invalidity 
litigation could result in substantial costs and diversion of resources and could harm our business  operating results and financial condition regardless of the outcome of the litigation 
we own patents in the united states relating to our products and processes  and have filed for several more 
in addition  we hold several patents in europe and canada  and have filed several foreign patent applications in europe  japan  korea  taiwan and canada 
we cannot assure you that any pending patent application will be granted 
our operating results could be harmed by the failure to protect our intellectual property 
if we are accused of infringing the intellectual property rights of other parties we may become subject to time consuming and costly litigation 
if we lose  we could suffer a significant impact on our business and be forced to pay damages 
third parties may assert that our products infringe their proprietary rights  or may assert claims for indemnification resulting from infringement claims against us 
any such claims may cause us to delay or cancel shipment of our products or pay damages that could harm our business  financial condition and results of operations 
in addition  irrespective of the validity or the successful assertion of such claims  we could incur significant costs in defending against such claims 
in the past we were sued both by atmel corporation and intel corporation regarding patent infringement issues and sued winbond electronics corporation regarding our contractual relationship with them 
significant management time and financial resources have been devoted to defending these lawsuits 
we settled with intel in may  with winbond in october  and the atmel litigation is ongoing 
in addition to the atmel  intel and winbond actions  we receive from time to time  letters or communications from other companies stating that such companies have patent rights that involve our products 
since the design of all of our products is based on superflash technology  any legal finding that the use of our superflash technology infringes the patent of another company would have a significantly negative effect on our entire product line and operating results 
furthermore  if such a finding were made  there can be no assurance that we could license the other company s technology on commercially reasonable terms or that we could successfully operate without such technology 
moreover  if we are found to infringe  we could be required to pay damages to the owner of the protected technology and could be prohibited from making  using  selling  or importing into the united states any products that infringe the protected technology 
in addition  the management attention consumed by and legal cost associated with any litigation could harm our operating results 
public announcements may hurt our stock price 
during the course of lawsuits there may be public announcements of the results of hearings  motions  and other interim proceedings or developments in the litigation 
if securities analysts or investors perceive these results to be negative  it could harm the market price of our stock 
our litigation may be expensive  may be protracted and confidential information may be compromised 
whether or not we are successful in our lawsuit with atmel  we expect this litigation to continue to consume substantial amounts of our financial and managerial resources 
on april   a jury found that we willfully infringed atmel s and patents  and awarded atmel million in actual damages 
on may   the court entered judgment in the total amount of million  which includes the original million 
the and patents expired in february therefore  we are not precluded from selling any of our products 
we believe that there were significant errors in both the infringement and the damages verdicts  and filed a notice of appeal on july  on october   we filed our opening brief in that appeal 
our final reply brief was filed on january  atmel filed its final brief on january  the court of appeals will likely schedule oral arguments sometime in we do not expect a decision until sometime in mid to late atmel has agreed to stay its enforcement of this judgment pending our appeal 
in july  we posted a bond in the amount of million pending the appeal 
we have incurred certain costs associated with defending this matter  and at any time atmel may file additional claims against us  which could increase the risk  expense and duration of the litigation 
further  because of the substantial amount of discovery required in connection with this type of litigation  there is a risk that some of our confidential information could be compromised by disclosure

if an earthquake or other natural disaster strikes our manufacturing facility or those of our suppliers  we would be unable to manufacture our products for a substantial amount of time and we would experience lost revenues 
our corporate headquarters are located in california near major earthquake faults 
in addition  some of our suppliers are located near fault lines 
in the event of a major earthquake or other natural disaster near our headquarters  our operations could be harmed 
similarly  a major earthquake or other natural disaster such as typhoon near one or more of our major suppliers  like the earthquake in september or the typhoon in september that occurred in taiwan could potentially disrupt the operations of those suppliers  which could then limit the supply of our products and harm our business 
prolonged electrical power outages  energy shortages  or increased costs of energy could harm our business 
our design and process research and development facilities and our corporate offices are located in california  which is susceptible to power outages and shortages as well as increased energy costs 
to limit this exposure  all corporate computer systems at our main california facilities are on battery back up 
in addition  all of our engineering and back up servers and selected corporate servers are on generator back up 
while the majority of our production facilities are not located in california  more extensive power shortages in the state could delay our design and process research and development as well as increase our operating costs 
our growth has in the past placed a significant strain on our management systems and resources and if we fail to manage our growth  our ability to market  sell our products or develop new products may be harmed 
our business has in the past experienced rapid growth  which strained our internal systems  and future growth will require us to continuously develop sophisticated information management systems in order to manage our business effectively 
we are currently implementing a supply chain management system and a vendor electronic data interface system 
there is no guarantee that we will be able to implement these new systems in a timely fashion  that in themselves they will be adequate to address any growth  or that we will be able to foresee in a timely manner other infrastructure needs before they arise 
our success depends on the ability of our executive officers to effectively manage our growth 
if we are unable to manage our growth effectively  our results of operations will be harmed 
if we fail to successfully implement new management information systems  our business may suffer severe inefficiencies that may harm the results of our operations 
risks related to our industry our success is dependent on the growth and strength of the flash memory market 
all of our products  as well as all new products currently under design  are stand alone flash memory devices or devices embedded with flash memory 
a memory technology other than superflash may be adopted as an industry standard 
our competitors are generally in a better financial and marketing position than we are from which to influence industry acceptance of a particular memory technology 
in particular  a primary source of competition may come from alternative technologies such as fram devices if such technology is commercialized for higher density applications 
to the extent our competitors are able to promote a technology other than superflash as an industry standard  our business will be seriously harmed 
the selling prices for our products are extremely volatile and have historically declined during periods of over capacity or industry downturns 
the semiconductor industry has historically been cyclical  characterized by periodic changes in business conditions caused by product supply and demand imbalance 
when the industry experiences downturns  they often occur in connection with  or in anticipation of  maturing product cycles and declines in general economic conditions 
these downturns are characterized by weak product demand  excessive inventory and accelerated declines of average selling prices 
in some cases  downturns  such as the one we have experienced since late  have lasted for more than a year 
our business could be further harmed by industry wide prolonged downturns in the future 
the flash memory products portion of the semiconductor industry  from which we derive substantially all of our revenues suffered from excess capacity in  and  which resulted in greater than normal declines in our markets  which unfavorably impacted our revenues  gross margins and profitability 
while these conditions improved in and  deteriorating market conditions at the end of and continuing through have resulted in the decline of our selling prices and harmed our operating results 
there is seasonality in our business and if we fail to continue to introduce new products this seasonality may become more pronounced 
sales of our products in the consumer electronics applications market are subject to seasonality 
as a result  sales of these products are impacted by seasonal purchasing patterns with higher sales generally occuring in the second half of each year 
in the past we have been able to mitigate such seasonality with the introduction of new products throughout the year 
if we fail to continue to introduce new products  our business may suffer and the seasonality of a portion of our sales may become more pronounced 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to risks associated with foreign exchange rate fluctuations due to our international manufacturing and sales activities 
these exposures may change over time as business practices evolve and could negatively impact our operating results and financial condition 
all of our sales are denominated in us dollars 
an increase in the value of the us dollar relative to foreign currencies could make our products more expensive and therefore reduce the demand for our products 
such a decline in the demand could reduce revenues and or result in operating losses 
in addition  a downturn in the economies of china  japan or taiwan could impair the value of our equity investments in companies with operations in these countries 
if we consider the value of these companies to be impaired  we will write off  or expense  some or all of our investments 
in the fourth quarter of  we wrote down our investment in kye by million to million due to an other than temporary decline in its market value 
as of december   the recorded value of our kye investment was approximately million based on the quoted market price as of the balance sheet date 
in the third quarter of  we wrote down our investment in apacer  a privately held memory module manufacturer located in taiwan  by million due to an other than temporary decline in its value 
as of december   the recorded value of our apacer investment was approximately million 
in addition  we have equity investments in companies with operations in china  japan  taiwan and united states with recorded values at december  of approximately million  million  million and million  respectively 
at any time  fluctuations in interest rates could affect interest earnings on our cash  cash equivalents and short term investments  or the fair value of our investment portfolio 
we believe that the effect  if any  of reasonably possible near term changes in interest rates on our financial position  results of operations  and cash flows would not be material 
currently  we do not hedge these interest rate exposures 
as of december   the carrying value of our available for sale investments approximated fair value 
the table below presents the carrying value and related weighted average interest rates for our unrestricted and restricted cash  cash equivalents and available for sale investments as of december  in thousands ca rrying interest value rate short term available for sale investments fixed rate long term available for sale investments to years fixed rate cash and cash equivalents variable rate
