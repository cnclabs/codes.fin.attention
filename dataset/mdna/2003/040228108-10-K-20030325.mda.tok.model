we have no off balance sheet debt 
the subordinated notes and credit facility contain certain restrictions on the payment of dividends on our common stock and the occurrence of additional indebtedness  as well as other typical debt covenants

unlike traditional industrial companies  a gaming company s balance sheet has limited accounts receivable and inventories 
in addition  casinos generate significant cash on a daily basis 
we generally apply our daily cash flows to pay down indebtedness under our revolving credit facility and pay our current liabilities pursuant to their normal cycles 
given the significant daily cash flows generated by our operations and the financial flexibility provided by our credit facility  the existence of a working capital deficit has no impact on our ability to operate our business or meet our obligations as they become due 
we believe that cash on hand  operating cash flows and funds available under our credit facility will be sufficient to fund our current operating  capital expenditure and debt service obligations for the next months 
contractual obligations  as of december   mature as follows one year and less years years after years total debt      operating leases     total      critical accounting estimates our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states  which requires our management to make estimates and assumptions about the effects of matters that are inherently uncertain 
we have summarized our significant accounting policies in note to our notes to consolidated financial statements 
of our accounting policies  we believe the following may involve a higher degree of judgment and complexity 
goodwill we have approximately million of goodwill recorded on our balance sheet at december   related to acquisitions 
we regularly evaluate our acquired businesses for potential impairment indicators 
additionally  we adopted the provisions of sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  on january   that require us to perform impairment testing at least annually 
our judgments regarding the existence of impairment indicators are based on  among other things  the regulatory and market status and operational performance of each of our acquired businesses 
if these estimates or related assumptions change in the future  impairment charges would be recorded that could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations 
property and equipment our operations are capital intensive and we have made significant capital investments in each of our properties 
at december   we have approximately million of net property and equipment recorded on our balance sheet 
we depreciate our assets on a straight line basis over their estimated useful lives 
the estimates of the useful lives are based on the nature of the asset as well as our current operating strategy 
future events  such as property expansions  new competition and new regulations  could result in a change in the manner in which we are using certain assets requiring a change in the estimated useful lives of such assets 
in assessing the recoverability of the carrying value of property and equipment  we must make assumptions regarding estimated future cash flows and other factors 
if these estimates or the related assumptions change in the future  we may be required to record impairment charges for these assets 
insurance accruals our insurance policies for employee health  workers compensation and general patron liability have significant deductible levels on an individual claim basis 
we accrue a liability for known workers compensation and general patron liability based upon claims reserves established by the third party administrator processing our claims 
additionally  we accrue an amount for incurred but not reported claims based on our historical experience and other factors 
our employee health insurance benefit accrual is based on our historical claims experience rate including an estimated lag factor 
these accruals involve complex estimates and could be significantly affected should current claims vary from historical levels 
management reviews our insurance accruals for adequacy at the end of each reporting period 
effective gaming tax rates we record gaming taxes based upon effective gaming tax rates for each of our casinos 
these effective rates are based upon statutory gaming tax rates and estimates of annual casino revenues 
increases or decreases in our actual or estimated casino revenues or changes in statutory gaming tax rates could require changes to our effective gaming tax rates 
management reviews our effective gaming tax rates at the end of each reporting period 
market risk interest rate sensitivity the market risk inherent in our financial instruments is the potential loss in fair value arising from adverse changes in interest rates 
the following table provides information about our debt obligations that are sensitive to changes in interest rates 
the following table presents principal cash flows and related weighted average interest rates by expected maturity dates and estimated fair value of our debt obligations 
thereafter total fair value dollars in thousands fixed rate debt maturities      average interest rate variable rate debt maturities average interest rate we use interest rate swap agreements from separate financial institutions to manage our interest rate risk associated with our term loan as required under the credit facility 
we have entered into three interest rate swaps that have fixed the interest rate as of october   for a combined original notional amount of million of our variable rate term loan under our credit facility 
the three separate swap agreements carry original notional amounts of million  million and million 
for each swap agreement  we agree to receive a floating rate of interest on the notional principal amount based upon a three month libor rate plus a spread in exchange for fixed rates ranging from to 
all three swap agreements mature on september  two of the three swap agreements have reductions in the notional amounts proportionally with the quarterly payments on the term loan beginning december  the total notional amounts are million at december  as a result of all three swap agreements  we have  in effect  converted of our term loan variable rate debt under our credit facility to fixed rate debt at december  at december   the fair value of our swap agreements is reported on the balance sheet in other liabilities million pretax and the related change in fair value of these agreements is included in stockholders equity as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income million  net of taxes of million
