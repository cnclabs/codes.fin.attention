item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations reference is made throughout this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations to footnotes included in notes to consolidated financial statements  beginning on page f of this report 
overview the company develops and manufactures a broad range of products that are sold worldwide 
the company expands the product lines and services it offers by developing and commercializing its own core technologies and by making strategic acquisitions of complementary businesses 
in january  the company announced a major reorganization plan under which it planned to sell or spin off many noncore businesses 
in  the company modified the plan and sold its power generation business 
as a result of these actions  the company s continuing operations solely include its instrument businesses 
the results of the businesses that have been spun off  sold  or placed for sale have been presented as discontinued operations in the accompanying financial statements 
the company s continuing operations fall into three principal business segments life and laboratory sciences  measurement and control  and optical technologies 
the company s discussion and analysis of its financial condition and results of operations is based upon its financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires the company to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenue and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent liabilities 
on an on going basis  the company evaluates its estimates  including those related to bad debts  inventories  intangible assets  warranty obligations  income taxes  contingencies and litigation  restructuring  and discontinued operations 
the company bases its estimates on historical experience  current market and economic conditions  and other assumptions that management believes are reasonable 
the results of these estimates form the basis for judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities where the values are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
the company believes the following represent its critical accounting policies and estimates used in the preparation of its financial statements a the company maintains allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of its customers to pay amounts due 
if the financial condition of the company s customers were to deteriorate  reducing their ability to make payments  additional allowances would be required 
b the company writes down its inventories for estimated obsolescence for differences between the cost and estimated net realizable value based on recent usage and expected demand 
if ultimate usage or demand varies significantly from expected usage or demand  additional writedowns may be required 
c the company assesses the realizability of its notes receivable based on judgments concerning the borrower s ability to make the required payments 
if the financial condition of the borrower were to deteriorate  charges to reduce the carrying value of notes receivable may be necessary 
d the company periodically evaluates goodwill for impairment using market comparables for similar businesses and forecasts of discounted future cash flows 
should the fair value of the company s goodwill decline because of reduced operating performance  market declines  or other indicators of impairment  charges for impairment of goodwill may be necessary 
e the company reviews other intangible assets for impairment when indication of potential impairment exists  such as a significant reduction in cash flows associated with the assets 
should future cash flows decline significantly from estimated amounts  charges for impairment of other intangible assets may be necessary 
f in instances where the company sells equipment with an obligation to install it at a customer site  the company assesses the complexity of the installation to determine the timing of revenue recognition 
if the nature of the company s products and the related installation obligations changed so that installation were to become more complicated and lengthy  the company may be required to defer additional revenues upon shipment of its products until completion of installation 
g at the time the company recognizes revenue it provides for the estimated cost of product warranties based primarily on historical experience 
should product failure rates or the actual cost of correcting product failures vary from estimates  revisions to the estimated warranty liability would be necessary 
h the company estimates the degree to which tax assets and loss carryforwards will result in a benefit based on expected profitability by tax jurisdiction  and provides a valuation allowance for tax assets and loss carryforwards that it believes will more likely than not go unused 
should the company s actual future taxable income by tax jurisdiction vary from estimates  additional allowances may be necessary 
i the company estimates losses on contingencies and litigation and provides a reserve for these losses 
should the ultimate losses on contingencies and litigation vary from estimates  adjustments to those reserves may be required 
j the company records restructuring charges for asset impairment based on estimated future cash flows associated with the equipment and for the cost of vacating facilities based on expected sub rental income 
should actual cash flows associated with impaired equipment and sub rental income from vacated facilities vary from estimated amounts  adjustments may be required 
k the company estimates the expected proceeds from the sale of its discontinued businesses and  when necessary  records losses to reduce the carrying value of these businesses to estimated realizable value 
should the actual proceeds  which would include post closing purchase price adjustments  vary from estimates  actual results could differ from expected amounts 
results of operations the discussion of operating income and operating income margin throughout this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations includes references to amounts determined in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles gaap  as well as amounts that exclude restructuring costs  gains and losses on the sale of businesses  and certain other items that are discussed by segment below and in more detail in note the company believes that this presentation  which is substantially consistent with how it measures its operating performance  provides information that investors may find useful as the items  while recurring in the years presented  vary significantly from period to period 
compared with continuing operations sales in were billion  a decrease of million  or  from excluding the effect of acquisitions  divestitures  and currency translation  revenues decreased million  or 
currency translation had a favorable effect on revenues as discussed below by segment  due to the weakening of the us dollar relative to currencies of countries in which the company operates

the restructuring and other items in both periods are discussed by segment below and in more detail in note excluding the restructuring and other costs  which totaled million in and million in  segment operating income was million in and million in the period included million of goodwill amortization 
amortization of goodwill ceased following the adoption of statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  effective in note 
excluding goodwill amortization and restructuring and other items  segment operating income totaled million in segment operating income excluding goodwill amortization and restructuring and other items decreased in due to lower revenues and the resulting reduced profitability at a number of businesses  discussed below  offset in part by the impact of cost reduction and productivity initiatives 
in response to a continued downturn in semiconductor and other industrial markets served by the company  and in an effort to further integrate business units and reduce the number of real estate locations  the company continued restructuring initiatives in at a number of business units 
the restructuring and related actions primarily consisted of headcount reductions  writedowns of production equipment and abandonment of leases for telecommunications products  and consolidation of facilities to streamline operations and reduce costs 
these actions resulted in annual cost reductions beginning in late and continuing in early of approximately million  including million in the life and laboratory sciences segment  million in the measurement and control segment  and million in the optical technologies segment 
the company expects to incur an additional million of restructuring costs in for charges associated with these actions that cannot be recorded until incurred  such as relocation and moving costs 
the company believes that restructuring actions undertaken in will be substantially completed by mid the company expects to identify additional sites to consolidate in and will record charges in connection with any such actions 
life and laboratory sciences sales in the life and laboratory sciences segment increased million to billion in the favorable effects of currency translation resulted in an increase in revenues of million in sales decreased million due to divestitures  net of acquisitions 
excluding the effect of currency translation  divestitures  and acquisitions  revenues grew nominally  increasing million  or 
increased demand for high end technology mass spectrometry equipment and histology and cytology products was offset in part by weakened demand for spectroscopy instruments and sample preparation products that had mid single digit percentage declines in sales  primarily due to lower capital spending 
the company believes that many pharmaceutical customers  for example  are delaying purchases except for high end equipment where recent technological advances may provide a competitive advantage 
operating income margin increased to in from in operating income margin is segment operating income divided by segment revenues 
the segment s operating income margin increased primarily due to the discontinuation of goodwill amortization as a result of the adoption of sfas no 
in and higher restructuring and other costs in  compared with excluding restructuring and other costs  net  of million in and million in  and goodwill amortization of million in  operating income margin was in and in the increase in operating income margin resulted primarily from cost reduction and productivity measures undertaken in and and  to a lesser extent  revenue growth of higher margin products

measurement and control sales in the measurement and control segment decreased million to million in sales decreased million due to divestitures  net of acquisitions 
the favorable effects of currency translation resulted in an increase in revenues of million in excluding the effect of divestitures  acquisitions  and currency translation  revenues decreased million  or 
the decrease was due to a decline in revenues in each of the segment s principal businesses  particularly the temperature control business  where over half of the decrease occurred 
the overall revenue decline was due to economic conditions facing customers  particularly in the semiconductor  energy  and steel industries 
the decrease in revenues was offset in part by an increase in sales of explosives detection equipment in the fourth quarter of following a congressional mandate to begin screening all checked airline baggage in the united states by the end of the company expects that a continued downturn in markets served by the segment will unfavorably affect the segment s revenue comparisons with corresponding prior year periods in the near term 
a prolonged downturn could adversely affect the realizability of the segment s assets  which may result in charges for impairment 
the principal divestitures by the segment included the july sale of thermo blh and thermo nobel  which manufacture and sell strain gauges  and were placed for sale in note  the august sale of its pharos marine unit  which manufactures and sells marine navigation equipment  the april sale of the cac and mid south businesses  which provide the oil and gas industry with wellhead safety and control products  and the july sale of its thermomicroscopes unit  a manufacturer of scanning probe microscopes

excluding the effect of currency translation  an acquisition  and divestitures  revenues decreased million  or 
the decrease was due to a severe slowdown in the semiconductor and other industrial markets that has adversely affected all of the segment s principal businesses 
the semiconductor industry is highly cyclical and is experiencing a downturn that began in the company expects that the slowdowns in semiconductor and other industrial markets will continue to result in unfavorable revenue comparisons with corresponding prior year periods in the near term 
a prolonged downturn could adversely affect the realizability of the segment s assets  which may result in charges for impairment 
in the third quarter of  following the company s acquisition of the remaining minority interest in spectra physics  the company conformed the lasers division s backlog policy to the prevailing practice at the company s other businesses of including in backlog only product orders that are expected to ship within six months

forward looking statements in connection with the safe harbor provisions of the private securities litigation reform act of  we caution readers that the following important factors  among others  in some cases have affected  and in the future could affect  our actual results and could cause our actual results in and beyond to differ materially from those expressed in any forward looking statements made by us 
we must develop new products  adapt to rapid and significant technological change  and respond to introductions of new products in order to remain competitive 
our growth strategy includes significant investment in and expenditures for product development  including in the area of proteomics 
we sell our products in several industries that are characterized by rapid and significant technological changes  frequent new product and service introductions  and enhancements and evolving industry standards 
without the timely introduction of new products  services  and enhancements  our products and services will likely become technologically obsolete over time  in which case our revenue and operating results would suffer 
our customers use many of our products to develop  test  and manufacture their own products 
as a result  we must anticipate industry trends and develop products in advance of the commercialization of our customers products 
if we fail to adequately predict our customers needs and future activities  we may invest heavily in research and development of products and services that do not lead to significant revenue 
many of our existing products and those under development are technologically innovative and require significant planning  design  development  and testing at the technological  product  and manufacturing process levels 
these activities require us to make significant investments 
products in our markets undergo rapid and significant technological change because of quickly changing industry standards and the introduction of new products and technologies that make existing products and technologies uncompetitive or obsolete 
our competitors may adapt more quickly to new technologies and changes in customers requirements than we can 
the products that we are currently developing  or those we will develop in the future  may not be technologically feasible or accepted by the marketplace  and our products or technologies could become uncompetitive or obsolete 
we sell our products and services to a number of companies that operate in cyclical industries  which would adversely affect our results of operations when those industries experience a downturn 
the growth and profitability of some of our businesses depend in part on sales to industries that are subject to cyclical downturns and are experiencing slowing trends 
for example  our optical technologies segment depends in part on sales to the semiconductor industry and our measurement and control segment depends in part on sales to the steel and cement industries 
a continued slowdown in these industries would adversely affect sales by these segments  which in turn would adversely affect our revenues and results of operations 
our business is adversely impacted by the continuing general worldwide economic slowdown and related uncertainties affecting markets in which we operate 
continuing adverse economic conditions worldwide could adversely impact our business in and beyond  resulting in reduced demand for some of our products  increased rate of order cancellations or delays  increased risk of excess and obsolete inventories  increased pressure on the prices for our products and services  and greater difficulty in collecting accounts receivable 
for example  continued softness in the laboratory equipment  industrial manufacturing  and semiconductor markets could adversely affect our future operating results 
changes in governmental regulations may reduce demand for our products or increase our expenses 
we compete in many markets in which we and our customers must comply with federal  state  local  and international regulations  such as environmental  health and safety  and food and drug regulations 
we develop  configure  and market our products to meet customer needs created by those regulations 
any significant change in regulations could reduce demand for our products 
for example  many of our instruments are marketed to the pharmaceutical industry for use in discovering and developing drugs 
changes in the us food and drug administration s regulation of the drug discovery and development process could have an adverse effect on the demand for these products 
demand for most of our products depends on capital spending policies of our customers and on government funding policies 
our customers include manufacturers of semiconductors and products incorporating semiconductors  pharmaceutical and chemical companies  laboratories  universities  healthcare providers  government agencies  and public and private research institutions 
many factors  including public policy spending priorities  available resources  and product and economic cycles  have a significant effect on the capital spending policies of these entities 
these policies in turn can have a significant effect on the demand for our products 
our inability to protect our intellectual property could have a material adverse effect on our business 
in addition  third parties may claim that we infringe their intellectual property  and we could suffer significant litigation or licensing expense as a result 
we place considerable emphasis on obtaining patent and trade secret protection for significant new technologies  products  and processes because of the length of time and expense associated with bringing new products through the development process and into the marketplace 
our success depends in part on our ability to develop patentable products and obtain and enforce patent protection for our products both in the united states and in other countries 
we own numerous us and foreign patents  and we intend to file additional applications  as appropriate  for patents covering our products 
patents may not be issued for any pending or future patent applications owned by or licensed to us  and the claims allowed under any issued patents may not be sufficiently broad to protect our technology 
any issued patents owned by or licensed to us may be challenged  invalidated  or circumvented  and the rights under these patents may not provide us with competitive advantages 
in addition  competitors may design around our technology or develop competing technologies 
intellectual property rights may also be unavailable or limited in some foreign countries  which could make it easier for competitors to capture increased market position 
we could incur substantial costs to defend ourselves in suits brought against us or in suits in which we may assert our patent rights against others 
an unfavorable outcome of any such litigation could materially adversely affect our business and results of operations 
we also rely on trade secrets and proprietary know how which we seek to protect our products  in part  by confidentiality agreements with our collaborators  employees  and consultants 
these agreements may be breached and we may not have adequate remedies for any breach 
in addition  our trade secrets may otherwise become known or be independently developed by our competitors 
third parties may assert claims against us to the effect that we are infringing on their intellectual property rights 
we could incur substantial costs and diversion of management resources in defending these claims  which could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  and results of operations 
in addition  parties making these claims could secure a judgment awarding substantial damages  as well as injunctive or other equitable relief  which could effectively block our ability to make  use  sell  distribute  or market our products and services in the united states or abroad 
in the event that a claim relating to intellectual property is asserted against us  or third parties not affiliated with us hold pending or issued patents that relate to our products or technology  we may seek licenses to such intellectual property or challenge those patents 
however  we may be unable to obtain these licenses on commercially reasonable terms  if at all  and our challenge of the patents may be unsuccessful 
our failure to obtain the necessary licenses or other rights could prevent the sale  manufacture  or distribution of our products and  therefore  could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  and results of operations 
we have retained contingent liabilities from businesses that we have sold 
from through  we divested over businesses with aggregate annual revenues in excess of billion 
as part of these transactions  we retained responsibility for some of the contingent liabilities related to these businesses  such as lawsuits  product liability claims  and potential claims by buyers that representations and warranties we made about the businesses were inaccurate 
the resolution of these contingencies has not had a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition  however  we can not be certain that this favorable pattern will continue 
we face a number of challenges in integrating and consolidating our businesses 
we have historically operated our businesses largely as autonomous  unaffiliated operations 
for the past few years  we have been consolidating our operations and managing them in a more coordinated manner 
the following factors may make it difficult to successfully complete the integration and consolidation of our operations our success in integrating our businesses depends on our ability to coordinate or consolidate geographically separate organizations and integrate personnel with different business backgrounds and corporate cultures 
our ability to combine our businesses requires coordination of previously autonomous administrative  sales and marketing  distribution  and accounting and finance functions  and expansion and integration of information and management systems 
the integration and consolidation process could be disruptive to our businesses 
moreover  we may not be able to realize all of the cost savings and other benefits that we expect to result from the integration and consolidation process 
our results could be impacted if we are unable to realize potential future savings from new sourcing initiatives 
as part of our corporate consolidation over the past two years  we have undertaken significant real estate consolidations and cost savings initiatives relating to sourcing materials and services purchased by us throughout our businesses 
while we anticipate continued significant savings from additional sourcing initiatives and further real estate consolidations  future savings opportunities may be fewer and smaller in size  and may be more difficult to achieve 
implementation of our new branding strategy may be difficult and could adversely affect our business 
we historically operated our business largely as autonomous  unaffiliated companies and as a result each of our businesses independently created and developed its own brand names 
we are implementing a new marketing and branding strategy which involves the transition from multiple  unrelated brands to two brands  thermo electron and spectra physics 
several of our existing brands such as finnigan  nicolet  and oriel command strong market recognition and customer loyalty 
we believe the transition to the two new brands will enhance and strengthen our collective brand image and brand awareness across the entire company 
our success in transitioning our brands depends on many factors  including effective communication of the transition to our customers  acceptance and recognition by customers of these new brands  and successful execution of the branding campaign by our marketing and sales teams 
if we are not successful in implementing this strategy and transitioning our brands  we may experience erosion in our product recognition  brand image and customer loyalty  and a decrease in demand for our products 
it may be difficult for us to implement our strategies for improving internal growth 
some of the markets in which we compete have been flat or declining over the past several years 
to address this issue  we are pursuing a number of strategies to improve our internal growth  including finding new markets for our products  including in the area of proteomics  developing new applications for our technologies  combining sales and marketing operations in appropriate markets to compete more effectively  actively funding research and development  commencing key customer initiatives  strengthening our presence in selected geographic markets  and developing commercial tools and infrastructure to increase and support cross selling opportunities of products and services to take advantage of our breadth in product offerings 
we may not be able to successfully implement these strategies  and these strategies may not result in the growth of our business 
we have significant international operations  which entail the risk that exchange rate fluctuations may negatively affect demand for our products and our profitability 
international revenues account for a substantial portion of our revenues  and we intend to continue expanding our presence in international markets 
in  our international revenues from continuing operations  including export revenues from the united states  accounted for approximately of our total revenues 
international revenues are subject to the risk that fluctuations in exchange rates may adversely affect product demand and the profitability in us dollars of products and services provided by us in international markets  where payment for our products and services is made in the local currency 
for example  while in fiscal  currency translation had a favorable effect on revenues of our continuing operations of million  in fiscal  the unfavorable effects of currency translation decreased revenues of our continuing operations by million 
we have acquired several companies and businesses  as a result we have recorded significant goodwill on our balance sheet  which we must continually evaluate for potential impairment 
we have acquired significant intangible assets  including approximately billion of goodwill that we have recorded on our balance sheet as of december  we assess the realizability of the goodwill we have on our books annually as well as whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the goodwill may be impaired 
these events or circumstances generally include operating losses or a significant decline in earnings associated with the acquired business or asset 
our ability to realize the value of the goodwill will depend on the future cash flows of these businesses 
these cash flows in turn depend in part on how well we have integrated these businesses 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company is exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates  currency exchange rates  and equity prices  which could affect its future results of operations and financial condition 
the company manages its exposure to these risks through its regular operating and financing activities 
additionally  the company uses short term forward contracts to manage certain exposures to currencies 
the company enters into forward currency exchange contracts to hedge firm purchase and sale commitments denominated in currencies other than its subsidiaries local currencies 
the company does not engage in extensive currency hedging activities  however  the purpose of the company s currency hedging activities is to protect the company s local currency cash flows related to these commitments from fluctuations in currency exchange rates 
the company s forward currency exchange contracts principally hedge transactions denominated in us dollars  euros  british pounds sterling  japanese yen  and swiss francs 
income and losses arising from forward contracts are recognized as offsets to losses and income resulting from the underlying exposure being hedged 
the company does not enter into speculative currency agreements 
interest rates certain of the company s short and long term available for sale investments and long term obligations are sensitive to changes in interest rates 
interest rate changes would result in a change in the fair value of these financial instruments due to the difference between the market interest rate and the rate at the date of purchase or issuance of the financial instrument 
a decrease in year end and market interest rates would result in a negative impact to the company of million and million  respectively  on the net fair value of its interest sensitive financial instruments 
in addition  interest rate changes would result in a change in the company s interest expense due to variable rate debt instruments 
a basis point increase in day libor at december   would increase the company s annual pre tax interest expense by million 
currency exchange rates the company generally views its investment in international subsidiaries with a functional currency other than the company s reporting currency as long term 
the company s investment in international subsidiaries is sensitive to fluctuations in currency exchange rates 
the functional currencies of the company s international subsidiaries are principally denominated in euros  british pounds sterling  and japanese yen 
the effect of a change in currency exchange rates on the company s net investment in international subsidiaries is reflected in the accumulated other comprehensive items component of shareholders equity 
a depreciation in year end and functional currencies  relative to the us dollar  would result in a reduction of shareholders equity of million and million  respectively 
the fair value of forward currency exchange contracts is sensitive to changes in currency exchange rates 
the fair value of forward currency exchange contracts is the estimated amount that the company would pay or receive upon termination of the contract  taking into account the change in currency exchange rates 
a depreciation in year end and currency exchange rates related to the company s contracts would result in an increase in the unrealized loss on forward currency exchange contracts of million and million  respectively 
the unrealized gains or losses on forward currency exchange contracts resulting from changes in currency exchange rates are expected to approximately offset losses or gains on the exposures being hedged 
certain of the company s cash and cash equivalents are denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of the depositor and are sensitive to changes in currency exchange rates 
a depreciation in the related year end and currency exchange rates would result in a negative impact of million and million  respectively  on the company s net income 
equity prices the company s available for sale investment portfolio includes equity securities that are sensitive to fluctuations in price 
in addition  the company s convertible obligations are sensitive to fluctuations in the price of the company s common stock 
changes in equity prices would result in changes in the fair value of the company s available for sale investments and convertible obligations due to the difference between the current market price and the market price at the date of purchase or issuance of the financial instrument 
a decrease in year end market equity prices would result in a negative impact to the company of million on the net fair value of its price sensitive equity financial instruments  principally its available for sale investments 
a increase in the year end market equity prices would result in a negative impact to the company of million on the net fair value of its price sensitive equity financial instruments  principally its convertible obligations
