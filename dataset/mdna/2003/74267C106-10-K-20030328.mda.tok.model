item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations liquidity and capital resources and financial condition we need liquid funds to pay losses and loss adjustment expenses losses and lae and operating expenses in the ordinary course of business and to meet our debt service requirements 
cash provided by our operating activities was sufficient to meet those needs in  and we believe that our operating activities will provide sufficient cash to meet our liquidity needs during during the fourth quarter of  proassurance sold  shares at per share in a public offering that generated additional capital of million 
as of december   we have increased the statutory surplus of our professional liability segment by million in support of the growth of that segment and expect to use the remaining proceeds from the sale to support additional growth of our professional liability insurance business and for general corporate purposes 
our positive cash flow from operations of million plus the million proceeds from the public offering are the principal reasons for the million increase during in our invested assets and cash and cash equivalents 
our reserves for net losses and loss adjustment expenses net of amounts receivable from reinsurers at december  increased approximately million over those at december  substantially all of this increase is in our professional liability segment  a long tailed business 
a characteristic of a long tailed business is that there is a long length of time between the occurrence of an insured event and significant payment on that event 
because of this characteristic  it is not unusual for reserves to increase as our business increases 
at december  we have a term loan balance of million remaining from the million that we borrowed in order to fund the cash requirements of the consolidation with professionals group 
we are required to pay quarterly principal repayments of million  and beginning in  an additional annual principal payment equal to the lower of either of our parent company only operating cash flow for the preceding year or million 
we have made all quarterly payments on the loan  and we also made a million optional prepayment in september the term loan bears interest at a variable rate based on the london interbank offered rate libor or the bank s base rate at our election 
at december  the interest rate was 
the credit agreement also provides for a revolving line of credit in the amount of million 
the revolving line of credit is available for our operating and working capital requirements 
we have not borrowed any funds under the line and expect to renew the line at the same or a greater amount of credit when the line expires in may the borrowings under the credit agreement are secured by a pledge of the outstanding stock of all of our significant subsidiaries other than meemic holdings and its subsidiaries 
the credit agreement for the term loan  as is customary for credit agreements of this size and nature  requires that proassurance maintain certain financial standards  otherwise known as loan covenants 
as of december  we were in compliance with all loan covenants 
see notes and to our consolidated financial statements for more information regarding the consolidation transaction and the terms of the credit agreement  including the financial covenants 
proassurance did not repurchase any shares of our common stock during the year ended december  our board has authorized stock repurchases of up to approximately one million shares 
at december  proassurance indirectly owned of meemic holdings  inc on january  meemic holdings  the parent company of meemic insurance company  purchased all of the issued and outstanding shares of its common stock  other than those held by proassurance s subsidiary  pronational insurance company pronational 
meemic holdings used its internal funds in the approximate amount of million to acquire all of the  shares of its common stock not owned by pronational  to pay for outstanding options for  shares  and to pay the expenses of the transactions 
the funds were derived from meemic holdings cash and investment resources 
overview proassurance commenced operations on june  through a transaction that joined medical assurance and professionals group as the wholly owned subsidiaries of proassurance 
the consolidation of medical assurance into proassurance was in the form of a corporate reorganization and the assets  liabilities  stockholders equity and results of operations of medical assurance are included in proassurance s consolidated financial statements for the entirety of all periods presented 
prior to june  proassurance s consolidated financial statements do not include the assets  liabilities or results of operations of professionals group because the consolidation of professionals group into proassurance was in the form of a purchase transaction 
for additional information about the consolidation  see note to the consolidated financial statements 
segment overview we operate in two industry segments professional liability insurance and personal lines insurance 
prior to the consolidation  we operated only in the professional liability segment 
our operations have included a personal lines segment since june   when meemic insurance company was acquired as a part of the professionals group consolidation transaction 
our professional liability insurance segment principally provides liability insurance and reinsurance for providers of health care services  and  to a limited extent  providers of legal services 
the principal operating insurance subsidiaries of this segment are the medical assurance company  inc  medical assurance of west virginia  inc  pronational insurance company and red mountain casualty insurance company  inc our personal lines insurance segment provides personal property and casualty insurance to individuals 
our personal lines segment includes the operations of a single insurance company  meemic insurance company 
all of our revenues and expenses are allocated to the operating segments  other than investment income earned directly by the parent holding company and interest expense related to long term debt held by the parent 
critical accounting policies we are required to make estimates and assumptions in certain circumstances that affect amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements and related footnotes 
we evaluate these estimates and assumptions on an on going basis based on historical developments  market conditions  industry trends and other information that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
there can be no assurance that actual results will conform to our estimates and assumptions  and that reported results of operations will not be materially adversely affected from time to time by the need to make accounting adjustments reflecting changes in these estimates and assumptions 
we believe the following policies are the most sensitive to estimates and judgments 
premium income we recognize insurance premium income on a monthly pro rata basis over the respective terms of the policies in force 
unearned premiums represent the portion of premiums written applicable to the unexpired terms of the policies in force 
reserve for losses and loss adjustment expenses losses and lae our reserve for losses and lae represents our estimate of the future amounts necessary to pay claims and expenses associated with investigation and settlement of claims 
these estimates consist of case reserves and bulk reserves 
case reserves are estimates of future losses and lae for reported claims and are established by our claims departments 
bulk reserves  which include a provision for losses that have occurred but have not been reported to us as well as development on reported claims  are the difference between i the sum of case reserves and paid losses and ii an actuarially determined estimate of the total losses and lae necessary for the ultimate settlement of all reported claims and incurred but not reported claims  including amounts already paid 
the estimates take into consideration our past loss experience  available industry data and projections as to future claims frequency  severity  inflationary trends and settlement patterns 
independent actuaries review our reserves for losses and lae each year and prepare reports that include recommendations as to the level of reserves 
we consider these recommendations as well as other factors  such as known  anticipated or estimated changes in frequency and severity of claims and loss retention levels and premium rates  in establishing the amount of our reserves for losses and loss adjustment expenses 
estimating reserves is a complex process that is heavily dependent on judgment and involves many uncertainties 
this is particularly true of our professional liability reserves since these claims are typically resolved over a long period time  often exceeding five years 
as a result  reserve estimates may vary significantly from the eventual outcome 
the assumptions used in establishing our reserves are regularly reviewed and updated by management as new data becomes available 
any adjustments necessary are reflected in current operations 
due to the size of our reserves  even a small percentage adjustment to the assumptions can have a material effect on our results of operations for the period in which the change is made 
reinsurance loss recoveries and receivables from reinsurers are estimates of the ultimate amount of our losses and lae that will be reimbursed by reinsurers 
we also estimate premiums ceded under reinsurance agreements that provide wherein the premium  subject to certain maximums and minimums  due to the reinsurer is a percentage of the losses paid under the agreement 
these estimates are based upon our estimates of the ultimate losses and lae that we expect to incur and the portion of those losses that we expect to be allocable to reinsurers based upon the terms of our reinsurance agreements 
given the uncertainty of the ultimate amounts of our losses and lae  these estimates may vary significantly from the eventual outcome 
our estimates of the amounts receivable from and due to reinsurers are regularly reviewed and updated by management as new data becomes available 
any adjustments necessary are reflected in then current operations 
investments we consider our fixed maturity and equity securities as available for sale  which means they are available to be sold in response to our liquidity needs  changes in market interest rates and investment management strategies  among others 
available for sale securities are recorded at fair value  with unrealized gains and losses  net of the related income tax effect  excluded from income and reported as a separate component of shareholders equity 
we evaluate the securities in our investment portfolio on at least a quarterly basis for declines in market value below cost for the purpose of determining whether these declines represent other than temporary declines 
the evaluation involves judgment by management 
some of the factors we consider in the evaluation of our investments are the extent to which the market value of the security is less than its cost basis the length of time for which the market value of the security has been less than its cost basis the financial condition and near term prospects of the security s issuer  taking into consideration the economic prospects of the issuers industry and geographical region  to the extent that information is publicly available proassurance s ability and intent to hold the investment for a period of time sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in market value a decline in the fair value of an available for sale security below cost that we judge to be other than temporary is realized as a loss in the current period and reduces the cost basis of the security 
in subsequent periods  we base any measurement of gain or loss or decline in value upon the adjusted cost basis of the security 
results of operations year ended december  compared to year ended december  our consolidated income before cumulative effect of accounting change is million  or per share  for the year ended december  the operating results of each of our reportable industry segments are discussed separately in the following sections 
the year ended december  includes professionals group activity for the entire period  while the year ended december  includes professionals group activity only since june  thus  when the two periods are compared  significant variances are created because operating results do not include professionals group operating results for the first six months of net income for was reduced by net realized investment losses of million while net income for was increased by net realized investment gains of million 
during  we recognized losses of million for other than temporary declines in the market value of our equity and fixed maturity securities 
approximately million of the impairment losses related to our investments in common stock 
gains realized during from sales of fixed maturity securities largely offset the impairment losses 
we purchase fixed maturity securities with the initial intent to hold such securities until their maturity  however  we may dispose of securities prior to their respective maturities if we believe such disposals are consistent with our overall investment objectives  including maximizing total yields over time  maximizing after tax profits and disposing of securities that no longer meet our risk management criteria 
throughout but particularly in the latter half of  bond prices increased substantially  both in response to historically low market interest rates and in response to uncertainty in the equity market 
in response to these market conditions  we undertook a significant restructuring of our fixed maturity portfolio during the fourth quarter and sold million of fixed maturity securities for net gains of approximately million 
these sales contributed to the shortening of our investment portfolio and reduced the weighted average yield of our fixed maturity portfolio 
interest expense of million in and million in relates entirely to the bank loan that provided financing for the consolidation with professionals group 
the debt bears interest at a variable rate based on the london interbank offered rate libor  or at our election  the bank s base rate 
the interest rate is on december  we initially borrowed million on june  to finance the consolidation 
because the cash requirements of the consolidation were lower than we originally anticipated  we made a million prepayment on the loan in september interest expense increased during as compared to because there was no outstanding loan balance for the first six months of the increase was limited to approximately  because interest rates were lower throughout as compared to and we repaid principal during as required under the loan agreement 
we recognized tax benefits of  and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
our effective rate for both years is significantly lower than the expected statutory rate because approximately in and in of our investment income was earned from tax exempt sources 
after adjustment for tax exempt income  we experienced a taxable loss for the years ended december  and minority interest in both and relates entirely to the minority interest in meemic holdings 
this minority interest was purchased on january  as discussed under liquidity and capital resources 
after adjustment for our tax liability for the year ended december   we have available approximately million in federal tax loss carryforwards related to tax years ending on or before december  that will expire in the year we also have available approximately million in alternative minimum tax carryforwards that can be applied against any future regular tax payable 
the alternative minimum tax carryforwards have no expiration date 
professional liability insurance segment operating results for our professional liability insurance segment for the years ended december  and are summarized in the table below dollars in thousands 
year ended december increase decrease gross premiums written    net premiums written    revenues premiums earned    premiums ceded    net premiums earned    net investment income    net realized investment gains losses    other income    total revenues    expenses net losses and loss adjustment expenses    underwriting  acquisition and insurance expenses    total expenses    income loss before income taxes    net loss and lae ratio underwriting expense ratio combined ratio december net reserves for loss and lae   premiums premiums written our professional liability insurance segment principally provides liability insurance for providers of medical and other healthcare services  and to a limited extent providers of legal services professional coverages 
the professional liability segment also includes accident and health and workers compensation insurance other coverages 
premiums written for the professional liability segment for the year ended december  were million  which is an increase of million as compared to the same period of this increase is comprised of a million increase related to professional coverages offset by a million decrease related to other coverages 
professional coverages premiums written increased to million for the year ended december  the increase is primarily due to the consolidation with professionals group but also reflects the beneficial effect of rate increases implemented during and we have implemented and we plan to continue to implement rate increases based on loss trends  subject to our receipt of regulatory approval 
we have experienced some loss of insureds due to the higher rates 
however  to date  our premium renewals and new business at the higher rates have more than offset the effect of non renewals 
we estimate that  on average  renewals were at rates that were approximately higher than rates 
gross written premiums for other coverages were approximately million for the year ended december  as compared to million for the same period in our other coverages premiums were primarily written in conjunction with and through third parties as a means of utilizing our capital 
during the latter half of we decided to significantly decrease our commitment to these programs and have since allowed existing contractual relationships to expire 
the decline in other coverages premiums is the expected result of this decision 
premiums earned premiums earned for the year ended december  increased by million as compared to the year ended december  as with written premiums  this increase is comprised of an increase related to professional coverages offset by a decrease related to other coverages 
our professional coverages premiums earned for the year ended december  increased by million to million 
the increase is primarily due to the additional premiums earned as a result of the consolidation but  as with written premiums  also reflects the beneficial impact of rate increases 
rate increases implemented after january  have not yet been fully reflected in premiums earned since premiums are earned over the entire policy period usually one year after the policy is written 
other coverages premiums earned for the year ended december  were million  a decrease of million as compared to the year ended december   reflecting our decreased commitments to the programs that generated these premiums  as previously discussed 
we do not expect to earn any significant amount of other coverage premiums in premiums ceded premiums ceded for the year ended december  increased by million as compared to the year ended december  the increase is comprised of a million increase related to professional coverages offset by a million decrease related to other coverages 
professional coverages premiums ceded were million for the year ended december  the primary reasons for the increase are the growth in premiums earned that resulted from the consolidation with professionals group and rate increases 
other coverages premiums ceded were million for the year ended december   reflecting the decline in related earned premiums  as previously discussed 
losses and loss adjustment expenses as discussed in our critical accounting policies  our reserve for losses and loss adjustment expenses represents our estimate of the future amounts necessary to pay claims and expenses associated with investigation and settlement of claims 
the resulting net losses and loss adjustment expenses hereafter referred to as net losses may be summarized into three components of these estimates i actuarial evaluation of incurred loss levels for the current accident year  ii actuarial re evaluation of incurred loss levels for prior accident years and iii actuarial re evaluation of the reserve for the death  disability and retirement provision 
accident year refers to the period in which the insured event becomes a liability of the insurer 
for occurrence policies the insured event becomes a liability when the event takes place  for claims made policies the insured event becomes a liability when the event is first reported to the insurer 
we believe that measuring losses on an accident year basis is the most indicative measure of the underlying profitability of the premiums earned in that period  since it associates policy premiums earned with our estimate of the losses incurred related to those policy premiums the following table summarizes net losses and net loss ratios for and by type of coverage and by separating losses between the current accident year and all prior years dollars in thousands 
the net loss ratios shown are calculated by dividing the applicable net losses by current calendar year net premiums earned 
year ended december current accident year net losses and lae professional coverages   other coverages   change in prior accident year net losses   change in death  disability and retirement reserves  calendar year net losses   current accident year net loss ratio professional coverages other coverages net loss ratio attributable to current accident year net losses prior accident year net losses change in death  disability and retirement reserves all losses incurred in related to the book of business acquired from professionals group are considered to be current accident year losses because there was no liability for these losses prior to the consolidation transaction 
professional coverages current accident year net losses related to professional coverages for the year ended december  increased by million as compared to the year ended december  our consolidation with professionals group and the resulting increase in premiums is the primary reason for the increase 
the current accident year net loss ratio for professional coverages for the year ended december  as compared to the same period in has decreased from to 
the improvement in the loss ratio primarily reflects the effects of a more adequate premium structure as a result of rate increases implemented during and other coverages current accident year net losses related to other coverages decreased by million year ended december  as compared to the same periods of the decrease resulted from the termination of the programs that generated these losses  as previously discussed with respect to other coverages premiums 
prior year net losses change in death  disability and retirement reserves we increased our estimates of professional liability prior accident year net losses by million during in  we increased our estimates of prior year losses by million 
in both periods  our estimates of losses related to prior year were adjusted based upon actuarial evaluations performed during the period 
in  we decreased our estimate of the reserves required for death  disability and retirement by million 
the decrease was primarily related to the pronational book of business and was principally the result of an increase in the premium rate loads and a decrease in the number of insureds 
the assumptions used in establishing our reserves are regularly reviewed and updated by management as new data becomes available 
any adjustments necessary are reflected in current operations 
due to the size of our reserves  even a small percentage adjustment to the assumptions can have a material effect on our results of operations for the period in which the change is made 
net investment income our professional liability segment investment income is primarily derived from the interest income earned by our fixed maturity securities but also includes interest income from short term and cash equivalent investments  dividend income from equity securities  and rental income earned by our commercial real estate holdings 
investment fees and expenses and real estate expenses are deducted from investment income 
our net investment income for the year ended december  increased by million as compared to the same period in the primary reason for the increase is the additional investment income earned as a result of the consolidation with professionals group 
during  we experienced a decline in overall investment yields as a result of lower market interest rates  both short and long term 
our investment opportunities for new and matured funds have been at rates that are less favorable than the rates available in recent years 
our average investment in lower yielding short term and overnight cash investments increased during due to a lack of more desirable long term investment opportunities 
additionally  as we have invested new and matured funds  we have utilized shorter maturities 
we believe a shorter  more liquid portfolio is currently advantageous  even preferable  although such a strategy reduces current yields 
interest income from fixed maturity investments comprised of our total investment income in and of our total investment income in the weighted average tax equivalent book yield tax adjusted gross earnings divided by the average quarterly ending book value of our professional liability segment fixed maturity investments was for as compared to for the year ended december  the weighted average tax equivalent book yield of the securities in our fixed maturity portfolio at december  was 
net realized investment gains losses net realized investment gains losses includes gains and losses realized on sales of investment securities and realized losses for other than temporary impairments in the fair value of investment securities  as shown in the following table 
net gains from sales   other than temporary impairment losses  net realized investment gains losses   approximately million of the impairments recognized during were related to our equity securities  approximately million of the impairments were related to fixed maturity securities 
approximately million of our net gains from sales were from sales of fixed maturity securities 
we purchase fixed maturity securities with the initial intent to hold such securities until their maturity  however  we may dispose of securities prior to their respective maturities if we believe such disposals are consistent with our overall investment objectives  including maximizing total yields over time  maximizing after tax profits and disposing of securities that no longer meet our risk management criteria 
throughout but particularly in the latter half of  bond prices increased substantially  both in response to historically low market interest rates and in response to uncertainty in the equity market 
in response to these market conditions we undertook a significant restructuring of our fixed maturity portfolio during the fourth quarter 
most of the gains recognized for resulted from these restructuring activities 
underwriting  acquisition and insurance expenses underwriting  acquisition and insurance expenses increased by million for the year ended december  as compared to the same period in expenses related to professional coverages premiums earned increased by million  however  this increase was largely offset by a million decrease in expenses related to other coverages premiums earned 
the increase in professional coverages expenses primarily reflects the additional six months of professionals group activity that is included in the decrease in other coverages expenses is due to the termination of these programs as previously discussed 
the underwriting expense ratio underwriting  acquisition and insurance expenses divided by net premiums earned decreased as compared to the ratio for the year ended december  is as compared to for the same period in the decrease in other coverages acquisition costs discussed above reduced the ratio by 
the remaining decrease in the ratio is primarily due to operating efficiencies realized in and the effect of rate increases 
guaranty fund assessments for the years ended december  and were approximately million and million  respectively 
we are required by most states to be a member of its insolvency or guaranty fund association and  as such  must make payments to the association when so assessed by the state 
such assessments can and do vary from year to year 
personal lines insurance segment our personal lines segment is comprised of the operations of a single insurance company  meemic insurance company  acquired on june  as a part of the consolidation with professionals group 
the year ended december  includes twelve months of meemic operations while the year ended december  includes only six months of meemic operations 
selected financial data for our personal lines insurance segment is summarized in the table below dollars in thousands 
year ended december increase decrease gross premiums written    net premiums written    revenues premiums earned    premiums ceded    net premiums earned    net investment income    net realized investment gains losses other income  total revenues    expenses net losses and loss adjustment expenses    underwriting  acquisition and insurance expenses    total expenses    income loss before income taxes and minority interest    net loss and lae ratio underwriting expense ratio combined ratio december net reserves for loss and lae   premiums premiums written gross written premiums increased by million to million for the year ended december  as compared to the year ended december  for all lines  the principal reason for the increase is the inclusion of an additional six months of meemic activity in premiums by line of business for each year are as follows dollars in thousands year ended december amount amount automobile   homeowners   boat  umbrella and other automobile premiums also increased due to growth in the number of policyholders  an increase in the value of autos insured and an increase in the mcca mandatory statutory assessments that are passed through to automobile policyholders 
during the number of vehicles insured grew by approximately homeowner premiums also increased due to average rate increases of approximately  an increase in the value of homes insured and growth in the number of policyholders 
during the number of homes insured grew by approximately 
premiums earned premiums earned for the year ended december  increased by million as compared to the year ended december  as with written premiums  this increase is primarily due to the inclusion of an additional six months of meemic activity in but also increased due to the effects of rate increases and growth in the number of insureds 
premiums ceded premiums ceded are the portion of our earned premiums due to reinsurers in return for the transfer of a portion of our risk to them 
premiums ceded for the year ended december  increased by million as compared to the year ended december  approximately million of this increase is attributable to an increase in the premiums due to a single reinsurer  the mcca 
the remainder of the increase is primarily attributable to the additional six months of meemic activity in losses and loss adjustment expenses the following table summarizes personal lines net losses and net loss ratios for and by separating losses between the current accident year and all prior accident years dollars in thousands 
the net loss ratios shown are calculated by dividing the applicable net losses by current calendar year net premiums earned 
year ended december net losses and lae current accident year   prior accident years  calendar year net losses and lae   net loss ratio attributable to current accident year net losses and lae prior accident year net losses and lae calendar year net loss ratio all losses incurred in are considered to be current accident year losses because there was no liability for personal lines losses prior to the consolidation transaction 
calendar year net losses and loss adjustment expenses increased from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december   an increase of million 
the principal reason for the increase is the inclusion of an additional six months of meemic activity in the current accident year net loss ratio current accident year losses divided by net earned premiums is and reflects decreases in both the frequency and severity of auto liability claims and the positive effect of mild weather conditions during we reduced losses during by million as a result of favorable developments in our estimates of prior years auto liability reserves 
this was primarily the result of lower than expected claims frequency  which is a continuing result of the legislative tort reforms in the state of michigan 
this legislation has had the effect of reducing frequency and shortening the reporting pattern of claims 
while the legislation became effective in  the effects were uncertain for several years and could be changed through additional legislation or court decisions 
we established initial reserves that considered the various possible outcomes and recognize favorable results as they materialize 
uncertainties inherent in the loss estimation process will invariably cause differences in actual ultimate liabilities from estimates 
net investment income our net investment income is comprised of the interest and dividend income from our fixed maturity  short term  cash equivalent and equity investments  net of investment expenses 
net investment income increased by approximately million for the year ended december  as compared to the year ended december   primarily because includes only six months of personal lines activity 
interest income from fixed maturity investments represents more than of our net investment income 
the tax equivalent book yield tax adjusted gross earnings divided by the average quarterly ending book value of the personal lines segment fixed maturity investments for the year ended december  is as compared to for the year ended december  the average yield is reduced because market rates available for the investment of new and matured funds were lower in the weighted average tax equivalent book yield of the fixed maturity securities that we held at december  is 
net realized investment gains losses net realized investment gains and losses for the year ended december  of  did not include any realized losses for other than temporary impairments 
underwriting  acquisition and insurance expenses underwriting  acquisition and insurance expenses consist of normal  recurring expenses such as commissions  salaries and other expenses 
underwriting  acquisition and insurance expenses for the year ended december  were million as compared to million for the year ended december  the increase is primarily due to the additional six months of meemic activity in but also is due to higher underwriting and acquisition costs resulting from premium growth 
the underwriting expense ratio underwriting  acquisition and insurance expenses divided by net premiums earned for the year ended december  was as compared to for the year ended december  the increase in the ratio is primarily due to an increase in our statutory and guaranty fund assessments in guaranty fund assessments total  in  there were no guaranty fund assessments in year ended december  compared to year ended december  our consolidated income before cumulative effect was million  or per share  for the year ended december  the operating results of our reportable industry segments are discussed separately in the following discussion 
interest expense for the year ended december  of million relates entirely to the term loan obtained in order to finance our consolidation with professionals group 
the debt bears interest at a variable rate based on libor or the bank s base rate 
at december  the interest rate was 
we recognized a tax benefit of million for the year ended december  as compared to a tax expense of million for the year ended december  our tax exempt investment income is the primary reason that our effective rates for both years are significantly lower than the expected statutory rate of 
we earned tax exempt investment income of approximately million in and million in because tax exempt income is not included as taxable income  we experienced a taxable loss for the year ended december  as compared to taxable income for the year ended december  professional liability segment we have summarized the operating results for our professional liability segment for the years ended december  and in the table below 
year ended december increase decrease gross premiums written    revenues premiums earned    premiums ceded    net premiums earned    net investment income    net realized investment gains losses   other income   total revenues    expenses net losses and lae    underwriting  acquisition and insurance expenses    total expenses    income before income taxes    net loss and lae ratio underwriting expense ratio combined ratio premiums gross premiums written professional liability segment gross premiums written for the year ended december  increased by million as compared to our consolidation with professionals group is the primary reason that our gross premiums written increased 
our rate increases implemented during also contributed to the increase 
we implemented rate increases on our professional coverages averaging approximately on renewals weighted by premium volume 
we plan to continue to implement rate increases based on loss trends  subject to regulatory approval 
to date  premiums renewed at the higher rates coupled with new business have more than offset the effect of premiums lost due to decreased retention of insureds 
however  the higher rates may result in a greater loss of insureds in future periods 
premiums earned as with gross premiums written  the increase in premiums earned for the year ended december  as compared to is primarily attributable to our consolidation with professionals group 
the beneficial impact of rate increases will be reflected in our financial results over time 
rate increases implemented after january  have not yet been fully reflected in premiums earned since premiums are earned over the entire policy period usually one year after the policy is written 
reinsurance premiums ceded are estimated based on the terms of the respective reinsurance agreements 
we continually review the estimated expense and any adjustments that we believe necessary are included in current operations 
several factors contributed to the increase in reinsurance premiums ceded for as compared to the increase in premiums earned as a result of the consolidation accounted for approximately of the increase 
during the fourth quarter of  we increased the amount of reinsurance coverage in certain markets which resulted in more of our premiums earned being ceded to reinsurers in also  in more premiums were earned in markets where we rely more heavily on reinsurance 
net premiums earned for the years ended december   and include other coverages of approximately million and million  respectively 
we have historically written accident and health  workers compensation and multi line premiums from time to time as favorable opportunities arose to utilize capital 
during we decided to decrease our commitment to these programs 
however  we continued to write and earn premiums for other coverages during and to honor existing contractual relationships 
our premiums during reflect both volume increases and higher rates charged on other coverages 
losses and loss adjustment expenses professional liability segment losses and loss adjustment expenses and the related current accident year net loss and lae ratio are summarized in the following table 
year ended december incurred losses and lae related to current accident year   prior accident years   change in death  disability and retirement reserves   net incurred losses and lae   net loss and lae ratio current accident year net loss ratio prior accident years ratio change in death  disability and retirement reserves ratio total calendar year net loss and lae ratio during  we recognized million of additional net losses related to prior accident years 
this represented approximately of our december  professional liability segment net reserves of billion 
in  the million decrease in our reserve for death  disability and retirement is principally the result of an increase in premium rate loads and a decrease in the number of insureds primarily related to the pronational book of business 
the current accident year net loss and lae ratio in the table above is calculated by dividing current accident year incurred losses by net premiums earned 
the principal reason for the increase in that ratio in is the effect of the inclusion of professionals group s premiums and losses 
net investment income and net realized investment gains losses earnings on our professional liability segment investment portfolio increased by million as compared to the year ended december  the increase is primarily due to the net increase in the investment portfolio as a result of the consolidation with professionals group 
at december   our professional liability segment investment portfolio of approximately billion consisted of taxable securities and tax exempt securities 
net realized investment gains increased from approximately  in to million in this increase primarily resulted from additional sales of investment securities related to our efforts to restructure our professional liability segment investment portfolio 
underwriting  acquisition and insurance expenses underwriting  acquisition and insurance expenses increased approximately million for the year ended december  as compared to due to our consolidation with professionals group 
the underwriting expense ratio also increased to for as compared to for the increase in the ratio is primarily due to an increase in guaranty fund assessments 
the remaining increase is due to normal fluctuations in acquisition expenses between years 
guaranty fund assessments for the year ended december  were million 
there were no significant guaranty fund charges in we are required by most states to be a member of the state s insolvency or guaranty fund association and  as such  we must make payments to the association when so assessed by the state 
personal lines segment our personal lines segment is comprised of the operations of a single insurance company  meemic insurance company  acquired on june  operating results for our personal lines segment for the six months ended december  are summarized in the table below

at december   the average yield of our personal lines segment fixed maturity investments was 
net realized investment gains losses are insignificant during the six months ended december  underwriting  acquisition and insurance expenses underwriting  acquisition and insurance expenses related to our personal lines segment were million for the period ended december   consisting of normal  recurring expenses such as commissions  salaries and other expenses 
the underwriting expense ratio was for the six months ended december  no guaranty fund assessments were included in underwriting  acquisition and insurance expenses in item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk s we believe that we are principally exposed to three types of market risk related to our investment operations 
these risks are interest rate risk  credit risk and equity price risk 
the term market risk refers to the risk of loss arising from adverse changes in market rates and prices  such as interest rates  equity prices and foreign currency exchange rates 
all market sensitive instruments discussed here relate to our investment assets which are classified as available for sale 
as of december   our fair value investment in fixed income securities was  million 
these securities are subject primarily to interest rate risk and credit risk 
we have not and currently do not intend to enter into derivative transactions 
interest rate risk our fixed maturities portfolio is exposed to interest rate risk 
fluctuations in interest rates have a direct impact on the market valuation of these securities 
as interest rates rise  market values of fixed income portfolios fall and vice versa 
we believe we are in a position to keep our fixed income investments until maturity as we do not invest in fixed maturity securities for trading purposes 
portfolio change in modified interest value value duration rates millions millions years basis point rise  basis point rise  current rate  basis point decline  basis point decline  current rates are as of december  at december   the fair value of our investment in preferred stocks was million  including net unrealized gains of million 
preferred stocks are primarily subject to interest rate risk because they bear a fixed rate of return 
the investments in the above table do not include preferred stocks 
computations of prospective effects of hypothetical interest rate changes are based on numerous assumptions  including the maintenance of the existing level and composition of fixed income security assets  and should not be relied on as indicative of future results 
certain shortcomings are inherent in the method of analysis presented in the computation of the fair value of fixed rate instruments 
actual values may differ from those projections presented should market conditions vary from assumptions used in the calculation of the fair value of individual securities  including non parallel shifts in the term structure of interest rates and changing individual issuer credit spreads 
credit risk we have exposure to credit risk primarily as a holder of fixed income securities 
we control this exposure by emphasizing investment grade credit quality in the fixed income securities we purchase 
as of december   of our fixed income portfolio consisted of securities rated investment grade 
we believe that this concentration in investment grade securities reduces our exposure to credit risk in these fixed income investments to an acceptable level 
however  in the current environment even investment grade securities can rapidly deteriorate and result in significant losses 
equity price risk at december  the fair value of our investment in common stocks  excluding preferred stocks as discussed in the preceding paragraphs  was million  which included net unrealized gains of million 
these securities are subject to equity price risk  which is defined as the potential for loss in market value due to a decline in equity prices 
a hypothetical increase in the market prices as of december  would increase the fair value of these securities to million  a hypothetical decrease in the price of each of these marketable securities would reduce the fair value to million 
the selected hypothetical change does not reflect what could be considered the best or worst scenarios 
proassurance s cash and short term investment portfolio at december  was on a cost basis which approximates its fair value 
this portfolio lacks significant market rate sensitivity due to its short duration
