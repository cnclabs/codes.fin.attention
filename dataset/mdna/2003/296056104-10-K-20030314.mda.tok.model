the company maintains a reserve to absorb probable losses relating to bad debts arising from uncollectible accounts receivable 
the allowance for doubtful accounts is maintained at a level the company considers to be adequate to absorb probable bad debts inherent in the accounts receivable balance and is based on ongoing assessments and evaluations of the collectibility  historical loss experience of accounts receivable and the financial status of customers with accounts receivable balances 
bad debts are charged and recoveries are credited to the reserve 
provision for bad debts are based on the company s review of the historical loss experience and such factors  which in management s judgment  deserve consideration under existing economic conditions in estimating probable losses

the estimate for the allowance for doubtful accounts is a critical accounting estimate for both segments

the company has not substantively changed any aspect to its overall approach in the determination of the allowance for bad debts 
there have been no material changes in assumptions or estimation techniques as compared to prior periods that impacted the determination of the current period allowance
