the decline in us  canadian  and international rig activity  which began in the fourth quarter of  continued in the first half of and rig activity remained relatively low throughout compared to recent years 
us  canadian  and international rig activity declined   and for the full year in compared to on a combined basis  worldwide rig activity declined in compared to the prior year average 
in addition  north america workover rig activity was down in however  oil prices rose sharply in the second half  resulting in an average price per barrel of west texas intermediate crude of  an increase of over the average for natural gas prices were down in compared to  but recorded the strongest quarterly average prices in the fourth quarter of since the second quarter of management believes these contradictory trends of strong commodity prices but weak drilling and workover activity are due to customer concerns and uncertainty about the recovery of the us and world economy and related demand for energy 
rig activity has remained weak due to questions about the sustainability of future oil and gas prices 
in addition  oil prices may be reflecting a premium due to the risk of supply disruption due to the war in iraq 
the company s total revenue was  million in  an increase of million over revenue of  million 
the increase was due to a million increase in drilling equipment revenue related to several large drilling equipment packages being shipped in and the estimated incremental impact on revenue approximately million related to and acquisitions 
the decline in rig activity had an adverse effect on the company s services business revenue in compared to excluding the estimated impact from acquisitions  tubular services and drilling services revenue was down approximately million and million in compared to in addition  the company s coiled tubing and wireline business was also negatively impacted by the decline as non acquisition related revenue was down approximately million in compared to the company has executed acquisitions over the past few years as part of its growth strategy 
the company seeks  where possible  to effect consolidation cost savings by integrating acquired businesses with its own 
as a consequence  the financial results of acquired businesses may not be separable from the company s existing businesses  and therefore may not be readily measurable 
accordingly  the impact of acquisitions on the company s overall financial results are difficult to measure 
where the company provides estimates of incremental revenue and operating profit from acquired businesses  these estimates are based upon management s judgment

us rig activity at february  was at rigs drilling  an increase of from the december  activity of rigs 
the company believes that current industry projections are forecasting us drilling rig activity to continue to be up slightly in the first half of compared to the second half of in addition  rig activity is expected to be up in both canada and internationally 
numerous events could significantly alter these projections including the war in iraq  the acceleration or deceleration of the recovery of the us and world economies  a build up in world oil inventory levels  or numerous other events or circumstances 
results of operations year ended december  vs year ended december  revenue 
revenue for the year ended december  was  million  an increase of million  or  from revenue of  million for the year ended december  the increase in revenue was primarily due to acquisitions completed in and  and the shipment of several large drilling equipment packages in the following table summarizes the company s revenue by operating segment in   and in thousands drilling equipment sales tubular services drilling services coiled tubing wireline products total revenue revenue from the company s drilling equipment sales in was million  an increase of million compared to the increase was due to the shipment of several major rig projects totaling million in compared to million for major projects in due to these major projects and to the shipment of other units  the company shipped a record number of top drives in compared to top drives in in addition  revenue was up approximately million due to the company s september acquisition of morinoak international limited group mil  a manufacturer of derricks  substructures and other structural drilling rig components

management believes that acquisitions completed in and december contributed approximately million of the increase 
in addition  the shipment of approximately million of major product shipment in contributed further to the increase 
additional increases are discussed in further detail below by product line 
revenue from the company s drilling equipment sales in was million  an increase of million compared to this increase was due primarily to the shipment of several large orders placed in the results included million of revenue related to the projects for maersk hyundai heavy industries

in addition  the company benefited from strong markets and revenue growth in latin america up million and the eastern hemisphere up million 
also  the company s instrumentation business increased primarily due to two acquisitions in canada in coiled tubing and wireline products revenue was million in  an increase of million over results 
the increase was mainly due to the acquisitions of four coiled tubing and wireline products companies and greater sales of coiled tubing units and pressure control equipment 
the acquisitions included quality tubing january  bradon industries ltd 
march  albin s enterprises  inc may  and elmar services ltd 
august 
management estimates that these four acquisitions contributed approximately million of revenue in with quality tubing contributing approximately million of revenue in the remaining million increase was due primarily to greater sales of coiled tubing units and pressure control equipment in compared to backlog for this segment was at million at december  compared to million at december   a decline of and an additional indication of the recent decline in the market 
gross profit 
gross profit was million of revenue in compared to million of revenue in the increase in gross profit dollars was due to the greater revenue in discussed above 
the increase in gross profit percentages was due to strong operating leverage in tubular services  drilling services  and coiled tubing and wireline products 
these strong operating leverages more than offset lower margins from the drilling equipment sales group which was caused by higher engineering costs on certain large sales of drilling equipment units in selling  general  and administrative costs 
selling  general  and administrative costs were million in  an increase of million over costs of million 
approximately million of the increase was due to the acquisitions completed in and two acquisitions in december the remaining million increase was due primarily to the non acquisition related growth in revenue in over as a percent of revenue  selling  general  and administrative costs were of revenue in compared to of revenue in research and engineering costs 
research and engineering costs was million in  an increase of million compared to results 
management estimates that the acquisitions completed in and two acquisitions completed in december represented million of the increase

for the fiscal year ended december   cash provided by operating activities was million compared to million for cash was provided by operations primarily through net income of million plus non cash charges of million 
in addition  cash was provided by a decrease in accounts receivable of million and prepaid expenses of million 
these items were offset by an increase in inventory of million  a decrease in accounts payable and accrued liabilities of million and a decrease in income taxes payable of million 
the decrease in accounts receivable was due to an improvement in the collection of outstanding receivables as days sales outstanding declined from days at december  to days at december  in addition  fourth quarter revenue was million compared to million in the fourth quarter of the increase in inventory was primarily in the drilling equipment operations and was related to a management decision to maintain greater stock inventory levels of spare parts inventory for drilling equipment customers in order to reduce cycle times 
the decrease in accounts payable and accrued liabilities was due to lower customer deposits at december  than december  and lower payables associated with services operations in the fourth quarter of compared to the fourth quarter of the decrease in income taxes payable was due to less pre tax income in the fourth quarter of than the fourth quarter of  and cash tax payments 
for the fiscal year ended december   cash used for investing activities was million compared to for the same period of the company used approximately million of cash for seven acquisitions during see note of notes to the consolidated financial statements

commitment fees range from to depending on the company rating 
at december   there was million of funds available under the revolving credit facility and million of funds available under the bilateral letter of credit facility  with million and million being used for letters of credit  respectively 
the company believes that its december  cash and cash equivalents  its outstanding credit facility  and cash flow from operations will be sufficient to meet its capital expenditures and its operating cash needs for the foreseeable future 
a summary of the company s outstanding contractual obligations at december  is as follows in thousands payments due by period total less than year years years after years total debt operating leases total contractual obligations standby letters of credit critical accounting policies and estimates in preparing the financial statements  we make assumptions  estimates and judgments that affect the amounts reported 
we periodically evaluate our estimates and judgments related to bad debts and inventory obsolescence  impairments of long lived assets  including goodwill and our reserves for product warranty claims 
note to the consolidated financial statements contains the accounting policies governing each of these matters 
our estimates are based on historical experience and on our future expectations that we believe are reasonable  the combination of these factors forms the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results are likely to differ from our current estimates and those differences may be material 
reserves for bad debts are determined on a specific identification basis when we believe that the required payment of specific amounts owed to us is not probable 
a substantial portion of the company s revenues come from international oil companies  international oilfield service companies  and government owned or government controlled oil companies 
therefore  the company has significant receivables in many foreign jurisdictions 
if worldwide oil and gas drilling activity or changes in economic conditions in foreign jurisdictions deteriorate  our customers may be unable to repay these receivables  and additional allowances could be required 
reserves for inventory obsolescence are determined based on our historical usage of inventory on hand as well as our future expectations related to requirements to provide spare parts for our substantial installed base and new products 
changes in worldwide oil and gas drilling activity and the development of new technologies associated with the drilling industry could require the company to record additional allowances to reduce the value of inventory to the lower of its cost or net realizable value 
accruals for warranty claims are provided based on historical experience at the time of sale 
product warranties generally cover periods from one to three years 
our accruals for warranty claims are affected by the size of our installed base of products currently under warranty  as well as new products delivered to the market 
if actual experience proves different from historical estimates  changes to the company s provision rates may be required 
long lived assets  which include property and equipment  goodwill  and identified intangible assets comprise a significant amount of the company s total assets 
the company makes judgments and estimates in conjunction with the carrying value of these assets  including amounts to be capitalized  depreciation and amortization methods and useful lives 
additionally  the carrying values of these assets are reviewed for impairment periodically or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amounts may not be recoverable 
an impairment loss is recorded in the period in which it is determined that the carrying amount is not recoverable 
this requires the company to make long term forecasts of its future revenues and costs related to the assets subject to review 
these forecasts require assumptions about demand for the company s products and services  future market conditions and technological developments 
significant and unanticipated changes to these assumptions or the intended use of these assets could require a provision for impairment in a future period 
factors affecting future operating results this annual report contains forward looking statements within the meaning of section a of the securities act of and section e of the securities exchange act of the forward looking statements are those that do not state historical facts and are inherently subject to risk and uncertainties 
the forward looking statements contained herein are based on current expectations and entail various risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those projected in the forward looking statements 
such risks and uncertainties are set forth below 
the oil and gas industry in which the company participates historically has experienced significant volatility 
demand for the company s services and products depends primarily upon the number of oil and gas wells being drilled  the depth and drilling conditions of such wells  the volume of production  the number of well completions  the capital expenditures of other oilfield service companies and drilling contractors  the level of pipeline construction and maintenance expenditures  and the level of workover activity 
drilling and workover activity can fluctuate significantly in a short period of time  particularly in the united states and canada 
the willingness of oil and gas operators to make capital expenditures for the exploration and production of oil and natural gas will continue to be influenced by numerous factors over which the company has no control  including the prevailing and expected market prices for oil and natural gas 
such prices are impacted by  among other factors  the ability of the members of the organization of petroleum exporting countries opec to maintain price stability through voluntary production limits  the level of production of non opec countries  worldwide demand for oil and gas  general economic and political conditions  costs of exploration and production  availability of new leases and concessions  and governmental regulations regarding  among other things  environmental protection  taxation  price controls and product allocations 
in addition  the war in iraq may have an impact on market prices for oil and natural gas 
no assurance can be given as to the level of future oil and gas industry activity or demand for the company s services and products 
the company s foreign operations  which include significant operations in canada  europe  the far east  the middle east and latin america  are subject to the risks normally associated with conducting business in foreign countries  including uncertain political and economic environments  which may limit or disrupt markets  restrict the movement of funds or result in the deprivation of contract rights or the taking of property without fair compensation 
government owned petroleum companies located in some of the countries in which the company operates have adopted policies or are subject to governmental policies giving preference to the purchase of goods and services from companies that are majority owned by local nationals 
as a result of such policies  the company relies on joint ventures  license arrangements and other business combinations with local nationals in these countries 
in addition  political considerations may disrupt the commercial relationship between the company and such government owned petroleum companies 
although the company has from time to time experienced problems arising from political instability  nationalistic policies  economic instability or currency restrictions  such problems have not been material to the company s financial results 
however  there can be no assurances that such problems will not be material in the future  including as a result of the war in iraq and political instability in venezuela 
the company s solids control  inspection and coating services routinely involve the handling of waste materials  some of which may be considered to be hazardous wastes 
the company is subject to numerous local  state and federal laws and regulations concerning the containment and disposal of materials  pursuant to which the company has been required to incur compliance and clean up costs  which were not substantial in   and compliance with environmental laws and regulations due to currently unknown circumstances or developments  however  could result in substantial costs and have a material adverse effect on the company s results of operations and financial condition 
a significant portion of the company s recent growth in revenues and profitability has been the result of its aggressive acquisition program 
the company s future operating results will be impacted by the company s ability to identify additional attractive acquisition opportunities  consummate such acquisitions on favorable terms and successfully integrate the operations of the acquired businesses with those of the company 
item a 
quantitative qualitative disclosure about market risk the company does not believe it has a material exposure to capital market risk 
the company has historically managed its exposure to interest changes by using a combination of fixed rate debt  variable rate debt  and  occasionally  interest rate swap and collar agreements in its total debt portfolio 
as of december   the company had no interest rate swap or collar agreements outstanding 
at december   the company had million of outstanding debt 
fixed rate debt included million of senior notes at a fixed rate of  million of senior notes at a fixed interest rate of  and million of senior notes at a fixed interest rate of 
with respect to foreign currency fluctuations  the company primarily uses natural hedges to minimize the effect of rate fluctuations 
when natural hedges are not sufficient  generally it is the company s policy to enter into forward foreign exchange contracts to hedge significant transactions for periods consistent with the underlying risk 
the company had no forward foreign exchange contracts outstanding at december  the company does not enter into foreign currency or interest rate transactions for speculative purposes 
because the company operates in virtually every oil and gas exploration and production region in the world  it conducts a portion of its business in currencies other than the us dollar 
the functional currency for some of the company s international operations is the applicable local currency 
although some of the company s international revenues are denominated in the local currency  the effects of foreign currency fluctuations are partly mitigated because local expenses of such foreign operations are also generally denominated in the same currency 
during the years ended december    and the company reported foreign currency losses gains of   and  respectively 
the losses were primarily due to exchange rate fluctuations related to receivable and payable balances denominated in currencies other than the functional currency 
assets and liabilities of those foreign subsidiaries are translated using the exchange rates in effect at the balance sheet date  resulting in translation adjustments that are reflected in accumulated other comprehensive loss in the common stockholders equity section of the company s balance sheet 
the company recorded currency translation losses of   and  during the years ended december    and related to these translations
