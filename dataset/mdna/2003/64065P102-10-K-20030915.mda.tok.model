introduction the company provides software  services and solutions to enable appliance computing  a proven internet based computing architecture targeted at business customers that is designed to be easier to manage and more cost effective than traditional pc based computing 
the company s software and management tools secure  power and manage a new generation of smart thin client appliances that utilize the benefits of open  industry standard technologies to create new alternatives to full function personal computers used in business and proprietary business devices including green screen terminals 
the company s software runs on thin client appliances and personal computers  and enables these devices to be secured and centrally managed  as well as to connect to mainframes  midrange  unix  linux and legacy systems 
the company generates revenues from sales of its eon  capio  thinstar and voyager thin client appliances  as well as its thinpc thin client software for pcs  teemtalk host access software for pcs and unix workstations  ezremote manager central management software  and services such as training and integration 
results of operations the following table sets forth  for the periods indicated  certain items from the company s consolidated statements of operations as a percentage of net revenues 
year ended june  gross profit operating expenses sales and marketing research and development general and administrative acquisition costs operating income loss loss on investment interest income  net income loss before taxes income taxes net income loss year ended june  compared to year ended june  for the year ended june   net revenues increased by  or  to  from  for the prior fiscal year 
the increase in net revenues was primarily attributable to an increase in sales of the company s thin client appliance products sold as a result of the increasing acceptance in the marketplace of thin client technology and the company s increased access to customers as a result of its greater market share  its alliance with ibm  and its larger sales organization 
this is an emerging market gaining mainstream acceptance and has grown in particular in a number of vertical markets such as retail  healthcare  transportation  hospitality  education  state and local governments and others 
in addition  as discussed below  the company significantly increased its investment in sales and marketing activities during the current fiscal year compared to the prior fiscal year  which also contributed to the increase in net revenues 
the company s gross profit as a percentage of net revenues increased to for the year ended june   from for the prior fiscal year 
the increase in gross profit is attributable primarily to lower component and license costs and secondarily to increased software sales and the spreading of fixed overhead costs over a larger revenue base 
operating expenses for the year ended june  were  an increase of  or  from operating expenses of  for the prior fiscal year 
as a percentage of revenues  total operating expenses declined to from in the prior fiscal year 
sales and marketing expenses increased by  or  to  for the year ended june  compared to  for the prior fiscal year 
the increase is primarily attributable to personnel additions to sales  marketing and business development staffing and it is anticipated that such costs will continue to increase as the company grows 
as a percentage of revenues  sales and marketing expenses declined to from in the prior fiscal year 
research and development expenses for the year ended june  increased by  or  to  from  in the prior fiscal year primarily due to increased staffing of professionals dedicated to research and development activities 
the company is committed to investing in research and development in order to continue to develop new products and enhance existing products and it is anticipated that such expenses will continue to increase as the company continues to grow 
as a percentage of revenues  research and development expenses declined to from in the prior fiscal year 
general and administrative expenses for the year ended june  increased by  or  to  from  for the prior fiscal year primarily due to increased staffing 
during the year ended june   the company hired a chief operating officer and other management and administrative personnel to support the company s continued growth in fiscal and it is anticipated that such expenses will continue to increase as the company continues to grow 
as a percentage of revenues  general and administrative expenses declined to from 
during the year ended june   the company wrote down its investment of  in the marketable equity securities of boundless corporation to zero as a result of the bankruptcy filing by boundless in march the company realized net interest income of  for the year ended june  compared to net interest income of  for the prior fiscal year 
the increase was due to the higher levels of cash invested during the current year primarily as a result of cash provided from operations and the private placement  offset partially by a decrease in interest rates 
for the year ended june   the company recorded a provision for income taxes of  compared to an income tax benefit of  in the prior year  which reflected the reversal of a previously recorded valuation allowance against deferred income tax assets 
this reversal was the result of the company s sustained history of operating profitability and future prospects of continued profitability 
the company expects its effective income tax rate going forward will be approximately 
for the year ended june   the company generated net income of  as compared to  for the prior fiscal year 
the improvement in performance is primarily attributable to higher revenues  higher gross profit margin and lower operating expenses as a percentage of revenues  offset by the effect of the variance in the income tax provision benefit described in the preceding paragraph resulting from the reversal of a previously recorded valuation allowance against deferred income tax assets in fiscal year ended june  compared to year ended june  for the year ended june   net revenues increased by  or to  from  for the prior fiscal year 
the increase in net revenues was attributable to increased sales of the company s thin client appliance products  net revenues attributable to activ e solutions operations acquired on december   which amounted to  net revenues generated from the thinstar thin client business acquired from ncd on march  which amounted to  and net revenues generated from the ibm alliance which was entered into on january  which amounted to approximately  the increase in sales of thin client appliance products is attributable to the increasing acceptance in the marketplace of thin client technology and the company s increased access to customers as a result of its greater market share  its alliance with ibm  and its larger sales organization 
this is an emerging market gaining mainstream acceptance and has grown in particular in a number of vertical markets such as retail  healthcare  transportation  hospitality  education  state and local governments and others 
in addition  as discussed below  the company significantly increased its investment in sales and marketing activities during the current and prior fiscal year which also contributed to the increase in net revenues 
the company s gross profit as a percentage of net revenues increased to for the year ended june   from for the prior fiscal year 
the increase in gross profit is attributable primarily to reduced component and license costs and secondarily to the spreading of fixed overhead costs over a larger revenue base 
operating expenses for the year ended june  were  an increase of  or from operating expenses of  for the prior fiscal year 
as a percentage of revenues  total operating expenses declined to from in the prior fiscal year 
sales and marketing expenses increased by  or  to  for the year ended june  compared to  for the prior fiscal year 
the increase is primarily attributable to personnel additions to sales  marketing and business development staffing  and it is anticipated that such costs will continue to increase as the company grows 
as a percentage of revenues  sales and marketing expenses increased to from in the prior fiscal year 
research and development expenses for the year ended june  increased by  or  to  from  in the prior fiscal year primarily due to increases in staffing of professionals dedicated to research and development activities 
the company is committed to investing in research and development in order to continue to develop new products and enhance existing products  and it is anticipated that such expenses will continue to increase as the company continues to grow 
as a percentage of revenues  research and development expenses decreased to from in the prior fiscal year 
general and administrative expenses for the year ended june  increased by  or  to  from  for the prior fiscal year primarily due to increased staffing and personnel costs  and it is anticipated that such expenses will continue to increase as the company continues to grow 
as a percentage of revenues  general and administrative expenses decreased to from in the prior fiscal year 
during the year ended june   the company incurred costs of  in connection with proposed acquisitions and or strategic relationships that were not consummated 
the company realized net interest income of  for the year ended june  compared to net interest income of  for the prior fiscal year 
the decrease was due to lower interest rates and a reduction in the amount of cash available for investment due to the capio  activ e and thinstar acquisitions 
for the year ended june   the company recorded a net income tax benefit of  which reflects the reversal of a previously recorded valuation allowance against deferred income tax assets 
this reversal is the result of the company s recent sustained history of operating profitability and future prospects of continued profitability 
the effective income tax rate for the year ended june  was zero since no income tax benefit was recognized as a result of the net operating losses incurred as there was no assurance at that time that the benefit of the net operating loss carryforward would be realized 
for the year ended june   the company generated net income of  as compared to a net loss of  for the prior fiscal year 
the improvement in performance is primarily attributable to higher revenues  higher gross profit margin and the net income tax benefit  offset by increased operating expenses 
liquidity and capital resources as of june   the company had net working capital of  composed primarily of cash and cash equivalents  short term investments and accounts receivable 
the company s principal sources of liquidity include  of cash and cash equivalents  short term investments and a  line of credit facility with wachovia bank  formerly first union national bank  of which  was available as of june  the company had no borrowings under the line of credit during the year ended june  cash and cash equivalents and short term investments increased by  during the year ended june   primarily as a result of positive cash flow from operations  and proceeds received from the exercise of stock options and warrants 
the company generated cash from operating activities of  in fiscal compared to using cash in operations of  during fiscal the increase in cash provided by operations during fiscal over cash used in operations in fiscal was primarily due to the increase in net income in fiscal  over fiscal  and a smaller increase in accounts receivable in fiscal  compared to fiscal 
the increase in accounts receivable in fiscal is primarily a result of the increase in revenues of  for the quarter ended june  compared to the quarter ended june  deferred taxes and current deductions from the exercise of stock options resulted in reduced income taxes payable of  in fiscal the increase in accounts payable and accrued expenses for fiscal compared to fiscal is primarily attributable to the growth of the company s business 
cash flow from operations can vary significantly from quarter to quarter depending on the timing of payments from  and shipments to  large customers 
during fiscal  net cash of  was used in investing activities for purchases of short term investments  and property and equipment  compared to net cash used in investing activities of  in fiscal  which was primarily for the acquisitions of the activ e solutions and the thinstar product line 
during fiscal  net cash of  was provided by financing activities primarily from the exercise of stock options and warrants compared to net cash generated by investing activities of  during fiscal primarily as a result of the proceeds from a private placement of the company s common stock 
the company expects to fund current operations and other cash expenditures through the use of available cash  cash from operations  funds available under its credit facility and possible new debt or equity sources 
management believes that there will be sufficient funds from current cash  operations and available financing to fund operations and cash expenditures for the foreseeable future 
during july  the company acquired from pericom holdings plc its host access software business for approximately  in cash and completed a private placement of its common stock which resulted in net proceeds to the company of approximately  contractual cash obligations the following table summarizes the company s contractual obligations as of june payments due by period total after contractual cash obligations operating leases     capital leases     purchase commitments   total     inflation the company believes that inflation has not had a material effect on its costs and net revenues during the past three years 
off balance sheet arrangements none critical accounting policies the company has identified the following policies as critical to its business and the understanding of its results of operations 
application of these policies affects many of the items discussed throughout management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
for a detailed discussion on the application of these and other accounting policies see note in the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
preparation of this annual report on form k requires the company s use of estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements  and the reported revenue and expense amounts for the periods being reported 
there can be no assurance that the company s actual results will not differ from these estimates 
revenue recognition the company s revenue recognition policy is significant as revenue is a key component of results of operations 
the timing of revenues also affects the timing of various expenses  such as commission and royalty expenses 
the company recognizes revenues in accordance with statement of position no 
 software revenue recognition  issued by the american institute of certified public accountants because software has been deemed to be essential to the functionality of the hardware 
generally  the company recognizes revenue upon shipment of products 
revenue related to post contract services on such shipments is recognized with the initial sale when the fee is included with the initial license fee  post contract services are for one year or less  the cost of providing such services is not significant and unspecified upgrades enhancements offered have historically been and are expected to be minimal and infrequent 
revenue from service obligations associated with service contracts is generally recognized ratably over the service period 
from time to time  customers request delayed shipment  usually because of customer scheduling for systems integration and lack of storage space at a customer s facility during the implementation 
in such bill and hold transactions  the company recognizes revenues when the following conditions are met the equipment is complete  ready for shipment and segregated from other inventory  the company has no further performance obligations in connection with the completion of the transaction  the commitment and delivery schedule is fixed  the customer requested the transaction be completed on this basis  and the risks of ownership have passed to the customer 
the company records a provision for estimated sales returns and allowances in the same period that related revenues are recorded 
these estimates are based on historical sales returns  analysis of credit memo data and other known factors 
if the historical data used to calculate these estimates do not properly reflect future returns  additional provisions could be required which would adversely affect revenues reported in future periods 
the company s agreements with customers typically do not provide for product returns except for very limited circumstances  including certain distributors that have stock rotation rights which are contractually limited to a maximum amount per quarter and require a corresponding order of equal or greater value at the time of the stock rotation 
the impact of product returns has not historically been a significant factor in the company s results of operations 
accounts receivable the company sells products and services to a large number of customers in various industries worldwide 
trade accounts receivable are exposed to normal credit risks and the company provides for potential bad debts based upon the results of management s review of all significant outstanding invoices and the age of all of its receivables 
the company also performs ongoing credit reviews of payment performance and financial condition of its customers 
if the judgments made as a result of this review are inaccurate  additional provisions for potential bad debts may be required which would adversely affect the results of operations of future periods 
inventories inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market  with cost determined on a first in first out fifo basis 
inventories on hand include the cost of materials  freight  direct labor and other manufacturing overhead 
the company regularly reviews its inventories on hand and records any provisions needed for excess and obsolete inventories based on forecasted demand  new product rollouts and production requirements 
in making these judgments  the company relies on historical sales data and on projected sales and new product introduction forecasts 
if these estimates do not properly reflect future results  provisions for excess and obsolete inventories could be required in future periods 
income taxes the company records the estimated future tax effects of temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities and amounts reported in the accompanying balance sheets  as well as operating loss and tax credit carryforwards 
the company exercises judgment relating to projected future taxable income to determine the recoverability of any deferred tax assets recorded on the balance sheet 
if judgments regarding recoverability of deferred tax assets are not accurate  the company could be required to record additional income tax expense in future periods 
asset impairment at june   goodwill and intangible assets amount to  goodwill and non amortizable intangible assets are assessed for impairment pursuant to sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  and impairment of other amortizable intangible amortizable assets is assessed pursuant to sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
the company operates in one reporting unit and is required to perform the sfas no 
impairment test at least annually or more frequently if circumstances indicate possible impairment 
as of june   management believes there has been no impairment under sfas no 
and no triggering events that would require an impairment analysis under sfas no 
an adverse change in the business could result in an impairment charge 
factors affecting the company and future operating results our future results may be affected by industry trends and specific risks in our business 
some of the factors that could materially affect our future results include those described below 
we experienced significant growth in our business in the past two years due to internal expansion and business acquisitions  and if we do not appropriately manage this growth and any future growth  including the integration of our newly hired employees and executive officers  our business will suffer 
our business has grown during the past two years through both internal expansion and business acquisitions  and has put pressure on our infrastructure  internal systems and managerial resources 
the number of our employees increased from employees at june  to employees at july  our new employees include a number of senior executive officers and other key managerial  technical  sales and marketing personnel 
to manage our growth effectively  we must continue to improve and expand our infrastructure  including operating and administrative systems and controls  and continue managing and integrating our personnel in an efficient manner 
our business may be adversely affected if we do not integrate and train our new employees quickly and effectively and coordinate among our executive  engineering  finance  marketing  sales  operations and customer support organizations  all of which add to the complexity of our organization and increase our operating expenses  which may grow at a faster rate than our sales 
in addition  because of the growth of our foreign operations  we now have facilities located in multiple locations  and we have limited experience coordinating a geographically separated organization 
although we have generated operating profits for the past two years  we have a prior history of losses and may experience losses in the future  which could result in the market price of our common stock declining 
although we have generated operating profits in the past two years  we have incurred net losses in prior periods 
we expect to continue to incur significant operating expenses 
our operating expenses increased during the three months and year ended june  reflecting the hiring of additional key personnel as we continue to implement our growth strategy 
as a result  we will need to generate significant revenues to maintain profitability 
if we do not maintain profitability  the market price for our common stock may decline 
our financial resources may not be enough for our capital and corporate development needs  and we may not be able to obtain additional financing 
a failure to maintain and increase our revenues would likely cause us to incur losses and negatively impact the price of our common stock 
we may not be able to successfully integrate the acquisitions we have completed  the alliance we have entered into or future acquisitions we may complete as part of our growth strategy  which may materially adversely affect our growth and our operating results 
within the last two years  we have made four acquisitions and entered into an alliance with ibm  and we may make additional acquisitions as part of our growth strategy 
we have not yet fully integrated some of these acquisitions or fully implemented the alliance 
there is no assurance that we will successfully integrate these acquisitions into our business or successfully implement the alliance 
in addition  we may be unable to retain key employees or key business relationships of the acquired businesses and integration of the businesses may divert the attention and resources of our management 
we cannot assure that we will achieve anticipated revenue and earnings growth as a result of these transactions 
our failure to successfully integrate the acquired businesses into our operations or successfully implement the alliance could have a material adverse effect upon our business  operating results and financial condition 
even if the acquisitions and alliance are successfully integrated  we may not receive the expected benefits of the transactions if we find that the business or alliance does not further our business strategy or that we paid more than what the assets were worth 
managing acquisitions and alliances requires management resources  which may divert our attention from other business operations 
as a result  the effects of any completed or future transactions on financial results may differ from our expectations 
our ability to accurately forecast our quarterly sales is limited  although our costs are relatively fixed in the short term and we expect our business to be affected by rapid technological change  which may adversely affect our quarterly operating results 
because of the new and rapidly evolving market for our software and embedded windows and linux based thin client appliances  our ability to accurately forecast our quarterly sales is limited  which makes it difficult to predict the quarterly revenues that we will recognize 
in addition  most of our costs are for personnel and facilities  which are relatively fixed in the short term 
if we have a shortfall in revenues in relation to our expenses  we may be unable to reduce our expenses quickly enough to avoid losses 
as a result  our quarterly operating results could fluctuate 
we expect our quarterly revenues and operating results to fluctuate for a number of reasons 
future operating results will continue to be subject to quarterly fluctuations based on a wide variety of factors  including linearity our quarterly sales have historically reflected a pattern in which a disproportionate percentage of sales occur in the last month of the quarter 
this pattern makes prediction of revenues  earnings and working capital for each financial period especially difficult and uncertain and increases the risk of unanticipated variations in quarterly results and financial condition 
significant orders we are subject to variances in our quarterly operating results because of the fluctuations in the timing of our receipt of large orders 
if even a small number of large orders are delayed until after a quarter ends  our operating results could vary substantially from quarter to quarter and net income could be substantially less than expected 
conversely  if even a small number of large orders are pulled into a quarter from a future quarter  our revenues and net income could be substantially higher than expected  making it possible that sales and net income in future periods may decline sequentially 
there are factors that may affect the market acceptance of our products  some of which are beyond our control  including the following o the growth and changing requirements of the thin client appliance market  o the quality  price  performance and total cost of ownership of our products  o the availability  price  quality and performance of competing products and technologies  and o the successful development of our relationships with software providers  original equipment manufacturers and existing and potential channel partners 
we may not succeed in developing and marketing our software and thin client appliance products and our operating results may decline as a result 
our gross margins can vary significantly  based upon a variety of factors 
if we are unable to sustain adequate gross margins we may be unable to reduce operating expenses in the short term  resulting in losses 
our gross margins can vary significantly from quarter to quarter depending on average selling prices  fixed costs in relation to revenue levels and the mix of our business  including the percentage of revenues derived from hardware  software and consulting services 
the gross profit margin also varies in response to competitive market conditions as well as periodic fluctuations in the cost of memory and other significant components 
the market in which we compete remains very competitive  and although we intend to continue our efforts to reduce the cost of our products  there can be no certainty that we will not be required to reduce prices of our products without compensating reductions in the cost to produce our products in order to increase our market share or to meet competitors price reductions 
our business is dependent on customer adoption of windows and linux based thin client appliances to perform discrete tasks for corporate and internet based computer networks and a decrease in their rates of adoption could adversely affect our ability to increase our revenues 
we are dependent on the growing use of thin client appliances to perform discrete tasks for corporate and internet based networks to increase our revenues 
if the role of thin client appliances does not increase as we anticipate  or if it in any way decreases  our revenues would not materialize 
if corporate information technology organizations do not accept windows or linux based embedded operating systems  or if there is a wide acceptance of alternative operating systems that provide enhanced capabilities  our operating results could be harmed 
the thin client appliance market in which we compete is new and unpredictable  and if this market does not develop and expand as we anticipate  our revenues may not grow 
because some of our products use embedded versions of microsoft windows as their operating system  an inability to license these operating systems on favorable terms could impair our ability to introduce new products and maintain market share 
we may not be able to introduce new products on a timely basis because some of our products use embedded versions of microsoft windows as their operating system 
microsoft corporation provides windows to us  and we do not have access to the source code for certain versions of the windows operating system 
if microsoft fails to continue to enhance and develop its embedded operating systems  or if we are unable to license these operating systems on favorable terms  our operations may suffer 
because some of our products use linux as their operating system  the failure of linux developers to enhance and develop the linux kernel could impair our ability to release new products and maintain market share 
we may not be able to release new products on a timely basis because some of our products use linux as their operating system 
the heart of linux  the linux kernel  is maintained by third parties 
linus torvalds  the original developer of the linux kernel  and a small group of independent engineers are primarily responsible for the development and evolution of the linux kernel 
if this group of developers fails to further develop the linux kernel  we would have to either rely on another party to further develop the kernel or develop it ourselves 
to date  we have optimized our linux based operating system based on a version of red hat linux 
if we were unable to access red hat linux  we would be required to spend additional time to obtain a tested  recognized version of the linux kernel from another source or develop our own operating system internally  which could significantly increase our costs 
actions taken by the sco group sco could impact the sale of linux as an operating system  negatively affecting sales of some of our products 
sco has taken legal action against ibm and recently sent a letter to  linux customers alleging that certain linux kernels infringe on sco s unix intellectual property and other rights  and that sco intends to aggressively protect those rights 
while we are not a party to any legal proceeding with sco  since some of our products use linux as their operating system  sco s allegations  regardless of merit  could adversely affect sales of such products 
because we depend on sole source  limited source and foreign source suppliers for key components in our thin client appliance products  we are susceptible to supply shortages that could prevent us from shipping customer orders on time  if at all  and result in lost sales 
we depend upon single source suppliers for our thin client appliance products and for several of the components in them 
we also depend on limited sources to supply several other industry standard components 
we also rely on foreign suppliers which subject us to risks associated with foreign operations such as the imposition of unfavorable governmental controls or other trade restrictions  changes in tariffs  political instability and currency fluctuations 
a weakening dollar could result in greater costs to us for our components 
we have in the past experienced and may in the future experience shortages of  or difficulties in acquiring  these components 
a significant portion of our revenues is derived from the sale of thin client appliances that are bundled with our software 
third parties produce these thin client appliances for us 
if we experience shortages of these products  or of their components  we may not be able to deliver our products to our customers  and our revenues would decline 
if we are unable to continue generating substantial revenues from international sales our business could be adversely affected 
currently  approximately percent of our revenues are derived from international sales 
our ability to sell our products internationally is subject to a number of risks 
general economic and political conditions in each country could adversely affect demand for our products and services in these markets 
currency exchange rate fluctuations could result in lower demand for our products or lower pricing resulting in reduced revenue and margins  as well as currency translation losses 
changes to and compliance with a variety of foreign laws and regulations may increase our cost of doing business in these jurisdictions 
trade protection measures and import and export licensing requirements subject us to additional regulation and may prevent us from shipping products to a particular market  and increase our operating costs 
because we rely on channel partners  including ibm  to sell our products  our revenues could be negatively impacted if our existing channel partners do not continue to purchase products from us 
we cannot be certain that we will be able to attract channel partners that market our products effectively or provide timely and cost effective customer support and service 
none of our current channel partners  including ibm  is obligated to continue selling our products nor to sell our new products 
we cannot be certain that any channel partner will continue to represent our products or that our channel partners will devote a sufficient amount of effort and resources to selling our products in their territories 
we need to expand our direct and indirect sales channels  and if we fail to do so  our growth could be limited 
if our channel partners were to discontinue sales of our products or reduce their sales efforts  it could adversely affect our operating results 
in addition  there can be no assurance as to the continued viability and financial condition of our channel partners  two of which have accounted for more than of our net sales 
as a result of our alliance with ibm  we rely on ibm for distribution of our products to ibm s customers 
if ibm were to discontinue sales of our products or reduce its sales efforts  it could adversely affect our operating results 
our business may suffer if it is alleged or found that we have infringed the intellectual property rights of others 
although we have not received any claims that our products infringe on the proprietary rights of third parties  if we were to receive such claims in the future  responding to such claims  regardless of their merit  could be time consuming  result in costly litigation  divert management s attention and resources and cause us to incur significant expenses 
there is no assurance  in the event of such claims  that we would be able to enter into a licensing arrangement on acceptable terms or that litigation would not occur 
in the event that there were a temporary or permanent injunction entered prohibiting us from marketing or selling certain of our products  or a successful claim of infringement against us requiring us to pay royalties to a third party  and we failed to develop or license a substitute technology  our business  results of operations or financial condition could be materially adversely affected 
we may not be able to effectively compete against pc and thin client providers as a result of their greater financial resources and brand awareness 
in the market for thin client appliances  we face significant competition from makers of personal computers  as well as larger companies that have greater name recognition than we have 
increased competition may negatively affect our business and future operating results by leading to price reductions  higher selling expenses or a reduction in our market share 
our future competitive performance depends on a number of factors  including our ability to o continually develop and introduce new products and services with better prices and performance than offered by our competitors  o offer a wide range of products  and o offer high quality products and services 
if we are unable to offer products and services that compete successfully with the products and services offered by our competitors  including pc manufacturers  our business and our operating results would be harmed 
in addition  if in responding to competitive pressures  we are forced to lower the prices of our products and services and we are unable to reduce our costs  our business and operating results would be harmed 
thin client appliance products are subject to rapid technological change due to changing operating system software and network hardware and software configurations  and our products could be rendered obsolete by new technologies 
the thin client appliance market segment of the pc market  is characterized by rapid technological change  frequent new product introductions  uncertain product life cycles  changes in customer demands and evolving industry standards 
our products could be rendered obsolete if products based on new technologies are introduced or new industry standards emerge 
we may not be able to preserve the value of our products intellectual property because we do not have any patents and other vendors could challenge our other intellectual property rights 
our products will be differentiated from those of our competitors by our internally developed technology that is incorporated into our products 
if we are unable to protect our intellectual property  other vendors could sell products with features similar to ours  and this could reduce demand for our products  which would harm our operating results 
we may not be able to attract software developers to bundle their products with our thin client appliances 
our thin client appliances include our own software  plus software from other companies for specific markets 
if we are unable to attract software developers  and are unable to include their software in our products  we may not be able to offer our thin client appliances for certain important target markets  and our financial results will suffer 
in order to continue to grow our revenues  we may need to hire additional personnel 
in order to continue to develop and market our line of thin client appliances  we may need to hire additional personnel 
competition for employees is significant and we may experience difficulty in attracting suitably qualified people 
future growth that we may experience will place a significant strain on our management  systems and resources 
to manage the anticipated growth of our operations  we may be required to o improve existing and implement new operational  financial and management information controls  reporting systems and procedures  o hire  train and manage additional qualified personnel  and o establish relationships with additional suppliers and partners while maintaining our existing relationships 
we rely on the services of certain key personnel  and those persons knowledge of our business and technical expertise would be difficult to replace 
our products  technologies and operations are complex and we are substantially dependent upon the continued service of our existing personnel 
the loss of any of our key employees could adversely affect our business and profits and slow our product development processes 
errors in our products could harm our business and our operating results 
because our software and thin client appliance products are complex  they could contain errors or bugs that can be detected at any point in a product s life cycle 
although many of these errors may prove to be immaterial  any of these errors could be significant 
detection of any significant errors may result in o the loss of or delay in market acceptance and sales of our products  o diversion of development resources  o injury to our reputation  or o increased maintenance and warranty costs 
these problems could harm our business and future operating results 
occasionally  we have warranted that our products will operate in accordance with specified customer requirements 
if our products fail to conform to these specifications  customers could demand a refund for the purchase price or assert claims for damages 
moreover  because our products are used in connection with critical distributed computing systems services  we may receive significant liability claims if our products do not work properly 
our agreements with customers typically contain provisions intended to limit our exposure to liability claims 
however  these limitations may not preclude all potential claims 
liability claims could require us to spend significant time and money in litigation or to pay significant damages 
any such claims  whether or not successful  could seriously damage our reputation and our business 
if our contracts with citrix and other vendors of software applications were terminated  our it services business would be materially adversely affected 
we depend on third party suppliers to provide us with key software applications in connection with our it services business 
if such contracts and relationships were terminated  our revenues would be negatively affected 
our prior use of arthur andersen llp as our independent auditor may pose risks to us and limit our ability to seek potential recoveries from them related to their work 
our consolidated financial statements as of and for each of the three years in the period ended june  were audited by arthur andersen llp andersen 
on march   andersen was indicted on federal obstruction of justice charges arising from the government s investigation of enron corporation 
on june   a jury convicted andersen of these charges 
on july   we dismissed andersen and retained kpmg llp as our independent auditors for our fiscal year ended june  sec rules require us to present historical audited financial statements in various sec filings  such as registration statements  along with andersen s consent to our inclusion of its audit report in those filings 
since our former engagement partner and audit manager left andersen and in light of the cessation of andersen s sec practice  we will not be able to obtain the consent of andersen to the inclusion of its audit report in our relevant current and future filings 
the sec has provided regulatory relief designed to allow companies that file reports with the sec to dispense with the requirement to file a consent of andersen in certain circumstances  but purchasers of securities sold under our registration statements  which were not filed with the consent of andersen to the inclusion of its audit report  will not be able to sue andersen pursuant to section a of the securities act and  therefore  their right of recovery under that section may be limited as a result of the lack of our ability to obtain andersen s consent 
our stock price can be volatile

in addition  general macroeconomic and market conditions unrelated to our financial performance may also affect our stock price 
provisions in our charter documents and delaware law may delay or prevent acquisition of us  which could decrease the value of your shares 
our certificate of incorporation and bylaws and delaware law contain provisions that could make it harder for a third party to acquire us without the consent of our board of directors 
these provisions include advance notice procedures with respect to stockholder proposals and the nomination of candidates for election as directors 
delaware law also imposes some restrictions on mergers and other business combinations between us and any holder of or more of our outstanding common stock 
the issuance of additional equity securities may have a dilutive effect on our existing stockholders and could lead to a decline in the price of our common stock 
any additional sale of equity securities may have a dilutive effect on our existing stockholders 
in addition  the perceived risk associated with the possible sale of a large number of shares could cause some of our stockholders to sell their stock  thus causing the price of our stock to decline 
subsequent sales of our common stock in the open market or the private placement of our common stock or securities convertible into common stock could also have an adverse effect on the market price of the shares 
if our stock price declines  it may be more difficult or we may be unable to raise additional capital
