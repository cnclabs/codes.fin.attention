item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
part i item business introduction the principal business and operations of bei technologies technologies or the company are conducted within one business segment and are carried out by operations which design  manufacture and sell electronic devices that provide vital sensory input and actuation for the control systems of advanced machinery and automation systems 
sensors designed and manufactured by technologies  most of which are concerned with physical motion  provide information that is essential to logical  safe and efficient operation of sophisticated machinery 
technologies also develops and produces motors and actuators  which are the prime movers in high performance machinery 
the company s long term strategy is to provide  on a global basis  selected advanced intelligent motion control sensors  actuators and sensor based subsystems utilizing proprietary technologies 
management believes that intelligent sensory input to machine control systems and computers will be increasingly crucial to the productive functioning of a modern economy 
accordingly  technologies goal is to maintain  develop and acquire a diverse offering of advanced motion control sensor products  and manufacture and sell these with complementary products 
the company targets technology based markets for subsystems and end products in which its traditional sensors  micromachined sensors  motors and actuators play an enabling role 
the company s near term initiatives include a increase global penetration of the quartz yaw sensor for the automotive industry as described below  b leverage the advancements made to the gyrochip from automotive efforts into current opportunities for the aerospace and defense markets  c development and commercialization of other internally developed technologies that have broad industrial and commercial applications for motion control  rotation rate and position sensing  and d expand product lines through synergistic acquisitions and strategic relationships of complementary and value added technologies 
a key feature of the company s strategy is to be recognized worldwide as the most capable source for the sensor and actuator categories targeted by the company s product lines 
the company s traditional emphasis has been on producing highly engineered motion control components and assemblies 
the company believes it differentiates itself by offering a superior technology to solve a customer problem including innovative proprietary technology  b quality service  and c application engineering expertise in recommending and prescribing technical solutions for customers applications 
the company s strategy is to provide technical solutions and customer service that  together with the products themselves  create value and give the customer confidence that the products have been expertly prescribed and applied 
the company s products are not sold as commodities 
by way of more specific examples  the company s engineers regularly address the following machine control requirements of customers many automobiles now have computer controlled stability enhancement systems to assist drivers in maintaining control of the vehicle in slippery conditions or evasive maneuvers 
in some of these systems sensors instantly measure and report the presence of yaw and roll forces  which if excessive  could cause the vehicle to spin out  fishtail or roll over 
the automation system relies on these sensors to compare the driver s indicated direction with the actual result and can then take corrective action automatically 
to this end the company provides special gyrochip quartz sensors 
commercial and military aircraft utilize many sensors to help control movements of the aircraft s control surfaces as well as provide instrumentation readings to the pilot on the aircraft s heading and position 
the company s gyrochip sensors are engaged in sensing for yaw damping  back up attitude heading and reference instruments  and navigation instrumentation on many aircraft platforms 
advanced control systems in tractors  trucks  automobiles and construction equipment need position data in order to control implements on tractors  adjust engine speed and control steering and other automated functions on all such equipment and vehicles 
the company s potentiometers provide the necessary data for steering  throttle and seat position as well as for positioning tools 
table of contents on industrial or off road equipment 
semiconductor production equipment requires extremely fast yet accurate control of start move stop action on x y z positioners and tools 
the company s magnetic actuators provide the energizing force for such tasks 
an automated assembly line must control positioning and movement of handling of materials with speed and precision 
factory automation customers typically use optical encoders to control the movement and position of products in various operations of the manufacturing process 
during normal operation  an elevator system needs to know exactly where each car is is the car between floors or not are the doors open or closed 
in both the foregoing examples  the company s encoders measure speed  exact location or door position 
an antenna on a moving ship needs to be actively stabilized so that the antenna will continuously point at a satellite or another ship s pencil beam communication signal 
for such an application  the company can supply its proprietary gyrochip quartz rate sensor 
it can also supply motor encoders and actuators to drive the compensating action of such a system 
various medical systems require compact  high reliability  airflow and pressure regulation 
the company provides motors for blower assemblies and or magnetic actuators for fast acting pressure regulating valves 
a number of today s heavy equipment vehicles used in off road applications are utilizing drive by wire technologies 
a number of the company s sensors are utilized to provide the input for steering and throttle functions of these vehicles 
customers and markets the foregoing examples illustrate a few of the thousands of machine control situations for which products of the company are used 
customers who buy the company s products are makers and users of many different kinds of machinery and systems used in diverse markets and industries 
important market categories include transportation including cars  trucks  mass transit  construction and farm equipment  factory automation  process control  health care and scientific equipment  military  aviation  space and telecommunications applications 
the company considers its large number of customers and the scope of existing and potential applications for its products to be a source of the company s existing business strength and an opportunity for continued long term growth 
the company s brands have been well established in north america for many years and were distributed during the past fiscal year through technologies sales force to more than  different commercial customers  principally in the united states 
these customers include both end users and original equipment manufacturers 
the company ships of sales to commercial customers  with approximately to the automotive market and to other industrial markets 
the value of individual orders from industrial customers is typically less than  sales to the us government or prime contractors who manage government funded projects represented approximately of the company s net sales in fiscal  in fiscal and in fiscal one commercial customer  continental teves ag co 
continental teves located in germany  accounted for approximately  and of net sales in fiscal year  and  respectively 
in fiscal  approximately of the company s sales occurred in foreign markets with approximately sold in foreign currency 
the company also seeks to use its proprietary sensor capabilities to create value added subsystems or products 
the goal is to make such high margin products  enabled by the company s proprietary technology  a growing part of the company s business 
for example  the company can provide position feedback inside a magnetic actuator creating a smart actuator 
products and proprietary systems the company s main product groups may be categorized as follows  traditional sensors  micromachined sensors  
table of contents magnetic actuators and motors  and engineered subsystems such as inertial measurement units  scanner assemblies  electronic servo control systems and trackballs 
a more detailed description of the products and systems designed  manufactured and sold by the company follows below 
traditional sensors optical shaft encoders 
optical shaft encoders translate the motion of rotating shafts directly into digitally coded electronic signals 
these digitally coded signals facilitate interpretation of the sensed motion by microcomputer processors that are used to control the operation of machinery and equipment 
the company offers a wide array of optical shaft encoders to serve a variety of applications 
the most common applications are for factory automation  office automation and transportation equipment  but specialized versions are also used for military and space hardware 
value added assemblies that employ optical shaft encoders include servo motors and servo drive electronic control systems 
position sensors 
similar in basic function to encoders  position sensors are potentiometric or noncontacting technology devices that measure motion by analog not digital changes in electrical potential  magnetic field or inductive field 
these changes may sometimes be subsequently translated into digital code 
position sensors are used as economical motion sensing devices for throttle  steering  suspension  and seat and mirror position controls in automobiles and in some heavy equipment  such as earth movers  construction equipment and farm machinery 
they are also used to measure position in such applications as missile fin control  sawmill controls and numerous other types of industrial equipment and in oil well logging calipers 
traditional accelerometers 
traditional accelerometers using mechanical technology eg  a moving mass suspended by a pivot and jewel mechanism rely on the movement of complex machined metallic parts to measure linear and angular motion 
micromachined sensors rate sensors 
a rate sensor provides precise and reliable measurements of minute linear and angular motion for control  guidance and instrumentation 
in general  these devices operate without need for direct linkage to the driving mechanisms 
such measurements are required for heading and attitude reference instruments and flight control needs in aircraft and missiles  stabilization of satellites  stabilization control of antennae on aircraft  ships and other moving platforms  navigation of aircraft and vehicles  and for intelligent vehicle stability  roll over and navigation systems in the automotive industry 
technologies produces miniature  solid state quartz rate sensors based on innovative and proprietary chemical micromachining of a single element from crystalline quartz using photolithographic methods similar to those used in the manufacture of silicon semiconductor chips 
the advantages of quartz rate sensors over traditional mechanical units are increased reliability  reduced size and lower production and life cycle costs 
this family of rotation rate sensors is known as the gyrochip 
the company s family of gyrochip quartz rate sensors  developed primarily to accommodate the need for reliable and high precision yet economical gyros  have found use in varied applications 
the most frequent use of gyrochip units is as yaw sensors in stability control or spinout prevention systems for automobiles 
gyrochip sensors provide performance suitable for commercial  military  aviation and space applications while offering ruggedness  lower cost  longer life  and smaller size than many other gyro technologies 
pressure sensors 
pressure sensors measure absolute  gage or differential pressure from vacuum to  psi 
various sensing technologies are used  including silicon micromachined systems used for commercial and industrial markets 
the company provides standard products as well as application specific solutions to pressure measurement requirements 
micro electromechanical systems mems 
mems are a new category of ultra small devices  usually micromachined from crystalline materials such as quartz or silicon 
the gyrochip sensors and other quartz devices discussed above are examples of mems currently being sold by technologies 
management expects the company s mems research and development programs to lead to new devices for sensing motion  pressure and other physical parameters 
magnetic actuators and motors magnetic actuators 
magnetic actuators are used in place of cams or motors to achieve fast and precise control of short 
table of contents stroke linear or limited rotary motion 
actuators using very high energy magnets are also produced for specialized applications requiring intense force  torque or acceleration relative to the size of the device 
brushless dc motors 
brushless dc motors give high performance and efficiency in compact  lightweight packages 
these motors  which feature high energy magnets  are characterized by long life and low acoustic and electrical noise 
they are well suited to high reliability applications  such as in respiration therapy equipment where there is a long life requirement  where the risk of dust from a brush motor could be troublesome or where electrical noise could disrupt computers or computer controlled equipment 
engineered subsystems inertial measurement units imu and navigation subsystems 
these subsystems are a fundamental element of virtually all inertial navigation and position or attitude reporting systems 
even systems that rely on the global positioning satellite gps network frequently must have an imu built in to ensure a back up in case the gps signal is interrupted 
technologies has made new breakthroughs in size  reliability and cost for its proprietary imu subsystems 
bei has integrated gps  imu  and software to market complete navigation subsystems 
scanner assemblies 
scanner assemblies are an integral subsystem of the optics in military night vision systems that guide the infrared image to the focal plane sensor array 
these subsystems consist of spinning or reciprocating mirrors  a motor and an encoder in a precision servo loop 
the company s motion control know how helps ensure that the scanner delivers jitter free  well resolved images 
servo systems 
servo systems are closed loop electronic systems that control the position and or velocity of rotating shafts  linear assemblies or other moving parts by noting a desired rate of movement and position usually input from computers or control electronics  monitoring the actual position and rate of movement using an appropriate encoder or other sensor and constantly providing feedback that indicates whether further action is required to achieve or maintain the desired performance 
trackballs 
bei trackballs have flexible and rugged designs that allow them to be an integral part of a keyboard as well as in stand alone cursor positioners 
they are used in ultra sound scanning machines  factory automation and defense applications 
the flexibility is provided by the interface electronics design that accommodates various standard and customized interfaces and rugged performance is provided by a proprietary ball sealing technique that allows operation in harsh environments 
backlog backlog for the company at september  and at september  was approximately  and  respectively 
the company s commercial operations typically ship standard products within to days after receipt of a purchase authorization 
management of the company believes that its competitive position depends in part on minimizing the time that elapses between receipt and shipment of an order 
products that require special analysis  design or testing  such as those produced for customers in the aviation or space technology markets  are generally shipped from to months after receipt of the purchase authorization 
in the case of us government contracts  backlog includes only the applicable portion of contracts that are fully funded by a procuring government agency 
all us government contracts and subcontracts are subject to termination by the us government at will  traditionally with compensation for work completed and costs incurred 
the company s backlog includes aggregate contract revenues remaining to be earned principally over the next twelve months for scheduled deliveries under existing contracts 
some contracts undertaken by technologies extend beyond one year 
accordingly  portions of certain contracts are carried forward from one year to the next as part of backlog 
all orders considered backlog for the company as of september  are scheduled for shipment during fiscal there can be no assurance that all existing contract backlog will eventually result in revenue and  accordingly  the amount of backlog at any date is not necessarily a reliable indicator of future revenue or profitability trends 
competition competitors for various products offered by the company are found among certain divisions or product lines of large  
table of contents diversified companies such as bosch  siemens ag  denso corporation  danaher corp  northrop grumman corporation  bae systems  panasonic  rockwell automation and invensys 
there are smaller or product specific companies  some of whose products compete with those of the company  including cts corp  heidenhain  silicon sensing systems  servo magnetics corp  bourns  inc and bi technologies corp 
in its principal markets  the company believes that competition is based primarily on design  performance  reliability  price  delivery  service and support 
the company believes that it competes favorably with respect to these factors 
manufacturing the company s manufacturing operations provide a mix of standard and custom products designed to meet the specialized requirements of particular customers 
the company s products  whether standard or custom  are normally manufactured in response to customers orders and are in general not held as finished goods 
most are assembled from parts or subassemblies that are proprietary to the company 
the company relies on various sources for its raw material components 
see business risk factors dependence upon key suppliers 
specialized or proprietary equipment is often used to produce the company s products 
for example  a code pattern generator designed by and proprietary to the company is used to produce some shaft encoder parts 
specialized quartz micromachining equipment is used for the production of gyrochip units 
high throughput automated or semi automated equipment is used for the production of gyrochip assemblies  brushless motors and potentiometers 
some parts are fabricated under clean room conditions 
the company s production of automotive yaw sensors required scaling up its production to the quantities demanded by the automobile market 
the company is continuing to refine production engineering measures to support the fabrication  assembly  and testing of new sensors in the appropriate quantities 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to produce the required quantities on time or in sufficient amounts to satisfy demand 
failure to do so would have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
see business risk factors manufacturing experience risk  scale up risk  product recall risk 
research and development the company s research and development focus has included improving performance and yields of existing products  with special emphasis on the quartz sensors used in high accuracy imu s and high volume yaw rate sensors for the automotive industry 
substantial effort has also been devoted to the development of efficient manufacturing methods necessary for competitive pricing of the company s products while maintaining the required quality for the automotive market 
the company has transitioned to the next generation quartz fork sensor which is smaller resulting in more forks per wafer and utilizes a new patented design 
the company also upgraded two application specific integrated circuit asic designs  continued research on fork design to upgrade performance for military applications and continued to upgrade accelerometer performance for military use 
during the fiscal year  the company continued development and commercialization of a new non contacting angular position sensor referred to as ncaps 
the development was driven by the company s perception of market demand for a technology usable in high volume applications eg  steering sensors  medium resolution absolute angular position measurement sensors that would overcome the limitations of contacting sensors as well as the limitations of currently available non contacting sensors 
the design and architecture of the ncaps essentially a digitally processed proprietary transceiver sensor unit  when combined with the company s existing manufacturing expertise  may lend itself to high volume production 
the company believes applications for this technology may cover a wide spectrum within the automotive and industrial market sectors 
a customized asic for the ncaps sensor is in first iteration  which the company anticipates will provide the cost and performance required by the market 
management of the company believes that its future success will depend in part on its ability to continue to enhance its existing products  and to develop and introduce new products that maintain technological leadership  meet a wider range of customer needs and achieve market acceptance 
accordingly  the company s internally funded research  development and related engineering expenditures were approximately million  million and million in fiscal  and  respectively 
in addition  customer funded research and development expenditures charged to cost of sales were million  million and million  respectively  for the same periods 
development of the company s portfolio of rate sensors  including the ncaps  comprised most of the prior years customer funded research and development expenditures 

table of contents from time to time  the company s research and development efforts may result in the development of proprietary technology only tangentially related to the company s core business 
during fiscal  the company undertook to distribute shares in a majority owned subsidiary  opticnet  inc opticnet  founded to exploit such derivative technology  to its stockholders 
certain proprietary technology related to and useful in the optical networking industry was contributed to opticnet at such time 
at the close of business on october   technologies declared a distribution to its stockholders of approximately of the outstanding securities of opticnet 
in the distribution  each holder of record of technologies common stock as of the close of business on october  received one share of opticnet common stock for every two shares of technologies common stock held  and cash in lieu of any fractional shares of opticnet common stock

there can be no assurance that the company will be successful in these efforts 
the company has incurred  and the company expects to continue to incur  substantial expenses associated with the introduction and promotion of new products 
there can be no assurance that the expenses incurred will not exceed research and development cost estimates or that new products will achieve market acceptance and generate sales sufficient to offset development costs 
in order to develop new products successfully  the company is dependent upon key management and technical personnel who continuously contribute ideas to develop new products and enhancements of the company s existing products 
there can be no assurance that products or technologies developed by others will not render the company s products non competitive or obsolete 
risks from manufacturing and design defects  ability to meet customers performance criteria the company has experienced manufacturing quality problems in the past and could experience similar problems in the future 
certain of the company s products are designed for use in critical safety and mission critical systems 
during the company s continuing efforts to increase manufacturing and production capabilities to meet market demand  high quality standards for the company s products must be maintained  or risk customer dissatisfaction  damage to the company s reputation  or significant liability claims if the company s products contain undetected errors or inaccuracies 
the company attempts to contractually limit exposure to liability claims by customers  but this may be insufficient in the face of very large claims and does not preclude all potential claims 
as a result  product recalls or significant liability claims  whether or not successful  could harm the company s reputation and business 
manufacturing experience risk  continued scale up risk  product recall risk technologies is continuing the process of adding production capacity for its automotive yaw rate sensors to respond to the expected future demand for quantities required by the automobile market 
the company has relatively recent experience in large scale manufacturing having produced million automotive quartz rate sensors and million automotive quartz rate sensors in fiscal and  respectively 
in fiscal  the company manufactured approximately million units of its automotive quartz rate sensor in its concord  california facility  which supplied sensors to approximately of new automobiles sold in the north american and european markets in fiscal in years prior to fiscal  the company encountered difficulties in scaling up production of the gyrochip sensors  including problems involving production yields  component supplies and shortages of qualified personnel 
although many of these issues were resolved in fiscal  management expects a continued ramp up beyond fiscal a failure by the company to manufacture and deliver products in a timely fashion could harm the company s reputation and cause the loss of potential future sales and the company could be liable for penalties to customers in the event of contract breach for delivery failures 
these types of manufacturing delays can occur for various reasons  including a lack of manufacturing capacity  the failure of a supplier to provide components in a timely fashion or with acceptable quality  or an inability by the company to attract and retain qualified manufacturing personnel 
there can be no assurance that future manufacturing difficulties or product recalls  either of which could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations  will not occur 
manufacturing processes and equipment the company manufactures certain products such as quartz rate sensors  potentiometers and some shaft encoders using extremely complex proprietary processes and equipment 
the fabrication of these products requires manufacturing efforts to occur in a highly controlled and ultra clean environment  and accordingly these products are extremely sensitive to changes in manufacturing conditions 
the company is largely dependent on its concord  california facility to meet the volume of manufacturing required by the automotive market 
in the event of a production disruption  the possibility exists that equipment could be damaged or that process disciplines and controls could be temporarily lost  which would cause the company to experience problems achieving acceptable manufacturing rates and yields 
such a disruption of production could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
dependence upon key personnel the company depends  to a significant degree  on the continued contribution of key management and technical personnel 
the loss of the services of one or more key employees could have a material adverse effect on the company 
the company s 
table of contents success also depends on its ability to attract and retain additional highly qualified management and technical personnel 
skilled technical personnel in the company s industry are typically in short supply 
as a result  competition for these people is intense and they are often subject to offers from competing employers  particularly in northern california where certain of the company s facilities are located and there is a high concentration of technology companies 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to retain its key employees  or that it will be able to attract or retain additional skilled personnel as needed 
the company does not currently maintain key person insurance on any employee

reinhold  inc  substrates  supplied by aurora circuits  llc  two types of asic s  supplied by national semiconductor corporation  flextronics semiconductor  inc and american megatrends  inc  and two types of led s  supplied by optek technology  inc 
and opto diode corp 
the company currently relies on single or a limited number of suppliers for these components 
any increase in the cost of the components used in the company s products could make the company s products less competitive and lower the company s gross margin 
additionally  the company s single source suppliers could enter into exclusive agreements with or be acquired by one of the company s competitors  increase their prices  refuse to sell their products to the company  discontinue products or go out of business 
to the extent acceptable alternative suppliers are available to the company  identifying them and entering into arrangements with them is difficult and time consuming requiring validation of quality standards 
additionally  consolidations among the company s suppliers could result in other sole source suppliers 
there can be no assurance that there will not be a significant disruption in the supply of such components in the future  or in the event of such disruption  that the company will be able to locate alternative suppliers of the components with the same quality at an acceptable price 
an interruption in the supply of components used in the manufacture of the company s products  particularly as the company scales up its manufacturing activities in support of commercial sales  could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
dependence upon key customers approximately of the net sales of the company in fiscal were to continental teves for the automotive quartz rate sensor product used in advanced vehicle stability control systems 
continental teves integrates the company s sensor product into independently developed products and markets the integrated systems to various customers in the automobile industry 
this concentration of sales is expected to expand in fiscal and beyond 
the company is currently transitioning to its next generation of automotive inertial quartz based sensor products  remotely mounted multi sensor clusters with can bus and a multi rate sensor package suitable for incorporation into electronic systems modules 
the company expects to continue to increase production of the gyrochip sensors see business risk factors manufacturing experience risk  scale up risk  product recall risk to meet the requirements of its contracts with continental teves in fiscal and beyond 
in addition  the company is in discussion with continental teves and other automotive customers that could lead to extensions of existing contracts and to new contracts 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to retain or extend its contracts with continental teves or other automotive customers  or obtain new contracts on favorable terms  or that the product will continue to achieve continuing growth beyond the end of the current contracts  any of which could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
government regulation certain aspects of the industry in which the company s products are sold are regulated both in the united states and in foreign countries 
imposition of public carrier tariffs  foreign taxation and the necessity of incurring substantial costs and the expenditure of managerial resources to obtain regulatory approvals  particularly in foreign countries where safety standards differ from those in the united states  or the inability to obtain regulatory approvals within a reasonable period of time  could have a material  adverse effect on the company s business  operating results and financial condition 
the company s products must comply with a variety of equipment  interface and installation standards promulgated by regulatory authorities in different countries 
changes in government policies  regulations and interface standards could require the redesign of products and result in product shipment delays which could have a material  adverse impact on the company s business  operating results and financial condition

contracting with the us government approximately  and of the net sales of technologies in fiscal  and  respectively  were derived from contracts with the us government or under subcontract to other prime contractors to the us government 
because a significant portion of technologies business is derived from contracts with the department of defense or other agencies of the us government  the company s business is sensitive to changes in us government spending policies that can have significant variations from year to year 
at various times  the company s results have been adversely affected by contract cutbacks and there can be no assurance that the company s results of operations will not in the future be materially and adversely affected by changes in us government procurement policies or reductions in us government expenditures for products furnished by the company 
under applicable regulations  various audit agencies of the us government conduct regular audits of contractors compliance with a variety of us government regulations 
the us government also has the right to review retroactively the cost records under most us government contracts 
contract prices may be adjusted in the event the us government determines that the company submitted incomplete  inaccurate or obsolete cost or pricing data 
government contracts and subcontracts generally provide for either a fixed price  negotiated fixed price or cost plus fixed fee basis for remuneration 
the majority of the company s contracts with the us government are competitive fixed price or negotiated fixed price contracts  although cost plus fixed fee contracts provided approximately of the company s net sales in fiscal for fixed price contracts  the company bears the risk of cost overruns and derives the benefits from cost savings 
as a result  greater risks are involved under fixed price contracts than under cost plus contracts because failure to anticipate technical problems  estimate costs accurately or control costs during contract performance may reduce or eliminate the contemplated profit or may result in a loss 
all us government contracts contain termination clauses that allow the contract to be terminated either for contractor default or for the convenience of the us government 
in the event of termination for the convenience of the government  the clause typically provides that the contractor will receive payment for work in progress  including profit 
to date  termination of technologies contracts by the us government has not had any significant effect on the company s financial results 
however  no assurance can be given that such terminations will not have a materially adverse effect on the company s results of operations in the future 
portions of the company s government business are sometimes classified 
as a result  the company may be prohibited from disclosing the substance or status of such business 
dependence on proprietary intellectual property success for the company depends  in part  on the company s ability to protect its intellectual property 
the company relies on a combination of patent  copyright  trademark and trade secret laws to protect its proprietary technologies and processes 
nevertheless  such measures may not be adequate to safeguard the proprietary technology underlying its products 
in addition  the company s existing and future patents could be challenged  invalidated or circumvented  and any right granted thereunder may not provide meaningful protection to the company 
the failure of any patents to provide protection to the company s technology 
table of contents might make it easier for competitors to offer similar products and use similar manufacturing techniques 
despite precautions  it may be possible for a third party to copy or otherwise obtain and use the company s products or technology without authorization  develop similar technology independently or design around those patents issued to the company 
in addition  effective patent  copyright  trademark and trade secret protection may be unavailable or limited outside of the united states  europe and japan 
the company may not be able to obtain any meaningful intellectual property protection in such countries and territories 
additionally  the company may  for a variety of reasons  decide not to file for patent  copyright  or trademark protection outside of the united states 
further  at the request of customers  the company occasionally incorporates a customer s intellectual property into designs  in which case the company will have obligations with respect to the non use and non disclosure of that intellectual property 
however  the steps taken by the company to prevent misappropriation or infringement of company intellectual property or that of customers may not be successful 
moreover  costly and time intensive litigation could be necessary to enforce the company s intellectual property rights  to protect the company s trade secrets or to determine the validity and scope of proprietary rights of others  including customers 
the industries in which the company operates can be characterized by their vigorous protection and pursuit of intellectual property rights 
in this regard  the invalidity of the company s patents could be asserted and claims made against the company 
furthermore  in a patent or trade secret action  the company could be required to withdraw certain products from the market or redesign products offered for sale or under development 
the company has also entered into certain indemnification obligations in favor of customers and strategic partners that could be triggered upon an allegation or finding of infringement of other parties proprietary rights 
irrespective of the validity or successful assertion of such claims  the company would likely incur significant costs and diversion of resources with respect to the defense of such claims 
to address any potential claims or actions asserted in opposition  the company may seek to obtain a license under a third party s intellectual property rights 
under such circumstances  a license may not be available on commercially reasonable terms  if at all 
international sales sales to customers located outside the united states accounted for approximately  and of the company s net sales in fiscal  and  respectively 
most of these sales were to continental teves  located in germany 
the company expects that international sales will continue to represent a significant portion of the company s product revenues and that the company will be subject to the normal risks of international sales  such as export laws  currency fluctuations  longer payment cycles  greater difficulties in accounts receivable collections and complying with a wide variety of foreign laws 
although the company has not previously experienced significant difficulties under foreign law in exporting its products  there can be no assurance that the company will not experience such difficulties in the future 
in addition  because the company primarily invoices its foreign sales in us dollars  fluctuations in exchange rates could affect demand for the company s products by causing its prices to be out of line with products priced in the local currency 
such difficulties could have a material adverse effect on the company s international sales and a resulting material adverse effect on the company s business  operating results and financial condition 
financial risk covered by insurance or uninsured it is the policy of the company to insure for certain property and casualty risks consisting primarily of physical loss to property  business interruptions resulting from property losses  workers compensation  comprehensive general liability and auto liability 
insurance coverage is obtained for catastrophic property and casualty exposures as well as those risks required to be insured by law or contract 
although the company believes that its insurance coverage is reasonable  significant events such as judicial decisions  legislation  economic conditions and large losses could materially affect the company s insurance obligations and future expense 
possible volatility of the company s common stock price the price of the company s common stock has fluctuated widely in the past 
sales of substantial amounts of the company s common stock  or the perception that such sales could occur  could adversely affect prevailing market prices for the company s common stock 
the management of the company believes that such past fluctuations may have been caused by the factors identified above as well as announcements of new products  quarterly fluctuations in the results of operations and other factors  including recent volatility in stock prices for technology focused companies as a whole 
these factors  as well as general economic  political  market and other factors unrelated to operating performance may adversely affect the market price of the company s common stock 
the company anticipates that the price for technologies common stock may continue to be volatile for the same reasons 
future stock price volatility for technologies common stock could provoke the initiation of securities litigation  which may divert substantial management resources and have a material adverse effect on the company s business  
table of contents operating results and financial condition 
voting control by officers  directors and affiliates at september   the company s officers and directors and their affiliates beneficially owned approximately of the outstanding shares of the company s common stock 
accordingly  together they have the ability to significantly influence the election of the company s directors and other corporate actions requiring stockholder approval 
such concentration of ownership may have the effect of delaying  deferring or preventing a change in control of the company 
certain charter provisions the company s board of directors has authority to issue up to  shares of preferred stock and to fix the rights  preferences  privileges and restrictions  including voting rights  of these shares without any further vote or action by the stockholders 
the rights of the holders of the company s common stock will be subject to  and may be adversely affected by  the rights of the holders of any preferred stock that may be issued in the future 
the issuance of preferred stock  while providing desirable flexibility in connection with possible acquisitions and other corporate purposes  could have the effect of making it more difficult for a third party to acquire a majority of the outstanding voting stock of the company  thereby delaying  deferring or preventing a change in control of the company 
furthermore  such preferred stock may have other rights  including economic rights  senior to the common stock  and as a result  the issuance thereof could have a material adverse effect on the market value of the company s common stock 
risk of extended economic downturn the united states has been experiencing a general economic downturn  particularly in the manufacturing sector 
although economic conditions may have leveled off  the company has yet to see significant improvement in economic conditions and cannot predict when improvements might occur 
as a result of this uncertainty  forecasting and financial and strategic planning are more difficult than usual 
if the current downturn in the economy remains for an extended period  technologies will suffer from the lack of opportunities to grow sales as customers will continue to limit their spending 
specifically  the recent downturn and continuing lack of growth in the economy has resulted and may continue to result in diminished factory utilization and decreased consumer demand in the automobile  aviation  aerospace and factory automation markets  resulting in lower demand for technologies products 
moreover  the continuing adverse impact of the downturn on the capital markets could impair technologies ability to raise capital as needed and impede the company s ability to expand 
in addition  this economic downturn has been exacerbated by the terrorist attacks in new york and washington  dc  which disrupted commercial activities in the united states and internationally 
the long term impact of the terrorist attacks on the economy as a whole  and specifically to the automotive industry  government programs  and other industries to which technologies sells  is not known at this time 
any future terrorist attacks or outbreaks  or escalation of hostilities arising out of any attacks  or concerns that attacks or hostilities may occur  could adversely affect the united states economy in general  including the capital markets  which in turn could adversely impact the worldwide economy and prolong or intensify the current downturn 
international conflicts may further adversely affect our business international conflicts such as the war in iraq and the political turmoil in the middle east cause significant uncertainty with respect to us and other business and financial markets and adversely affect our business 
although our military and aerospace business may experience greater demand for products as a result of increased government defense spending  factors arising directly or indirectly from international conflicts have adversely affected our business in the past  and may further adversely affect our business

sales to the automotive industry  including sales of the company s gyrochip sensors  increased to million from million in fiscal due to the launch of new platforms into the north american and european markets and an increase in quantities shipped and engineering development billings of million to the company s largest customer 
sales to other industrial customers decreased million to million from million during fiscal resulting primarily from continued weakness in factory automation 
government related sales increased million in fiscal to million from million during fiscal primarily from increased military based sensor shipments 
during fiscal net sales for the company decreased to million from million in fiscal the sales volume decrease was primarily due to lower commercial sales to domestic and foreign automotive customers due to competition supplying yaw rate sensors to the company s largest customer  lower automotive production levels for vehicles containing electronic stability program esp systems  lower product pricing and  to a lesser extent  reduced sales to industrial customers primarily due to the continuing soft economy 
sales to the automotive industry  including sales of the company s gyrochip sensors  decreased to million from million in fiscal sales to other industrial customers decreased million to million from million during fiscal resulting primarily from reduced sales to the semiconductor capital equipment industry 
government related sales decreased million in fiscal to million from million during fiscal primarily from shipment timing on contracts 
the company s sales to international customers were approximately  and of the company s net sales for fiscal 
table of contents  and  respectively 
the increase in international sales in fiscal is attributable to the launch of new automotive platforms with stability control systems and an increase in quantities shipped for older platforms 
the decrease in international sales in fiscal was attributable to competitors supplying yaw rate sensors to the company s largest customer 
the vast majority of sales to non us customers are denominated in us dollars 
cost of sales and gross profit in fiscal  cost of sales as a percentage of net sales increased percentage points due to a higher automotive product mix with lower associated margins  higher overhead spending associated with gyrochip capacity expansion not yet fully absorbed  additional inventory reserves at the company s facilities  the impact of low yields associated with model launches and scrap issues with two automotive vendors 
there may be additional margin rate variability in future years due to the introduction of new products  changes in product pricing  negotiation of development revenues and changes in manufacturing processes  volumes and product life cycles 
management continues to undertake technological initiatives designed to increase manufacturing and production efficiencies and attempts to maintain close relationships with vendors and customers in an effort to reduce costs and increase margins 
in fiscal  cost of sales as a percentage of net sales decreased percentage points due primarily to a lower proportion of automotive sales with higher than average cost of sales percentage offset to some degree by the impact of improved yields on the new automotive sensor cluster product 
selling  general and administrative expenses selling  general and administrative expenses in fiscal increased million from million in fiscal to million 
included in selling  general and administrative expense is the legal expense recovery of million associated with the favorable settlement of the company s patent infringement litigation against a competitor 
more than offsetting this recovery is increased spending primarily due to the legal costs associated with the patent infringement litigation settlement of million and other spending of million to support higher revenue 
as a percentage of sales  selling  general and administrative expenses decreased percentage points to in fiscal from in fiscal primarily due to increased sales revenue 
selling  general and administrative expenses in fiscal decreased million from million in fiscal to million primarily due to management actions to reduce spending in light of sales decreases in fiscal  which reduction was partially offset by an increase in the provision for allowance for doubtful accounts as compared to fiscal as a percentage of sales  selling  general and administrative expenses increased percentage points to in fiscal from in fiscal primarily as a result of reduced sales 
research  development and related expenses research and development expenses in fiscal decreased million to million from million in fiscal research and development expenditures have remained constant as management remains dedicated to the development of new and enhanced products  such as the next generation quartz automotive gyro sensor  ncaps  and improvements to other existing product families 
research and development expenses in fiscal increased million to million from million in fiscal the increase was due to management s dedication to the development of new and enhanced products  such as the next generation quartz and silicon automotive gyro sensors  ncaps and improvements to other existing product families 
the company believes that the continued timely development of new products and enhancements to its existing products is essential to maintaining its competitive position 
accordingly  the company anticipates that expenses associated with such efforts will increase in absolute amount  but may fluctuate as a percentage of sales depending on the company s success in acquiring customers or  in some cases  us government contracts funding research and development efforts 
related party expense and financing in august  the company entered into a tender offer the tender offer to purchase the outstanding common shares of opticnet at per share 
the board of directors of both companies approved the proposed transaction 
if successful  the tender offer will enable the company to purchase the million outstanding common shares of opticnet it does not already own at an aggregate cost of approximately million 
upon completion  the company intends to terminate the registration of 
table of contents opticnet s common stock under the securities exchange act of  as amended the exchange act 
the company expects to benefit from cost reductions associated with opticnet s terminated operations and the absence of exchange act reporting requirements for opticnet 
since inception  all capital for opticnet see business research and development has been provided by the company as debt or equity financing  as a result of opticnet s inability to gain outside financing from independent parties to date  in light of the severe downturn in the optical networking industry 
opticnet s net loss for the three month period from october  through december  of  is included in the consolidated results of the company 
originally  the company accounted for its investment in opticnet under the equity method of accounting until march   when the company deemed its investment impaired 
the company has recognized opticnet s entire net loss for the six months ended september  and fiscal year as of march   the company fully reserved its initial million investment in opticnet 
in october  the company agreed to provide opticnet with a line of credit originally established for up to million  amended in march for borrowings of up to million 
during the fiscal quarter ended june   the company suspended the availability of advances to opticnet under the line of credit  under which amounts outstanding at such time totaled approximately million in principal amount 
in the six months ending september   the company provided an additional million of financing to opticnet  which was advanced with the intent to convert such cash advances into additional equity in opticnet  upon terms to be decided 
the million advanced was expensed during the third and fourth quarters of fiscal  reflecting opticnet s net loss for the six month period from march  through september  effective september   the company and opticnet had determined that opticnet would authorize and issue to the company a series of nonvoting preferred stock 
in november  opticnet issued a total of  shares of nonvoting and nonconvertible series b preferred stock to technologies  in consideration of the million advanced during the third and fourth quarters of fiscal see note for a further description of the relationship with opticnet 
provisions in fiscal  the company recognized a provision for the impairment of silicon gyro research and development equipment of approximately million related to excess capacity

the net decrease of percentage points in fiscal from fiscal results from many factors including the relative proportion of tax credits generated to pre tax book income for  the true up of estimated prior year tax credits  increased export sales benefit generated in the current year and other prior year items 
the net increase of percentage points in fiscal from fiscal resulted from the company generating a pre tax loss in fiscal and the adverse impact that result had on all the permanent difference items  in addition to a decrease in both the us federal statutory rate and the tax benefit related to foreign sales 
other factors may have favorable and unfavorable effects upon the company s effective tax rate in and subsequent years

table of contents critical accounting policies and the use of estimates management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based upon the company s consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the company reviews the accounting policies used in reporting its financial results on a regular basis 
the preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
the estimates are based on historical experience and on various other assumptions that management believes to be reasonable under the circumstances 
on an ongoing basis  the company evaluates its estimates 
results may differ from these estimates due to actual outcomes being different from those on which the company based its assumptions 
the united states securities and exchange commission sec has defined critical accounting policies as those that are most important to the portrayal of an issuer s financial condition and results of operations and require management to make the most difficult and subjective judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates on matters that are inherently uncertain 
based upon this definition  the company believes the following critical accounting policies affect its more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements 
allowance for doubtful accounts the company continuously monitors collections and payments from its customers and maintains allowances for doubtful accounts based upon historical experience and any specific customer collection issues that the company has identified 
while such credit losses have historically been within management s expectations  there can be no assurance that the company will continue to experience the same relative level of credit losses that it has in the past 
in addition  although the company s sales have historically been to many customers in a variety of markets  in recent periods  one automotive customer accounted for a significant portion of the company s net sales 
a significant change in the liquidity or financial position of that customer or a further deterioration in the economic environment in general could have a material adverse impact on the collectability of the company s accounts receivable and future operating results  including a reduction in future revenues and additional allowances for doubtful accounts 
if  at the time of shipment  the company determines that collection of a receivable is not reasonably assured  the revenue is deferred and recognized at the time collection becomes reasonably assured  which is generally upon receipt of payment 
inventories inventories are carried principally at the lower of cost or fair value and does not exceed net realizable value 
cost is determined by the first in  first out fifo method  including material  labor and factory overhead 
the company writes down its inventory for estimated obsolescence for the difference between the cost of inventory and the estimated market value based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions 
if actual future demand or market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management  additional inventory write downs may be required 
the company s inventories are evaluated for obsolescence and excess quantity at least annually  with quarterly updates for the most significant operations 
long lived and intangible assets and goodwill management reviews goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite useful lives for impairment on an annual basis or more regularly if an event occurs that represents an indicator of possible impairment 
all other long lived and intangible assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable 
an impairment loss would be recognized based on the difference between the carrying value of the asset and its estimated fair value  which would be determined based on undiscounted cash flows estimated to be generated by those assets 
the evaluation of goodwill and intangibles with indefinite useful lives for impairment requires management to use significant judgments and estimates including  but not limited to  projected future revenue  operating results and cash flows 
although management currently believes that the estimates used in the evaluation of goodwill and intangibles with indefinite lives are reasonable  differences between actual and expected revenue  operating results and cash flow could cause these assets to be deemed impaired 
if this were to occur  the company would be required to charge to earnings the write down in value of such assets  which could have a material adverse effect on the company s results of operations and financial position 

table of contents equity investments the company records its equity investment in a private company on the cost basis if the company owns less than of the outstanding equity of the investee company 
the company periodically evaluates the fair market value of its equity investment to determine if an other than temporary impairment in the value of its investment has taken place 
litigation the company reserves for legal claims when payments associated with the claims become probable and can be reasonably estimated 
due to the difficulty in estimating costs of resolving legal claims  actual costs may be substantially different than the amounts reserved 
provision for excess capacity  uncollectables from a related party and product line move and other during the quarter ended march   the company established reserves for portions of assets held under leases and owned in excess of requirements  receivables from a related party and the closure of a specific manufacturing facility  as discussed in note to the company s consolidated financial statements 
these reserves required the use of significant estimates 
though the company believes that these estimates accurately reflect the costs of these plans  they relate to matters that are inherently uncertain and actual results may be different 
environmental matters the company reserves for known environmental claims  of which there are none as of september   when payments associated with the claims become probable and the costs can be reasonably estimated 
the company s environmental reserves  for all periods presented  are recorded at the expected payment amount 
the actual cost of resolving environmental issues may be higher than that reserved primarily due to difficulty in estimating such costs and potential changes in the status of government regulations 
income taxes the company has significant amounts of deferred tax assets that are reviewed periodically for recoverability and valued accordingly 
these assets are evaluated by using the four sources of taxable income that may be considered under financial accounting standards fas no 
future reversals of existing temporary differences  taxable income in prior carryback years  if carryback is permitted under the tax law  tax planning strategies and  future taxable income exclusive of reversing temporary differences and carryforwards 
in the event it is determined more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized  a valuation allowance would be recorded with a corresponding charge to income in the period such determination occurs 
significant accounting policies revenue recognition revenues are primarily generated from the sale of electronic devices to our customers  typically the end user 
revenues also include other items such as negotiated development billings  licensing fees or royalties that may not occur on a regular basis 
the company recognizes revenue using the guidance from sec staff accounting bulletin no 
revenue recognition in financial statements 
under these guidelines  revenue recognition is deferred on transactions where persuasive evidence of an arrangement does not exist  revenue recognition is contingent upon performance of one or more obligations of the company  the price is not fixed or determinable or payment is not reasonably assured 
product warranty the company records a warranty liability on its products at the time of revenue recognition based on historical experience and any specific warranty issues that the company has identified 
although historical warranty costs have been within expectations  there can be no assurance that future warranty costs will not exceed historical amounts 
if actual future warranty costs exceed historical amounts  additional allowances may be required  which could have a material adverse impact on the company s 
table of contents operating results in future periods 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for product warranty disclosure 
property  plant and equipment and related depreciation the company records property  plant and equipment at cost  which is depreciated using the straight line method for structures and equipment over their estimated useful lives 
leasehold improvements and assets acquired under capital leases are amortized over the shorter of the lease term or their estimated useful lives 
management reviews the estimated useful lives of property  plant and equipment to verify that the assets are being depreciated in accordance with their usage and all assets no longer in service are fully depreciated 
accrued expenses and other liabilities the company records liabilities for services or products received in the period in which the benefit was recognized 
due to the difficulty in estimating costs of these services or products received  actual costs may be substantially different than the amounts recorded 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company is exposed to market risk in the form of changes in foreign exchange rates  changes in the prices of marketable equity securities held as part of a deferred compensation plan a rabbi trust and changes in interest rates 
the company has approximately  calculated based on the conversion rate for euros at september  permanently invested in the assets of ideacod  sas  located in strasbourg  france 
the potential loss in fair value resulting from a hypothetical adverse change in the foreign currency exchange rate amounts to  which would not be material to the consolidated financial statements 
the rabbi trust assets  consisting of cash equivalents and debt and equity securities  are offset by an equivalent deferred compensation liability to the trust participants 
the liability fluctuates equally with changes in the value of the assets 
because the liability completely offsets the assets of the trust  changes in asset value have no effect on the company s results of operations or financial position 
the company is affected by changes in the general level of us interest rates  as a portion of the company s investments are in short term debt securities issued by corporations 
the company s investments are placed with high quality issuers and the company attempts to limit the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer 
due to the nature of the company s short term investments  the company believes that it is not subject to any material market risk exposure 
the company does not have any foreign currency or other derivative financial instruments
