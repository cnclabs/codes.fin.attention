item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations this annual report on form k contains  in addition to historical information  forward looking statements that involve substantial risks and uncertanties 
the company s actual results could differ materially from the results anticipated by the company and discussed in the forward looking statements 
factors that could cause or contribute to such differences are discussed below in the section entitled forward looking statements and elsewhere in this annual report 
the following discussion should be read together with our financial statements and related notes thereto included elsewhere in this document 
general the company s discussion and analysis of its financial condition and results of operations are based upon the company s consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires the company to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  the company evaluates its estimates  including those related to customer programs and incentives  bad debts  inventories  income taxes  warranty obligations  financing operations  restructuring  and contingencies and litigation 
the company bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
critical accounting policies and estimates the company believes the following critical accounting policies affect its more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition britesmile recognizes revenue related to retail products at the time such products are sold to customers 
britesmile recognizes revenue at company operated centers at the time a whitening procedure is performed 
britesmile records deferred revenue at the time of sale of key cards and access codes to associated centers 
revenue is subsequently recognized over the period that the whitening procedures  which can be performed via the key cards and access codes  are performed  currently estimated at days from the date of shipment 
a material change to the estimated time period over which the key cards and access codes are used could have a significant impact on britesmile s revenue in the period of change as well as future periods 
britesmile s policy is not to accept any return of key cards or access codes during the course of the agreement with an associated center  however  it does provide credits to the ultimate whitening customer for a whitening guarantee 
britesmile recognizes those credits by reducing its revenue 
bad debt britesmile maintains allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of its customers to make required payments 
a considerable amount of judgment is required in assessing the ultimate realization of accounts receivable including the current credit worthiness of each customer 
if the financial condition of britesmile s customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
inventory britesmile is required to state its inventories at the lower of cost or market 
britesmile writes down its inventory for estimated obsolescence or unmarketable inventory equal to the difference between the cost of inventory and the estimated market value based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions  as well as for damaged goods 
if actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management  additional inventory write downs may be required 
property  equipment and improvements carrying value near recoverability estimate britesmile evaluates its property  equipment and improvements for impairment whenever indicators of impairment exist 
management determined that impairment indicators did exist in fiscal based upon continued operating losses and negative cash flow 
as a result  britesmile recorded an impairment charge of million 
no impairment charge was recorded during fiscal store closures during fiscal and the transition period  britesmile recorded significant reserves in connection with store closures 
these reserves include estimates pertaining to employee separation costs and the settlements of contractual obligations  primarily property leases 
although the company does not anticipate significant changes  the actual costs related to the closures may differ from these estimates 
legal contingencies britesmile is currently a party to certain legal action 
management does not believe that current pending litigation will have a material adverse effect on britesmile s consolidated financial position 
this conclusion has been developed in consultation with outside counsel handling britesmile s representation in these matters 
it is possible  however  that future results of operations for any particular quarterly or annual period could be materially affected by changes in management s assumptions and the effectiveness of britesmile s strategies related to these legal actions 
britesmile recognizes the costs of legal services in the periods incurred

liquidity and capital resources general the company s principal sources of liquidity have been proceeds from issuances of common stock and debt at december   the company had million of cash and cash equivalents 
the company anticipates signing contracts for additional associated centers during the next twelve months 
this expansion is contingent upon several factors  including available cash resources and acceptance by consumers and associated center dentists of the company s latw services 
the company expects that its principal uses of cash will be to provide working capital  to finance capital expenditures  and to satisfy other general corporate expenses 
in particular  the company plans to use its cash to finance its marketing strategy 
during the first quarter of  the company obtained a million line of credit from cap advisers  and million in shortfall guarantees 
as amended in march  july and january  the line of credit was increased to million 
see cap advisers line of credit  and additional working capital guarantees below 
the company also amended its evl lease agreement to defer payment of monthly rental on latw devices to year see evl lease line amendment below 
cap advisers line of credit in december  as amended in march  july and january  britesmile international  a wholly owned subsidiary of the company  entered into credit and security agreements with cap advisers which provide for a million line of credit facility of which  million is for the purchase of capital equipment

of the  latw devices in operation at associated centers at december    of such devices were leased to the company by evl 
each key card or access code enables associated center dentists to perform teeth whitening procedures resulting in variable rent of per procedure 
on march   the company and evl amended their lease agreement to provide that the variable rent portion of the monthly rental payments during  in the amount of for each britesmile procedure  will be deferred and paid to evl in twelve equal monthly installments beginning january   with interest payable on the deferred amount at a rate equal to libor  as quoted by the bank of nova scotia for the applicable adjustment dates for deposits in us dollars for one month maturities  plus basis points

in consideration for the guarantors commitment  the company issued to the guarantors five year warrants to purchase an aggregate of  shares of common stock of the company at an exercise price of per share 
pursuant to the commitment letters  on november   the company sold to two investors in a private placement convertible notes that are due and payable on november  the november notes 
the november notes are convertible into shares of common stock of the company at a conversion rate of per share 
the two investors  who purchased the november notes  both affiliates of the company  are lco investments limited  and bradford g 
peters 
the ceo of the company has agreed to fund an additional  in under the same terms 
accordingly  as of december   the company had received of the total million committed pursuant to the commitment letters 
to date  the company has yet to achieve profitability 
the company does not expect to be profitable in the company has implemented initiatives to increase sales and decrease expenses to assure its viability for the next months 
the company also has developed a contingency plan in anticipation of prolonged negative business impact resulting from the war in iraq 
to date  the company s principal sources of liquidity have been proceeds from issuance of common stock and debt 
at december   the company had million in cash and borrowing capacity under lines of credit totaling  additionally  as discussed below  subsequent to december   the company obtained the following borrowing availability o  convertible notes under the same terms as the november notes described in note o million increase in the credit agreements with cap advisers

o million center loan with cap advisers 
this credit facility is for general working capital needs  and capital expenditures and specific revenue generating initiatives million 
the company believes that cash on hand along with available borrowing capacity discussed above will be sufficient to sustain operations through the end of payments due by period contractual obligations total less than year years years after years long term debt    capital lease obligations   operating leases      lease obligation for closed centers  total contractual cash obligations      factors that may affect our performance inflation most of the company s products are purchased in finished form and packaged by the supplier or at the company s headquarters 
the company anticipates usual inflationary increases in the price of its products and does not intend to pass these increases along to its customers  primarily as a result of other operating efficiencies gained through changing the sourcing of certain of its products 
in general  the company does not believe that inflation has had a material effect on its results of operations in recent years 
however  there can be no assurance that the company s business will not be affected by inflation in the future 
seasonality the company believes that its business follows seasonal trends due to the closing of some associated center dental offices in july and august  and again in november and december  for vacations 
as a result  the company s sales performance could potentially be affected 
forward looking statements the statements contained in this report that are not purely historical are forward looking statements within the meaning of the private securities litigation reform act of and section e of the securities exchange act 
these statements relate to the company s expectations  hopes  beliefs  anticipations  commitments  intentions and strategies regarding the future 
they may be identified by the use of words or phrases such as believes  expects  anticipates  should  plans  estimates  and potential  among others 
forward looking statements include  but are not limited to  statements contained in management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations regarding the company s financial performance  revenue and expense levels in the future and the sufficiency of its existing assets to fund future operations and capital spending needs 
actual results could differ materially from the anticipated results or other expectations expressed in such forward looking statements 
the company believes that many of the risks set forth here and in the company s filings with the securities and exchange commission are part of doing business in the industry in which the company operates and competes and will likely be present in all periods reported 
the forward looking statements contained in this report are made as of the date of this report and the company assumes no obligation to update them or to update the reasons why actual results could differ from those projected in such forward looking statements 
among others  risks and uncertainties that may affect the business  financial condition  performance  development  and results of operations of the company include we have a limited operating history upon which to evaluate our likelihood of success 
we have only manufactured and distributed our bs since november  the bs since november and the bspb since may we opened our first center in walnut creek  california in february  and britesmile associated centers began performing latw procedures in april therefore  we have a limited relevant operating history upon which to evaluate the likelihood of our success 
investors must evaluate the likelihood of our success in light of the risks  expenses and difficulties frequently encountered in the operation and expansion of a new business and the development and marketing of new products 
we cannot be certain that our business strategy will be successful or that we will successfully address these risks and difficulties 
our failure to address any of these risks or difficulties could have a material adverse effect on our business 
we have a history of losses and accumulated deficit and this trend of losses may continue in the future 
for fiscal  we had a net loss of million  for fiscal  we had a net loss of million and for the transition period ended december  we had a net loss of million 
as of december   our accumulated deficit was million 
our ability to reach and sustain profitability will depend  in part  upon the successful marketing of our existing services and products and the successful and timely introduction of new services and products 
we anticipate that net losses will continue for the foreseeable future 
we can give no assurances that we will achieve profitability or  if achieved  that we will sustain profitability 
our success will depend on acceptance of our latw process and post whitening maintenance products 
we derive substantially all of our revenues from our latw procedures  a relatively new teeth whitening concept for consumers 
we also market britesmile brand toothpaste  electric toothbrushes  mouthwash  chewing gum and post whitening procedure touchup kits through our centers and associated centers 
our success will depend in large part on our ability to successfully encourage consumers  dentists and dental office employees to switch from traditional and less expensive bleaching tray whitening methods to our latw system  and on our ability to successfully market our line of post whitening maintenance products 
there can be no assurance that consumers will accept our procedure or products 
typically  medical and dental insurance policies do not cover teeth whitening procedures  including the company s latw procedure  or whitening maintenance products  which may have an adverse impact upon the market acceptance of our products and services 
our success will depend on our ability to update our technology to remain competitive 
the dental device and supply industry is subject to technological change 
as technological changes occur in the marketplace  we may have to modify our products in order to become or remain competitive or to ensure that our products do not become obsolete 
while we are continuing our research and development efforts to improve our current latw systems in order to strengthen our competitive advantage  we cannot assure that we will successfully implement technological improvements to our latw systems on a timely basis  or at all 
if we fail to anticipate or respond in a cost effective and timely manner to government requirements  market trends or customer demands  or if there are any significant delays in product development or introduction  our revenues and profit margins may decline which could adversely affect our cash flows  liquidity and operating results 
we may have problems financing our future growth 
our growth strategy includes investment in and expansion of associated centers throughout the united states and internationally  increasing awareness of the britesmile brand and developing and marketing our brand name and retail products 
to finance our prior growth we have sold debt and equity securities  however  additional funds are needed in the future for continued expansion 
we cannot assure that additional financing will be available or that  if available  it will be on terms favorable to our stockholders or us 
if needed funds are not available  we may be required to close existing centers  and or limit or forego the establishment of new associated centers and the development of new products  or limit the scope of our current operations  which could have a material adverse effect on our business  operating results and financial condition 
we may be required to take other actions that may lessen the value of our common stock  including borrowing money on terms that are not favorable to us 
raising the needed funds through the sale of additional shares of our common stock or securities convertible into shares of common stock may result in dilution to current stockholders 
we are subject to competition 
the market for teeth whitening products and services is highly competitive 
competition in the market for teeth whitening products and services may intensify in the future 
numerous well established companies and smaller entrepreneurial companies are focusing significant resources on developing and marketing products and services that will compete with our products and services 
in addition  many of our current and potential competitors have greater financial  technical  operational and marketing resources 
teeth whitening products and services offered by our competitors include traditional and often less expensive bleaching tray methods and other forms of heat or light activated curing methods 
we may not be able to compete successfully against these competitors in developing  marketing and distributing our services and products  which could result in the loss of customers and could have a material adverse effect on our business 
competitive pressures may also force prices for teeth whitening services down and such price reductions may adversely affect our potential future revenue 
we are susceptible to product liability suits and if a lawsuit is brought against us it could result in us having to pay large legal expenses and or judgments 
although no lawsuits have been filed against the company relating to our products or services  because of the nature of the dental device industry  there can be no assurance that we will not be subject to such claims in the future 
our products come into contact with vulnerable areas of the human body  such as the mouth  tongue  teeth and gums  and  therefore  the sale and support of dental products makes us susceptible to the risk of such claims 
a successful product liability claim or claim arising as a result of use of our products or services brought against us  or the negative publicity brought up by such claim  could have a material adverse effect on our business 
we maintain product liability insurance with coverage limits of million per occurrence and million per year 
while we believe that we maintain adequate insurance coverage that is reasonable and customary for our business  we cannot assure that the amount of insurance will be adequate to satisfy claims made against us in the future  or that we will be able to obtain insurance in the future at satisfactory rates or in adequate amounts 
future growth may place strains on our managerial  operational and financial resources and we may be unable to recruit and retain qualified personnel 
if we grow as expected  a significant strain on our managerial  operational and financial resources may occur 
further  as the number of associated centers  customers  advertisers and other business partners grows  we will be required to manage multiple relationships with various center dentists  associated center dentists  customers  strategic partners and other third parties 
future growth or increase in the number of our strategic relationships may strain our managerial  operational and financial resources  thereby inhibiting our ability to achieve the rapid execution necessary to successfully implement our business plan 
in addition  our future success will also depend on our ability to expand our sales and marketing organization and our support organization commensurate with the growth of our business 
we may experience shortages of the supplies we need because we do not have long term agreements with suppliers 
our success depends to a large degree on our ability to provide our affiliated dentists with our latw systems  and a sufficient supply of teeth whitening gels and maintenance products 
since our bs was first used commercially  we have relied upon manufacturing and supply agreements with multiple suppliers and a single manufacturer of our latw systems 
effective april   the company s latw systems are manufactured by peak industries  longmont  colorado  pursuant to an agreement between the company and peak 
we have no long term purchase contracts or other contractual assurance of continued supply  pricing or access to new products 
while we believe that we have good relationships with our suppliers and our manufacturer  if we are unable to extend or secure manufacturing services or to obtain component parts or finished products from one or more key vendors on a timely basis and on acceptable commercial terms  our results of operations could be seriously harmed 
we need to successfully manage our growth in order for the addition of any new associated centers to be profitable 
even though we have grown in the past two years in terms of numbers of centers and associated centers opened and in operation  we may not be able to achieve profitable operations at the centers 
we currently have centers in operation 
our future growth primarily depends upon expansion of the number of our associated centers 
we cannot assure that we will be successful in expanding the number of associated centers  or that such associated centers will achieve sales levels satisfactory to us 
britesmile has certain debt 
britesmile has million of debt outstanding as of december  the degree to which britesmile is leveraged could have important consequences to the shareholders  including the following o britesmile s ability to obtain additional financing for working capital  capital expenditures  acquisitions or general corporate purposes may be impaired  o britesmile must pay interest on its debt  leaving less funds for other purposes  o britesmile may be at a competitive disadvantage to its less leveraged competitors  and o britesmile may be more vulnerable to a downturn in general economic conditions 
if britesmile were to default on its debt obligations for any reason  there can be no assurance that any assets will remain for britesmile s shareholders after payment of amounts owed to debt holders 
see item management s discussion of financial condition and results of operations  liquidity and capital resources 
britesmile does not intend to pay dividends 
britesmile does not anticipate paying any cash dividends on its common stock to its shareholders for the foreseeable future 
britesmile intends to retain future earnings  if any  for use in the operation and expansion of its business 
in addition  it is possible that any debt financing agreements entered into by britesmile in the future may contain restrictions on britesmile s ability to declare dividends 
we cannot guarantee that the patents we have applied for will be granted  or that even if granted  they will not be infringed by competitors 
the company has an expansive and growing portfolio of patents to protect its intellectual property rights 
in  a number of patents relating to the latw systems were granted  including patents covering the methods of whitening comprising of a bleaching composition exposed to light to accelerate whitening  which has been asserted in a patent lawsuit against a major competitor 
the company also has a number of patent applications related to the composition of our whitening gel  tissue isolation useful in light activated teeth whitening  our business method and our unique system of delivery of light to all teeth simultaneously 
in addition  we have ongoing research and development efforts to expand and improve our current technology  and to develop new teeth whitening compositions and light devices 
although the company intends to continue to apply for patents as advised by patent counsel  there can be no assurance that such patents will be issued or that  when they are issued  they will not be infringed upon by third parties or that they will cover all aspects of the product or systems to which they relate 
the rights we rely upon to protect our intellectual property underlying our products and services may not be adequate  which could enable third parties to use our technology and would reduce our ability to compete in the market 
in addition to patents  we rely on a combination of trade secrets  copyright and trademark laws  nondisclosure agreements and other contractual provisions and technical measures to protect our intellectual property rights 
nevertheless  these measures may not be adequate to safeguard the technology underlying our products and services 
if they do not protect our rights  third parties could use our technology  and our ability to compete in the market would be reduced 
in addition  employees  consultants and others who participate in the development of our products and services may breach their agreements with us regarding our intellectual property  and we may not have adequate remedies for the breach 
we also may not be able to effectively protect our intellectual property rights in some foreign countries 
for a variety of reasons  we may decide not to file for additional patent  copyright or trademark protection outside of the united states or in foreign jurisdictions 
we also realize that our trade secrets may become known through other means not currently foreseen by us 
notwithstanding our efforts to protect our intellectual property  our competitors may independently develop similar or alternative technologies or products that are equal or superior to our technology and products without infringing on any of our intellectual property rights or design around our proprietary technologies 
our products or services could infringe on the intellectual property rights of others  which may cause us to engage in costly litigation and  if we are not successful  could also cause us to pay substantial damages and prohibit us from selling our products or services 
third parties may assert infringement or other intellectual property claims against us 
we may have to pay substantial damages  including treble damages  for past infringement if it is ultimately determined that our products or services infringe a third party s proprietary rights 
further  we may be prohibited from selling our products before we obtain a license  which  if available at all  may require us to pay substantial royalties 
even if these claims are without merit  defending a lawsuit takes significant time  may be expensive and may divert management s attention from other business concerns 
notwithstanding the foregoing  we are not aware of any infringement claims asserted against us by others 
we are subject to government regulation regarding the corporate practice of dentistry 
our corporate structure  operation of centers and contractual relationships with the licensed dentists at our centers are subject to government regulation and may be reviewed by applicable state agencies governing the practice of dentistry such as a board of dental examiners 
we believe that our present and contemplated operation of centers is and will be in compliance in all material respects with applicable federal  state and local laws and regulations  and that favorable review of our corporate structure would be obtained from any state agency which chooses to review our operational structure 
however  we cannot assure that such favorable review would be obtained in all instances 
if we are unable to obtain favorable review  we may be subject to penalties
