item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview the company operates in three industry segments 
the company s metals recycling business collects  processes and recycles steel and other metals through its facilities 
the company s steel manufacturing business operates a mini mill near portland  oregon  which melts recycled metal  produces finished steel products and maintains one mill depot in southern california and one in central california 
the company s auto parts business purchases used and wrecked automobiles and allows retail customers the opportunity of extracting parts for purchase in its self service auto parts stores  with located in california  two in nevada and one store in each of texas  utah  illinois and indiana 
additionally  the company is a non controlling partner in joint ventures that are either in the metals recycling business or are suppliers of unprocessed metals 
the joint ventures in the metals recycling business sell recycled metals that have been processed at their facilities processing and also buy and sell third parties processed metals brokering 
note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements describes the auto parts business acquisition that occurred on february  under statement of financial accounting standards no 
sfas  business combinations  the acquisition is considered a step acquisition due to the fact that the company had a significant joint venture interest in the acquired business for a number of years 
additionally  since the acquisition occurred during the year  the company elected to include it in the consolidated results as though it had occurred at the beginning of fiscal thus  the fiscal statement of operations  balance sheet and statement of cash flows have been adjusted to consolidate the acquisition as of september  also  the acquired businesses were consolidated with the company s previous interest in the business to form a separate reporting segment called the auto parts business 
consolidation accounting requires the company to adjust its earnings for the ownership interests it did not own during the reporting period 
during fiscal  net income was reduced by million for minority interests  net of income taxes  representing the share of income attributable to various continuing minority partners of the business 
also  for the period from september  through february   net income was reduced by million of pre acquisition interests  net of income taxes  representing the share of income attributable to the former joint venture partner prior to the acquisition 
the financial results of the acquired business for periods prior to fiscal continue to be accounted for using the equity method and are included in the joint venture businesses reporting segment 
critical accounting policies and estimates the company s discussion and analysis of its financial condition and results of operations are based upon its consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles 
the preparation of these financial statements requires the company to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an ongoing basis  the company evaluates its estimates 
the company bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
these estimates and assumptions provide a basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions  and these differences may be material 
the company believes the following critical accounting policies affect its more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements 
inventories inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market 
cost is determined using the average cost method 
the production and accounting process utilized by the company to record recycled metals inventory quantities relies on significant estimates 
the company relies upon perpetual inventory records that utilize estimated recoveries and yields that are based upon historical trends and periodic tests for certain unprocessed metal commodities 
over time  these estimates are reasonably good indicators of what is ultimately produced  however  actual recoveries and yields can vary depending on product quality  moisture content and source of the unprocessed metal 
to assist in validating the reasonableness of the estimates  the company not only runs periodic tests  but also performs physical inventories 
physical inventories can normally detect significant variations in volume  but because of variations in product density  holding period and production processes utilized to manufacture the product  physical inventories will not generally detect smaller variations 
to mitigate this risk  the company adjusts it physical inventories when the volume of a commodity is low and a physical inventory can more accurately predict the remaining volume 
revenue recognition the company recognizes revenue when it has a contract or purchase order from a customer with a fixed price  the title and risk of loss transfer to the buyer  and collectibility is reasonably assured which is generally upon shipment 
title for both metals and finished steel products transfers upon shipment 
for retail sales by the company s auto parts business  revenues are recognized when customers pay for salvaged vehicle parts or when wholesale products are shipped to the customer location 
substantially all of the company s ferrous export sales of recycled metal are made with letters of credit  minimizing credit risk 
however  domestic ferrous recycled metal sales  nonferrous sales and sales of finished steel are generally made on open account 
historically  there have been very few sales returns and adjustments that impact the ultimate collection of revenues  therefore no provisions are made when the sale is recognized 
bad debt reserves the company evaluates the collectibility of its accounts  notes and advances receivable based on a combination of factors 
in cases where management is aware of circumstances that may impair a specific customer s ability to meet its financial obligations to the company  management records a specific allowance against amounts due and reduce the net recognized receivable to the amount we reasonably believe will be collected 
for all other customers  the company maintains a reserve that considers the total receivables outstanding  historical collection rates and economic trends 
environmental costs the company operates in industries that inherently possess environmental risks 
to manage these risks  the company employs both its own environmental staff and outside consultants 
these consultants and finance personnel meet regularly to stay updated on environmental risks 
the company estimates future costs for known environmental remediation requirements and accrues for them on an undiscounted basis when it is probable that the company has incurred a liability and the related costs can be reasonably estimated 
the regulatory and government management of these projects is extremely complex  which is one of the primary factors that make it difficult to assess the cost of potential and future remediation of potential sites 
when only a wide range of estimated amounts can be reasonable established  and no other amount within the range is better than another  the minimum amount of the range is recorded in the financial statements 
adjustments to the liabilities are made when additional information becomes available that affects the estimated costs to remediate 
in a number of cases  it is possible the company may receive reimbursement through prior insurance 
in these situations  recoveries of environmental remediation costs from other parties are recorded as assets when collection is accomplished 
taxes deferred income taxes reflect the differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities at year end based on enacted tax laws and statutory tax rates 
tax credits are recognized as a reduction of income tax expense in the year the credit arises 
a valuation allowance is established when necessary to reduce deferred tax assets  including net operating loss carryforwards  to the amount more likely than not to be realized 
periodically  the company reviews the deferred tax assets to assess whether the valuation allowances continue to be necessary 
the valuation allowances will be reversed when there is significant evidence that it is more likely than not that the assets will be realized 
goodwill and other intangibles effective june   the company adopted statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  under which goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite lives are no longer amortized 
the company reviews its goodwill and non amortizable intangibles on an annual basis for impairment  or more frequently if impairment indicators arise  in accordance with the provisions of sfas no 
prior to adoption of sfas no 
 the company amortized goodwill and other intangible assets over their estimated useful lives 
results of operations during fiscal  the company s operations improved dramatically  resulting in a record year for revenue and net income 
both the company s metals recycling business and steel manufacturing business recognized marked improvements over last year 
as well  the company s joint ventures in the metals recycling business benefited from rising selling prices to improve their profitability by nearly 
also  as explained further below  the company acquired a new business segment  the auto parts business  in fiscal this segment significantly contributed to earnings during the year 
the results of operations of the company depend in large part upon demand and prices for recycled metals in world markets and steel products in the western united states 
for example  increasing steel demand and prices led to improved profitability during the period of fiscal through fiscal however  during fiscal and  the asian financial crisis severely curtailed demand and decreased prices  causing a negative impact on the results of the metal recycling business 
during fiscal  the company saw demand for recycled metal rise  but unusually large supplies of recycled ferrous metal became available from certain countries that were part of the former soviet union  thereby holding prices down 
in addition  domestic demand for finished steel products was strong  but lower cost imports  primarily from asia  caused average prices to generally decline 
in fiscal  the demand for recycled metals declined in the united states as domestic steel production declined  however  demand in asia  particularly in china  remained firm 
selling prices also continued to be adversely affected by supplies coming out of the former soviet union and during the first six months of fiscal  recycled metals prices approached record lows due primarily to this surplus coupled with weak domestic demand 
domestic demand for finished steel products declined due to the slowing united states economy and competition from lower cost imports 
the result was a record low average net selling price for the steel manufacturing business during fiscal during the second half of fiscal  certain countries of the former soviet union started imposing export tariffs and bans on recycled ferrous metal 
as a result  recycled ferrous metal supplies to global markets declined causing prices to increase 
many of the company s customers postponed purchases during the first quarter of fiscal believing that these delays would cause prices to decline 
however  demand  which is being fueled primarily by china and korea  continued to remain strong and the company continues to experience improved market conditions 
throughout much of the remainder of fiscal  selling prices continued to rise primarily due to the tight supply of ferrous metal available in the export market and the weakness of the us dollar relative to other foreign currencies 
the joint ventures in the metals recycling business were affected by the same supply and demand factors as the company s wholly owned metals recycling business 
the steel manufacturing business saw higher average selling prices and higher sales volumes during fiscal due primarily to a higher valued product sales mix and lower volumes of competing imported steel  which is partially attributed to the weakness of the us dollar 
additionally  during the spring of  the us government imposed anti dumping and countervailing duties on certain wire rod imports from eight foreign countries  which combined with higher worldwide ferrous recycled metals prices the primary raw material used to produce much of the world s wire rod  improved the competitive position of domestic wire rod producers 
the steel manufacturing business turned this price parity with imported wire products into increased sales and market share 
in the second quarter of fiscal  the steel manufacturing business completed two capital projects to one of the rolling mills  which now allow it to produce higher margin specialty wire products  to improve the packaging of coiled products and increase the productivity on all wire production 
the auto parts business segment was formed in the second quarter of fiscal as a result of the acquisition referred to in the overview section 
it purchases salvaged vehicles  sells parts from those vehicles through its retail facilities and wholesale operations and sells the remaining portion of the vehicles to metal recyclers 
the retail operations are somewhat seasonal and principally affected by weather conditions and promotional events 
since the stores are open to the natural elements  during periods of prolonged wet  cold or extreme heat  the retail business tends to slow down due to the difficult customer working conditions 
further  the company generally runs promotional events during seasonably moderate times of the year when it is most likely to affect the buying patterns of its retail customers 
as a result  the company s first and third fiscal quarters tend to generate the most retail sales and the second and fourth fiscal quarters are the slowest in terms of retail sales 
the auto parts business other primary source of revenue is the sale of scrap metal and other parts wholesale 
revenues for the wholesale product lines are principally affected by commodity prices and shipping schedules 
as mentioned earlier in the discussions regarding the metal recycling business  recycled metal prices have increased dramatically since the second quarter of fiscal  which has positively affected the revenues and profits of the auto parts business 
the following tables set forth information regarding the breakdown of revenues between the company s metals recycling business  steel manufacturing business and auto parts business  and the breakdown of income from operations between the metals recycling business  the steel manufacturing business  the auto parts business  joint ventures  corporate and eliminations 
additional financial information relating to business segments is contained in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
revenues year ended august  in millions metals recycling business ferrous nonferrous other recycled metals total auto parts business steel manufacturing business intercompany sales eliminations total income loss from operations year ended august  in millions metals recycling business auto parts business steel manufacturing business jvs in the metals recycling business jv suppliers of metals corporate expense intercompany eliminations impairment and other nonrecurring charges income from operations ferrous recycled metal sales from the metals recycling business to the steel manufacturing business  and auto body sales from the auto parts business to the metals recycling business  are made at negotiated rates per ton that are intended to approximate market 
consequently  these intercompany sales tend to produce intercompany profits  which are eliminated until the finished products are ultimately sold to third parties 
includes year end lifo adjustments that reduced income from operations by million and million in fiscal and  respectively  and increased income from operations by million in fiscal corporate expense consists primarily of unallocated corporate expense for services that benefit all three business segments 
because of this unallocated expense  the income from operations of each segment does not reflect the income from operations the segment would have as a stand alone business 
impairment and other nonrecurring charges related to the metals recycling business in fiscal and to the auto parts business in fiscal the amounts are shown separately to assist in understanding the business financial results 
fiscal compared to fiscal revenues 
consolidated revenues increased million to million for fiscal compared with fiscal revenues for the metals recycling business increased due to higher selling prices and volumes as worldwide demand for ferrous metals strengthened through the year 
revenues for the steel manufacturing business also increased due to higher average net selling prices and increased sales volumes 
consolidated revenues also increased by million due to the addition of the auto parts business as a consolidated business 
the metals recycling business generated revenues of million  before intercompany eliminations  which is an increase of million 
ferrous revenues increased million to million as a result of an increase in tons sold and higher average selling prices net of shipping cost average net selling prices 
ferrous sales volumes increased  tons and the average net selling price of ferrous recycled metal increased to per ton 
curtailed supplies of ferrous recycled metals from the countries of the former soviet union  growing worldwide demand and the weakness of the us dollar drove the volume and price increases 
asia  especially china and korea  continues to be the primary destination of export sales 
in fiscal  the metals recycling business made export shipments aggregating million tons  an increase of  tons compared with fiscal domestic third party ferrous tonnage also increased by  tons to  tons 
sales to the company s steel manufacturing business increased to  tons due to increased demand in this business 
nonferrous revenues increased million to million due primarily to higher average prices 
the average net nonferrous selling price in fiscal was per pound  an increase of per pound from fiscal the steel manufacturing business revenues increased from revenues recognized in the prior year to million in fiscal primarily due to higher average net selling prices and higher volumes for all major product lines 
the volume of finished steel products sold increased  along with the average net selling price per ton  compared with fiscal sales of finished steel products were up to  tons while the average net selling price per ton increased per ton to per ton 
the increase in the average sales price per ton was primarily due to a higher valued product sales mix and lower supplies of competing importing steel  which was partially attributed to the weakness of the us dollar 
also  towards the end of the fiscal second quarter  the company and other steel producers increased their selling prices for rebar 
additionally  merchant bar selling prices have increased modestly to adjust to the costs of production 
the increase in sales volume was due to a increase in the volume of wire rod and a increase in sales volume of rebar 
the higher wire rod volume was due to import duties imposed by the us government in the spring of on certain wire rod products 
the increase in rebar volumes is primarily due to increased demand as wholesale customers bought inventory ahead of the effective date of announced price increases 
as previously mentioned  the auto parts business was acquired on february  and was considered a step acquisition allowing the consolidation of its financial results as of the beginning of fiscal as such  revenues for fiscal included million related to the auto parts business with no comparable revenues being recognized for financial statement purposes in fiscal in order to aid the reader s understanding of the financial performance of this segment  the pro forma fiscal revenues for the auto parts business were million 
the million increase was primarily caused by an increase in wholesale revenues driven by higher average sales prices for scrapped auto bodies due to rising ferrous recycled metal prices 
wholesale prices also benefited from the implementation of a new core distribution center that aggregated production volumes and provided an improved venue to sell these products to competing customers 
retail revenues were also up due to growth in part sales and admissions pricing 
cost of goods sold 
consolidated cost of goods sold increased million to million and was percent of revenues compared with in fiscal the decrease to was primarily due to improved margins  coming principally from higher selling prices  for all of the company s business segments 
cost of goods sold for the metals recycling business increased million to million before intercompany eliminations 
the cost of goods sold as a percentage of revenues decreased from for fiscal to during fiscal  contributing to a million increase in gross profit 
this increase in gross margin in fiscal was primarily attributable to higher selling prices and higher sales volume  partially offset by higher prices paid to suppliers of ferrous recycled metals and higher export freight rates  resulting in an per ton increase in the average ferrous metals cost of sales per ton 
cost of sales per ferrous ton increased as higher selling prices and higher demand for processed metal pushed up the purchase price the company paid for unprocessed metal 
competition from other recyclers for the purchase of unprocessed metal was also a factor in the cost increases 
the average export freight rate climbed per ton in fiscal compared with fiscal cost of goods sold for the steel manufacturing business increased million to million and decreased as a percentage of revenues from in fiscal to in fiscal the decrease was due to a higher average sales price per ton and lowered fixed cost per ton  due to larger production volumes spreading the fixed costs over more tons produced  partially offset by higher prices paid for scrap metal 
melt shop production increased and rolling mill production increased compared with fiscal fiscal production volumes were temporarily curtailed in order to reduce inventory to better match it with customer demand 
average cost of sales per ton increased per ton compared with the prior fiscal year 
as this increase in cost of sales per ton was more than offset by the per ton increase in average net selling price  gross profit improved by million in fiscal compared with fiscal the auto parts business cost of sales was million lower during fiscal as compared to the pro forma cost of sales for fiscal as a percentage of revenues  cost of sales decreased from to 
this improvement was due to higher margins realized on wholesale sales partially offset by higher labor costs 
impairment and other nonrecurring charges 
in connection with the acquisition of the auto parts business  the company conducted an environmental due diligence investigation 
based upon new information obtained in this investigation  the joint venture accrued million in environmental liabilities in the second quarter of fiscal for remediation costs at the auto parts business s store locations 
no environmental proceedings are pending at any of these sites 
the company recorded impairment and other nonrecurring charges of million in fiscal the company recorded nonrecurring charges of million for the early termination of a fixed price alaska barge contract of affreightment that management determined was not cost effective 
the alaska barge contract charge included a million write off of a note receivable and a million payment to terminate the contract 
also  an impairment charge of million was recorded for the elimination of an unprofitable car crushing business and an impairment charge of million was recorded for the closure of an under performing yard in reno  nevada 
nonrecurring charges of million were recorded for the loss on the early termination of two vessel charter contracts with a related company 
the company terminated the leases in order to take advantage of market rates which were to per ton lower than the all in contracted rates 
shipping cost savings as a result of the contract termination totaled approximately million 
additionally  a loss of million was recorded for the sale of a non strategic steel forging business 
income from joint ventures 
the company s joint ventures revenues and results of operations were as follows in thousands year ended august  total revenues from external customers recognized by joint ventures in the metals recycling business processing   brokering   joint venture suppliers of metals   income from joint ventures recognized by the company joint ventures in the metals recycling business   joint venture suppliers of metals  the joint ventures in the metals recycling business predominantly sell recycled ferrous and nonferrous metals 
the increase in revenues recognized by these joint ventures is attributable to higher average net ferrous selling prices 
shipments of ferrous metal processed by the joint ventures were million tons for the year ended august  compared with million tons in the prior year 
the volume of ferrous metal brokered by the joint ventures increased to million tons in fiscal compared to million tons in the prior year 
the average net selling price of ferrous recycled metal increased during that period to per ton from per ton  predominantly due to strong demand from asia  especially china and korea 
these joint ventures also increased their sales margins by improving operational efficiencies 
in fiscal  the company s share of income from joint ventures in the metals recycling business increased to million due to higher average net selling prices  increased margins and more efficient operations 
the company s joint ventures with hugo neu corporation  which earned the majority of the income  instituted eva concurrently with the company in fiscal the use of eva coupled with management changes has continued to result in improved operational efficiencies and increased profitability 
operating income in fiscal was reduced by million representing the company s share of the jv lifo inventory adjustment compared with a reduction of million in fiscal revenues of the joint venture suppliers of metals decreased by million from fiscal as compared to the fiscal most of this decrease was caused by the reclassification in fiscal of the pick n pull joint venture  which is now consolidated and included as a new business segment  the auto parts business 
excluding the change caused by this reclassification  revenues decreased million during fiscal compared to last year due to lower selling prices and lower demolition revenue 
the company s equity in income from these joint ventures  excluding the impact of pick n pull  decreased million primarily due to the slowdown in the us economy 
selling and commission expenses 
these expenses increased million compared with fiscal primarily due to an increase in export commission expense caused from higher ferrous recycled metals export sales 
general and administrative expenses 
compared with fiscal  general and administrative expenses increased million 
the consolidation of the auto parts business represents million of this increase 
the remainder of this increase is primarily due to increased bonus accruals directly related to the improvement in the company s eva performance 
interest expense 
in fiscal  interest expense decreased million compared with fiscal due to lower average interest rates and borrowings 
the company s borrowings averaged million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal the average interest rate for fiscal was compared with for fiscal other income and expenses 
other income and expenses decreased million in fiscal compared with fiscal the difference is principally due to the addition of the auto parts business and a harbor maintenance tax refund received in fiscal in addition  this line item includes market value adjustments for changes in investment performance for securities held in a trust for the purpose of funding future non qualified pension payments 
the company recognized gains from the trust fund assets in the amount of million in fiscal and losses of million in fiscal income tax provision 
the company s effective rate of was lower than the federal statutory tax rate for three primary reasons the implementation of sfas has eliminated the amortization of goodwill  some of which had been nondeductible  export sales  which under federal law are taxed at a lower rate than domestic sales  have increased  and net operating loss carryforwards that accompanied an earlier acquisition continue to provide benefit 
the prior year s tax rate of benefited from the two latter items  as well as from the one time recognition of california tax credits that had been generated over the previous ten years 
as part of the acquisition of proler international corp 
proler  the company acquired million of federal net operating loss carryforwards nols 
the company recognized no immediate tax benefit for the nols 
instead  the company set up an offsetting million valuation allowance because the ultimate use of the nols were uncertain given the then current federal tax law proscription against applying the nols to any taxable income other than the post acquisition income generated by proler 
a change to federal tax law in  however  has allowed an annual million of nol to be applied to taxable income from all sources  not just from proler 
due to this change in tax law  the company released an annual million from the valuation allowance  and recognized the corresponding million in tax benefit  in fiscal years  and this is a major reason why the company s effective tax rates have been lower than the statutory rates for those years 
the remaining balance of unused nols  which stands at million as of august   will expire in fiscal years through if not used by then 
the company also acquired million of credits as part of the proler acquisition 
as with the nols  a valuation allowance was set up to offset the credits  the ultimate use of which has been made more likely by the subsequent liberalization of federal tax law 
no part of the valuation allowance has yet to be released 
the credits are not likely to be used until after the nols have been used or expire 
the credits can be carried forward indefinitely 
in fiscal  the company qualified for million of enterprise zone tax credits in the state of california 
these credits can be used to offset california state income taxes to the extent that each corporation in the consolidated group has a california franchise income tax liability 
any credits in excess of the tax liability can be carried forward indefinitely 
these credits  combined with the release of million of valuation allowance pertaining to the nols  were major reasons the company s effective tax rate of for fiscal was well below the statutory rate of 
fiscal compared to fiscal revenues 
consolidated revenues increased million to million for fiscal compared with fiscal revenues for the metals recycling business increased due to higher selling prices and volumes as worldwide demand for ferrous metals strengthened through the year 
revenues for the steel manufacturing business were slightly lower primarily due to lower average net selling prices partially offset by increased sales volumes 
the metals recycling business generated revenues of million  before intercompany eliminations  an increase of million 
ferrous revenues increased million to million as a result of an increase in tons sold and higher average selling prices net of shipping cost average net selling prices 
ferrous volumes increased  tons and the average net selling price of ferrous recycled metal increased to per ton 
diminished supplies of ferrous recycled metals from the countries of the former soviet union and growing worldwide demand drove the volume and price increases 
asia  especially china and korea  continued to be the primary destination of export sales 
in fiscal  the metals recycling business made export shipments aggregating  tons  an increase of  tons compared with fiscal because of the continued soft united states economy  domestic third party ferrous tonnage decreased  ton to  tons 
sales to the company s steel manufacturing business decreased to  tons due to production curtailments in this business 
nonferrous revenues decreased million to million due to a corresponding reduction in sales volume 
the average net nonferrous selling price in fiscal was per pound  a decline of per pound from fiscal the steel manufacturing business recognized revenues of million in fiscal  a decrease of from revenues recognized in the prior year 
the volume of finished steel products sold increased  but the average net selling price per ton decreased compared with fiscal sales of finished steel products were up to  tons while the average net selling price per ton decreased per ton to per ton  a record low 
the decrease in sales revenue was primarily due to lower average net selling prices for all major product lines which were partially offset by the increase in sales volumes 
the decrease in the average sales price per ton was primarily due to the sluggish united states economy and weak end user demand  continuing competition from lower cost steel imports and a shift in product mix from merchant bar to wire rod 
the increase in sales volume was due to a greater sales volume of wire rod  which was partially offset by a decline in the sales volume of merchant bar 
the higher wire rod volume was due to additional demand by a major customer 
tariffs on selected imported steel products enacted in march and april by the international trade commission itc under section of the trade act did not produce any significant price benefits 
cost of goods sold 
consolidated cost of goods increased million to million and was percent of revenues compared with in fiscal the increase to was primarily due to eroded margins for the steel manufacturing business 
gross profit decreased million to million 
cost of goods sold for the metals recycling business increased million to million before intercompany eliminations 
the cost of goods sold as a percentage of revenues increased from for fiscal to during fiscal gross profit increased million compared with fiscal this increase in gross margin in fiscal was primarily attributable to higher selling prices and higher sales volume  partially offset by higher prices paid to suppliers for ferrous recycled metals  resulting in a per ton increase in the average ferrous metals cost of sales per ton 
cost of sales per ferrous ton increased as higher selling prices and higher demand for processed metal pushed up the purchase price the company paid for unprocessed metal 
lower shipping costs per ton partially offset the purchase price increases 
competition from other recyclers for the purchase of unprocessed metal was also a factor in the cost increases 
cost of goods sold for the steel manufacturing business increased million to million and increased as a percentage of revenues from in fiscal to over in fiscal the increase was due to higher fixed costs being spread over fewer production tons as mill curtailments that began in august continued throughout fiscal melt shop production fell and rolling mill production fell compared with fiscal also  contributing to the increase was a rise in energy costs 
energy cost increased due to the western energy shortage which increased contracted power rates 
average cost of sales per ton increased per ton compared with the prior fiscal year 
this increased cost of sales per ton  combined with the per ton reduction in average net selling price  resulted in a decrease in gross profit of million in fiscal compared with fiscal impairment and other nonrecurring charges 
the company recorded impairment and other nonrecurring charges of million in fiscal the company recorded nonrecurring charges of million for the early termination of a fixed price alaska barge contract of affreightment that management determined was not cost effective 
the alaska barge contract charge included a million write off of a note receivable and a million payment to terminate the contract 
also  an impairment charge of million was recorded for the elimination of an unprofitable car crushing business and an impairment charge of million was recorded for the closure of an under performing yard in reno  nevada 
the company now sublets the reno facility and leases the equipment to a third party that sells its recycled metal output to the company 
nonrecurring charges of million were recorded for the loss on the early termination of two vessel charter contracts with a related company 
the company terminated the leases in order to take advantage of market rates which were to per ton lower than the all in contracted rates 
shipping cost savings as a result of the contract termination totaled approximately million 
additionally  a loss of million was recorded for the sale of a non strategic steel forging business 
a number of the charges were a direct result of the company s implementation of economic value added eva which is a tool used to measure financial performance and acceptable returns on investment as well as compensate management on the change in eva performance 
since implementing eva  the company has re analyzed the business performance and related outlook for many of its assets 
the result of these reviews  using the eva tool  led to many operational and management changes in the company s business 
income from joint ventures 
the company s joint ventures revenues and results of operations were as follows in thousands year ended august  total revenues from external customers recognized by joint ventures in the metals recycling business processing   brokering   joint venture suppliers of metals   income from joint ventures recognized by the company joint ventures in the metals recycling business   joint venture suppliers of metals   the joint ventures in the metals recycling business predominantly sell recycled ferrous and nonferrous metals 
the increase in revenues recognized by these joint ventures was attributable to higher average net ferrous selling prices and an increase in tonnage shipped 
shipments of ferrous metal processed by the joint ventures increased to million tons for the year ended august  from million tons in the prior year 
the average net selling price of ferrous recycled metal increased during that period to per ton from per ton  predominantly due to strong demand from asia  especially china and korea 
these joint ventures also increased their sales margins by improving operational efficiencies 
in fiscal  the company s share of income from joint ventures in the metals recycling business increased to million due to increased sales volume  higher average net selling prices  increased margins and more efficient operations 
the company s joint ventures with hugo neu corporation  which earned the majority of the income  instituted eva concurrently with the company in fiscal the use of eva has continued to result in improved operational efficiencies and increased profitability 
operating income in fiscal was reduced by million representing the company s share of the jv lifo inventory adjustment compared with a benefit of million in fiscal operating income in fiscal also benefited by million representing the company s share of a nonrecurring gain on sale of jv property 
both revenues and income from the joint venture suppliers of metal increased from fiscal to fiscal primarily due to increased sales by the company s self service auto dismantling joint venture 
increased sales prices  more efficient operations  and lower interest costs drove the revenue growth and income improvements 
selling and commission expenses 
these expenses increased million compared with fiscal primarily due to an increase in export commission expense caused from higher ferrous recycled metals export sales 
general and administrative expenses 
compared with fiscal  general and administrative expenses increased million primarily due to a million increase in wages as a result of annual merit increases and bonus accruals related to the company s eva performance and a million in increased insurance expense due to adverse insurance market conditions since september  interest expense 
in fiscal  interest expense decreased million compared with fiscal due to lower average borrowings and lower average interest rates 
the company s borrowings averaged million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal the decrease in average borrowings reflected improved cash flow as a result of substantial decreases in inventory during fiscal the average interest rate for fiscal was compared with for fiscal other income 
other income decreased million in fiscal compared with fiscal primarily due to a million decrease in interest income as a result of lower interest rates charged on variable interest rate advances and notes to joint venture businesses 
in addition  this line item includes market value adjustments for changes in investment performance for securities held in a trust for the purpose of funding future non qualified pension payments 
during fiscal and  the company recognized losses from the trust fund assets in the amount of million and million  respectively 
income tax provision 
as part of the acquisition of proler international corp 
proler  the company acquired million of federal net operating loss carryforwards nols 
prior to fiscal  federal tax law placed limitations on the source of the income that could be offset by the nols 
accordingly  the company was not able to record the potential tax benefits from the nols because of the lack of certainty in being able to realize these benefits 
in fiscal  a change in federal tax law allowed the company to use the nols to offset taxable income from all sources  subject to a limit of million per year 
during fiscal  the company continued to benefit from the use of million of nols  which was one of the primary reasons the effective rate was as compared to the statutory rate of 
in fiscal  it was determined that the company qualified for million of enterprise zone tax credits in the state of california 
these credits can be used to offset california state income taxes to the extent that each corporation in the consolidated group has a california franchise income tax liability 
any credits in excess of the tax liability can be carried forward indefinitely 
the combination of nols and enterprise zone tax credits made the company s effective tax rate for fiscal as compared with a statutory rate of 
as noted above  federal income tax law limits the company s use of nols to million per year 
unused nols may be carried forward and used in subsequent fiscal years  though they will ultimately expire in fiscal years through  if not used by then 
subject to the annual limit  there remains at august  million of proler nols that may be used in future years before they expire 
liquidity and capital resources 
for fiscal  cash generated by operations was million  compared to million last year 
the increase in cash flow provided by operations was primarily the result of improved operating profits 
in fiscal  inventories declined million  generating cash flow of this amount 
capital expenditures totaled million  million  and million for fiscal years  and  respectively 
the increase was due primarily to costs associated with dock renovation and improvement projects at the company s portland  oregon and oakland  california recycling facilities 
as a result of acquisitions completed in both the current and prior years  the company had environmental liabilities that aggregated million as of august  the company expects significant future cash outlays as it incurs the actual costs relating to the remediation of such environmental liabilities 
on may   the company entered into an agreement to refinance its revolving bank credit facility 
the new facility is unsecured  matures in may  and provides for up to million of credit availability 
the facility s interest rates vary 
the company also has an additional unsecured line of credit of million  which is uncommitted 
the company s debt agreements have certain restrictive covenants 
as of august   the company was in compliance with such covenants and had aggregate bank borrowings outstanding of million 
in july  the company s metals recycling joint ventures with hugo neu corporation entered into a million revolving credit facility jv credit facility with a group of banks for working capital and general credit purposes 
prior to that time  the joint ventures working capital and other cash needs had been met by advances provided equally by the company and hugo neu corporation 
the jv credit facility expires in july and is secured by the inventory and receivables of the joint venture businesses 
the company is not a guarantor of the jv credit facility 
the jv credit facility has a number of covenants and restrictions  including restrictions on the level of distributions to the joint venture partners 
as of august   the joint ventures were in compliance with such covenants 
borrowings under the jv credit facility totaled million at august  because the interest rates under the jv credit facility are higher than those obtained by the company  management generally considers it prudent for the joint ventures to reduce the facility balance before remitting cash to the joint venture partners 
the joint venture agreements allow for distributions to the joint venture partners 
no such distributions were declared for fiscal instead  cash flow from operations was primarily used to fund working capital and capital expenditures 
as such  cash received from joint ventures in fiscal was lower than in fiscal the company has certain contractual obligations and commercial commitments to make future payments 
the following table summarizes these future obligations and commitments as of august  in thousands less than after total year years years years long term debt    operating leases      letters of credit   jv credit facility   total      the company has a million credit facility with a group of banks for working capital and other general purposes 
the facility expires in may the company s operating leases increased by million as a result of the acquisition of the auto parts business 
this disclosure assumes that if the jv credit facility is not renewed or refinanced upon expiration  the company and hugo neu corporation would restore their previous arrangement under which each funded one half of the joint ventures cash needs 
pursuant to a stock repurchase program  the company is authorized to repurchase up to million shares of its stock when the market price of the company s stock is not reflective of management s opinion of an appropriate valuation of the stock 
management believes that repurchasing shares under these conditions enhances shareholder value and helps the company manage its targeted capital structure 
during fiscal  the company made no share repurchases 
as of august   a total of million shares had been purchased under this program 
the company believes that the current cash balance  internally generated funds and existing credit facilities will provide adequate financing for capital expenditures  working capital  joint ventures  stock repurchases  debt service requirements and future environmental obligations for the next year 
in the longer term  the company may seek to finance business expansion with additional borrowing arrangements or additional equity financing 
factors that could affect future results 
this form k  including item of part and items and a of part ii  contains forward looking statements  within the meaning of section a of the securities act of and section e of the securities act of  that are made pursuant to the safe harbor provisions of the private securities litigation reform act of one can generally identify these forward looking statements because they contain expect  believe  anticipate  estimate  plans  and other words which convey a similar meaning 
one can also identify these statements as they do not relate strictly to historical or current facts 
examples of factors affecting schnitzer steel industries  inc s wholly owned operations and its joint ventures the company that could cause actual results to differ materially are the following cyclicality and general market considerations selling prices for recycled metals are highly cyclical in nature and subject to worldwide economic conditions 
in addition  the cost and availability of recycled metals are subject to volatile supply and demand conditions beyond the company s control  resulting in periodic fluctuations in recycled metals prices 
while the company attempts to maintain margins by responding to changing recycled metals selling prices through adjustments to its metals purchase prices  the company s ability to do so is limited by competitive factors as well as the impact of lower prices on the volume of recycled metal available to the company 
moreover  increases in recycled metals prices can adversely affect the operating results of the company s steel manufacturing business because increases in steel prices generally lag increases in ferrous recycled metals prices 
the steel industry is also highly cyclical in nature and sensitive to general economic conditions 
future economic downturns or a stagnant economy may adversely affect the performance of the company 
the company expects to continue to experience seasonal fluctuations in its revenues and net income 
revenues can fluctuate significantly quarter to quarter due to factors such as the seasonal slowdown in the construction industry  which is an important buyer of the company s finished steel products 
the timing and extent of the slowdown is also dependent on the weather 
another factor which may affect revenues relates to the seasonal reduction in demand from foreign customers who tend to reduce their finished steel production during the summer months to offset higher energy costs 
also  severe weather conditions may affect the company s global market conditions 
the company makes a number of large ferrous recycled metals shipments to foreign steel producers each year 
customer requirements  shipping schedules and other factors limit the company s control over the timing of these shipments 
variations in the number of foreign shipments from quarter to quarter will result in fluctuations in quarterly revenues and earnings 
the company s expectations regarding ferrous metal sales prices and volumes  as well as earnings  are based in part on a number of assumptions for example  uncertainties relating to customer orders  metal availability  estimated freight rates  cost and volume of inventory yet to be processed  and production output  etc the auto parts business experiences modest seasonal fluctuations in demand 
the retail stores are open to the elements 
during periods of extreme temperatures and precipitation  customers tend to delay their purchases and wait for milder conditions 
as a result  retail sales are generally higher during the spring and fall of each fiscal year and lower in the winter and summer months 
competition the recycled metals industry is highly competitive  with the volume of purchases and sales subject to a number of competitive factors  principally price 
the company has competition from both large and numerous smaller companies in its markets for the purchase of recyclable metals 
the company competes with a number of domestic and foreign recycled metals processors for sales to foreign customers 
in the recent past  lower cost ferrous recycled metals supplies from the countries of the former soviet union have adversely affected the company s ferrous recycled metals selling prices and volumes 
currently  those countries have export tariffs and some outright export bans which have significantly reduced their export volumes and lowered the worldwide supply of ferrous recycled metals these tariffs and bans have had a positive effect on the company s selling prices and volumes 
however  the company cannot predict when or if the countries of the former soviet union will change their export policies and what effect  if any  such changes might have on the company s operating results 
the domestic steel industry also is highly competitive 
steel prices can be highly volatile and price is a significant competitive factor 
the company competes with several steel producers in the western united states for sales of its products 
in recent years  the company has experienced significant foreign competition  which is sometimes subsidized by large government agencies 
there can be no assurance that such competition will not increase in the future 
in march and april  the itc imposed tariffs on imported steel  under section of the trade act  to temporarily aid the domestic steel industry 
in  these tariffs were found to be in violation of global trade rules by a world trade organization wto dispute panel 
the wto has not issued a final report and it is expected that the us government would appeal the decision 
to date  however  those tariffs have not significantly benefited selling prices for finished steel products on the west coast of the united states 
in the spring of  the us government imposed anti dumping and countervailing duties against wire rod products from eight foreign countries 
these duties have assisted the company in increasing sales of wire rod products  any expiration or termination of the duties could have a corresponding adverse effect 
in december  nucor corporation assumed ownership of the assets of birmingham steel corp  a steel manufacturing business in seattle  washington 
nucor corporation  the leader in setting prices in the company s markets  has a significant share of the west coast finished steel market and is considered an aggressive competitor 
the long term impact  if any  that nucor s ownership and operation of birmingham steel s seattle facility will have on the steel manufacturing business and the metals recycling business operating results cannot be determined at this time 
additionally  until recently the steel manufacturing business also competed with the north star mill in kingman  arizona  which was sold to nucor 
that facility is currently idle  but any future start up of its operations could impact the company s market 
joint ventures the company has significant investments in joint venture companies 
the company does not manage the day to day activities of these businesses 
as a result  it does not have the same ability to control the operations and related financial results as it does with its consolidated businesses 
these businesses are  however  affected by many of the same risk factors mentioned above 
therefore  it is difficult to predict the financial results of these businesses 
additionally  two of these joint ventures continue to use lifo inventory accounting  which tends to defer income taxes 
historically  the effects of lifo adjustments are difficult to predict 
energy supply the company and its joint ventures utilize various energy sources to operate their facilities 
in particular  electricity and natural gas currently represent approximately of the cost of steel manufactured for the company s steel manufacturing business 
the steel manufacturing business purchases electric power under a long term contract from mcminnville water light mcminnville which in turn relies on the bonneville power administration bpa 
historically  these contracts have had favorable prices and are long term in nature 
the company has a five year contract that expires in september on october   the bpa increased its electricity rates due to increased demand on the west coast and lower supplies 
this increase was in the form of a cost recovery adjustment clause crac added to bpa s contract with mcminnville 
the crac is an additional monthly surcharge on selected power charges to recover costs associated with buying higher priced power during the west coast power shortage 
because the bpa can adjust the crac every six months  it is not possible to predict future rate changes 
the steel manufacturing business also has a contract for natural gas 
the current contract expires on october  and a new contract has been signed which expires october  the new contract price has increased by 
if the company is unable to negotiate favorable terms of electricity  natural gas and other energy sources  this could adversely affect the performance of the company 
tax laws the company has been able to reduce its effective tax rate below the federal statutory tax rate for each of the last three years by using a combination of net operating loss carryforwards nols  state of california enterprise zone tax credits and foreign sales corporations or extraterritorial income exclusions 
the company cannot predict how future tax law changes might affect the company s effective tax rate 
currency fluctuations demand from the company s foreign customers is partially driven by foreign currency fluctuations relative to the us dollar 
recent weakness of the us dollar relative to foreign currencies has been a significant factor in the increases in recycled metals prices over the last year  as well as resulted in increasing the cost of certain finished steel imports 
strengthening of the us dollar could adversely affect the competitiveness of the company s products in the markets in which the company competes 
the company has no control over such fluctuations and  as such  these dynamics could affect the company s revenues and earnings 
shipping and handling both the metals recycling business and the steel manufacturing business often rely on third parties to handle and transport their products to end users in a timely manner 
the cost to transport the products  in particular by ocean freight  can be affected by circumstances over which the company has no control such as fuel prices  political events  governmental regulations on transportation and changes in market rates due to carrier availability 
insurance the cost of the company s insurance is affected not only by its own loss experience but also by cycles in the insurance market 
the company cannot predict future events and circumstances which could cause rates to materially change such as war  terrorist activities or natural disasters 
auto parts business the auto parts business competes with both full service and self service auto dismantlers as well as larger well financed retail auto parts businesses for retail customers 
periodically  the auto parts business increases prices  which may affect customer flow and buying patterns 
the ultimate impact of these changes cannot be predicted 
also  the business competes for its automobile inventory with other dismantlers  used car dealers  auto auctions and metal recyclers 
inventory costs can fluctuate significantly depending on market conditions and prices for recycled metal 
the auto parts business is subject to a number of other risks that could prevent it from maintaining or exceeding its current levels of profitability  such as volatile supply and demand conditions affecting prices and volumes in the markets for its products  services and raw materials  environmental issues  local and worldwide economic conditions  increased competition  and business integration and management transition issues 
one should understand that it is not possible to predict or identify all factors that could cause actual results to differ from the company s forward looking statements 
consequently  the reader should not consider any such list to be a complete statement of all potential risks or uncertainties 
further  the company does not assume any obligation to update any forward looking statement 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company periodically uses derivative financial instruments to limit exposure to changes in interest rates 
because such derivative instruments are used solely as hedges and not for speculative trading purposes  they do not represent incremental risk to the company 
for further discussion of derivative financial instruments  refer to fair value of financial instruments in the consolidated financial statements included in item  note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements
