item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
results of operations the following table sets forth the percent relationship of certain items to net sales for the periods indicated for the years ended june  net sales gross profit selling  general and administrative expenses interest 


other income 

earnings before federal income taxes net earnings federal screw works reported net sales of million in fiscal  which represented a decrease from fiscal sales of million 
net sales for fiscal decreased from fiscal sales of million 
there were no significant changes in sales in fiscal from fiscal the decrease in was the result of lower demand from our customers 
gross profits increased slightly to million in fiscal  a million increase from fiscal while sales for the year were approximately equal to the previous year  the company s net earnings exclusive of the special gains from the sale of insurance stocks last year were up 
the increase of  is attributable to improved productivity and cost reductions in manufacturing and administrative expense 
this occurred despite pressure from most of our customers for price reductions 
fiscal gross profits decreased to million compared to the million level realized in this decrease is attributable to the reduction of million in net sales 
as a percentage of total sales  the company expects to gradually ship less to automobile manufacturers and more to tier one suppliers  reflecting the greater manufacturing responsibilities assumed by tier one suppliers 
at this date  it is impossible to quantify the future effect of this trend and  secondly  to quantify our gradual shift in business from the automobile manufacturers to the major automobile supplier companies 
the company is dependent upon sales to the two largest us automobile manufacturers  a condition that has existed for over fifty years 
although the company has purchase orders from such customers  such purchase orders generally provide for supplying the customer s requirements for a particular model or model year rather than for manufacturing a specific quantity of products 
the loss of any one of such customers or significant purchase orders could have a material adverse effect on the company 
these customers are also able to exert considerable pressure on component suppliers to reduce costs  improve quality and provide additional design and engineering capabilities 
there can be no assurance that the additional costs of increased quality standards  price reductions or additional capabilities required by such customers will not have a material adverse effect on the financial condition or results of operations of the company 
three years ago the company rejoined the daimlerchrysler supply base after a four year absence 
sales to daimlerchrysler  although not material  are gradually increasing 
in addition  the company received orders in fiscal from several new customers which management believes will result in new business in and the receipt of orders for the  and model years continues to be encouraging 
refrigeration sales in fiscal  which approximated of total sales  were level with the prior fiscal year 
refrigeration sales in fiscal decreased to of total sales  from of total sales in fiscal as a percentage of growth  refrigeration sales growth historically has been greater than automotive sales growth 
this has not been the case for the past four years 
the company has not been able to increase its business with the asian and european transplant suppliers in either of the past two fiscal years 
again  outsourcing programs were not a factor in fiscal  which is consistent with fiscal and despite this  the company believes that these programs will be a source of significant new business in the future 
as a percentage of net sales  selling  general and administrative expenses were in fiscal in fiscal and fiscal these expenses were and of net sales  respectively 
interest expense decreased in fiscal because of a decrease in short term interest rates under the company s revolving credit and term loan agreement 
interest expense increased in fiscal because of an increase in average borrowings under the agreement 
included in other income for fiscal is  which the company received as a result of the sale of stock acquired in connection with the demutualization of insurance companies 
the net after tax gains from these transactions were  in the second quarter and  in the third quarter of fiscal environmental the company s management has determined that a material loss resulting from environmental matters is not reasonably possible 
dividends cash dividends declared in fiscal year were per share  more than that declared in fiscal and less than that declared in fiscal the company declared a for stock split on february   payable as a stock dividend april  the dividend per share amounts have been adjusted to retroactively give effect to the stock split

liquidity and capital resources cash flows from operating activities approximated million in fiscal this compares to million in and million in capital expenditures for fiscal were million  primarily related to the purchase of equipment and expansion of facilities in order to improve production efficiencies and enable the company to meet increased future demand for its products 
capital expenditures in fiscal years and were million and million  respectively 
expenditures for additional equipment during fiscal are presently expected to approximate million  of which million had been committed as of june  these future capital expenditures are expected to be financed from cash generated from operations and additional borrowing capacity under the revolving credit and term loan agreement 
net cash used in financing activities was million in fiscal this compares to million used in financing activities in fiscal and million provided by financing activities in fluctuations in these activities have been influenced principally by borrowings and repayments under the company s revolving credit and term loan agreement 
on october   the company extended its revolving credit and term loan agreement by one year 
the expiration date for this agreement is now october   and is renewable annually for an additional year 
borrowings up to million and capital expenditures of million annually are permitted under the agreement 
the company has the option to convert borrowings under the facility to a term note through october  payments under the term note  if the conversion option were exercised  would be made quarterly and could extend to october  therefore  borrowings under the revolving credit and term loan agreement  which were  at june   and  at june   are classified as long term debt 
working capital at june   amounted to  as compared to working capital of  at june  the decrease resulted primarily from a decrease in inventories 
inventories were reduced to reflect lower demand from our automotive customers and also to reflect the elimination of strike banks required earlier but no longer necessary with the signing of a new four year contract with the employees of our romulus division effective february  statement of financial accounting standards sfas no
