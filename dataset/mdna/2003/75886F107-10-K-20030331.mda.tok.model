item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations general we are a biopharmaceutical company that discovers  develops  and intends to commercialize pharmaceutical products for the treatment of serious medical conditions 
our product pipeline includes product candidates for the treatment of obesity  rheumatoid arthritis and other inflammatory conditions  cancer and related disorders  allergies  asthma  and other diseases and disorders 
developing and commercializing new medicines entails risk and significant expense 
since inception we have not generated any sales or profits from the commercialization of any of our product candidates 
below is a summary of our leading clinical and preclinical research programs 
we retain sole ownership and marketing rights for each of these programs  and currently are developing them independent of any corporate partners except for the il trap  as described in the recent developments section included in part i  item of this form k 
axokine acts on the brain region regulating food intake and energy expenditure and is being developed for the treatment of obesity 
in july  we initiated a phase iii clinical program of axokine in overweight and obese subjects 
we began enrolling subjects in the initial pivotal trial in september and in january completed enrollment of approximately  subjects in sites across the united states 
this pivotal trial included a month treatment period  which the company announced was completed in january  in which subjects received daily subcutaneous self injections of placebo or axokine 
as described in the recent developments section  included in part i  item of this form k  we reported data from the month treatment period of the axokine pivotal trial on march  the treatment period is being followed by a twelve month open label extension phase  during which all study subjects receive axokine 
as of december   the average treatment period for people in this pivotal trial was months 
in june  we announced the initiation of a clinical trial to assess the safety and efficacy of axokine in overweight and obese individuals with type diabetes mellitus 
in july  we announced that we had completed enrollment for two additional trials  each of which includes approximately subjects  that are designed to evaluate the safety of intermittent treatment with axokine and to study maintenance of weight loss following short term treatment regimens 
the company announced in january that axokine has received fast track designation from the fda for the treatment of severely obese people who are unresponsive to  intolerant of  or unsuitable candidates for certain fda approved medicines for the long term treatment of obesity 
interleukin cytokine trap il trap protein based product candidate designed to bind the interleukin called il cytokine and prevent its interaction with cell surface receptors 
il is thought to play a major role in rheumatoid arthritis and other inflammatory diseases 
in july  we announced the initiation of a dose ranging phase ii trial that will involve approximately participants to study the safety and efficacy of the il trap in people with rheumatoid arthritis 

table of contents subjects in the study will receive  in a double blind manner  either placebo or one of three different dose levels of the il trap 
the results from this trial are expected to be available mid year vegf trap protein based therapeutic candidate designed to bind vascular endothelial growth factor called vegf  also known as vascular permeability factor or vpf and prevent its interaction with cell surface receptors 
vegf is required for the growth of blood vessels that are needed for tumors to grow and is a potent regulator of vascular permeability and leak 
in  we initiated a dose escalation phase i clinical trial designed to assess the safety and tolerability of vegf trap in subjects with solid tumor malignancies and or non hodgkin s lymphoma 
this trial currently is in progress and is expected to end in interleukin interleukin cytokine trap il trap protein based product candidate designed to bind the interleukin and interleukin called il and il cytokines and prevent their interaction with cell surface receptors 
il and il are thought to play a major role in diseases such as asthma  allergic disorders  and other inflammatory diseases 
in october  we initiated a phase i trial for the il trap in adult subjects with mild to moderate asthma 
this trial is a placebo controlled  double blind  dose escalation study to assess the safety and tolerability of the molecule 
pegylated axokine chemically modified version of axokine that is being evaluated for its potential to remain in the bloodstream longer than unmodified axokine in obese subjects 
preliminary results of a phase i trial demonstrated a long pharmacokinetic half life  potentially compatible with once per week dosing regimens 
in its current form  the molecule is not optimally absorbed into the blood stream and has caused unacceptable injection site reactions 
we are currently working to develop an improved form of pegaxokine 
angiopoietins a new family of growth factors that act specifically on the endothelium cells that line blood vessels 
angiopoietins may be useful for growing blood vessels in diseased hearts and other tissues with decreased blood flow and for repairing blood vessel leaks that cause swelling and edema in many different diseases such as stroke  diabetic retinopathy  and inflammatory diseases 
we have an active preclinical research program covering this family of growth factors 
we have not yet selected a specific molecule to advance into clinical development or a specific indication for such development 
in addition to the above programs which we are conducting independent of any corporate partners  we have formed collaborations to advance other research and development efforts 
we are conducting research with the procter gamble company in muscle diseases and other fields 
we are also collaborating with medarex  inc to discover  develop  and commercialize certain human antibodies as therapeutics 
in partnership with amgen  we have development rights to neurotrophin  or nt  a clinical compound for the treatment of constipating conditions  although there are no ongoing development activities for nt at this time 
in all of these research collaborations  we retain of the commercialization rights 
we have not received revenue from the commercialization of our product candidates and may never receive such revenues 
before revenues from the commercialization of our product candidates can be realized  we or our collaborators must overcome a number of hurdles which include successfully completing our research and development efforts and obtaining regulatory approval from the fda or regulatory authorities in other countries 
in addition  the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries are rapidly evolving and highly competitive  and new developments may render our products and technologies noncompetitive or obsolete 
from inception on january  through december   we had a cumulative loss of million 
in the absence of revenues from the commercialization of our product candidates or other sources  the amount  timing  nature  or source of which cannot be predicted  our losses will continue as we conduct our research and development activities 
our activities may expand over time and may require additional resources and we expect our operating losses to be substantial over at least the next several years 
our losses may fluctuate from quarter to quarter and will depend  among other factors  on the timing of certain expenses and on the progress of our research and development efforts 

table of contents results of operations years ended december  and our total revenue was million in both and contract research and development revenue decreased to million in from million in as revenue from amgen regeneron partners decreased from million in to approximately  in  due to the completion of studies conducted on behalf of the partnership 
under our long term collaboration agreement with procter gamble  research payments  which are included in contract research and development revenue  were million per quarter before adjustments for inflation in both and contract manufacturing revenue relates primarily to our long term agreement with merck to manufacture a vaccine intermediate at our rensselaer  new york facility 
in  contract manufacturing revenue increased to million from million in  due primarily to the receipt of a non recurring million payment related to services we provided to merck in prior years 
we shipped similar quantities of intermediate to merck in and revenue and the related manufacturing expense are recognized as the product is shipped  after acceptance by merck 
our total operating expenses increased to million in from million in research and development expenses increased to million in from million in  primarily due to expansion of our clinical development programs  especially our phase iii clinical program for axokine which we initiated in july and our phase ii clinical program for il trap which we initiated in july we also expanded our research programs in  principally related to our proprietary velocigene tm technology platform 
research and development expenses were of total operating expenses in  compared to in contract manufacturing expenses were million in both and primarily because we shipped similar quantities of product to merck each year 
general and administrative expenses increased to million in from million in  due primarily to higher administrative staffing to support the growth of the company and higher fees paid to outside service providers  including higher patent prosecution and legal expenses related to the expansion of our intellectual property portfolio 
investment income decreased to million in from million in due to lower effective interest rates on investment securities during the full year and lower levels of interest bearing investments in the fourth quarter of  compared to the fourth quarter of  as we funded our operations 
our share of the loss in amgen regeneron partners decreased to approximately  in  compared to million in  due to the completion of studies conducted on behalf of the partnership 
interest expense increased to million in from million in  due to interest incurred on the million aggregate principal amount of convertible senior subordinated notes that we issued in october these notes bear interest at per annum  payable semi annually 
our net loss in was million  or per share basic and diluted  compared to a net loss of million  or per share basic and diluted  in years ended december  and our total revenue decreased to million in from million in contract research and development revenue decreased to million in from million in under our long term collaboration agreement with procter gamble  research payments decreased effective in the first quarter of to million per quarter before adjustments for inflation from million per quarter for the first two quarters of and million per quarter for last two quarters of in addition  revenue from amgen regeneron partners decreased to million in from million in due to the cessation of clinical trial activity on brain derived neurotrophic factor  or bdnf  in january and the substantial completion of our phase ii studies of nt in  research progress payments consisted of two non recurring payments totaling million from procter gamble related to our long term collaboration agreement and a non recurring payment of million reduced by million of japanese withholding tax from sumitomo pharmaceuticals related to the development of bdnf in japan 
contract manufacturing revenue decreased to million in  compared to million in contract manufacturing revenue related to our long term agreement with merck to manufacture a vaccine intermediate decreased to million in from million in  primarily because intermediate manufactured in the second half of was not shipped to merck until revenue and the related manufacturing expense are recognized as the product is shipped  after acceptance by merck 
contract 
table of contents manufacturing revenue in also included million related to the manufacture of clinical supplies of bdnf for sumitomo pharmaceuticals in connection with a research and development agreement 
production of bdnf clinical supplies for sumitomo pharmaceuticals was discontinued in january our total operating expenses increased to million in from million in research and development expenses increased to million in from million in  primarily as a result of higher staffing and increased activity in our preclinical and clinical development programs 
for example  in july  we initiated a phase iii clinical program of axokine for the treatment of obesity and in december  we initiated a phase i study of the il trap 
research and development expenses were of total operating expenses in  compared to in contract manufacturing expenses decreased to million in from million in in addition to the above described effect of not shipping vaccine intermediate manufactured for merck in the second half of until  the decrease was due  in part  to higher costs in associated with initiating commercial production at our rensselaer facility of both intermediate for merck and bdnf for clinical use by sumitomo pharmaceuticals 
general and administrative expenses increased to million in from million in  due primarily to higher administrative staffing to support a larger and more diversified company 
investment income in increased to million from million in due primarily to interest earned on the net proceeds of million from our private placement of million aggregate principal amount of convertible senior subordinated notes in october and million from our public offering in march and april the loss in amgen regeneron partners decreased to million in from million in due to the partnership s cessation of clinical trial activity on bdnf in january and the substantial completion of phase ii studies of nt interest expense increased to million in from million in due to interest incurred on the convertible notes issued in october these notes bear interest at per annum  payable semi annually 
during the fourth quarter of  we changed our method of accounting for revenue recognition to conform with the guidance provided by staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition in financial statements  sab  effective as of january  the cumulative effect of adopting sab as of january  was to increase our net loss by million  or per share  with a corresponding increase to deferred revenue that is being recognized in subsequent periods 
the sab adjustment relates to a portion of a payment received from sumitomo chemical in consideration for a fifteen year limited right of first negotiation to license up to three of our product candidates in japan 
in and  we recognized contract research and development revenue of million per year that was included in the cumulative effect adjustment as of january  our net loss in was million  or per share basic and diluted  compared to a net loss of million  or per share basic and diluted  in liquidity and capital resources since our inception in  we have financed our operations primarily through offerings of our equity securities  a private placement of convertible debt  revenue earned under our agreements with amgen  sumitomo chemical  sumitomo pharmaceuticals  merck  and procter gamble  and investment income 
in may  we entered into a long term collaboration agreement with procter and gamble 
in connection with the collaboration  procter gamble made equity purchases in regeneron of million in june and million in august  and agreed to provide funding in support of our research efforts related to the collaboration  of which we have received million through december  in august  procter gamble made two non recurring research progress payments to us totaling million 
effective december   we and procter gamble entered into a new long term collaboration agreement  replacing the companies agreement 
the new agreement extends procter gamble s obligation to fund regeneron s research through december  with no further research obligations by either party thereafter  and focuses the companies collaborative research on therapeutic areas that are of particular interest to procter gamble 
under the new agreement  beginning in the first quarter of  
table of contents research support from procter gamble is million per quarter  before adjustments for inflation  through december our activities relating to nt  as agreed upon by amgen and us  are being compensated by amgen regeneron partners for services rendered  and we recognize these amounts as revenue 
the partnership is not conducting ongoing development activities for nt at this time 
in january  amgen regeneron partners discontinued all development of bdnf for the potential treatment of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis  or als 
we and amgen fund amgen regeneron partners through capital contributions  and must make equal payments in order to maintain equal ownership and equal sharing of any profits or losses from the partnership 
our aggregate capital contribution to amgen regeneron partners from the partnership s inception in june through december  was million 
in  we made no capital contributions to the partnership and received a capital withdrawal of million 
at december   we continue to be an equal partner in the amgen regeneron partners 
we do not expect to make capital contributions to the partnership in additional contributions may be required  depending upon  among other things  whether and how amgen regeneron partners proceeds with the development of nt in connection with our agreement to collaborate with sumitomo pharmaceuticals in the research and development of bdnf in japan  we received a research progress payment from sumitomo pharmaceuticals of million reduced by million japanese withholding tax in april in addition  sumitomo pharmaceuticals paid us million through december  in connection with supplying bdnf for preclinical and clinical use 
in light of the discontinuation of bdnf development for als  no payments from sumitomo pharmaceuticals were received in and we do not expect to receive further payments related to bdnf for research progress payments  contract research and development  or contract manufacturing 
in december  we entered into an agreement with serono sa to use our proprietary velocigenetm technology to provide serono with knock out and transgenic mammalian models of gene function 
under the terms of this agreement  serono will pay us up to million annually for up to five years 
in return  we will use velocigene to provide serono with knock out transgenic models for target genes to be identified by serono 
in april  we completed a public offering of million shares of common stock at a price of per share and received proceeds  after commissions and expenses  of million 
in august  we sold  shares of common stock to procter gamble at a price of per share and received total proceeds of million 
the sale of stock to procter gamble was made pursuant to a securities purchase agreement 
in march  we completed a public offering in which we issued million shares of common stock at a price of per share and received proceeds  after commissions and expenses  of million 
in april  we sold an additional  shares of common stock pursuant to the underwriters over allotment option from the march public offering at a price of per share and received proceeds  after commissions and expenses  of million 
in october  we issued million aggregate principal amount of convertible senior subordinated notes in a private placement and received proceeds  after deducting the initial purchasers discount and out of pocket expenses  of million 
the notes bear interest at per annum  payable semi annually  and mature in the notes are convertible into shares of our common stock at a conversion price of approximately per share  subject to adjustment in certain circumstances 
we may redeem the notes  in whole or in part  at any time before october   if the closing price of our common stock has exceeded of the conversion price then in effect for a specified period of time 
upon any such redemption  we are required to pay interest that would have been due up through october  we may also redeem some or all of the notes at any time on or after october   if the closing price of our common stock has exceeded of the conversion price then in effect for a specified period of time 
we pledged million of us government securities which will be sufficient upon receipt of scheduled principal and interest payments to provide for the payment in full of the first six scheduled interest payments on the notes when due 
the first two interest payments were made in and at december   million of us government securities remain pledged to provide for the payment in full of the next four scheduled interest payments on the notes 

table of contents our total expenses for research and development from inception through december  have been approximately million 
we have not historically segregated all the costs associated with each of our research programs and it is not possible to forecast their success or the amounts that we may spend in the future 
we currently have research collaboration agreements with procter gamble  medarex  emisphere technologies  inc  amgen and sumitomo pharmaceuticals 
in   and  total expenses for research programs conducted under our third party collaboration agreements were approximately million  million  and million  respectively 
the remainder of our research and development expenses in those years related to our own internal research programs 
we are currently only committed to incur research expenditures under our research collaboration agreements through the end of and estimate that  based on current plans  future expenditures under these collaborations will total less than million 
at december   we had million in cash  cash equivalents  marketable securities  and restricted marketable securities 
we have no off balance sheet arrangements and do not guarantee the obligations of any other entity 
as of december   we had no established banking arrangements through which we could obtain short term financing or a line of credit 
we may seek additional funding through  among other things  future collaboration agreements and public or private financing 
we cannot assure you that additional financing will be available to us or  if available  that it will be available on acceptable terms 
our additions to property  plant  and equipment totaled million in  million in  and million in  including million in and million in related to the expansion of our manufacturing facilities in rensselaer  new york 
in connection with the original purchase and renovation of our rensselaer facility  we obtained financing of million from the new york state urban development corporation 
the outstanding balance on this note of million was fully repaid in october we expect to incur substantial funding requirements for  among other things  research and development activities including preclinical and clinical testing  expansion and validation of manufacturing facilities  and the acquisition of equipment 
we currently anticipate that in  approximately of our expenditures will be directed toward the preclinical and clinical development of product candidates  including axokine  il trap  il trap  vegf trap  and the angiopoietins  approximately of our expenditures will be invested in expansion of our manufacturing facilities  approximately of our expenditures will cover our basic research activities  approximately of our expenditures will be directed toward the continued development of our novel technology platforms  including potential efforts to commercialize these technologies  and the remainder of our expenditures will be for general corporate purposes  including working capital 
in  we expect to incur approximately million in capital expenditures for our expanded manufacturing  research and development activities 
in connection with our funding requirements  the following table summarizes our contractual obligations for leases and long term debt 
payments due by period less than to to total one year years years in millions convertible senior subordinated notes payable capital lease obligations operating leases includes amounts representing interest 
excludes future contingent rental costs for utilities  real estate taxes  and operating expenses 
in  these costs were million 
in the future  if we are able to successfully develop  market  and sell certain of our product candidates  we may be required to pay royalties on such sales in connection with our collaboration and licensing agreements 

table of contents we expect that expenses related to the filing  prosecution  defense  and enforcement of patent and other intellectual property claims will continue to be substantial as a result of patent filings and prosecutions in the united states and foreign countries 
the amount we need to fund operations will depend on various factors  including the status of competitive products  the success of our research and development programs  the potential future need to expand our professional and support staff and facilities  the status of patents and other intellectual property rights  the delay or failure of a clinical trial of any of our potential drug candidates  and the continuation  extent  and success of any collaborative research arrangements including those with procter gamble  medarex  emisphere  and amgen 
clinical trial costs are dependent  among other things  on the size and duration of trials  fees charged for services provided by clinical trial investigators and other third parties  the costs for manufacturing the product candidate for use in the trials  supplies  laboratory tests  and other expenses 
the amount of funding that will be required for our clinical programs depends upon the results of our research and preclinical programs and early stage clinical trials  regulatory requirements  the clinical trials underway plus additional clinical trials that we decide to initiate  and the various factors that affect the cost of each trial as described above 
we believe that our existing capital resources will enable us to meet operating needs through mid however  this is a forward looking statement based on our current operating plan  and we cannot assure you that there will be no change in projected revenues or expenses that would lead to our capital being consumed significantly before such time 
if there is insufficient capital to fund all of our planned operations and activities  we believe we would prioritize available capital to fund preclinical and clinical development of our product candidates 
in the event we need additional financing for the operation of our business  we will consider collaborative arrangements and additional public or private financing  including additional equity financing 
factors influencing the availability of additional financing include our progress in product development  investor perception of our prospects and the general condition of the financial markets 
critical accounting policies we recognize revenue from contract research and development and research progress payments as we perform services or as contract research materials are accepted and meet specifications  provided a contractual arrangement exists  the contract price is fixed or determinable  and our collection of the resulting receivable is probable 
in situations where we receive advance payments for contract research and development  these amounts are deferred and recognized as revenue as we perform the related services or as contract research materials are accepted and meet specifications 
non refundable fees  including payments we receive for services  up front licensing fees  technology fees  and research progress payments  are recognized as revenue based on the percentage of costs incurred to date  estimated costs to complete  and total expected contract revenue 
however  the revenue we recognize is limited to the amount of non refundable fees received 
non refundable fees that we receive in consideration for granting collaborators the right to license product candidates developed by us are recognized as revenue on a straight line basis over the term of the underlying agreements 
this policy conforms with guidance provided by sab with regard to our revenues from non refundable fees  we do not believe that changes in our assumptions of estimated costs to complete would have a material impact on the revenues we have recognized 
we have entered into a contract manufacturing agreement with merck under which we manufacture a vaccine intermediate at our rensselaer  new york facility and perform services 
we recognize contract manufacturing revenue from this agreement after the product is tested and approved by  and shipped fob shipping point to  merck  and as services are performed 
in connection with the agreement  we agreed to modify portions of our rensselaer facility to manufacture merck s vaccine intermediate and merck agreed to reimburse us for the related capital costs 
these capital cost payments were deferred and are recognized as revenue as product is shipped to merck  based upon our estimate of merck s order quantities each year through the expected end of the agreement 
since we commenced production of the vaccine intermediate in november  our estimates of merck s order quantities each year have not been materially different from merck s actual orders 
research and development expenses include costs directly attributable to the conduct of our research and development programs  including salaries  payroll taxes  employee benefits  materials  supplies  depreciation 
table of contents on and maintenance of research equipment  costs related to research collaboration and licensing agreements  the cost of services provided by outside contractors  including services related to our clinical trials  clinical trial expenses  the full cost of manufacturing drug for use in research  preclinical development  and clinical trials  expenses related to the development of manufacturing processes prior to commencing commercial production of a product under contract manufacturing arrangements  and the allocable portions of facility costs  such as rent  utilities  insurance  repairs and maintenance  depreciation  and general support services 
all costs associated with research and development are expensed as incurred 
for each clinical trial that we conduct  certain clinical trial costs  which are included in research and development expenses  are expensed based on the expected total number of patients in the trial  the rate at which patients enter the trial  and the period over which clinical investigators or contract research organizations are expected to provide services 
we believe that this method best aligns the expenses we record with the efforts we expend on a clinical trial 
we adjust our rate of clinical expense recognition if actual results differ from our estimates 
future impact of recently issued accounting standards in june  the financial accounting standards board issued statement on financial accounting standards no 
sfas no 
accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities 
sfas no 
nullifies emerging issues task force issue no 
 liability recognition for certain employee termination benefits and other costs to exit an activity including certain costs incurred in a restructuring 
sfas no 
requires that a liability for a cost associated with an exit or disposal activity be recognized when the liability is incurred rather than on the date of an entity s commitment to an exit plan and establishes that fair value is the objective for initial measurement of the liability 
the provisions of this statement shall be effective for exit or disposal activities initiated after december  our management believes that the future adoption of this accounting standard will not have a material impact on our financial statements 
in december  the financial accounting standards board issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure an amendment of fasb statement no 
sfas no 
provides several transition provisions that may be used upon adoption of the accounting provisions of statement of financial accounting standards no 
sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation 
sfas no 
also mandates certain new disclosures  whether or not sfas no 
is adopted  that are incremental to those required by sfas no 
those disclosures must be made in both interim and annual financial statements 
the transition and annual disclosure provisions of sfas no 
are effective for fiscal years ending after december   and have been adopted in this annual report on form k 
the new interim disclosure provisions will be adopted in our quarterly report on form q for the period ending march  and  our management believes  will not have a material impact on our financial statements 
in november  the fasb emerging issue task force finalized issue no 
eitf accounting for revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables  which addresses how to determine whether an arrangement involving multiple deliverables contains more than one unit of accounting 
eitf also addresses how arrangement consideration should be measured and allocated to the separate units of accounting in the arrangement 
the guidance in eitf is effective for revenue arrangements entered into in fiscal periods beginning after june  our management believes that the adoption of this accounting standard will not have a material impact on our financial statements 
factors that may affect future operating results we caution shareholders and potential investors that the following important factors  among others  in some cases have affected  and in the future could affect  our actual results and could cause our actual results to differ materially from those expressed in any forward looking statements made by  or on behalf of  us 
the statements under this caption are intended to serve as cautionary statements within the meaning of the private securities litigation reform act of the following information is not intended to limit in any way the 
table of contents characterization of other statements or information under other captions as cautionary statements for such purpose delay  difficulty  or failure of a clinical trial of any of our product candidates  including clinical trials of our product candidates axokine and the il trap 
if either or both of these product candidates fail to advance in the clinic  our business will be severely harmed and our stock price will be adversely affected 
a clinical trial can fail or be delayed as a result of many causes  including  among others  failure of the product candidate to demonstrate safety or efficacy  the development of serious or life threatening adverse events side effects caused by or connected with exposure to the product candidate  difficulty in enrolling and maintaining subjects  lack of sufficient supplies of the product candidate  and the failure of clinical investigators  trial monitors and other consultants  or trial subjects to comply with the trial plan or protocol 
in addition to the safety  efficacy  manufacturing  and regulatory hurdles faced by our pharmaceutical candidates  the administration of recombinant proteins frequently causes an immune response  resulting in the creation of antibodies against the therapeutic protein 
the antibodies can have no effect or can totally neutralize the effectiveness of the protein  or require that higher doses be used to obtain a therapeutic effect 
in some cases  the antibody can cross react with the patient s own proteins  resulting in an auto immune type disease 
whether antibodies will be created can often not be predicted from preclinical experiments and their appearance is often delayed  so that there can be no assurance that neutralizing antibodies will not be created at a later date in some cases even after pivotal clinical trials have been successfully completed 
subjects who have received axokine and the il trap in clinical trials have developed antibodies 
delay  difficulty  or failure in obtaining regulatory approval for our products  including delays or difficulties in development because of insufficient proof of safety or efficacy or the failure to manufacture product candidates in accordance with fda requirements 
delay  difficulty  or failure of our research and development programs to produce product candidates that are scientifically or commercially appropriate for further development by us or others 
cancellation or termination of material collaborative or licensing agreements including in particular  but not limited to  the agreement with procter gamble and the resulting loss of research or other funding could have a material adverse effect on us and our operations 
increased and irregular costs of development  manufacture  regulatory approval  sales  and marketing associated with the introduction of products in the late stage of development 
competitive or market factors that may cause use of our products to be limited or otherwise fail to achieve broad acceptance 
the ability to obtain  maintain  and prosecute intellectual property rights and the cost of acquiring in process technology and other necessary intellectual property rights  either by license  collaboration  or purchase of another entity 
difficulties or high costs of obtaining adequate financing to fund the cost of developing and manufacturing product candidates 
amount and rate of growth of our general and administrative expenses  and the impact of unusual charges resulting from our ongoing evaluation of our business strategies and organizational structure 
failure of corporate partners to develop or commercialize successfully our products or to retain and expand the markets served by the commercial collaborations  conflicts of interest  priorities  and commercial strategies which may arise between our corporate partners and us 
delays or difficulties in developing and acquiring production technology and technical and managerial personnel to manufacture novel biotechnology products in commercial quantities at reasonable costs and in compliance with applicable quality assurance and environmental regulations and governmental permitting requirements 

table of contents difficulties in obtaining key raw materials and supplies for the manufacture of our product candidates 
failure of service providers upon whom we rely to carry out our clinical development programs  such as contract research organizations and third parties who fill and label our clinical supplies  to perform their contractual responsibilities 
these failures could lead to delays in our clinical development programs 
the costs and other effects of legal and administrative cases and proceedings whether civil litigation  such as product liability  commercial  employment related  or environmental claims  or criminal litigation  settlements  and investigations  developments or assertions by or against us relating to intellectual property rights and licenses  the issuance and use of patents and proprietary technology by us and our competitors  including the possible negative effect on our ability to develop  manufacture  and sell our products in circumstances where we are unable to obtain licenses to patents which may be required for our products 
underutilization of our existing or new manufacturing facilities or of any facility expansions  resulting in inefficiencies and higher costs  start up costs  inefficiencies  delays  and increased depreciation costs in connection with the start of production in new plants and expansions 
failure to have sufficient manufacturing capacity to make clinical supplies or commercial product in a timely and cost competitive manner 
insufficient manufacturing capacity could delay clinical trials or limit commercial sale of marketed products 
health care reform  including reductions or changes in reimbursement available for prescription medications or other reforms 
difficulties in attracting and retaining key personnel  especially in areas where we have little experience such as sales and marketing 
as our scientific efforts lead to potentially promising new directions  both outside of recombinant protein therapies and into conditions or diseases outside of our current areas of experience and expertise  we will require additional internal expertise or external collaborations in areas in which we currently do not have substantial resources and personnel 
other parties could allege to have blocking patents covering any of our product candidates in clinical and or pre clinical development 
for example  we are aware of certain united states and foreign patents held by third parties relating to particular il and il receptors 
in addition  we are aware of a european patent that pertains to the use of cntf for the treatment of obesity 
we seek to obtain licenses to patents when  in our judgment  such licenses are needed 
if any licenses are required  we may not be able to obtain such licenses on commercially reasonable terms  if at all 
the failure to obtain any such license could prevent us from developing or commercializing one or more of our product candidates  which could severely harm our business 
defense and enforcement of our intellectual property rights can be expensive and time consuming  even if the outcome is favorable to us 
it is possible that patents issued or licensed to us will be successfully challenged  that a court may find that we are infringing validly issued patents of third parties  or that we may have to alter or discontinue the development of our products or pay license fees or royalties to take into account patent rights of third parties 
to date  we have received revenues from our licensees and collaborators for research and development efforts  merck and sumitomo pharmaceuticals for contract manufacturing  and investment income 
we may not continue to receive these revenues from our licensees  collaborators  or contract manufacturing customers 
in the absence of revenues from the commercialization of our product candidates or other sources  our losses will continue as we conduct our research and development activities 
our activities may expand over time and may require additional resources  and our operating losses may be substantial over at least the next several years 
our losses may fluctuate from quarter to quarter and will depend  among other factors  on the timing of certain expenses and on the progress of our research and development efforts 
we do 
table of contents not know if we will ever have an approved product or achieve significant revenues or profitable operations 
we do not expect to receive any revenue from the commercialization of our product candidates for several years and we intend to continue to invest significantly in our research and development activities 
even if we do successfully develop products that can be marketed and sold commercially  we will need to generate significant revenue from products to achieve and maintain profitability 
during the conduct of clinical trials  patients report changes in their health  including illnesses  injuries  and discomforts  to their study doctor 
often  it is not possible to determine whether or not these conditions are caused by the drug being studied 
various illnesses  injuries  and discomforts have been reported from time to time during the clinical trials of axokine  our only product candidate that has completed phase ii trials 
in the ongoing phase iii study of axokine  one patient was reported to have been diagnosed with guillain barre syndrome following an upper respiratory tract infection 
the most frequently reported conditions during the axokine phase ii trial were injection site reactions  cough  and nausea or vomiting 
during the phase i study that was conducted in  some subjects developed mouth sores  also known as cold sores  when axokine was given in higher doses than what is being studied in the phase iii program 
these cold sores were thought to be caused by the reactivation of herpes simplex virus  or hsv 
recurrence of hsv was also reported in previous clinical studies of cntf  axokine s parent molecule 
in the phase i axokine study  one patient who had evidence of previous exposure to hsv prior to treatment and had been previously diagnosed with bell s palsy  had a recurrence of bell s palsy approximately two weeks after the patient s last administration of axokine 
although axokine was generally well tolerated in the completed phase ii trial  it is possible that as we test axokine in a large and extended phase iii program  illnesses  injuries  and discomforts that were observed in the earlier trials  as well as conditions that did not occur or went undetected in these smaller trials  will be reported by patients 
if additional clinical experience indicates that axokine has many side effects or causes serious or life threatening side effects  the development of axokine may fail or be delayed  which would severely harm our business 
most drug research and development programs never lead to the development of commercially successful products 
only a small minority of all research and development programs ultimately result in commercially successful drugs 
we are attempting to develop drugs for human therapeutic uses  and our research and development activities may not be successful and none of our potential product candidates may ever complete clinical trials 
even if clinical trials demonstrate safety and efficacy of our product candidates and the necessary regulatory approvals are obtained  the commercial success of any of our product candidates will depend upon their acceptance by patients  the medical community  and third party payors and on our ability to successfully develop  manufacture  and market our product candidates 
if our products are not successfully commercialized  we will not be able to recover the significant investment we have made in developing such products and our business would be severely harmed 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk our earnings and cash flows are subject to fluctuations due to changes in interest rates primarily from our investment of available cash balances in investment grade corporate and us government securities 
we do not believe we are materially exposed to changes in interest rates 
under our current policies we do not use interest rate derivative instruments to manage exposure to interest rate changes 
we estimate that a one percent change in interest rates would result in an approximately million change in the fair market value of our investment portfolio at december
