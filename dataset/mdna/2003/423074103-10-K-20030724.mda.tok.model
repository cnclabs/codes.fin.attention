based on the amount of fixed rate debt converted to floating as of april   a variance of in the related interest rate would cause annual interest expense related to this debt to change by approximately million 
the following table presents additional information related to interest rate contracts designated as fair value hedges by the company dollars in millions april  may  pay floating swaps notional amount   net unrealized gains average maturity years weighted average receive rate weighted average pay rate at april   the company also maintained interest rate swaps with a total notional amount of million that do not meet the criteria for hedge accounting but effectively mitigate interest rate exposures 
these swaps mature within months and are accounted for on a full mark to market basis through current earnings 
net unrealized gains related to these swaps totaled million at april  commodity price sensitivity the company is the purchaser of certain commodities such as corn  soybean oil and soybean meal 
the company generally purchases these commodities based upon market prices that are established with the vendor as part of the purchase process 
the company may enter into commodity futures  swaps and option contracts to reduce the effect of price fluctuations on forecasted purchases 
the company held commodity contracts to hedge certain forecasted purchases with a notional amount of million and million at april  and may   respectively 
such contracts generally have a term of less than one year  and are accounted for as cash flow hedges if they meet certain qualifying criteria 
accordingly  the effective portion of gains and losses is deferred as a component of other comprehensive loss and is recognized as part of cost of products sold at the time the hedged item affects earnings 
any gains and losses due to hedge ineffectiveness or related to contracts which do not qualify for hedge accounting are recorded in current period earnings in other income and expense 
net unrealized losses related to commodity contracts held by the company were not material at april  or may  effect of hypothetical fluctuation in market prices as of april   the potential gain or loss in the fair value of the company s outstanding foreign currency contracts  interest rate contracts and commodity contracts assuming a hypothetical fluctuation in currency rates  swap rates and market prices  respectively  would be approximately dollars in millions fair value effect foreign currency contracts interest rate swap contracts commodity contracts however  it should be noted that any change in the fair value of the contracts  real or hypothetical  would be significantly offset by an inverse change in the value of the underlying hedged items 
in relation to currency contracts  this hypothetical calculation assumes that each exchange rate would change in the same direction relative to the us dollar 
discussion of significant accounting estimates in the ordinary course of business  the company has made a number of estimates and assumptions relating to the reporting of results of operations and financial condition in the preparation of its financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
actual results could differ significantly from those estimates under different assumptions and conditions 
the company believes that the following discussion addresses the company s most critical accounting policies  which are those that are most important to the portrayal of the company s financial condition and results and require management s most difficult  subjective and complex judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
marketing costs trade promotions are an important component of the sales and marketing of the company s products  and are critical to the support of its business 
trade promotion costs include amounts paid to encourage retailers to offer temporary price reductions for the sale of the company s products to consumers  amounts paid to obtain favorable display positions in retailers stores  and amounts paid to customers for shelf space in retail stores 
accruals for trade promotions are recorded primarily at the time of sale of product to the customer based on expected levels of performance 
settlement of these liabilities typically occurs in subsequent periods primarily through an authorized process for deductions taken by a customer from amounts otherwise due to the company 
as a result  the ultimate cost of a trade promotion program is dependent on the relative success of the events and the actions and level of deductions taken by the company s customers for amounts they consider due to them 
final determination of the permissible deductions may take extended periods of time 
inventories inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market value 
cost is principally determined by the average cost method 
the company records adjustments to the carrying value of inventory based upon its forecasted plans to sell its inventories 
the physical condition eg  age and quality of the inventories is also considered in establishing its valuation 
these adjustments are estimates  which could vary significantly  either favorably or unfavorably  from actual requirements if future economic conditions  customer inventory levels or competitive conditions differ from our expectations 
property  plant and equipment land  buildings and equipment are recorded at cost and are depreciated on a straight line method over the estimated useful lives of such assets 
changes in circumstances such as technological advances  changes to the company s business model or changes in the company s capital strategy could result in the actual useful lives differing from the company s estimates 
in those cases where the company determines that the useful life of buildings and equipment should be shortened  the company would depreciate the net book value in excess of the salvage value  over its revised remaining useful life thereby increasing depreciation expense 
factors such as changes in the planned use of fixtures or software or closing of facilities could result in shortened useful lives 
long lived assets long lived assets including fixed assets and intangible assets with finite useful lives are evaluated periodically by the company for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of any such asset may not be recoverable 
if the sum of the undiscounted cash flows is less than the carrying value  the company recognizes an impairment loss  measured as the amount by which the carrying value exceeds the fair value of the asset 
the estimate of cash flow requires significant management judgement and requires  among other things  certain assumptions about future volume  revenue and expense growth rates  foreign exchange rates  devaluation and inflation  and as such may differ from actual cash flows 
goodwill and indefinite lived intangibles carrying values of goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives are reviewed periodically for possible impairment in accordance with sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
the company s impairment review is based on a discounted cash flow approach that requires significant management judgments similar to those noted above for long lived assets  and to the selection of an appropriate discount rate 
impairment occurs when the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds the discounted present value of the cash flows for that reporting unit 
an impairment charge is recorded for the difference between the carrying value and the net present value of estimated future cash flows  which represents the estimated fair value of the asset 
the company uses its judgment in assessing whether assets may have become impaired between annual valuations 
indicators such as unexpected adverse economic factors  unanticipated technological change or competitive activities  loss of key personnel  acts by governments and courts  may signal that an asset has become impaired 
retirement benefits the company sponsors pension and other retirement plans in various forms covering substantially all employees who meet eligibility requirements 
several statistical and other factors that attempt to anticipate future events are used in calculating the expense and liability related to the plans 
these factors include assumptions about the discount rate  expected return on plan assets  turnover rates and rate of future compensation increases as determined by the company  within certain guidelines 
the discount rate assumptions used to value pension and postretirement benefit obligations reflect the rates available on high quality fixed income investments available in each country that the company operates a benefit plan as of the measurement date 
the weighted average discount rate for the year ending april  was reduced to from as of may   and as of may  reflecting the declining interest rate environment 
over time  the expected rate of return on pension plan assets should approximate the actual long term returns 
in developing the expected rate of return  the company considers actual real historic returns of asset classes  the investment mix of plan assets  investment manager performance and projected future returns of asset classes developed by respected consultants 
the weighted average expected rate of return on plan assets was for the year ending april  and as of may  for purposes of calculating fiscal expense  the weighted average rate of return will be reduced to approximately 
in addition  the company s actuarial consultants also use subjective factors such as withdrawal and mortality rates to estimate these factors 
the actuarial assumptions used by the company may differ materially from actual results due to changing market and economic conditions  higher or lower withdrawal rates or longer or shorter life spans of participants 
these differences may result in a significant impact to the amount of pension expense recorded by the company 
income taxes the company accounts for income taxes in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes 
judgment is required in determining the company s worldwide provision for income taxes 
in the ordinary course of the company s global business  there are many transactions for which the ultimate tax outcome is uncertain 
the company adjusts its income tax provision in the period it is probable that actual results will differ from its estimates 
tax law and rate changes are reflected in the income tax provision in the period in which such changes are enacted 
the company records valuation allowances to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
when assessing the need for valuation allowances  the company considers future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies 
should a change in circumstances lead to a change in judgment about the realizability of deferred tax assets in future years  the company would adjust related valuation allowances in the period that the change in circumstances occurs  along with a corresponding increase or charge to income 
inflation in general  costs are affected by inflation and the effects of inflation may be experienced by the company in future periods 
management believes  however  that such effects have not been material to the company during the past three years in the united states or foreign non hyperinflationary countries 
the company operates in certain countries around the world  such as argentina  venezuela and zimbabwe  that have experienced hyperinflation 
in hyperinflationary foreign countries  the company attempts to mitigate the effects of inflation by increasing prices in line with inflation  where possible  and efficiently managing its working capital levels 
the impact of inflation on both the company s financial position and results of operations is not expected to adversely affect fiscal results 
the company s financial position continues to remain strong  enabling it to meet cash requirements for operations  including anticipated additional pension plan contributions  capital expansion programs and dividends to shareholders
