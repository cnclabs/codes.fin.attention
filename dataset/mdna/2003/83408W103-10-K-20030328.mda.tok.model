item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview sohu  having introduced the first chinese language online directory  is one of the leading internet portals in china in terms of brand recognition 
we are a delaware corporation 
on october   sohu acquired chinaren for total consideration of million  comprising  shares of sohu common stock with an aggregate market value of approximately million  stock options granted to chinaren employees to purchase  shares of sohu common stock valued at million and other acquisition costs aggregating million 
revenues and expenses from chinaren s operations after the acquisition date have been included in sohu s consolidated financial statements 
we have incurred significant net losses since inception 
as of december   we had an accumulated deficit of million 
these losses have been funded with proceeds of preferred stock private placements and our initial public offering completed in july we intend to continue spending on marketing and brand development  content enhancements  technology and infrastructure 
as a result  net losses could continue to occur in the future 
we anticipate funding any such losses with the remaining proceeds from our initial public offering 
critical accounting policies sohu s discussion and analysis of its financial condition and results of operations are based upon sohu s consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires sohu to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  sohu evaluates its estimates based on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
sohu believes accounting for advertising revenue where multiple elements exist  accounting for e subscriptions revenues  allowance for doubtful accounts  provision for long term loans to related parties  valuation allowance against deferred tax assets and impairment of intangible assets represent critical accounting policies which reflect more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
advertising revenues are derived principally from online advertising pursuant to short term contracts normally less than twelve months 
online advertising includes banners  links  logos and buttons placed on our web sites and sponsorship of a particular area of the web sites 
revenue is recognized ratably over the period in which the advertising is displayed  when the collectibility is reasonably assured 
for multiple element contracts  the contract value is allocated among specific services provided and revenue is recognized in the period the services are performed 
in estimating the fair value of individual services provided  we make estimates based on the value of similar services provided to our customers using average sell rates for the period 
material differences could result in the amount and timing of our revenue for any period if management made different judgments or utilized different estimates 
non advertising revenues which have been the fastest growing part of our business during the year ended december  are derived principally from monetizing our users ie consumers via e subscription services and to a lesser extent from e commerce services 
e subscription revenues are included within non advertising revenues and are derived principally from providing value added short messaging services such as alumni club  dating and friends matching  e mail  ringtone and logo downloads and various other related products to mobile phone users 
e subscription fees are charged on a monthly or per message basis 
e subscription revenues are recognized in the month in which the service is performed  provided that no significant sohu obligations remain 
we rely on a number of mobile network operators in china to bill mobile phone users for e subscription fees 
in order to meet ownership requirements under prc law which restrict or prohibit us from being an internet content provider or directly providing telecommunications services such as e subscriptions  we rely on beijing sohu to contract on our behalf with the mobile operators 
generally  i within to days after the end of each month  beijing sohu receives a statement from each of the operators confirming the amount of e subscription charges billed to that operator s mobile phone users and ii within to days after delivering a monthly statement to beijing sohu each operator remits the e subscription fees  net of its service fees  for the month to beijing sohu which then transfers the funds to sohu 
in order to recognize revenue and get paid for services provided  we rely on billing confirmations from the mobile network operators as to the actual amount of services they have billed to their mobile customers 
we do not collect e subscription fees from an operator in certain circumstances due to technical issues with the operator s billing system 
this is referred to as the billing failure rate  which can vary from operator to operator 
an operator s billing failure rate can vary from month to month  ranges from to and may change at any time without notice 
if an operator encounters technical problems  increases in the billing failure rate for that operator could occur 
at the end of each reporting period  where an operator has not provided beijing sohu with the monthly statement for any month confirming the amount of e subscription charges billed to that operator s mobile phone users for the month  sohu  using information generated from its own internal system and historical data  makes estimates of the billing failure rate  collectable e subscription fees and accrues revenue accordingly 
material differences could result in the amount and timing of our revenue for any period because of differences between the actual billing failure rate per an operator s statement and our internal records 
e commerce revenues are earned from direct sales of consumer products through sohu s web site 
in  we established store 
sohu 
com where we undertake fulfillment e commerce activities and conduct e commerce transactions 
our e commerce products consist of over  consumer products such as books  health care products  cosmetics  videos  music and computer equipment 
we purchase products from suppliers  stock the goods in our warehouse and  upon receiving the orders from our web site  arrange for delivery to our customers  most of whom are individuals in beijing  shanghai and guangzhou 
fulfillment is provided by delivery companies or through postal services 
substantially all sales are done on a cash on delivery basis 
our management must make estimates of the uncollectability of our accounts receivables from third parties and a related party 
management specifically analyzes accounts receivable  historical bad debts  customer credit worthiness  current economic trends and changes in our customer payment terms when evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts 
our non related party accounts receivable balance was million net of allowance for doubtful accounts of  as of december  our accounts receivable from a related party was million and there was no allowance for doubtful accounts as of december  if the financial condition of sohu s customers were to deteriorate  resulting in their inability to make payments  additional allowance might be required 
our management must make estimates of the valuation of long term loans to related parties which are used to facilitate our participation in telecommunications  internet content  financial services and certain other businesses in china where foreign ownership is either prohibited or restricted the prc companies 
to the extent losses are incurred by the prc companies  sohu accrues for such losses by recording a valuation allowance against long term loans to related parties 
during the years ended december  and  sohu recorded  and  respectively  of such valuation allowance for losses incurred by the prc companies 
if the regulatory environment was to change or business conditions were to deteriorate  additional allowances might be required 
we record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized based on our estimate of future taxable income and prudent and feasible tax planning strategies 
if events were to occur in the future  which are currently not contemplated in our current estimates  that would allow us to realize more of our deferred tax assets than the presently recorded net amount  an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would increase income when those events occurred 
conversely  if we were to determine that we would not be able to realize all or part of our net deferred tax asset in the future  an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would result in a charge to income in the period in which such determination was made 
during the year ended december   sohu recorded an impairment charge of million to write off the remaining balance of identifiable intangibles and goodwill related to its acquisition of chinaren  inc this was the result of sohu s impairment assessment which was based upon an estimate of future discounted cash flows over the assets estimated useful lives 
if different judgments or estimates had been utilized  material differences could have resulted in the amount and timing of the impairment charge

sohu invests its excess cash in marketable debt securities of high quality investment grade 
as of december   we had cash  cash equivalents  and investments in marketable debt securities totaling approximately million compared to million and million as of december  and  respectively 
for the year ended december   net cash provided by operating activities of million was primarily attributable to our net loss of million  depreciation and amortization of million  other non cash expenses of million  and a slight increase in working capital of  for the year ended december   net cash used in operating activities of million was primarily attributable to our net loss of million  amortization and impairment of intangible assets of million  depreciation and amortization of million  other non cash expenses of  and a decrease in working capital of million 
for the year ended december   net cash used in operating activities of million was primarily attributable to our net loss of million  amortization of intangible assets of million  depreciation and amortization of million  other non cash expenses of million and a decrease in working capital of million 
for the year ended december   net cash used in investing activities of million was primarily due to long term investments in marketable debt securities of million  the acquisition of fixed assets of million  long term loans to related parties of million for financing investments in high century and hengda and the acquisition of other assets of  for the year ended december   net cash used in investing activities of million was primarily due to long term investments in marketable debt securities of million and the acquisition of fixed assets of million  long term loans to related parties of million for financing an investment in high century and the acquisition of other assets of  for the year ended december   net cash used in investing activities of million was primarily due to the purchase of fixed assets of million and cash used in the acquisition of chinaren  inc of million 
net cash used in financing activities was million for the year ended december   primarily due to the repurchase of treasury stock of million offset by issuance of common stock of  pursuant to our stock option plan 
there was no significant cash provided by financing activities for the year ended december  net cash provided by financing activities was million for the year ended december   primarily due to net proceeds of approximately million from the issuance of series d convertible preferred stock in february and of approximately million from the completion of our initial public offering in july our principal commitments consist of obligations under various operating leases for office facilities 
we expect that capital expenditures totaling million in will primarily consist of purchases of additional servers  computer software  workstations and technological improvements to network infrastructure 
we believe that current cash and cash equivalents will be sufficient to meet anticipated working capital net cash used in operating activities  commitments and capital expenditures for at least the next twelve months 
we may  however  require additional cash resources due to changed business conditions or other future developments  including any investments or acquisitions we may decide to pursue 
if these sources are insufficient to satisfy cash requirements  we may seek to sell additional equity or debt securities or to obtain a credit facility 
the sale of additional equity or convertible debt securities could result in additional dilution to shareholders 
the incurrence of indebtedness would result in increased debt service obligations and could result in operating and financial covenants that would restrict operations 
financing may not be available in amounts or on terms acceptable to us  if at all 
foreign currency exchange losses while our reporting currency is the us dollar  to date virtually all of our revenues and costs are denominated in renminbi and a significant portion of our assets and liabilities are denominated in renminbi 
as a result  we are exposed to foreign exchange risk as our revenues and results of operations may be impacted by fluctuations in the exchange rate between us dollars and renminbi 
if the renminbi depreciates against the us dollar  the value of our renminbi revenues and assets as expressed in our us dollar financial statements will decline 
we do not hold any derivative or other financial instruments that expose us to substantial market risk 
see risk factors we may suffer currency exchange losses if the renminbi depreciates relative to the us dollar 
the renminbi is currently freely convertible under the current account  which includes dividends  trade and service related foreign exchange transactions  but not under the capital account  which includes foreign direct investment 
to date  we have not entered into any hedging transactions in an effort to reduce our exposure to foreign currency exchange risk 
while we may decide to enter into hedging transactions in the future  the effectiveness of these hedges may be limited and we may not be able to successfully hedge our exposure at all 
accordingly  we may incur economic losses in the future due to foreign exchange rate fluctuations which may have a negative impact on our financial condition and results of operations 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk foreign currency exchange rate risk the majority of our revenues  expenses and liabilities are denominated in chinese renminbi 
thus  revenues and operating results may be impacted by exchange rate fluctuations in the renminbi when financial results are translated in us dollars on consolidation 
currency fluctuations and restrictions on currency exchange may adversely affect our business  including limiting the ability to convert chinese renminbi into foreign currencies and  if the renminbi were to decline in value  reducing revenue in us dollar terms 
we have not tried to reduce exposure to exchange rate fluctuations by using hedging transactions but may choose to do so in the future 
we may not be able to do this successfully 
accordingly  we may experience economic losses and negative impacts on earnings and equity as a result of foreign exchange rate fluctuations 
the effect of foreign exchange rate fluctuations on us in the fiscal year ended december  was not material
