item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations first defiance is unitary thrift holding company which conducts business through its subsidiaries  first federal and first insurance 
first federal is a federally chartered savings bank that provides financial services to communities based in northwest ohio where it operates full service branches and one commercial loan production office 
first federal provides a broad range of financial services including checking accounts  savings accounts  certificates of deposit  real estate mortgage loans  commercial loans  consumer loans  home equity loans and trust services 
first insurance sells a variety of property and casualty  group health and life  and individual health and life insurance products and investment and annuity products 
insurance products are sold through first insurance s office in defiance  ohio while investment and annuity products are sold through registered investment representatives located at two first federal banking center locations 
effective april   first defiance sold the leader to us bank home mortgage  a unit of us bank  and recognized an after tax gain of million  or per share from the sale 
that gain  as well as all operating results associated with the leader  has been reported as results of discontinued operations for all periods presented 
financial condition total assets at december  were million compared to billion at december  however  the total included million of assets of discontinued operations related to the leader 
net loans receivable increased by million or  to million at december  from million at december  and investment securities increased by million or to million at december  from million at december  also at december   the company had million of mortgage loans available for sale compared to only  at the same point in and had million invested in bank owned life insurance  which was a new asset on the company s balance sheet in the increase in loans receivable was primarily in the non residential real estate loan  commercial loan  home equity and improvement loan and multi family real estate loan categories 
non residential real estate loans increased by million  or  to million at december  from million at december  commercial loans increased by million  or  to million at december  from million at december  home equity and improvement loans increased by million  or  to million at december  from million at december  multi family real estate loans increased by million  or  to million at december  from million at december  the increases in the non residential real estate loan  commercial loan and multi family real estate loan categories are due to the company s emphasis in originating loans in those categories  especially in markets that the company has recently entered including findlay  bowling green  and toledo  ohio 
the increase in those loan balances was slightly offset by a decrease in the balance of loans secured by single family residences 
the balance of first mortgage residential loans declined to million at december  compared to million at december   a decline of million or 
this decline is a result of the company s strategy to sell most of the fixed rate mortgage loans that the company originates in the secondary market 
the increase in the balance in investment securities is the result of the reinvestment of the proceeds from the sale of the leader 
after the sale of the leader  first defiance had net investible funds of approximately million  due both to the proceeds from the sale and due to the settlement of all inter company debt and inter company deposit obligations between the leader and first federal 
of this amount  million was used to pay off fhlb overnight advances and million was used to pay off long term debt 
management also elected to prepay million of fixed rate fhlb advances which was a portion of the borrowings used to fund the leader s operations  incurring a prepayment penalty of  which has been included in discontinued operations 
of the remaining funds  million was invested in available for sale securities  and the balance has been used to fund loan growth 
management has also invested excess liquidity in shorter term investment securities 
the company s total deposits declined to million at december  from million at december  this decline is due to a decrease in brokered certificates of deposit  which were used to fund operations of the leader 
brokered cds declined million to million at december  from million at december  excluding brokered cds  first defiance s deposit balances were million at december   an increase of million or from the million balance at december  the growth in core deposits was primarily due to growth in checking accounts  which increased by million or  and in money market demand accounts  which increased by million or 
the growth in checking accounts is due to an increase in commercial checking balances consistent with the growth in the company s commercial loan and non residential real estate loan portfolios as well as continued marketing efforts 
the growth in the money market demand accounts is primarily due to marketing that account as an attractive alternative to certificates of deposit 
fhlb advances declined to million at december  from million at december  as of march   the day before the sale of the leader  first defiance had borrowed an additional million in advances from the fhlb  for a total of million 
as noted above  million of those advances were paid off following the sale of the leader 
since the sale  first defiance has made additional borrowings from the fhlb totaling million to fund loan growth and investment strategies 
average balances  interest rates and yields the following table presents for the periods indicated the total dollar amounts of interest from average interest earning assets and the resultant yields  as well as the interest expense on average interest bearing liabilities  expressed both in dollars and rates  and the net interest margin

interest rate spread is the difference in the yield on interest earning assets and the cost of interest bearing liabilities 
net interest margin is net interest income divided by average interest earning assets 
rate volume analysis the following table describes the extent to which changes in interest rates and changes in volume of interest related assets and liabilities have affected first defiance s interest income and expense during the periods indicated 
for each category of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities  information is provided on changes attributable to i changes in volume change in volume multiplied by prior year rate  ii change in rate change in rate multiplied by prior year volume  and iii total change in rate and volume 
the combined effect of changes in both rate and volume has been allocated proportionately to the change due to rate and the change due to volume

as a result of this sale  management has classified the operating results of the leader as discontinued operations for all periods presented 
also included in discontinued operations is the million gain realized from the sale of the leader and the cost associated with early payment penalties incurred in retiring certain fhlb advances which were used to fund operations of the leader 
see note to the consolidated financial statements 
first defiance reported net income of million for the year ended december  compared to million and million for the years ended december  and respectively 
income from continuing operations was million  million and million for the years ended december   and respectively 
excluding the cumulative effect adjustment for a change in accounting for goodwill  first defiance had income from continuing operations of million for the year ended december  on a diluted per share basis  first defiance earned in  in and in diluted per share income from continuing operations was

in net interest income from continuing operations was million for the year ended december   compared to million and million for the years ended december  and respectively 
net interest margin was  and for the years ended december   and respectively 
the decline in net interest margin from to was due primarily to significant growth in lower yielding interest earning assets resulting from the sale of the leader 
the proceeds from the sale were invested primarily in investment securities  which lowered the average yield on total interest earning assets 
the average balance of investment securities was million in compared to just million in the yield on those securities was in compared to in the interest rate spread also dropped in  to compared to in the improvement in the net interest margin in compared to is due primarily to an increase in the average balance of non interest bearing demand deposit accounts  which increased from million in to million in the yield on interest earning assets declined by basis points in compared to while the cost of interest bearing liabilities declined by basis points 
a portion of the decline in the yield on assets is due to the mix change caused by the growth in the investment securities portfolio as well a million increase in the average balance of interest earning deposits that first defiance maintained in other banks 
the decline in rates for both assets and liabilities was due to the low level of interest rates throughout those low rates were the result of cuts by the federal reserve to its federal funds rate implemented throughout the average rate on interest bearing deposits declined by basis points in compared to the rates on fhlb advances remained essentially flat in compared to as the majority of those advances have fixed rates 
the cost of brokered certificates of deposit and a portion of the cost of fhlb advances was used to finance operations of the leader throughout  and the first quarter of the cost associated with those brokered certificates of deposit and advances has been reclassified as discontinued operations 
in compared to  the yield on interest earning assets declined by basis points  to from while the cost of interest bearing liabilities declined by basis points to from 
both asset yields and liability costs were impacted in by declining interest rates driven by the federal reserve s rate cuts 
the provision for loan losses for the year ended december  was million compared to million in and  in for the year ended december   non interest income was million compared to million for and million for non interest expense for the year ended december  was million compared to million for and million for net interest income first defiance s net interest income is determined by its interest rate spread ie the difference between the yields on its interest earning assets and the rates paid on its interest bearing liabilities and the relative amounts of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities 
total interest income declined by  or  to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  average loans receivable increased by million to million in from million in while the average balance of investment securities increased to million in from million in and interest earning deposits held at other banks increased to million in from million in although the average balance of all interest earning assets  including fhlb stock increased by million in compared to  the yield on those total assets fell to in from in the average balance of non residential real estate loans  multi family real estate loans  non owner occupied residential mortgage loans and commercial loans increased by million  or in  to million for the year ended december  from million for the increase in these portfolios is the result of first defiance s strategy to increase this type of lending and was driven by growth in new markets  including findlay  bowling green and toledo  ohio  as well as gains in market share in existing markets 
the company also had an increase in the average balance of home equity and improvement loans  which averaged million in  up from s average balance of million 
the increases in these average loan balances were offset by declines in the company s residential mortgage portfolio  which had an average balance of million in compared to million in  a drop of 
this portfolio continues to decline as low interest rates caused a high level of refinancing activity  most of which is sold into the secondary market 
the company s average balance of consumer loans also declined in  to million from million in interest earnings from the investment portfolio increased by million in compared to because of the growth in the investment portfolio following the sale of the leader 
the average investment portfolio balance increased to million for compared to just million for the average yield on that portfolio was  a basis point decline from s yield of 
first defiance also had a large increase in interest earning deposits maintained at other banks  which increased to million in from million in the yield on those balances  which is generally tied directly to the federal funds rate  was in compared to in in  total interest income declined slightly  to million from million in income on loans was flat in compared to as the increase in average loan balances to million in from in was offset by a basis point decline in the yield on loans  to in from in income from the investment portfolio in was  lower than in due both to a million decrease in the average balance of the investment portfolio and a basis point decline in the yield on those assets in compared to interest expense decreased by million  or  to million in compared to million in interest expense on interest bearing deposits was million lower in compared to despite an million increase in the average balance of such deposits 
the average cost of interest bearing deposits dropped to in from in due primarily to significantly lower deposit cd and money market deposit account rates as well as an improvement in the overall deposit mix 
the decline in interest expense on deposits was slightly offset by an increase in costs associated with fhlb advances 
in  a portion of the expense for advances was allocated to discontinued operations as those advances were used to fund the operations of the leader 
in  management repaid million of advances  incurring a  pre payment penalty that was included in discontinued operations 
management determined not to prepay the remaining fhlb advances because of more substantial pre payment penalties and the full amount of outstanding balances were subsequently used to fund continuing operations 
interest expense also decreased because of a decline in notes payable 
in first defiance borrowed million from a bank to support overall operations 
that borrowing was paid off in upon the sale of the leader 
in  interest expense declined by million  or  to million compared to million for the decline is due to a basis point drop in the average cost of total interest bearing liabilities  to in from in deposit balances were up slightly in compared to million compared to million while costs were lower by basis points compared to 
fhlb advances included in continuing operations were lower in compared to million compared to million while term notes payable and other interest bearing liabilities primarily borrowings from another bank were higher in compared to million compared to million 
as a result of the foregoing  first defiance s net interest income was million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  and million for the year ended december  net interest margin from continuing operations for the year ended december  decreased to from for and for provision for loan losses first defiance s provision for loan losses was million for the year ended december  compared to million and  for the years ended december  and respectively 
provisions for loan losses are charged to earnings to bring the total allowance for loan losses to a level that is deemed appropriate by management to absorb probable losses in the loan portfolio 
factors considered by management include identifiable risk in the portfolios  historical experience  the volume and type of lending conducted by first defiance  regulatory guidance  the amount of non performing assets  including loans which meet the fasb statement no 
definition of impaired  general economic conditions  particularly as they relate to first defiance s market areas  and other factors related to the collectibility of first defiance s loan portfolio 
continued growth in the non residential loan and commercial loan portfolios at first defiance  which have an inherently higher level of risk than other types of loans  as well as concerns about economic conditions in the northwest ohio market areas has caused the provision for loan losses to increase in from and levels 
the allowance for loan losses totaled million at december  compared to million at december  and million at december  total loan charge offs were  in compared to million in both and while recoveries in those same years were   and  respectively 
first defiance s non performing assets at december  were million compared to million at december  and million at december  non performing assets include loans that are days past due and all real estate owned and other foreclosed assets 
non performing assets at december  and by category were as follows december in thousands non performing loans single family residential  non residential and multi family residential real estate  commercial consumer finance total non performing loans   real estate owned and repossessed assets total non performing assets   while the non performing commercial loan balances increased by  from to  total commercial loans increased by million during those same periods 
non performing loans in the non residential and multi family residential real estate and commercial loan categories represent 
and 
of the total loans in those categories respectively at december  compared to 
and 
respectively for the same categories at december  of the combined million of non performing non residential and multi family residential real estate loans and commercial loans at december   approximately  relates to a single lending relationship which management believes will be resolved without incurring any significant loss 
management also believes that the allowance for loan losses is adequate to cover any potential losses from non performing assets 
non interest income non interest income increased by million to million for the year ended december  from million in and million in million of the increase relates to higher gains from sales of mortgage loans  which totaled million in compared to million in the higher level of gains is due to increased mortgage loan origination volume through first federal s branch network 
in  first defiance originated a total of million of mortgage loans compared to million in  an increase of 
loan and deposit fees at first defiance increased to million in from million in  an increase of 
insurance and investment sales commissions recognized in were million compared to million in  an increase of 
also first defiance invested in bank owned life insurance in the fourth quarter of the earnings on bank owned life insurance  which are included in non interest income  were  in in first defiance realized  in gains from mortgage loan sales  million in loan and deposit service fees and million from insurance commissions 
non interest expense total non interest expense for was million compared to million for the year ended december  and million for the year ended december  the million increase from to is attributable primarily to increases in compensation and benefits  which increased by million and amortization and impairment of mortgage servicing rights  which increased by  the increase in wages and benefits were attributable to staffing increases  wage increases  and a significant increase in the company s group health insurance 
first defiance s full time employment increased by employees between the beginning and end of as the company added the loan production office in the toledo area and also added several staff positions to support growth 
despite the sale of the leader  first defiance continues to provide mortgage banking services through its first federal banking centers 
at december  first defiance serviced a total of  loans for others with a principal balance of million 
the total servicing portfolio at december  was  loans with balances of million 
the mortgage servicing rights associated with those loans had a net value of million as of december  after subtracting a million reserve for impairment  compared to million at december  after subtracting  of impairment 
first defiance recognized  in impairment expense in caused by declining market values for mortgage servicing rights in the low rate environment 
in first defiance recognized  of impairment 
amortization of mortgage servicing rights also increased significantly in  to million from  due to increased refinancing activity in the low interest rate environment and continued growth in the servicing portfolio 
the increase in non interest expense from to was primarily in compensation and benefits  which increased by million  and in amortization and impairment of mortgage servicing rights  which increased by million 
income taxes income taxes from continuing operations amounted to million in compared to million in and million in the effective tax rates for those three years were  and respectively 
the lower effective tax rate in is primarily due to a significant increase in tax exempt interest due to the company s increased investment in tax exempt securities in the investment portfolio 
discontinued operations first defiance s results included income from discontinued operations of million  or per diluted share 
the amount included million related to the after tax gain on the sale of the leader  million of income earned by the leader during the three months the subsidiary was operated by first defiance  and  of other expenses associated with discontinued operations 
for and the operating results of the leader have been reported as discontinued operations  consistent with the classification in so that all periods presented are comparative 
interest expense recorded at first federal which was associated solely with financing activities of the leader  primarily interest on brokered cds and a portion of the company s fhlb advances  has also been reported as part of discontinued operations for those two periods 
total discontinued operations for and were million and million respectively or and per share 
change in accounting for goodwill effective january   first defiance adopted financial account standards board fasb statement no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
as required under the standard  management evaluated goodwill recorded at its first insurance investments subsidiary for the purpose of measuring impairment and determined that such goodwill was impaired by   or 
per share after tax as of january  as permitted  this amount is reflected in the income statement as the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle 
in addition to the  of impaired goodwill  during first defiance paid additional consideration of  to settle a contingent payout clause under an agreement entered into in when first insurance was acquired 
because this settlement was not reached until after january   the impairment of the related goodwill created by the settlement is recorded as an operating expense rather than as part of the cumulative effect adjustment 
the  payment has been included in other non interest expense in the statement of income 
as a result of statement no 
 first defiance is no longer required to recognize goodwill amortization as an expense 
such amortization totaled  and  in and respectively 
see footnote to the consolidated financial statements 
concentrations of credit risk financial institutions such as first defiance generate income primarily through lending and investing activities 
the risk of loss from lending and investing activities includes the possibility that losses may occur from the failure of another party to perform according to the terms of the loan or investment agreement 
this possibility is known as credit risk 
lending or investing activities that concentrate a financial institution s assets in a way that exposes the institution to a material loss from any single occurrence or group of occurrences increases credit risk 
diversifying loans and investments to prevent concentrations of risks is one manner a financial institution can reduce potential losses due to credit risk 
examples of asset concentrations would include multiple loans made to a single borrower and loans of inappropriate size relative to the total capitalization of the institution 
management believes adherence to its loan and investment policies allows it to control its exposure to concentrations of credit risk at acceptable levels 
first defiance s loan portfolio is concentrated geographically in its northwest ohio market area 
there are no industry concentrations that exceed of the company s loan portfolio 
liquidity and capital resources the company s primary source of liquidity is its core deposit base  raised through first federal s branch network  along with unused wholesale sources of funding and its capital base 
these funds  along with investment securities  provide the ability to meet the needs of depositors while funding new loan demand and existing commitments 
cash used in operating activities was million and million in and and cash generated from operating activities was million in excluding the gain from the sale of discontinued operations and net changes in assets and liabilities of discontinued operations  first defiance used million in and generated cash from operations of million and million in and respectively 
the adjustments to reconcile net income to cash provided by or used in operations during the periods presented consist primarily of proceeds from the sale of loans less the origination of loans held for sale  the provision for loan losses  depreciation expense  the origination  amortization and impairment of mortgage servicing rights  esop expense related to the release of esop shares in accordance with aicpa sop and increases and decreases in other assets and liabilities 
in a typical year  the primary investing activity of first defiance is lending  which is funded with cash provided from operating and financing activities  as well as proceeds from payment on existing loans and proceeds from maturities of securities 
in  first defiance realized proceeds from the sale of the leader of million 
during  a total of million was used to purchase available for sale securities  million in proceeds were received from the maturing of available for sale securities and million was used to fund loan growth 
in and  only million and million respectively was invested in investment securities while million and million in proceeds were received from the maturing of available for sale securities 
in  the reduction in the loan portfolio provided million in cash while in  loan growth utilized million in cash 
principal financing activities include the gathering of deposits  the utilization of fhlb advances  the sale of securities under agreements to repurchase such securities and borrowings from other banks 
in addition  first defiance also purchased common stock for its treasury 
for the year ended december   deposits declined by million  primarily due to the company not replacing million of brokered certificates of deposit used to fund the leader s operations which matured during the year 
by contrast  cash generated from deposit balance increases were million and million in and respectively 
also in the company repaid million of existing advances from the fhlb  borrowed million of new advances from the fhlb  repaid million of borrowings from other banks  and repurchased million of common stock for treasury 
for additional information about cash flows from first defiance s operating  investing and financing activities  see the consolidated statements of cash flows included in the consolidated financial statements 
at december   first defiance had the following commitments to fund deposit  advance borrowing and lease obligations maturity dates by period at december  less than after contractual obligations total year years years years in thousands savings  checking and demand accounts   certificates of deposit     fhlb overnight advances   fhlb fixed advances including interest      securities sold under repurchase agreements   other notes payable lease obligations total contractual cash obligations      includes principal payments of  and interest payments of  at december   first defiance had the following commitments to fund loan or line of credit obligations amount of commitment expiration by period total amounts less than after commitments committed year years years years in thousands mortgage loans in process   commercial loans in process    single family mortgage loan originations   nonmortgage loan originations   consumer lines of credit     commercial lines of credit   total commitments      in addition to the above commitments  at december  first defiance had commitments to sell million of loans held for sale to freddie mac 
to meet its obligations  management can adjust the rate of savings certificates to retain deposits in changing interest rate environments  it can sell or securitize mortgage and non mortgage loans  and it can turn to other sources of financing including fhlb advances  the federal reserve bank  bank lines and brokered certificates of deposit 
at december  first defiance had million capacity under its agreements with the fhlb  the federal reserve bank and other banks 
stockholders equity increased by million  or at december  compared to december  net income for was million  of which million was returned to shareholders in the form of declared dividends

the increase in the market value of available for sale securities increased equity by million 
the vesting of management recognition plan shares and the release of esop shares increased equity by  and  respectively 
stock option exercises increased equity by approximately million

the book value of first defiance s common stock was per share at december  compared to per share at december  the tangible book value excluding goodwill per share was and per share at december  and first defiance is subject to various capital requirements of the office of thrift supervision 
at december   first federal had capital ratios that exceeded the standard to be considered well capitalized 
for additional information about first federal s capital requirements  see note to the consolidated financial statements 
pro forma income statement management does not believe that the reported income from continuing operations accurately represents the true financial picture of first defiance because the continuing operations results for the first three months of and for all prior periods presented do not reflect the reinvestment of any of the net proceeds realized from the sale of the leader 
the following pro forma income statement attempts to present what first defiance s results from continuing operations would have been had the sale of the leader occurred as of january  and the proceeds invested for the period from january  to april  management has estimated that additional assets added to the balance sheet as a result of the sale would have been reinvested to yield a weighted average rate of for the first quarter of also  to the extent possible  management has assumed that proceeds from the sale were used to prepay advances 
dollars are in thousands except per share amounts

income tax on  increase in net interest income at subsequent event on february   first defiance signed a purchase and assumption agreement with rfc banking company and its parent  rurban financial corp  to acquire banking centers located in findlay  ottawa  and mccomb  ohio 
under the terms of the agreement  first defiance will pay a purchase price equal to of all non brokered deposit accounts plus an agreed upon amount for all real estate  furnishings and equipment of those branches 
in addition  first defiance will acquire certain loans of those banking centers 
total deposit balances of those banking centers as of december  were approximately million  of which million were brokered deposits 
the approximate balance of the loans to be acquired by first defiance was million as of december  the acquisition is subject to regulatory approval 
it is anticipated that the transaction will close in the second quarter of critical accounting policies first defiance has established various accounting policies which govern the application of accounting principles generally accepted in the united states in the preparation of its financial statements 
the significant accounting policies of first defiance are described in the footnotes to the consolidated financial statements 
certain accounting policies involve significant judgments and assumptions by management  which have a material impact on the carrying value of certain assets and liabilities  management considers such accounting policies to be critical accounting policies 
the judgments and assumptions used by management are based on historical experience and other factors  which are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
because of the nature of the judgments and assumptions made by management  actual results could differ from these judgments and estimates  which could have a material impact on the carrying value of assets and liabilities and the results of operations of first defiance 
allowance for loan losses first defiance believes the allowance for loan losses is a critical accounting policy that requires the most significant judgments and estimates used in preparation of its consolidated financial statements 
in determining the appropriate estimate for the allowance for loan losses  management considers a number of factors relative to both specific credits in the loan portfolio and macro economic factors relative to the economy of the united states as a whole and the economy of the northwest ohio region in which the company does business 
factors relative to specific credits that are considered include a customer s payment history  a customer s recent financial performance  an assessment of the value of collateral held  knowledge of the customer s character  the financial strength and commitment of any guarantors  the existence of any customer or industry concentrations  changes in a customer s competitive environment  and any other issues that may impact a customer s ability to meet his obligations 
economic factors that are considered include levels of unemployment and inflation  specific plant or business closings in the company s market area  the impact of strikes or other work stoppages  the impact of weather or environmental conditions  especially relative to agricultural borrowers and other matters than may have an impact on the economy as a whole 
in addition to the identification of specific customer s who may be potential credit problems  management considers its historical losses  the results of independent loan reviews  an assessment of the adherence to underwriting standards  the loss experience being reported by other financial institutions operating in the company s market area  and other factors in providing reserves against loan balances that have not been specifically classified 
while management believes its allowance for loan losses is conservatively determined based on the above factors  it does not believe the allowances to be excessive or unnecessary 
refer to the section entitled allowance for loan losses and note  statement of accounting policies for a further description of the company s estimation process and methodology related to the allowance for loan losses 
valuation of mortgage servicing rights first defiance believes the valuations of mortgage servicing rights is a critical accounting policy that requires significant estimates in preparation of its consolidated financial statements 
first defiance recognizes as separate assets the value of mortgage servicing rights  which are acquired through loan origination activities 
first defiance does not purchase any mortgage servicing rights 
key assumptions made by management relative to the valuation of mortgage servicing rights include the stratification policy used in valuing servicing  assumptions relative to future prepayments of mortgages  the potential value of any escrow deposits maintained or ancillary income received as a result of the servicing activity and discount rates used to value the present value of a future cash flow stream 
the value of mortgage servicing rights is especially vulnerable in a falling interest rate environment 
refer also to the section entitled mortgage servicing rights and note  statement of accounting policies  and note  mortgage banking  for a further description of first defiance s process  methodology and assumptions 
sfas deferral of fees first defiance believes that sfas no 
deferral of fees is a critical accounting policy that utilizes estimates in its preparation of its consolidated financial statements 
first defiance accounts for loan origination and commitment fees and certain direct loan origination costs by deferring the net fees  or net costs  and amortizing them as an adjustment of the related loan s yield 
while the amount of fees to be deferred is generally apparent in the origination of a loan  the amount of costs  especially indirect or allocated costs to defer is a judgment that management makes based various time studies and cost accounting assumptions 
refer to the section entitled revenue recognition and note  statement of accounting policies  for a detailed description of first defiance s process and methodology 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk asset liability management a significant portion of the company s revenues and net income is derived from net interest income and  accordingly  the company strives to manage its interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities to generate what management believes to be an appropriate contribution from net interest income 
asset and liability management seeks to control the volatility of the company s performance due to changes in interest rates 
the company attempts to achieve an appropriate relationship between rate sensitive assets and rate sensitive liabilities 
first defiance does not presently use off balance sheet derivatives to enhance its risk management 
first defiance monitors interest rate risk on a monthly basis through simulation analysis that measures the impact changes in interest rates can have on net interest income 
the simulation technique analyzes the effect of a presumed basis point shift in interest rates which is consistent with management s estimate of the range of potential interest rate fluctuations and takes into account prepayment speeds on amortizing financial instruments  loan and deposit volumes and rates  non maturity deposit assumptions and capital requirements 
the results of the simulation indicate that in an environment where interest rates rise basis points over a month period  first defiance s net interest income would increase by just over the base case scenario 
were interest rates to fall by basis points during the same month period  the simulation indicates that net interest income would decrease by only 
first defiance has increased its lending activities in the non residential real estate and commercial loan areas 
while such loans carry higher credit risk than residential mortgage lending  they tend to be more rate sensitive than residential mortgage loans 
the balance of first defiance s non residential and multi family real estate loan portfolio increased to million  which is split between million of fixed rate loans and million of adjustable rate loans at december  the commercial loan portfolio increased to million  which is split between million of fixed rate loans and million of adjustable rate loans at december  certain of the loans classified as adjustable have fixed rates for an initial term that may be as long as five years 
the maturities on fixed rate loans are generally less than years 
first defiance also has significant balances of consumer loans million at december  which tend to have a shorter duration than residential mortgage loans  and home equity and improvement loans million at december  which fluctuate with changes in the prime lending rate 
also  to limit its interest rate risk  first federal sells approximately of its fixed rate mortgage originations into the secondary market 
in addition to the simulation analysis  first federal also prepares an economic value of equity eve analysis 
this analysis calculates the net present value of first federal s assets and liabilities in rate shock environments that range from basis points to basis points 
the results of this analysis are reflected in the following table 
december  economic value of equity as of economic value of equity present value of assets change in rates amount change change ratio change dollars in thousands bp   bp bp   bp bp  bp   bp bp   bp based on the above analysis  in the event of a basis point change in interest rates as of december   first federal would experience a increase in its economic value of equity in a rising rate environment and only a decrease in its economic value of equity in a declining rate environment 
during periods of rising rates  the value of monetary assets declines 
conversely  during periods of falling rates  the value of monetary assets increases 
it should be noted that the amount of change in value of specific assets and liabilities due to changes in rates is not the same in a rising rate environment as in a falling rate environment 
based on the eve analysis  the change in the economic value of equity in both rising and falling rate environments is generally negligible because both its assets and liabilities have relatively short durations and the durations are fairly closely matched 
the average duration of its assets at december  was years while the average duration of its liabilities was years 
in evaluating first federal s exposure to interest rate risk  certain shortcomings inherent in the each of the methods of analysis presented must be considered 
for example  although certain assets and liabilities may have similar maturities or periods to repricing  they may react in different degrees to changes in market interest rates 
also  the interest rates on certain types of assets and liabilities may fluctuate in advance of changes in market rates while interest rates on other types of financial instruments may lag behind current changes in market rates 
furthermore  in the event of changes in rates  prepayments and early withdrawal levels could differ significantly from the assumptions in calculating the table and the results therefore may differ from those presented 
forward looking information forward looking statements in this report are made in reliance upon the safe harbor provisions of the private securities litigation reform act of the statements in this report which are not historical fact are forward looking statements and they include  among other statements  projections about growth in the financial condition section  comments about the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses and projections about interest rate simulations included in the asset liability management section 
actual results may differ from expectations contained in such forward looking information as a result of factors including but not limited to the interest rate environment  economic policy or conditions  federal and state banking and tax regulations  and competitive factors in the marketplace 
each of these factors could affect estimates  assumptions  uncertainties and risks considered in the development of forward looking information and could cause actual results to differ materially from management s expectation regarding future performance
