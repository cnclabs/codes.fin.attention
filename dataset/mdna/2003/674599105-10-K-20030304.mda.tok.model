item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations md a incorporating item a in this report  the term occidental refers to occidental petroleum corporation and or one or more entities in which it owns a majority voting interest subsidiaries 
occidental is divided into two segments oil and gas and chemical 
business environment oil and natural gas industry oil and gas prices are the key variables that drive the industry s financial performance 
prices can vary even on a short term basis 
the average west texas intermediate wti market price for was barrel bbl compared with bbl in from a low point of less than bbl in  prices have improved to a fourth quarter of average price of bbl  which was the strongest quarter for oil prices since the first quarter of nymex domestic natural gas prices began at approximately per thousand cubic feet mcf  but increased during the year 
for the fourth quarter of  gas prices averaged mcf compared with mcf for the fourth quarter of chemical industry the chemical industry continued to struggle throughout the year due to poor economic conditions 
however  several commodity chemical product prices improved moderately due to the resilient building and construction industry and marginal improvement in demand for general durable goods 
domestic chlorine demand improved slightly in  compared to due to the modest growth across all markets other than vinyl chloride monomer vcm 
despite modest growth in chlorine demand  prices remained strong and improved significantly through the year 
strong chlorine prices resulted from a percent overall decrease in industry capacity and unplanned production outages 
caustic soda prices declined through the second quarter due to a slow rebound in downstream product demand  but improved in the fourth quarter as supply became tighter 
polyvinyl chloride pvc prices improved reflecting the ability to pass through price increases in feedstock costs as well as strong demand in building and construction markets  resulting in some margin improvement 
strategic overview and review of business results strategy occidental s overall corporate strategy aims to generate competitive total returns to stockholders and consists of three basic elements focus on large  long lived oil and gas assets with growth potential 
maintain financial discipline and strengthen the balance sheet 
harvest cash from chemicals 
large  long lived legacy oil and gas assets like those in california  the permian basin in texas and qatar tend to have moderate decline rates  enhanced secondary and tertiary recovery opportunities and economies of scale that lead to cost effective production 
these assets are expected to contribute strong earnings and cash flow and serve as a strong foundation for new growth initiatives 
at occidental  maintaining financial discipline means prudently investing capital in projects that are expected to generate above cost of capital returns from these investments throughout the business cycle 
during periods of high commodity prices  occidental will use the bulk of its cash flow after capital and dividends to reduce the volatility of its earnings either through debt reduction or  to a lesser extent  by acquiring additional properties with low risk characteristics 
occidental may also sell properties to reduce debt and to fund other higher return acquisitions  while strengthening the balance sheet to reduce risk and increase earnings 
the chemicals business provides free cash flow 
from through  cash flow  after subtracting capital expenditures  from the chemicals business totaled billion 
this does not include asset sales  net of acquisitions  which provided an additional billion 
specific actions oil and gas the oil and gas business strategy has three parts that  together  are focused on adding new oil and natural gas reserves at a pace well ahead of production  while simultaneously keeping finding and development costs among the lowest in the industry continue to add commercial reserves in and around occidental s core areas  which are the us  middle east and latin america  through a combination of focused exploration and development programs 
pursue commercial opportunities with host governments in core areas to enhance the development of mature fields with large volumes of remaining oil in place by applying appropriate technology and innovative reservoir management practices 
maintain a disciplined approach in buying and selling assets at attractive prices 
occidental s oil and gas operations are located in california  kansas  oklahoma  new mexico and texas domestically and in colombia  ecuador  oman  pakistan  qatar  russia  united arab emirates and yemen internationally 
occidental also has interests in several other countries 
the asset mix within each of the core areas has been strengthened 
occidental has sold properties with low or no current return and invested in assets with higher performance potential 
the results of these changes are discussed below in business review oil and gas 
chemical occidental manufactures and markets basic chemicals  vinyls and performance chemicals directly and through various affiliates collectively  oxychem 
oxychem focuses on the chlorovinyls chain where it begins with chlorine  which is co produced with caustic soda  and then converts chlorine and ethylene  through a series of intermediate products  into pvc 
in august  occidental and lyondell chemical company completed an agreement for occidental to sell its percent share of equistar to lyondell and to purchase a percent equity interest in lyondell 
occidental entered into these transactions to diversify its petrochemicals interest 
these transactions reduced occidental s direct exposure to petrochemicals volatility  yet allowed it to maintain a presence and preserve  through its lyondell investment  an economic upside when the petrochemicals industry recovers 
corporate in july  occidental sold its interests in a subsidiary that owned a texas intrastate pipeline system and its interest in a liquefied natural gas lng project in indonesia 
after tax proceeds of approximately million from these transactions were used to reduce debt 
in april  occidental sold its interest in canadian occidental petroleum ltd  renamed nexen inc canadianoxy or nexen 
after tax proceeds  together with tax benefits from the disposition of oil producing properties in peru at the same time  totaling million were used to reduce debt following the altura acquisition 
debt structure the components of occidental s total debt are shown in the table below amounts in millions other occidental recourse total date debt debt a debt a a includes trust preferred securities  natural gas delivery commitment which was terminated in  corporate and subsidiary preferred stock and capital lease obligations 
occidental s year end total debt to capitalization ratio has declined to approximately percent from the percent level that existed at the end of  as shown in the table below 
the debt to capitalization ratio is computed by dividing total debt by total capitalization 
total debt capitalization ratio date total debt capitalization ratio business review oil and gas occidental s overall performance during the past several years reflects the successful implementation of its oil and gas business strategy  beginning with the billion acquisition of the elk hills oil and gas field in california 
the elk hills acquisition was followed in april by the purchases of both altura energy in texas for billion and the thums property in long beach  california for million 
at the end of  these three assets made up percent of occidental s worldwide proven oil reserves and percent of its proven gas reserves 
on a barrel of oil equivalent boe basis  they accounted for percent of occidental s worldwide reserves 
in  the combined production from these assets averaged approximately  boe per day  which represents percent of occidental s total worldwide production 
these businesses also contributed approximately percent of oil and gas segment earnings and percent of oil and gas segment free cash flow 
elk hills occidental operates the elk hills oil and gas field in the southern portion of california s san joaquin valley with an approximate percent interest 
the field reserves are among the top ten in the lower united states and the field is the largest producer of gas in california 
production increased in to approximately  boe per day from approximately  boe per day in elk hills has generated total net cash flow  after subtracting million of capital expenditures  of approximately billion since occidental acquired the asset in early since the date of acquisition  occidental has replaced percent of its total elk hills oil and gas production of million boe 
at the end of  the property still had an estimated million boe of proved reserves  compared to the million boe that were recorded at the time of the acquisition 
permian basin occidental integrated the altura properties with its previously existing permian basin properties in southwest texas and southeast new mexico 
since the acquisition  the former altura properties have generated more than billion in total net cash flow  after subtracting capital expenditures of approximately million 
one element of occidental s strategy in the permian basin is to acquire producing properties at attractive prices that offer synergies with its existing operations 
in  occidental made a number of small acquisitions in the permian basin for a total purchase price of million 
these acquisitions accounted for total proven reserve additions of million boe for an average cost of per boe 
total permian oil and gas production averaged  boe per day in compared to  boe per day in net permian oil production averaged  barrels per day in compared to  barrels per day in occidental is the largest oil producer in texas 
approximately percent of occidental s permian basin production is reliant upon the application of carbon dioxide co flood technology  an enhanced oil recovery technique  a portion of which is supplied by the bravo dome co unit 
this involves injecting co into oil reservoirs where it acts as a solvent  causing the oil to flow more freely so it can be pumped to the surface 
the size of these co flood operations makes occidental a world leader in the development and application of this technology 
in  occidental implemented two large co projects  one in the cogdell field in west texas and the other in hobbs  new mexico 
when these two projects become fully operational  they are expected to add approximately  boe per day to occidental s production 
thums occidental purchased thums  the field contractor of the long beach unit  an oil and gas production unit offshore long beach  california  in it is part of the wilmington field  which is the fourth largest oil field in the continental us at year end  net production from the thums oil property was averaging  barrels per day 
occidental completed construction of a megawatt gas fired power plant and began generating electricity in december previously  the oil field s operations depended on the local utility for power to operate electric pumps critical to production 
the electricity supply from the utility was interruptible  meaning that when power was in short supply  service could be temporarily discontinued 
electricity is the largest component of operating costs for this field and by securing a reliable source of electricity  it will be possible to reduce overall field production costs 
gulf of mexico in july  occidental completed agreements with respect to two transactions involving its interests on the continental shelf in the gulf of mexico gom and the proceeds were used to reduce debt 
occidental has a one third interest in the deep water horn mountain oil field  which is its primary asset in the gom 
bp plc bp is the operator 
the discovery well  which was drilled to a depth of nearly  feet  is located about miles off the louisiana mississippi coast in  feet of water 
development work was completed on time and under budget and the field began production in november  with a year end exit rate of approximately  net boe per day 
net proved reserves are approximately million boe 
hugoton occidental owns a large concentration of gas reserves  production interests and royalty interests in the hugoton area of kansas and oklahoma 
the hugoton field is the largest natural gas field discovered to date in north america 
occidental s hugoton operations produced  mcf of natural gas and  barrels of oil per day in middle east dolphin project in  occidental purchased a percent interest in dolphin energy limited del  the operator of the dolphin project 
the dolphin project  which is expected to cost its owners billion in total  consists of two parts a development and production sharing agreement with qatar to develop and produce natural gas and condensate in qatar s north field  and the rights for del to build  own and operate a mile long  inch export pipeline to transport billion cubic feet per day of dry natural gas from qatar to markets in the uae for a period of years 
the pipeline will have capacity to transport up to billion cubic feet per day  which will allow for additional business development projects 
del is currently negotiating contracts to market the gas with users in the uae 
construction on the upstream production and processing facilities and the pipeline is expected to begin in and production is scheduled to begin in early the dolphin partners anticipate securing project financing 
occidental has not recorded any revenue or production costs for this project and no oil and gas reserves have been included in its proved oil and gas reserves 
oman occidental s oman business centers on its million barrel discovery in block  in which it has a percent working interest 
occidental has produced more than million gross barrels from the block  most of it from the safah field 
net production to occidental averaged  barrels of oil per day in the fourth quarter 
occidental uses multi lateral horizontal wells to increase production and recovery rates and to minimize the number of wells needed 
today  percent of occidental s production in oman relies on horizontal wells 
a new waterflood program is currently under way at safah that will enhance production and improve the ultimate recovery of reserves from the field 
occidental recently entered into an agreement  which is awaiting government approval  to sell an estimated million cubic feet of natural gas per day from block operations to the omani government  beginning in early and extending through the occidental omani agreement is expected to open up a market for previously stranded gas that is associated with oil production from the safah field 
occidental also continues its exploration program in the adjacent block yemen in yemen  occidental owns direct working interests in the masila field in block percent and the east shabwa field in block percent 
in addition  occidental has interests in seven exploration blocks encompassing nearly million acres 
of these  occidental is the operator of blocks and  with working interests of percent and percent  respectively  and has a percent working interest in each of five blocks blocks    and on the border with saudi arabia 
occidental s net production averaged  barrels of oil per day in  with  coming from the masila field and the remainder from east shabwa 
a series of step out wells at masila in added million barrels of new reserves 
occidental drilled and completed two exploratory wells in block in late and completed a d seismic program in the third quarter of in block qatar in qatar  occidental successfully reversed years of declining production in the idd el shargi north dome isnd field 
by introducing advanced drilling systems and by applying new waterflooding and reservoir characterization techniques  occidental is increasing production and recoverable reserves from the field s billion barrels of remaining oil in place 
occidental is moving forward under a new agreement with a second phase in the development of isnd 
the new phase is targeting the development and recovery of million gross barrels of additional reserves from isnd 
occidental is also engaged in full field development of the idd el shargi south dome issd field which  as a satellite to the north dome  reduces the overall capital requirement of the two projects 
combined production from the two fields averaged  barrels per day  net to occidental  in when the second phase of isnd and the full field development of issd are fully completed  occidental expects its total net production from qatar to increase to approximately  barrels per day in reserves  net to occidental  related to these projects are expected to total million barrels 
also  see the dolphin project discussed above 
saudi arabia in saudi arabia  occidental has a percent interest in the core venture two consortium  which is proposing to invest in the red sea area to help the kingdom identify and develop new natural gas reserves for the domestic market 
an initial agreement was signed with the kingdom on june  other eastern hemisphere pakistan occidental holds oil and gas working interests  that vary from to percent  in four badin blocks in pakistan 
bp is the operator 
in  occidental purchased additional interests in two of these blocks from the government of pakistan for approximately million 
current gross production is  boe per day  while occidental s net share is approximately  boe per day 
current plans call for drilling to wells per year to develop new and existing fields 
additionally  occidental continues to evaluate various exploration opportunities 
russia in russia  occidental owns percent of a joint venture company  vanyoganneft  that operates in the western siberian oil basin 
production for was approximately  boe per day  net to occidental 
latin america colombia occidental has a percent net share of production and is operator of the cano limon oil field in colombia 
colombia s national oil company  ecopetrol  operates the cano limon covenas oil pipeline and marine export terminal 
the pipeline transports oil produced from the cano limon field for export to international markets 
in addition  occidental has an percent working interest in two exploration blocks encompassing  square miles in the central llanos basin 
in  production from occidental s cano limon operations in colombia increased substantially from due to improved security along the export pipeline that reduced the number of attacks by local terrorist groups 
the pipeline was subjected to a record number of attacks in occidental s net share of production averaged  barrels of oil per day compared to  barrels per day in this operation accounts for less than one percent of occidental s worldwide assets  only two percent of total worldwide reserves and less than seven percent of average worldwide oil and gas production in occidental presently anticipates that it will recover the proved reserves attributable to its contract 
ecuador gross production in block in  which occidental operates with a percent working interest  averaged approximately  barrels of oil per day net to occidental 
full field development of the eden yuturi oil field in the southeastern corner of block is complete 
full scale production is scheduled to coincide with the anticipated completion  in the second half of  of the oleoducto de crudos pesados ocp ltd 
oil export pipeline  in which occidental has a percent interest 
in addition  work continues in the producing areas in the western portion of the block 
the combined effect of these projects is expected to add total net incremental production of  barrels per day to occidental s production profile in in addition  occidental is expanding its exploration activities in block with aggressive d seismic and drilling programs 
in  occidental farmed out a percent economic interest in block in ecuador to alberta energy company ltd 
aec  now encana 
as a result of this transaction  encana agreed to fund a significant portion of the capital program 
foreign oil companies  including occidental  have been paying value added tax vat  generally calculated on the basis of percent of expenditures for goods and services used in the production of oil for export 
until  oil companies  like other companies producing products for export  filed for and received reimbursement of vat 
in  the ecuador tax authority announced that the oil companies vat payments did not qualify for reimbursement 
in response  the affected oil companies filed actions in the ecuador tax court to seek a judicial determination that the expenditures are subject to reimbursement 
in november  occidental initiated an international arbitration proceeding against the ecuadorian government under the united states ecuador bilateral investment treaty based on occidental s belief that the ecuadorian government is arbitrarily and discriminatorily refusing to refund the vat to occidental 
occidental believes that it has a valid claim for reimbursement under applicable ecuador tax law and the treaty 
in the event of an unfavorable outcome  the potential income statement effect would not be significant 
production sharing contracts occidental conducts its operations in qatar  oman and yemen under production sharing contracts 
occidental receives a share of production from production sharing contracts to recover its costs and an additional share for profit 
occidental s share of production from these contracts decreases when oil prices improve and increases when oil prices decline 
overall  occidental s net economic benefit from these contracts is greater at higher oil prices 
business review chemical chlor alkali saw increased demand for chlorine in all major market segments  particularly vcm  propylene oxide and epichlorohydrin 
domestic demand for co product caustic soda was flat year over year and exports from the us declined 
the chlor alkali industry entered coming off the lowest operating rate since as a result of increased demand  coupled with a full year of capacity reductions in  industry operating rates increased from percent in the fourth quarter of to a peak of percent in the third quarter of annual operating rates increased from percent for to percent for prices for chlorine followed the demand curve and increased steadily throughout the year 
declining total demand for caustic soda coupled with increased electrochemical unit ecu production led to falling caustic soda prices through the third quarter 
although markets have improved steadily in  oxychem has maintained its deer park chlor alkali production facility in houston  texas in a standby mode pending further strengthening in overall economic conditions and improved demand for caustic soda 
oxychem successfully began commercial operation of a megawatt cogeneration facility in taft  louisiana in the fourth quarter of this facility provides all of the steam and electric power requirements for the taft  louisiana chlor alkali plant at a lower cost than if the plant were to generate its own steam and purchase electricity from a public utility 
it sells excess power in the merchant market 
vinyls saw improvement in north american pvc resin demand following a strengthening trend which began in early for the year  north american pvc resin demand grew at a rate of approximately percent 
the market exhibited strong growth through july  with more moderate growth in the third quarter  followed by seasonal contraction in the fourth quarter 
as a result of higher demand  together with lower inventory levels  in much of the chain  industry operating rates climbed from the low percent levels of the second half of to above percent for the second and third quarters of although pvc resin capacity remains in oversupply  tightness in vcm and chlorine feedstocks have constrained vinyls production levels throughout the year 
vinyls prices reflected this tightness by rising cents lb in the first seven months of prices to vinyls export markets peaked somewhat earlier in the year then retreated during the third quarter  due primarily to a sharp reduction in chinese imports 
prices posted improvements in late fourth quarter as spot buyers anticipated supply constraints for coupled with an overall improvement in demand in southeast asia 
outlook oil and gas the petroleum industry is highly competitive and subject to significant volatility due to numerous market forces 
crude oil and natural gas prices are affected by market fundamentals such as weather  inventory levels  competing fuel prices  overall demand and the availability of supply 
in the last half of  worldwide oil prices strengthened due to increasing political and economic turmoil in venezuela and the growing threat of conflict with iraq 
venezuela alone accounts for approximately percent of total us oil imports 
these uncertainties raised concerns about the security and availability of ample supplies to meet growing demand 
in  continued unrest in venezuela and the middle east portend significant volatility for short term crude oil prices and continued price uncertainty over the long term 
if the turmoil continues well into  the result could be a continued tightening of crude oil supplies and correspondingly higher prices 
conversely  a lessening of the uncertainties could result in greater crude oil supply and lower prices 
sustained high oil prices will significantly impact profitability and returns for occidental and other upstream producers 
however  the industry has historically experienced wide fluctuations within price cycles 
for example  the average price of wti crude oil in the first quarter of was bbl compared to in the fourth quarter 
although oil prices cannot be predicted with any certainty  wti price has averaged approximately barrel over the past ten years 
while supply demand fundamentals are a decisive factor affecting domestic natural gas prices over the long term  day to day prices may be more volatile in the futures markets  such as on the nymex and other exchanges  which make it difficult to predict prices with any degree of confidence 
over the long term  volatile prices  sharp production decline rates and the uncertain timing of new gas supplies  in response to new gas related drilling  place constraints on the domestic gas supply industry 
record high gas related drilling rates in the first half of added very little new domestic production capacity  increasing uncertainty about the gas supply outlook  particularly as drilling declined in the wake of falling prices in the first half of the early onset of severe winter weather for the heating season contributed to an increase in gas prices in the second half of however  this did not spark a corresponding increase in gas driven drilling activity  giving rise to expectations of steeper production decline rates in robust prices in could lead to a new upsurge in gas related drilling to address longer term supply uncertainties 
chemical the performance of the chemical business is difficult to forecast  but this business is capable of contributing significant earnings and cash flow when demand is strong 
the major factors that have an impact on the performance of the chemicals business are general economic conditions  energy and feedstock costs  and the effect of changes in productive capacity 
chlor alkali further improvement in ecu operating rates is expected as domestic demand for both chlorine and caustic soda are forecasted to increase over percent in and industry capacity is expected to decline further 
pvc  and other derivatives not manufactured by occidental  are leading the growth in demand for chlorine 
growth in demand for caustic soda is expected to track overall manufacturing activity 
with increasing demand and increased capacity utilization  pricing for chlorine is expected to improve slightly over the fourth quarter levels 
caustic soda prices are expected to show a marked improvement over as contracts reflect previously announced price increases and overall supply and demand become more balanced 
energy costs for are expected to increase over levels 
vinyls occidental expects north american pvc resin demand to grow percent for  based on annual us and global gdp growth expectations of approximately percent 
north american pvc operating rates are expected to continue to move upward in  averaging percent higher than rates 
chlorovinyls supply constraints  together with spiking energy costs  have created conditions for vinyls price increases early in in addition  vcm intermediates will be in shorter supply than pvc because of industry capacity rationalizations and maintenance requirements 
operating rates for north american vcm producers are expected to average well above percent 
energy and raw material price escalation will limit margin growth in tightness in chlorine supply for vinyls production will remain a concern in income summary occidental reported net income of billion per share in  on net sales of billion  compared with net income of billion per share in  on net sales of billion

lease payments are charged to occidental s operations  mainly as cost of sales 
the accounting treatment for the leases described above  including the taft lease  is dictated by statement of financial accounting standards sfas no

the probable consolidation would affect the laporte  texas vcm plant lease 
if consolidation were to take place  there would be no significant effect on occidental s financial condition  however  consolidation would result in an increase in assets of approximately million and liabilities of million  with an after tax charge of approximately million in the third quarter of that would be recorded as a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principles 
annual expense for depreciation would increase by approximately million pre tax 
if occidental chose to terminate the leases prior to adoption  there would be no cumulative effect of a change in accounting principles 
oxymar occidental has a percent ownership interest before minority interest in oxymar 
occidental owns percent of oxymar directly and the oxyvinyls partnership  which is percent owned by occidental  owns percent

marubeni has a right to put its interest in oxymar to occidental in by paying approximately million to occidental and  in connection with this transfer  require occidental to assume marubeni s guarantee of oxymar s debt 
occidental determined that marubeni s strike price was equal to fair value as of the issue date and assigned a fair value of zero to the option 
therefore  occidental did not record an asset or liability associated with this put option in the consolidated financial statements 
since the put price was negotiated on arms length terms and has no predetermined conditions that would require exercise of the option  occidental cannot determine whether marubeni will exercise its option 
occidental does not expect to record a loss if the option is exercised 
if oxymar were to be consolidated at december   assets would increase by million and liabilities would increase by million on occidental s consolidated balance sheets 
as of december   occidental had advanced million to oxymar and had a net equity investment of million

in general  the fair value recorded for derivative instruments is based on quoted market prices  dealer quotes and the black scholes or similar valuation models 
accounting for derivatives and definitions occidental accounts for its derivatives under the provisions of sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  as amended by sfas no 
and sfas no 
collectively sfas no 

under sfas no 
 recognition of the gain or loss that results from recording and adjusting a derivative to fair market value depends on the purpose for issuing or holding the derivative 
gains and losses from derivatives that are not designated as hedges are recognized immediately in earnings 
a hedge is considered effective if changes in its value are offset exactly by changes in the value of the item being hedged 
a hedge is ineffective to the extent changes in its value are not matched by offsetting changes in value for the item being hedged 
if a derivative is used to hedge the fair value of an asset or liability fair value hedge  the gains or losses from adjusting the derivative to its market value are recognized in earnings immediately and to the extent the hedge is effective  offset the concurrent recognition in earnings of changes in the fair value of the hedged item 
gains or losses from derivatives used to hedge future cash flows cash flow hedges are recorded on the balance sheet in accumulated other comprehensive income oci  a component of stockholders equity  until the transaction that is hedged is recognized in earnings 
however  to the extent the value of the derivative differs from the value of the anticipated cash flows of the hedged transaction  the hedge is considered partly ineffective and the resulting gains or losses are recognized immediately in earnings 
commodity price risk general occidental s results are sensitive to fluctuations in crude oil and natural gas prices 
based on current levels of production  if oil prices vary overall by per barrel  it would have approximately a million annual effect on income  before us income tax 
if natural gas prices vary by per million btu mmbtu  it would have approximately a million annual effect on income  before us income tax 
if production levels change in the future  the sensitivity of occidental s results to oil and gas prices also would change 
occidental s results are also sensitive to fluctuations in chemical prices 
if chlorine or caustic soda prices vary by ton  it would have approximately a million and million  respectively  annual effect on income before us income taxes 
if pvc prices vary by 
lb  it would have approximately a million annual effect on income  before us income taxes 
if edc prices vary by ton  it would have approximately a million annual effect on income  before us income taxes 
according to chemical market associates  inc  december average contract prices were chlorine ton  caustic soda ton  pvc lb and edc ton 
marketing and trading operations occidental periodically uses different types of derivative instruments to achieve the best prices for oil and gas 
derivatives are also used by occidental to reduce its exposure to price volatility and mitigate fluctuations in commodity related cash flows 
occidental enters into low risk marketing and trading activities through its separate marketing organization  which operates under established policy controls and procedures 
with respect to derivatives used in its oil and gas marketing operations  occidental utilizes a combination of futures  forwards  options and swaps to offset various physical transactions 
overall  occidental usually remains unhedged to long term oil and gas prices and its use of derivatives in hedging activity remains at a low level 
in september  occidental unwound its natural gas delivery commitment and corresponding natural gas price swap which were entered into in november occidental recognized a pre tax loss of million related to these transactions 
risk management occidental conducts its risk management activities for energy commodities which include buying  selling  marketing  trading  and hedging activities under the controls and governance of the risk management policy 
the chief financial officer and risk management committee oversee these controls  which are implemented and enforced by the trading control officer 
the trading control officer provides an independent and separate check on results of marketing and trading activities 
controls for energy commodities include limits on credit  limits on trading  segregation of duties  delegation of authority and a number of other policy and procedural controls 
fair value of contracts the following tables reconcile the changes in the fair value of occidental s marketing and trading contracts during and and segregate the open contracts at december  by maturity periods 
in millions fair value of contracts outstanding at beginning of year gains on contracts realized or otherwise settled during the year changes in fair value attributable to changes in valuation techniques and assumptions other changes in fair values fair value of contracts outstanding at end of year maturity periods total source of to to and fair fair value thereafter value prices actively quoted prices provided by other external sources prices based on models and other valuation methods total the tables above include the fair value of physical positions and the fair value of the related financial instruments for trading and marketing operations 
at december  and  the physical positions were a net gain of million and a net loss of million  respectively 
the value of the derivative financial instruments that offset these physical positions are a net loss of million at december  and a net gain of million at december  gains and losses are netted in the statement of operations 
on the balance sheets  except where a right of set off exists  gains are recognized as assets and losses are recognized as liabilities 
commodity hedges on a limited basis  occidental uses cash flow hedges for the sale of crude oil and natural gas 
crude oil cash flow hedges were executed for approximately percent and percent of total us oil production in and  respectively 
natural gas cash flow hedges were executed for approximately percent of total us gas production 
occidental s commodity cash flow hedging instruments were highly effective 
at december   all of these cash flow hedges were settled 
no fair value hedges were used for oil and gas production during quantitative information occidental uses value at risk to estimate the potential effects of changes in fair values of derivatives and commodity contracts used in trading activities 
this method determines the maximum potential negative short term change in fair value with a percent level of confidence 
for non trading activities  there were no material amounts outstanding at december  the value at risk for both oil and natural gas is summarized below marketing and trading value at risk for the years ended december in millions value at risk oil high during the year low during the year average for the year value at risk natural gas high during the year low during the year average for the year interest rate risk general occidental is exposed to risk resulting from changes in interest rates and it enters into various derivative financial instruments to manage interest rate exposure 
interest rate swaps  forward locks and futures contracts are entered into periodically as part of occidental s overall strategy 
hedging activities occidental has entered into several interest rate swaps that qualified for fair value hedge accounting 
these derivatives effectively convert approximately billion of fixed rate debt to variable rate debt with maturities ranging from to occidental was a party to a series of forward interest rate locks  which qualified as cash flow hedges 
the hedges were related to the construction of a cogeneration plant that was completed in december and leased by occidental concurrently 
the associated loss on the hedges through december is approximately million after tax  which is recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income oci and will be recognized in earnings over the lease term of years on a straight line basis 
certain of occidental s equity investees have entered into additional derivative instruments that qualified as cash flow hedges 
occidental reflects its proportionate share of these cash flow hedges in oci 
tabular presentation of interest rate risk in millions of us dollars  except rates us dollar usdollar year of maturity fixed rate variable rate a grand total a  b thereafter   total    average interest rate fair value    a includes fixed rate debt with fair value hedges but excludes million of mark to market adjustments related to such hedges 
b excludes million of unamortized discounts 
credit risk occidental s energy contracts are spread among numerous counterparties 
creditworthiness is reviewed before doing business with a new counterparty and on an ongoing basis 
occidental monitors aggregated counterparty exposure relative to credit limits  and manages credit enhancement issues 
credit exposure for each customer is monitored for outstanding balances  current month activity  and forward mark to market exposure 
foreign currency risk several of occidental s foreign operations are located in countries whose currencies generally depreciate against the us dollar on a continuing basis 
typically  effective currency forward markets do not exist for these countries 
therefore  occidental attempts to manage its exposure primarily by balancing monetary assets and liabilities and maintaining cash positions only at levels necessary for operating purposes 
generally  international crude oil sales are denominated in us dollars 
additionally  all of occidental s oil and gas foreign entities have the us dollar as the functional currency 
however  in one foreign chemical subsidiary where the local currency is the functional currency  occidental has exposure on us dollar denominated debt that is not material 
at december  and  occidental had not entered into any foreign currency derivative instruments 
the effect of exchange rate transactions in foreign currencies is included in periodic income 
derivative and fair value disclosures the following table shows derivative financial instruments included in the consolidated balance sheets balance at december  in millions derivative financial instrument assets a current non current derivative financial instrument liabilities a current non current a amounts include energy trading contracts 
as a result of fair value swaps  the amount of interest expense recorded in the income statement is lower by approximately million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the following table summarizes after tax derivative activity recorded in oci for the years ended december in millions beginning balance cumulative effect of change in accounting principle losses gains from changes in current cash flow hedges amount reclassified to income ending balance during the years ended december  and  an million after tax loss and a million after tax gain  respectively  were reclassified from oci into earnings  resulting from the expiration of cash flow hedges when the hedged transactions closed 
during the years ended december  and  a net unrealized after tax loss of million and a net unrealized after tax gain of million  respectively  were recorded to oci relating to changes in current cash flow hedges 
during the next twelve months  occidental expects that million of net derivative after tax losses included in oci  based on their valuation at december   will be reclassified into earnings when the hedged transactions close 
hedge ineffectiveness did not have a significant impact on earnings for the years ended december  and accounting for energy trading activities in the third quarter of  occidental adopted certain provisions of emerging issues task force eitf issue no 
 issues involved in accounting for contracts under issue no 
these provisions prescribe significant changes in how revenue from energy trading is recorded 
occidental has two major types of oil and gas revenues revenues from its equity production  and revenues from the sale of oil and gas produced by other companies  but purchased and resold by occidental  referred to as revenue from trading activities 
both types of sales involve physical deliveries and had been historically recorded on a gross basis in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles 
with the adoption of eitf issue no 
 occidental now reflects the revenue from trading activities on a net basis 
there were no changes in gross margins  net income  cash flow or earnings per share for any period as a result of adopting this requirement 
however  net sales and cost of sales were reduced by equal and offsetting amounts to reflect the adoption of this requirement 
occidental has not engaged in any of the round trip trading activities that were the focus of the ferc s energy industry investigation activity in for the years ended december   and  net sales and cost of sales were reduced from amounts previously reported by approximately billion representing amounts for the first two quarters of  billion and billion  respectively  to conform to the current presentation 
since  occidental has accounted for certain energy trading contracts in accordance with eitf issue no 
 accounting for contracts involved in energy trading and risk management activities 
eitf issue no 
required that all energy trading contracts must be marked to fair value with gains and losses included in earnings  whether the contracts were derivatives or not 
in october  the eitf rescinded eitf issue no 
thus precluding mark to market accounting for all energy trading contracts that are not derivatives and fair value accounting for inventories purchased from third parties 
also  the rescission requires derivative gains and losses to be presented net on the income statement  whether or not they are physically settled  if the derivative instruments are held for trading purposes 
occidental will adopt this accounting change in the first quarter of and expects to record a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principles charge of approximately million  after tax 
starting january   occidental no longer records energy trading contracts that are not derivatives on a mark to market basis 
taxes deferred tax liabilities were million at december   net of deferred tax assets of million 
the current portion of the deferred tax assets of million is included in prepaid expenses and other 
the net deferred tax assets are expected to be realized through future operating income and reversal of taxable temporary differences 
lawsuits  claims  commitments  contingencies and related matters occidental petroleum corporation opc and certain of its subsidiaries have been named in a substantial number of lawsuits  claims and other legal proceedings 
these actions seek  among other things  compensation for alleged personal injury  breach of contract  property damage  punitive damages  civil penalties or other losses  or injunctive or declaratory relief 
opc and certain of its subsidiaries also have been named in proceedings under the comprehensive environmental response  compensation  and liability act cercla and similar federal  state and local environmental laws 
these environmental proceedings seek funding or performance of remediation and  in some cases  compensation for alleged property damage  punitive damages and civil penalties  however  occidental is usually one of many companies in these proceedings and has to date been successful in sharing response costs with other financially sound companies 
with respect to all such lawsuits  claims and proceedings  including environmental proceedings  occidental accrues reserves when it is probable a liability has been incurred and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated 
during the course of its operations  occidental is subject to audit by tax authorities for varying periods in various federal  state  local and foreign tax jurisdictions 
taxable years prior to are closed for us federal income tax purposes 
taxable years through are in various stages of audit by the internal revenue service 
disputes arise during the course of such audits as to facts and matters of law 
at december   commitments for major capital expenditures during and thereafter were approximately million 
occidental has entered into agreements providing for future payments to secure terminal and pipeline capacity  drilling services  electrical power  steam and certain chemical raw materials 
at december   the net present value of the fixed and determinable portion of the obligations under these agreements  which were used to collateralize financings of the respective suppliers  aggregated million  which was payable as follows in millions     and through fixed payments under these agreements were million in  million in and million in occidental has certain other commitments under contracts  guarantees and joint ventures  and certain other contingent liabilities 
many of these commitments  although not fixed or determinable  involve capital expenditures and are part of the billion capital expenditures estimated for as discussed under additional accounting changes below  fin no 
requires the disclosure in occidental s financial statements of information relating to guarantees issued by occidental and outstanding at december  these guarantees encompass performance bonds  letters of credit  indemnities  commitments and other forms of guarantees provided by occidental to third parties  mainly to provide assurance that occidental and or its subsidiaries and affiliates will meet their various obligations guarantees 
at december   the notional amount of the guarantees was approximately billion 
of this amount  approximately million relates to occidental s guarantee of equity investees debt and other commitments 
an additional million relates to the laporte  texas vcm plant operating lease and other equipment leases 
the foregoing items have also been discussed above in the additional considerations regarding funding and liquidity section  specifically  the debt guarantees relating to oxymar and elk hills power  the guarantees on debt and other commitments relating to the ecuador pipeline and the residual value guarantee of the laporte  texas vcm plant operating lease 
the remaining million relates to various indemnities and guarantees provided to third parties 
occidental has indemnified various parties against specified liabilities that those parties might incur in the future in connection with purchases and other transactions that they have entered into with occidental 
these indemnities usually are contingent upon the other party incurring liabilities that reach specified thresholds 
as of december   occidental is not aware of circumstances that would lead to future indemnity claims against it for material amounts in connection with these transactions 
it is impossible at this time to determine the ultimate liabilities that opc and its subsidiaries may incur resulting from any lawsuits  claims and proceedings  audits  commitments  contingencies and related matters 
if these matters were to be ultimately resolved unfavorably at amounts substantially exceeding occidental s reserves  an outcome not currently anticipated  it is possible that such outcome could have a material adverse effect upon occidental s consolidated financial position or results of operations 
however  after taking into account reserves  management does not expect the ultimate resolution of any of these matters to have a material adverse effect upon occidental s consolidated financial position or results of operations 
environmental expenditures occidental s operations in the united states are subject to stringent federal  state and local laws and regulations relating to improving or maintaining the quality of the environment 
foreign operations also are subject to environmental protection laws 
costs associated with environmental compliance have increased over time and are generally expected to rise in the future 
environmental expenditures related to current operations are factored into the overall business planning process 
these expenditures are mainly considered an integral part of production in manufacturing quality products responsive to market demand 
environmental remediation the laws which require or address environmental remediation may apply retroactively to past waste disposal practices and releases 
in many cases  the laws apply regardless of fault  legality of the original activities or current ownership or control of sites 
opc or certain of its subsidiaries are currently participating in environmental assessments and cleanups under these laws at federal superfund sites  comparable state sites and other remediation sites  including occidental facilities and previously owned sites 
also  opc and certain of its subsidiaries have been involved in a substantial number of governmental and private proceedings involving historical practices at various sites including  in some instances  having been named in proceedings under cercla and similar federal  state and local environmental laws 
these proceedings seek funding or performance of remediation and  in some cases  compensation for alleged property damage  punitive damages and civil penalties 
occidental manages its environmental remediation efforts through a wholly owned subsidiary  glenn springs holdings  inc gsh  which reports its results directly to occidental s corporate management 
the following table presents occidental s environmental remediation reserves at december   and grouped by three categories of environmental remediation sites amounts in millions of of of sites reserve sites reserve sites reserve cercla equivalent sites active facilities closed or sold facilities total in determining the environmental remediation reserves  occidental refers to currently available information  including relevant past experience  available technology  regulations in effect  the timing of remediation and cost sharing arrangements 
occidental expects that it will continue to incur additional liabilities beyond those recorded for environmental remediation at these and other sites 
the range of reasonably possible loss for existing environmental remediation matters could be up to million beyond the amount accrued 
many factors could result in changes to occidental s environmental reserves and reasonably possible range of loss 
the most significant are the original cost estimate may have been inaccurate 
modified remedial measures might be necessary to achieve the required remediation results 
occidental generally assumes that the remedial objective can be achieved using the most cost effective technology reasonably expected to achieve that objective 
such technologies may include air sparging or phyto remediation of shallow groundwater  or limited surface soil removal or in situ treatment producing acceptable risk assessment results 
should such remedies fail to achieve remedial objectives  more intensive or costly measures may be required 
the remedial measure might take more or less time than originally anticipated to achieve the required contaminant reduction 
site specific time estimates can be affected by factors such as groundwater capture rates  anomalies in subsurface geology  interactions between or among water bearing zones and non water bearing zones  or the ability to identify and control contaminant sources 
the regulatory agency might ultimately reject or modify occidental s proposed remedial plan and insist upon a different course of action 
additionally  other events might occur that could affect occidental s future remediation costs  such as the discovery of more extensive contamination than had been originally anticipated 
for some sites with impacted groundwater  accurate definition of contaminant plumes requires years of monitoring data and computer modeling 
migration of contaminants may follow unexpected pathways along geologic anomalies that could initially go undetected 
additionally  the size of the area requiring remediation may change based upon risk assessment results following site characterization or interim remedial measures 
remediation technology might improve to decrease the cost of remediation 
in particular  for groundwater remediation sites with projected long term operation and maintenance  the development of more effective treatment technology  or acceptance of alternative and more cost effective treatment methodologies such as bio remediation  could significantly affect remediation costs 
laws and regulations might change to impose more or less stringent remediation requirements 
for management s opinion  refer to the lawsuits  claims  commitments  contingencies and related matters section of this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
cercla and equivalent sites at december   opc or certain of its subsidiaries have been named in cercla or state equivalent proceedings  as shown below 
number reserve description amounts in millions of sites balance minimal no exposure a reserves between mm reserves over mm total a includes sites for which maxus energy corporation has retained the liability and indemnified occidental  sites where occidental has denied liability without challenge  sites where occidental s reserves are less than  each  and sites where reserves are between  and million each 
the eight sites with individual reserves over million in are a former copper mining and smelting operation in tennessee  two closed landfills in western new york  groundwater treatment facilities at three former chemical plants western new york  montague  michigan and tacoma  washington  replacement of a municipal drinking water treatment plant in western new york  and various sediment clean up actions in washington 
active facilities certain subsidiaries of opc are currently addressing releases of substances from past operations at active facilities 
three facilities certain oil and gas properties in the southwestern united states  a chemical plant in louisiana  and a phosphorous recovery operation in tennessee account for percent of the reserves associated with these facilities 
closed or sold facilities there are sites formerly owned or operated by certain subsidiaries of opc that have ongoing environmental remediation requirements 
three sites account for percent of the reserves associated with this group 
the three sites are an active refinery in louisiana where occidental indemnifies the current owner and operator for certain remedial actions  a water treatment facility at a former coal mine in pennsylvania  and a former chemical plant in west virginia 
environmental costs occidental s costs  some of which may include estimates  relating to compliance with environmental laws and regulations  are shown below for each segment in millions operating expenses oil and gas chemical capital expenditures oil and gas chemical remediation expenses corporate environmental reserves corporate operating expenses are incurred on a continual basis 
capital expenditures relate to longer lived improvements in currently operating facilities 
remediation expenses relate to existing conditions caused by past operations and do not contribute to current or future revenue generation 
although total costs may vary in any one year  over the long term  segment operating and capital expenditures for environmental compliance generally are expected to increase 
eight counties in the houston galveston area are subject to a federal environmental protection agency epa mandate to adopt a plan for implementing certain requirements of the federal clean air act  known as a state implementation plan 
in october  the epa approved a state implementation plan for the houston galveston area the plan 
in december  the texas commission on environmental quality revised the regulations associated with the plan 
the revised plan contains provisions requiring the reduction of percent of current nitrogen oxide nox emissions and percent of the volatile organic compound voc emissions in the houston galveston area by november occidental operates six facilities that will be subject to the plan s nox and voc reduction requirements 
occidental estimates that over the next several years its capital expenditures will increase by a total of million for environmental control and monitoring equipment necessary to comply with the plan  depending on the amount of emissions reduction that is ultimately required 
occidental began expending the capital necessary to comply with the plan in and expects expenditures to end in  although the timing of the expenditures will vary by facility 
occidental presently estimates that capital expenditures for environmental compliance including the plan discussed above will be approximately million for and million for foreign investments portions of occidental s assets outside north america are exposed to political and economic risks 
occidental conducts its financial affairs so as to mitigate its exposure against those risks 
at december   the carrying value of occidental s assets in countries outside north america aggregated approximately billion  or approximately percent of occidental s total assets at that date 
of such assets  approximately billion are located in the middle east  approximately million are located in latin america  and substantially all of the remainder are located in pakistan 
critical accounting policies the process of preparing financial statements in accordance with gaap requires the management of occidental to make estimates and judgments regarding certain items and transactions 
it is possible that materially different amounts could be recorded if these estimates and judgments change or if the actual results differ from these estimates and judgments 
occidental considers the following to be its most critical accounting policies which involve the judgment of occidental s management 
oil and gas properties occidental uses the successful efforts method to account for its oil and gas properties 
under this method  costs of acquiring properties  costs of drilling successful exploration wells and development costs are capitalized 
annual lease rentals  exploration costs  geological  geophysical and seismic costs and exploratory dry hole costs are expensed as incurred 
proved oil and gas reserves are the estimated quantities of crude oil  natural gas  and natural gas liquids ngls that geological and engineering data demonstrate with reasonable certainty can be recovered in future years from known reservoirs under existing economic and operating conditions considering future production and development costs 
there are several factors which could change occidental s recorded oil and gas reserves 
significantly higher or lower product prices could lead to changes in the amount of reserves due to economic limits or the effects of production sharing contracts 
occidental receives a share of production from production sharing contracts to recover its costs and an additional share for profit 
occidental s share of production from these contracts decreases when oil prices improve and increases when oil prices decline 
overall  occidental s net economic benefit from these contracts is greater at higher oil prices 
in other contractual arrangements  sustained lower product prices may lead to a situation where production of reserves becomes uneconomical 
this  in turn  could lead to a reduction in the quantity of recorded reserves 
an additional factor that could result in a change of recorded reserves is the reservoir decline rates being different than those assumed when the reserves were initially recorded 
estimation of future production and development costs is also subject to change partially due to factors beyond occidental s control  such as energy costs and inflation or deflation of oil field service costs 
overall  occidental s revisions to recorded proved reserves were positive for  and and amounted to less than percent  percent and percent  respectively 
additionally  occidental is required to perform impairment tests pursuant to sfas no 
when prices decline and or reserve estimates change significantly 
there have been no impairments over the past three years 
depreciation and depletion of oil and gas producing properties is determined by the unit of production method and could change with revisions to estimated proved recoverable reserves 
the change in the depreciation and depletion rate over the past three years due to revisions of previous reserve estimates has been immaterial 
if occidental s oil and gas reserves were to change based on the factors mentioned above  the most significant impact would be on the depreciation and depletion rate 
a percent increase in the amount of oil and gas reserves would change the rate from barrel to barrel  which would increase net income by million annually 
a percent decrease in the oil and gas reserves would change the rate from barrel to barrel and would result in a decrease in net income of million annually 
a portion of the carrying value of occidental s oil and gas properties are attributable to unproved properties 
at december   the costs attributable to unproved properties were approximately billion 
these costs are not currently being depreciated or depleted 
as exploration and development work progresses and the reserves on these properties are proven  capitalized costs of the properties will be subject to depreciation and depletion 
if the development work were to be unsuccessful  the capitalized costs of the properties related to this unsuccessful work would be expensed in the year in which the determination was made 
the timing of any writedowns of these unproven properties  if warranted  depends upon the nature  timing and extent of future exploration and development activities and their results 
occidental believes its exploration and development efforts will allow it to fully realize the unproved property balance 
chemical assets the most critical accounting policy affecting occidental s chemical assets is the determination of the estimated useful lives of its property  plant and equipment 
the estimated useful lives of occidental s chemical assets  which range from years to years  are used to compute depreciation expense and are also used for impairment tests 
the estimated useful lives used for the chemical facilities were based on the assumption that occidental would provide an appropriate level of annual capital expenditures while the plants are still in operation 
without these continued capital expenditures  the useful lives of these plants could significantly decrease 
other factors which could change the estimated useful lives of occidental s chemical plants include higher or lower product prices  feedstock costs  energy prices  environmental regulations  competition and technological changes 
occidental is required to perform impairment tests on its assets whenever events or changes in circumstances lead to a reduction in the estimated useful lives or estimated future cash flows that would indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable  or when management s plans change with respect to those assets 
under the provisions of sfas no 
 occidental must compare the undiscounted future cash flows of an asset to its carrying value 
the key factors that could significantly affect future cash flows are future product prices  feedstock costs  energy costs and remaining estimated useful life 
due to a temporary decrease in demand for some of its products  occidental temporarily idled an edc plant in june  and a chlor alkali plant in december these facilities will remain idle until market conditions improve 
management expects that both of these plants will become operational in the future 
the net book value of these two plants was million at december  these facilities were tested for impairment at the time they were temporarily idled and  based on the results  no impairment was deemed necessary for these two facilities 
occidental continues to depreciate these facilities based on their remaining estimated useful lives 
occidental s chemical plants are depreciated using either the unit of production or straight line method based upon the estimated useful life of the facilities 
the change in the depreciation rate over the prior three years has been immaterial 
if the estimated useful lives of occidental s chemical plants were to decrease based on the factors mentioned above  the most significant impact would be on depreciation expense 
if the estimated remaining useful lives were to decrease by percent  the annual depreciation charge would increase from million to million 
environmental costs and contingencies environmental expenditures that relate to current operations are expensed or capitalized as appropriate 
reserves for estimated costs that relate to existing conditions caused by past operations and that do not contribute to current or future revenue generation are recorded when environmental remedial efforts are probable and the costs can be reasonably estimated 
in determining the reserves  occidental refers to currently available information  including relevant past experience  available technology  regulations in effect  the timing of remediation and cost sharing arrangements 
the environmental reserves are based on management s estimate of the most likely cost to be incurred and are reviewed periodically and adjusted as additional or new information becomes available 
for the years ended december  and  occidental has not accrued any reimbursements or recoveries as assets 
recoveries and reimbursements are recorded in income when receipt is probable 
environmental reserves are recorded on a discounted basis only when a reserve is initially established and the aggregate amount of the estimated costs for a specific site and the timing of cash payments are reliably determinable 
the reserve methodology for a specific site is not modified once it has been established 
at sites involving multiple parties  occidental provides environmental reserves based upon its expected share of liability 
when other parties are jointly liable  the financial viability of the parties  the degree of their commitment to participate and the consequences to occidental of their failure to participate are evaluated when estimating the company s ultimate share of liability 
occidental believes that it will not be required to assume a share of liability of other potentially responsible parties  with whom it is alleged to be jointly liable  in an amount that would have a material effect on occidental s consolidated financial position or liquidity or results of operations 
most cost sharing arrangements with other parties fall into one of the following three categories category cercla or state equivalent sites wherein occidental and other alleged potentially responsible parties share the cost of remediation in accordance with negotiated or prescribed allocations  category oil and gas joint ventures wherein each joint venture partner pays its proportionate share of remedial cost  and category contractual arrangements typically relating to purchases and sales of property wherein the parties to the transaction agree to methods of allocating the costs of environmental remediation 
in all three of these categories  occidental records as a reserve its expected net cost of remedial activities  as adjusted by recognition for any non performing parties 
in addition to the costs of investigating and implementing remedial measures  which often take in excess of ten years at cercla sites  occidental s reserves include management s estimates of the cost of operation and maintenance of remedial systems 
to the extent that the remedial systems are modified over time in response to significant changes in site specific data  laws  regulations  technologies or engineering estimates  occidental reviews and changes the reserves accordingly on a site specific basis 
the following table shows environmental reserve activity for the past three reporting periods in millions balance beginning of year increases to provision including interest accretion changes from acquisitions dispositions payments other balance end of year occidental expects to expend funds equivalent to about half of the current environmental reserve over the next three years and the balance over the next ten or more years 
if the environmental reserve balance were to either increase or decrease based on the factors mentioned above  the amount of the increase or decrease would be immediately recognized in earnings 
if the reserve balance were to decrease by percent  the company would record a pre tax gain of million 
if the reserve balance were to increase by percent  the company would record an additional pre tax remediation expense of million 
other loss contingencies occidental is involved with numerous lawsuits  claims  proceedings and audits in the normal course of its operations 
occidental records a loss contingency for these matters when it is probable that an asset has been impaired or a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated 
in addition  occidental discloses  in aggregate  its exposure to loss in excess of the amount recorded on the balance sheet for these matters if it is reasonably possible that an additional material loss may be incurred 
in order to assess its loss contingencies  occidental reviews its loss contingencies on an on going basis so that they are adequately reserved on the balance sheet 
these reserves are based on judgments made by management with respect to the likely outcome of these matters and are adjusted as appropriate 
management s judgments could change based on new information  changes in laws or regulations  changes in management s plans or intentions  the outcome of legal proceedings  settlements or other factors 
additional accounting changes listed below are additional changes in accounting principles applicable to occidental 
fin no 
in january  the fasb issued fin no 
 consolidation of variable interest entities 
fin no 
requires a company to consolidate a variable interest entity if it is designated as the primary beneficiary of that entity even if the company does not have a majority of voting interests 
a variable interest entity is generally defined as an entity where its equity is unable to finance its activities or where the owners of the entity lack the risk and rewards of ownership 
the provisions of this statement apply at inception for any entity created after january  for an entity created before february   the provisions of this interpretation must be applied at the beginning of the first interim or annual period beginning after june  occidental will adopt the provisions of fin no 
in the third quarter of for existing entities that are within the scope of this interpretation 
the statement also has disclosure requirements  some of which are required to be disclosed for financial statements issued after january  on a preliminary basis  occidental believes that its oxymar investment and its laporte  texas vcm plant lease will be consolidated under the provisions of this statement 
see further discussion in additional considerations regarding funding and liquidity in the md a 
fin no 
in january  the fasb issued fin no 
 guarantor s accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees  including indirect guarantees of indebtedness of others 
fin no 
requires a company to recognize a liability for the obligations it has undertaken in issuing a guarantee 
this liability would be recorded at the inception of a guarantee and would be measured at fair value 
the measurement provisions of this statement apply prospectively to guarantees issued or modified after december  the disclosure provisions of the statement apply to financial statements for periods ending after december  see further discussion in lawsuits  claims  commitments  contingencies and related matters in the md a 
occidental will adopt the measurement provisions of this statement in the first quarter of the adoption of the statement is not expected to have a material effect on the financial statements when adopted 
sfas no 
in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure 
sfas no 
permits two additional transition methods for companies that elect to adopt the fair value based method of accounting for stock based employee compensation 
the statement also expands the disclosure requirements for stock based compensation 
the provisions of this statement apply to financial statements for fiscal years ending after december  the statement is not expected to have a material impact on the financial statements when adopted 
sfas no 
in july  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities 
sfas no 
requires that a liability be recognized for exit and disposal costs only when the liability has been incurred and when it can be measured at fair value 
the statement is effective for exit and disposal activities that are initiated after december  occidental will adopt sfas no 
in the first quarter of and it is not expected to have a material impact on its financial statements 
sfas no 
in april  the fasb issued sfas no 
 rescission of fasb statements no 
  and  amendment of fasb statement no 
 and technical corrections 
in addition to amending or rescinding other existing authoritative pronouncements to make various technical corrections  clarify meanings  or describe their applicability under changed conditions  sfas no 
precludes companies from recording gains and losses from the extinguishment of debt as an extraordinary item 
occidental implemented sfas no 
in the fourth quarter of and all comparative financial statements have been reclassified to conform to the presentation 
since occidental had no extraordinary items  there was no effect on the presentation 
the effects of the statement on prior years include the reclassification of an extraordinary loss to net income from continuing operations of million per share in and of million no per share effect in there was no effect on net income or basic earnings per common share upon adoption 
sfas no 
in august  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
sfas no 
addresses financial accounting and reporting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets and broadens the presentation of discontinued operations for long lived assets 
the provisions of this statement are effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after december  occidental adopted this statement in the first quarter of and it did not have an impact on the financial statements when adopted 
sfas no 
in june  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for asset retirement obligations 
sfas no 
addresses financial accounting and reporting for obligations associated with the retirement of tangible long lived assets and the associated asset retirement costs 
occidental s current policy for dismantlement  restoration and reclamation costs is to accrue the estimated future abandonment and removal costs of offshore production platforms  net of salvage value  over their operating lives 
for onshore oil and gas production  occidental estimates that the salvage value of the oil and gas properties generally will approximate the dismantlement  restoration and reclamation costs or that the net cost will not be material  therefore  no accrual is recorded 
occidental makes capital renewal expenditures for its chemical plants on a continual basis while an asset is in operation 
thus  retirement obligations are provided for when a decision is made to dispose of a property or when operations have been curtailed on other than a temporary basis 
under sfas no 
 companies are required to recognize the fair value of a liability for an asset retirement obligation in the period in which the liability is incurred if there is a legal obligation to dismantle the asset and reclaim or remediate the property at the end of the useful life 
occidental will adopt sfas no 
in the first quarter of the initial adoption is expected to result in an after tax charge of million  which will be recorded as a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principles 
the adoption is also expected to increase net property  plant and equipment by million  increase asset retirement obligation by million and decrease deferred tax liabilities by million 
in addition  occidental will record a pre tax charge to income of approximately million a year to reflect the accretion of the liability and higher depreciation expense beginning in sfas no 
in june  the fasb issued sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
sfas no 
changes the accounting and reporting requirements for acquired goodwill and intangible assets 
the provisions of this statement must be applied starting with fiscal years beginning after december  at december   the balance sheet included approximately million of goodwill and intangible assets with annual amortization expense of approximately million recorded in each of the years income statements for the three year period ended december  as a result  elimination of goodwill amortization would not have had a material impact on net income or earnings per share of any of the years presented and  as a result  the transitional disclosures of adjusted net income excluding goodwill amortization described by sfas no 
have not been presented 
upon implementation of sfas no 
in the first quarter of  three separate specialty chemical businesses were identified as separate reporting units and tested for goodwill impairment 
all three of these businesses are components of the chemical segment and were the only reporting units having any goodwill on the balance sheet 
the fair value of each of the three reporting units was determined through third party appraisals 
the appraisals determined fair value to be the price that the assets could be sold for in a current transaction between willing parties 
as a result of the impairment testing  occidental recorded a cumulative effect of changes in accounting principles after tax reduction in net income of approximately million due to the impairment of all the goodwill attributed to these reporting units 
occidental now has no remaining goodwill on its financial statements 
sfas no 
in june  the fasb issued sfas no 
 business combinations 
sfas no 
establishes new standards for accounting and reporting business combinations including eliminating the pooling method of accounting 
the standard applies to all business combinations initiated after june  occidental implemented the provisions of sfas no 
 which had no impact on the financial statements 
sfas no 
on january   occidental adopted sfas no 
 as amended 
these statements established accounting and reporting standards for derivative instruments and hedging activities and required an entity to recognize all derivatives in the statement of financial position and measure those instruments at fair value 
changes in the derivative instrument s fair value must be recognized in earnings unless specific hedge accounting criteria are met 
adoption of these new accounting standards resulted in cumulative after tax reductions in net income of approximately million and oci of approximately million in the first quarter of the adoption also increased total assets by million and total liabilities by million as of january  eitf issue no 
in the fourth quarter of  occidental adopted the provisions of eitf issue no 
 accounting for shipping and handling fees and costs  which establishes accounting and reporting standards for the treatment of shipping and handling costs 
among its provisions  eitf issue no 
requires that transportation costs that had been accounted for as deductions from revenues should now be recorded as an expense 
the implementation of eitf issue no 
had no effect on net income 
all prior year balances have been adjusted to reflect this accounting change 
the transportation costs that have been removed as deductions from revenues and included in cost of sales on occidental s statements of operations totaled million in sfas no 
in the fourth quarter of  occidental adopted the disclosure provisions of sfas no 
 accounting for transfers and servicing of financial assets and extinguishments of liabilities a replacement of fasb statement no 
 which revises disclosure standards for asset securitizations and other financial asset transfers 
sfas no 
also contains provisions which revise certain criteria for accounting for securitizations  financial asset transfers and collateral 
these accounting provisions were adopted by occidental on april  the implementation of the provisions of sfas no 
did not have an impact on occidental s consolidated financial position or results of operations 
see derivative activities and market risk above for other accounting changes 
safe harbor statement regarding outlook and other forward looking data portions of this report  including items and and the information appearing under the caption management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  including the information under the sub caption outlook  contain forward looking statements and involve risks and uncertainties that could significantly affect expected results of operations  liquidity  cash flows and business prospects 
factors that could cause results to differ materially include  but are not limited to global commodity pricing fluctuations  competitive pricing pressures  higher than expected costs including feedstocks  crude oil and natural gas prices  chemical prices  potential liability for remedial actions under existing or future environmental regulations and litigation  potential liability resulting from pending or future litigation  general domestic and international political conditions  potential disruption or interruption of occidental s production or manufacturing facilities due to accidents  political events or insurgent activity  potential failure to achieve expected production from existing and future oil and gas development projects  the supply demand considerations for occidental s products  any general economic recession or slowdown domestically or internationally  regulatory uncertainties  and not successfully completing  or any material delay of  any development of new fields  expansion  capital expenditure  efficiency improvement project  acquisition or disposition 
forward looking statements are generally accompanied by words such as estimate  project  predict  will  anticipate  plan  intend  believe  expect or similar expressions that convey the uncertainty of future events or outcomes 
occidental expressly disclaims any obligation to publicly update or revise any forward looking statements  whether as a result of new information or otherwise 
in light of these risks  uncertainties and assumptions  the forward looking events discussed might not occur 
report of management the management of occidental petroleum corporation is responsible for the integrity of the financial data reported by occidental and its subsidiaries 
fulfilling this responsibility requires the preparation and presentation of consolidated financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles 
management uses internal accounting controls  corporate wide policies and procedures and judgment so that such statements reflect fairly occidental s consolidated financial position  results of operations and cash flows
