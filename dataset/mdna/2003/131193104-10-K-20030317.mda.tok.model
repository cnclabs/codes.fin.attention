item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements  the related notes and the important notice to investors that appear elsewhere in this report 
critical accounting policies and estimates the company s discussion and analysis of its results of operations  financial condition and liquidity are based upon the company s consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires the company to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
the company bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results may materially differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
on an on going basis  the company reviews its estimates to ensure that the estimates appropriately reflect changes in its business or as new information becomes available 
management believes the following critical accounting policies affect its more significant estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements revenue recognition sales are recognized when both title and risk of loss transfer to the customer 
sales are recorded net of an allowance for sales returns and sales programs 
sales returns are estimated based upon historical returns  
table of contents current economic trends  changes in customer demands and sell through of products 
the company also records estimated reductions to revenue for sales programs such as customer sales programs and incentive offerings 
sales program accruals are estimated based upon the attributes of the sales program  management s forecast of future product demand  and historical customer participation in similar programs 
if the actual costs of sales returns and sales programs significantly exceed the recorded estimated allowance  the company s sales would be significantly adversely affected 
allowance for doubtful accounts the company maintains an allowance for estimated losses resulting from the inability of its customers to make required payments 
an estimate of uncollectable amounts is made by management based upon historical bad debts  current customer receivable balances  age of customer receivable balances  the customer s financial condition and current economic trends 
if the actual uncollected amounts significantly exceed the estimated allowance  then the company s operating results would be significantly adversely affected 
inventories inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market 
cost is determined using the first in  first out fifo method 
the inventory balance  which includes material  labor and manufacturing overhead costs  is recorded net of an estimated allowance for obsolete or unmarketable inventory 
the estimated allowance for obsolete or unmarketable inventory is based upon management s understanding of market conditions and forecasts of future product demand 
if the actual amount of obsolete or unmarketable inventory significantly exceeds the estimated allowance  the company s cost of sales  gross profit and net income would be significantly adversely affected 
long lived assets in the normal course of business  the company acquires tangible and intangible assets 
the company periodically evaluates the recoverability of the carrying amount of its long lived assets including property  plant and equipment  goodwill and other intangible assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be fully recoverable 
an impairment is assessed when the undiscounted expected future cash flows derived from an asset are less than its carrying amount 
impairments are recognized in operating earnings 
the company uses its best judgment based on the most current facts and circumstances surrounding its business when applying these impairment rules to determine the timing of the impairment test  the undiscounted cash flows used to assess impairments  and the fair value of a potentially impaired asset 
changes in assumptions used could have a significant impact on the company s assessment of recoverability 
numerous factors  including changes in the company s business  industry segment  and global economy  could significantly impact management s decision to retain  dispose of  or idle certain of its long lived assets 
warranty the company has a stated two year warranty policy for its golf clubs  although the company s historical practice has been to honor warranty claims well after the two year stated warranty period 
the company s policy is to accrue the estimated cost of satisfying future warranty claims at the time the sale is recorded 
in estimating its future warranty obligations  the company considers various relevant factors  including the company s stated warranty policies and practices  the historical frequency of claims  and the cost to replace or repair its products under warranty 
if the number of actual warranty claims or the cost of satisfying warranty claims significantly exceeds the estimated warranty reserve  the company s cost of sales  gross profit and net income would be significantly adversely affected 
see below  change in accounting estimate 
income taxes current income tax expense is the amount of income taxes expected to be payable for the current year 
a deferred income tax asset or liability is established for the expected future consequences resulting from 
table of contents temporary differences in the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities 
the company provides a valuation allowance for its deferred tax assets when  in the opinion of management  it is more likely than not that such assets will not be realized 
while the company has considered future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for the valuation allowance  in the event the company were to determine that it would be able to realize its deferred tax assets in the future in excess of its net recorded amount  an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would increase income in the period such determination was made 
likewise  should the company determine that it would not be able to realize all or part of its net deferred tax asset in the future  an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would be charged to income in the period such determination was made 
change in accounting estimate as discussed above  the company has a stated two year warranty policy for its golf clubs  although the company s historical practice has been to honor warranty claims well after the two year stated warranty period 
prior to the third quarter of  the company s method of estimating both its implicit and explicit warranty obligation was to utilize data and information based on the cumulative failure rate by product after taking into consideration specific risks the company believes existed at the time the financial statements were prepared 
these additional risks included product specific risks  such as the introduction of products with new technology or materials that would be more susceptible to failure or breakage  and other business risks  such as increased warranty liability as a result of acquisitions 
in many cases  additions to the warranty reserve for new product introductions have been based on management s judgment of possible future claims derived from the limited product failure data that was available at the time 
beginning in the second quarter of  the company began to compile data that illustrated the timing of warranty claims in relation to product life cycles 
in the third quarter of  the company determined it had gathered sufficient data and concluded it should enhance its warranty accrual estimation methodology to utilize the additional data 
the analysis of the data  in management s judgment  provided management with more insight into timing of claims and demonstrated that some product failures are more likely to occur early in a product s life cycle while other product failures occur in a more linear fashion over the product s life cycle 
as a result of its analysis of the recently collected additional information  the company believes it has gained better insight and improved judgment to more accurately project the ultimate failure rates of its products 
as a result of this refinement in its methodology  the company concluded that it should change its methodology of estimating warranty accruals and reduce its warranty reserve by approximately million 
the million reduction is recorded in cost of sales and favorably impacted gross profit as a percentage of net sales by percentage points for the year ended december  the change in methodology has been accounted for as a change in accounting principle inseparable from a change in estimate 

table of contents the following summarizes what net income and earnings per share would have been had the warranty reserve adjustment  adjusted for taxes  been excluded from reported results year ended december  in millions  except per share amounts reported net income non cash warranty reserve adjustment  net of tax adjusted net income basic earnings per share reported net income non cash warranty reserve adjustment  net of tax adjusted basic earnings per share diluted earnings per share reported net income non cash warranty reserve adjustment  net of tax adjusted diluted earnings per share the above adjusted net income and earnings per share information has not been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
this information is being provided as additional information for interested readers and is not intended to be in lieu of the company s reported results which were prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states and which are discussed elsewhere in this report 
the company s management believes that this pro forma information is useful because it believes the adjusted results more accurately reflect the performance of the company s operations 
the warranty reserve adjustment is a non cash accounting adjustment 
the magnitude of the adjustment is unusual for the company and management does not believe that it is reasonably likely that a similar adjustment of this magnitude will be made within at least the next two fiscal years 
see below for a further discussion of the effect on the company s net income of the warranty reserve reduction as well as the non cash energy derivative charge recorded in recent accounting pronouncements information regarding recent accounting pronouncements is contained in note to the consolidated financial statements for the year ended december   which note is incorporated herein by this reference 
results of operations years ended december  and net sales decreased to million for the year ended december  as compared to million for the year ended december  the overall decrease in net sales is primarily due to a decrease in sales of woods  which decreased million  combined with a slight decrease in iron sales  which decreased million  in as compared to the decrease in wood and iron sales was partially offset by a million increase in sales of putters  a million increase in sales of golf balls  and a million increase in sales of accessories and other products as compared to the decrease in net sales of woods was expected due to the company s natural product life cycles with higher priced titanium metal woods being in their second year after introduction 
the weakening of the us dollar in relation to other foreign currencies during had only a nominal favorable impact on net 
table of contents sales 
as compared to  the strengthening of foreign currency exchange rates favorably impacted net sales for by approximately million  as measured by applying exchange rates to net sales 
the company believes that its overall net sales during were negatively affected by adverse economic conditions and continued economic uncertainty  particularly in the united states  japan and other parts of asia 
many people in the united states have lost a substantial amount of wealth in the stock market  including some who have lost all or substantially all of their retirement savings in connection with companies that have recently failed 
there also have been announcements by companies of significant reductions in workforce and more are possible 
this economic uncertainty has resulted in a substantial decline in consumer confidence 
these adverse economic conditions and decline in consumer confidence have resulted in a significant reduction in consumer spending on discretionary goods  including the company s products 
the company also believes that the usga s reversal of its position regarding the allowance of high cor drivers see below usga action has resulted in confusion among consumers in the united states  causing them to postpone or even forgo the purchase of new equipment 
the company s net sales  primarily in the first half of  were also adversely affected by competitive pressures in many of the company s principal markets and particularly in the united states and japan 
these competitive pressures included the substantial discounting of competitors current products and close outs of products that were previously commercially successful  as well as significant retailer support programs 
in addition  the company believes that its net sales for were negatively affected by a decrease in rounds played 
golf datatech has reported that rounds played in the united states declined in  as compared to finally  the company s premium new wood product for  the big bertha c driver  was not well accepted by golfers  resulting in sales that were insufficient to compensate for sales declines in older products 
net sales information by product category is summarized as follows for the years ended december  growth decline dollars percent in millions net sales driver and fairway woods irons putters golf balls accessories and other the million decrease in net sales of woods to million represents a decrease in both unit and dollar sales 
this decrease was primarily attributable to a decline in sales of big bertha hawk eye vft titanium drivers and fairway woods and erc ii forged titanium drivers 
a decline was expected as the company s products generally sell better in their first year after introduction and was the second year in the life cycle for these products 
this decrease was also attributable to a decline in sales of big bertha steelhead plus drivers and fairway woods which were introduced in december these declines were partially offset by the sales generated from the january introduction of big bertha steelhead iii woods  the february introduction of big bertha c drivers  and the september introduction of the great big bertha ii titanium drivers and fairway woods 
the million decrease in net sales of irons to million represents a decrease in dollar sales and a slight increase in unit sales 
the dollar sales decline was due primarily to the decline in sales of steelhead x irons  which were in their third year of sales  and hawkeye irons  which were the predecessors to the hawk eye vft irons 
these decreases were substantially offset by the sales growth generated from the january launch of big bertha irons 
sales of the hawk eye vft irons  which were launched in august  generated modest sales growth in compared to 
table of contents the million increase in sales of putters is primarily attributable to increased sales of the company s odyssey putters resulting from the january introduction of the odyssey white hot ball putter 
the million increase in net sales of golf balls to million represents an increase in both unit and dollar sales 
the golf ball growth is largely attributable to the expansion of the company s golf ball product line offering to five models from only two during the majority of the prior year 
this expanded product line resulted in a higher average selling price as compared to  even after taking into account the august price reduction 
the company initially launched the ctu golf ball in november  the hx golf ball in march  the hx piece golf ball in may  and the warbird golf ball in august net sales for included sales generated primarily from the cb golf ball and rule golf ball 
the ctu golf ball contributed modestly to net sales due to its introduction in the latter part of and is the successor ball to the rule golf ball

these decreases were partially offset by an million increase in sales in europe 
the company s net sales in regions outside of the united states were not significantly affected by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates 
had exchange rates for been the same as the exchange rates  overall sales in regions outside of the united states would have been less than lower than reported results 
for the year ended december   gross profit decreased to million from million in the comparable period of gross profit as a percentage of net sales remained constant at in as compared to the company s gross profit percentage was favorably impacted by the million reduction in the company s warranty accrual during the third quarter of see above change in accounting estimate 
excluding the effects of such reduction  gross profit as a percentage of net sales decreased percentage points to in as compared to the gross profit percentage was also favorably impacted by a reduction in the company s manufacturing labor and overhead expenses as a percent of net sales and a favorable shift in product mix 
these increases were partially offset by a lower average selling price for golf club products combined with close out pricing for discontinued rule golf ball products and a price reduction on all golf ball products implemented in august  additional inventory reserves established on erc ii drivers and big bertha c drivers  a customs and duty assessment in korea  and the million

the company s management believes that this pro forma information is useful because it believes the adjusted results more accurately reflect the performance of the company s operations 
the warranty reserve adjustment and the energy derivative charge are both non cash accounting adjustments 
the magnitude of the warranty reserve adjustment is unusual for the company and management does not believe that it is reasonably likely that a similar adjustment of this magnitude will be made within at least the next two fiscal years 
furthermore  the non cash energy derivative charge is not the result of the company s operations but rather a valuation adjustment of a since terminated energy contract 
the company does not intend to enter into any energy derivative contracts of similar magnitude or duration 
therefore  it is not reasonably likely that a similar valuation charge of that magnitude will be incurred within at least the next two fiscal years

declines in other older iron models such as the hawk eye tungsten injected irons were partially offset by the introduction of the hawk eye vft irons in the second half of the year 
the million decrease in net sales of woods to million represents a decrease in both unit and dollar sales 
this decrease is primarily attributable to a decline in sales of big bertha steelhead plus stainless steel metal woods  which were introduced in january the decline in metal woods was partially offset by net increases generated by the introduction of the big bertha hawk eye vft metal woods and erc ii forged titanium drivers which more than offset the decrease in sales of their predecessors  great big bertha hawk eye metal woods and erc forged titanium drivers  respectively 
the million increase in sales of putters is primarily attributable to the january introduction of the company s odyssey trihot putters 
the million increase in net sales of golf balls to million represents an increase in both unit and dollar sales

net sales in the united states decreased million to million during versus overall  the company s sales in regions outside of the united states decreased million to million during versus this decrease is primarily attributable to a million decrease in sales in the rest of asia  which includes korea  and a million decrease in sales in europe 
these decreases were partially offset by a million increase in japan and a million increase in other regions outside of the united states 
the company s net sales in regions outside of the united states were negatively affected by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates

financial condition cash and cash equivalents increased million to million at december   from million at december  this increase resulted primarily from cash provided by operating activities of million  substantially offset by cash used in financing and investing activities of million and million  respectively 
cash flows provided by operating activities reflect net income adjusted for depreciation and amortization million  decreases in inventory million and other assets million combined with increases in accounts payable and accrued expenses million and income taxes payable million  partially offset by an increase in accounts receivable million and a decrease in the accrued warranty expense million  which included the million reduction to the warranty reserve 
see above change in accounting estimate for a further discussion of the reduction in warranty reserve 
cash flows used in financing activities are primarily attributable to the acquisition of treasury stock million and the payment of dividends million  partially offset by proceeds from the exercise of employee stock options million and purchases under the employee stock purchase plan million 
cash flows used in investing activities are primarily attributable to capital expenditures million  which include the million purchase in august of previously leased manufacturing equipment utilized in the company s golf ball operations 
at december   the company s net accounts receivable increased million from december  this increase is primarily attributable to the institution of the company s preferred retailer program in the united states  which offers longer payment terms  among other incentives  for retailers who participate in the program in exchange for providing certain benefits to the company  including the maintenance of agreed upon inventory levels  prime product placement and retailer staff training 
at december   the company s net inventory decreased million from december  this decrease is primarily attributable to the company s concerted effort to reduce inventory and million of additional inventory reserves established on erc ii drivers and big bertha c drivers  partially offset by upward pressures on inventory levels resulting from a broader product line in the current year  including five models of golf balls  as compared to two models at december  at december   the company s net property  plant and equipment increased million from december  this increase is primarily due to the august  purchase of previously leased manufacturing equipment utilized in the company s golf ball operations 
in december  the company entered into a master lease agreement for the acquisition and lease of golf ball equipment 
by december   the company had finalized its lease program and leased million of equipment under the operating lease 
on february   pursuant to the master lease agreement  the company notified the lessor of its election to purchase the leased equipment in august which was the end of the initial lease term 
during the third quarter of  pursuant to the master lease agreement and the company s february  notice  the company paid million in full satisfaction of the purchase price of the leased equipment and recorded the million estimated fair value of the equipment in fixed assets 
the estimated fair value of the equipment was based on an independent appraisal 
the actual purchase price was dependent in part upon interest rates on the date of purchase 
due to a decline in interest rates  the actual purchase price exceeded the estimated fair value of the equipment 
therefore  in  a charge of million was recorded in cost of sales 
liquidity the company s principal sources of liquidity  both on a short term and long term basis  for the periods presented has generally been cash flows provided by operations 
the company currently expects this to continue 
the company  however  generally maintains a back up credit facility to cover unexpected liquidity 
table of contents needs 
at december   the company had two credit facilities  namely a revolving credit facility for up to million  subject to a borrowing base formula and certain other limitations the amended credit agreement and an accounts receivable securitization facility for up to million  subject to a borrowing base formula and certain other limitations the accounts receivable facility 
at december   there were no advances outstanding under either of these facilities and the company has not used either of these facilities since the second quarter of except for some non material letters of credit issued under the amended credit agreement  primarily to facilitate certain international shipments of components 
both the amended credit agreement and the accounts receivable facility include certain restrictions  including restrictions on the amount of dividends the company can pay and the amount of its own stock the company can repurchase 
these facilities also required the company to maintain certain minimum financial ratios  including a fixed charge coverage ratio 
at september   the company was not in compliance with the fixed charge coverage ratio 
the noncompliance with this ratio resulted from the company s purchase of its previously leased golf ball manufacturing equipment during the third quarter 
excluding the golf ball equipment purchase  the company would have been in compliance with the fixed charge coverage ratio at september  at december   the company achieved a fixed charge coverage ratio in excess of the minimum requirements prescribed by the credit facilities 
in february  the amended credit agreement was amended to exclude the golf ball equipment purchase from the calculation of the fixed charge coverage ratio and the company obtained a waiver for prior non compliance 
both of the credit facilities were scheduled to expire in february the company therefore began reviewing what type of back up or other financing arrangements it would need upon expiration or termination of these facilities 
as part of this review  the company determined that it had no current or expected need for the accounts receivable facility and therefore in february terminated the accounts receivable facility 
the company expects to obtain a new credit facility to provide an additional source of liquidity prior to the expiration of the amended credit agreement 
in august  the company announced that its board of directors authorized it to repurchase shares of its common stock in the open market or in private transactions  subject to the company s assessment of market conditions and buying opportunities from time to time  up to a maximum cost to the company of million 
the company began the repurchase program in august and during the second quarter of completed the program which resulted in the repurchase of million shares of the company s common stock at an average cost of per share for a total of million 
in may  the company announced that its board of directors authorized it to repurchase additional shares of its common stock in the open market or in private transactions  subject to the company s assessment of market conditions and buying opportunities from time to time  up to a maximum cost to the company of million 
under this authorization  the company has spent million to repurchase million shares of its common stock at an average cost of per share through december  during the year ended december   the company spent a total of million to repurchase million shares under the august and may combined authorizations at an average cost of per share 
as of december   the company had million of remaining authority under the may stock repurchase authorization 
the following table provides as of december  certain significant cash obligations that will affect the company s future liquidity payments due by period less than after total year years years years in millions operating leases unconditional purchase obligations deferred compensation long term debt total 
table of contents the company leases certain warehouse  distribution and office facilities as well as office equipment under operating leases 
the amount presented in the table represents commitments for minimum lease payments under non cancelable operating leases 
the amounts indicated in this line item reflect long term purchase agreements for various key raw materials 
as of december   the purchase commitments covered by these agreements aggregate approximately million for related to golf ball materials and approximately million related to golf club materials through december during the first two months of  the company satisfied the remaining million minimum purchase requirements related to golf club materials 
in addition  in the normal course of operations  the company enters into unconditional purchase obligations with various vendors and suppliers of goods and services through purchase orders or other documentation or are undocumented except for an invoice 
such obligations are generally outstanding for periods less than a year and are settled by cash payments upon delivery of goods and services and are not reflected in the total unconditional purchase obligations presented in this line item 
the company has an unfunded  non qualified deferred compensation plan 
the plan allows officers  certain other employees and directors of the company to defer all or part of their compensation  to be paid to the participants or their designated beneficiaries after retirement  death or separation from the company 
to support the deferred compensation plan  the company has elected to purchase company owned life insurance 
the cash surrender value of the company owned insurance related to deferred compensation is included in other assets and was million at december  in april  the company entered into a note payable in the amount of million as part of a licensing agreement for patent rights 
the unsecured  interest free note payable matures on december  and is payable in quarterly installments 
during the second quarter of  the company entered into a derivative commodity instrument to manage electricity costs in the volatile california energy market 
the contract was originally effective through may during the fourth quarter of  the company notified the energy supplier that  among other things  the energy supplier was in default of the energy supply contract and that based upon such default  and for other reasons  the company was terminating the energy supply contract 
the company continues to reflect the million derivative valuation account on its balance sheet  subject to periodic review  in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for transfers and servicing of financial assets and extinguishments of liabilities 
the million represents unrealized losses resulting from changes in the estimated fair value of the contract and does not represent contractual cash obligations 
the company believes the energy supply contract has been terminated and  therefore  that the company does not have any further cash obligations under the contract 
accordingly  the energy derivative valuation account is not included in the table 
there can be no assurance  however  that a party will not assert a future claim against the company or that a bankruptcy court or arbitrator will not ultimately nullify the company s termination of the contract 
no provision has been made for contingencies or obligations  if any  under the contract beyond november see below supply of electricity and energy contracts 
in addition to the obligations listed above  the company has entered into contracts with professional golfers to endorse and promote the company s products 
many of these contracts provide incentives for successful performances using the company s products 
for example  under these contracts  the company could be obligated to pay a cash bonus to a professional who wins a particular tournament while playing the company s golf clubs 
it is not possible to predict with any certainty the amount of such performance awards the company will be required to pay in any given year 
such expenses  however  are an ordinary part of the company s business and the company does not believe that the payment of these performance awards will have a material adverse effect upon the company 
see below certain factors affecting callaway golf company golf professional endorsements 
during its normal course of business  the company has made certain indemnities  commitments and guarantees under which it may be required to make payments in relation to certain transactions 
these include i intellectual property indemnities to the company s customers and licensees in connection with the use  sale and or license of company products  ii indemnities to various lessors in connection with facility leases 
table of contents for certain claims arising from such facility or lease  iii indemnities to vendors and service providers pertaining to claims based on the negligence or willful misconduct of the company  iv indemnities involving the accuracy of representations and warranties in certain contracts  and v indemnities to directors and officers of the company to the maximum extent permitted under the laws of the state of delaware 
in addition  the company has made contractual commitments to several employees providing for severance payments upon the occurrence of certain prescribed events 
the company also has several consulting agreements that provide for payment of fees upon the issuance of patents and or the commercialization of research results 
the company has also issued a guarantee in the form of a standby letter of credit as security for contingent liabilities under certain workers compensation insurance policies 
the duration of these indemnities  commitments and guarantees varies  and in certain cases  may be indefinite 
the majority of these indemnities  commitments and guarantees do not provide for any limitation on the maximum amount of future payments the company could be obligated to make 
the company has not recorded any liability for these indemnities  commitments and guarantees in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets 
in addition to the contractual obligations listed above  the company s liquidity could also be adversely affected by an unfavorable outcome with respect to claims and litigation that the company is subject to from time to time 
see note to the company s consolidated financial statements 
although the company s golf club operations are mature and historically have generated cash from operations  the company s golf ball operations are relatively new and through december  have not generated cash flows sufficient to fund these operations 
the company has not achieved the sales volume necessary for its golf ball business to be profitable the company is evaluating all available actions to reduce and eliminate the losses in its golf ball business 
some of these actions could result in a write down of a significant portion of the assets used in the company s golf ball operations 
based upon its current operating plan  analysis of its consolidated financial position and projected future results of operations  the company believes that its operating cash flows  together with its current or future credit facilities  will be sufficient to finance current operating requirements  including planned capital expenditures  contractual obligations and commercial commitments  for the next twelve months 
there can be no assurance  however  that future industry specific or other developments  general economic trends or other matters will not adversely affect the company s operations  its ability to enter into a new credit facility upon terms acceptable to the company or its ability to meet its future cash requirements see below certain factors affecting callaway golf company 
usga action in  the united states golf association usga adopted a so called spring like effect test that limited the coefficient of restitution cor of drivers 
at that time  the royal and ancient golf club of st 
andrews r a disagreed with the usga and did not adopt such a test because it did not believe that such a limitation was needed or in the best interests of the game of golf 
on october   the company announced that it intended to sell its erc ii forged titanium driver erc ii driver in the united states despite the fact that it was ruled to be non conforming by the usga 
to the company s knowledge  it was the first large  premium brand golf equipment company to sell non conforming equipment in the united states 
by undertaking this approach  the company had hoped to expand participation in the game of golf in the united states the source of more than half of the company s revenues by making the game more enjoyable and accessible for more people  including those people who play the game primarily for fun  enjoyment and recreation 
while the company believed that this was the best strategy for the company and its shareholders  and one that was good for the game of golf as well  the strategy proved to be risky 
the usga vigorously and openly opposed the sale or use of the erc ii driver 
on december   the usga announced that scores in rounds played with clubs that do not conform to usga rules  such as the erc ii driver  may not be posted for usga handicap purposes 
that position was reinforced by further announcements by the usga 

table of contents as a result of the usga s actions  a significant number of us retailers declined to carry the erc ii driver and a significant number of us golfers decided that they did not want to purchase a driver that was non conforming under usga rules 
retailer and or consumer backlash against the introduction of a non conforming product hurt sales of erc ii drivers in the united states  and may have injured sales of other  conforming products  or otherwise damaged the brand 
on may   the usga announced that the usga and the r a had reached a proposed compromise position with respect to the cor of drivers 
under the compromise  the cor limit would have been set at under both the rules of the usga and the r a effective january  there would have been added to the rules of golf a new condition of competition that would have permitted the adoption of as the cor limit for competitions involving elite golfers 
currently  all professional tours in the united states play by the limit 
the r a had announced that it would adopt as the cor limit in the british open championships 
the pga european tour  the japan golf tour and the asian tour currently have no limits on cor 
in addition  as part of the compromise  the usga and the r a stated that the cor limit under the rules of golf would thereafter be reduced  from to on january  on august   the usga and the r a announced that they would not be implementing the may  proposal 
instead the usga announced that it would make no change to its rules of golf  keeping the current cor limit of in place in the united states and other jurisdictions that follow the rules of golf as published by the usga 
the r a announced that effective january  it would establish a cor limit of under its rules of golf 
in addition  the r a announced that it would adopt a condition of competition effective january  for use at competitions involving only highly skilled golfers eg  the british open championship and competitions organized by major professional tours 
under this condition of competition driving clubs would be limited to a cor of no higher than 
until january   there would be no limit on cor in r a jurisdictions except in those events where the condition of competition was applied 
in anticipation of the possible adoption of the proposed compromise as announced on may   and in response to competitive offerings by other manufacturers  the company had promoted the sale of its erc ii driver in the united states and canada beginning in late july the erc ii driver has a cor above the limit  but would have been conforming under the new  higher limit of contained in the may  proposal 
with the announcement that the usga would no longer be raising the cor limit in its jurisdictions effective january   the company modified its promotion and has offered various exchange and return privileges to consumers and retailers  respectively  who purchased erc ii drivers during the promotion in reliance upon a change in the rules of golf by the usga 
although the amount of erc ii drivers exchanged or returned was not significant  the company believes that the usga s reversal of its position has resulted in confusion among consumers  causing them to postpone or even forgo the purchase of new equipment 
the net effect of the reversal in position by the usga regarding the may  proposal is to leave the cor limitations for driving clubs unchanged in the united states 
the company had planned for this contingency  and has developed new driver products for sale in usga jurisdictions that conform to this limit eg  great big bertha ii titanium drivers 
in addition  the company has developed new driver products for sale in r a jurisdictions that take advantage of the absence of cor restrictions until january  eg  great big bertha ii titanium drivers 
while the company believes it would have had an additional competitive advantage in the united states and canada had the usga adopted the may  proposal and raised the cor limit to  it continues to believe that its driver products that conform to the limit have performance and other attributes that make many golfers prefer them over the offerings of competitors 
supply of electricity and energy contracts beginning in the summer of  the company identified a future risk to ongoing operations as a result of the deregulation of the electricity market in california 
in july  the company entered into a one year supply agreement with idaho power company idaho power  a subsidiary of idacorp  inc  for the supply of electricity at per megawatt hour 
during the second quarter of  idaho power advised the company 
table of contents that it was unwilling to renew the contract upon expiration in july due to concerns surrounding the volatility of the california electricity market at that time 
as a result  in the second quarter of  the company entered into an agreement with pilot power group  inc pilot power as the company s energy service provider and in connection therewith entered into a long term  fixed priced  fixed capacity  energy supply contract enron contract with enron energy services  inc eesi  a subsidiary of enron corporation  as part of a comprehensive strategy to ensure the uninterrupted supply of electricity while capping costs in the volatile california electricity market 
the enron contract provided  subject to the other terms and conditions of the contract  for the company to purchase nine megawatts of energy per hour from june  through may   megawatts over the term of the contract 
the total purchase price for such energy over the full contract term would have been approximately million 
at the time the company entered into the enron contract  nine megawatts per hour was in excess of the amount the company expected to be able to use in its operations 
the company agreed to purchase this amount  however  in order to obtain a more favorable price than the company could have obtained if the company had purchased a lesser quantity 
the company expected to be able to sell any excess supply through pilot power 
because the enron contract provided for the company to purchase an amount of energy in excess of what it expected to be able to use in its operations  the company accounted for the enron contract as a derivative instrument in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
the enron contract did not qualify for hedge accounting under sfas no 
therefore  the company recognized changes in the estimated fair value of the enron contract currently in earnings 
the estimated fair value of the enron contract was based upon a present value determination of the net differential between the contract price for electricity and the estimated future market prices for electricity as applied to the remaining amount of unpurchased electricity under the enron contract 
through september   the company had recorded unrealized pre tax losses of million million in the second quarter of and million in the third quarter of 
on november   the company notified eesi that  among other things  eesi was in default of the enron contract and that based upon such default  and for other reasons  the company was terminating the enron contract effective immediately 
at the time of termination  the contract price for the remaining energy to be purchased under the enron contract through may was approximately million 
on november   eesi notified the company that it disagreed that it was in default of the enron contract and that it was prepared to deliver energy pursuant to the enron contract 
however  on december   eesi  along with enron corporation and numerous other related entities  filed for bankruptcy 
since november   the parties have not been operating under the enron contract and pilot power has been providing energy to the company from alternate suppliers 
as a result of the company s notice of termination to eesi  and certain other automatic termination provisions under the enron contract  the company believes that the enron contract has been terminated 
as a result  the company adjusted the estimated value of the enron contract through the date of termination  at which time the terminated enron contract ceased to represent a derivative instrument in accordance with sfas no 
because the enron contract is terminated and neither party to the contract is performing pursuant to the terms of the contract  the company no longer records future valuation adjustments for changes in electricity rates 
the company continues to reflect on its balance sheet the derivative valuation account of million  subject to periodic review  in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for transfers and servicing of financial assets and extinguishments of liabilities 
the company believes the enron contract has been terminated  and as of march   eesi has not asserted any claim against the company 
there can be no assurance  however  that eesi or another party will not assert a future claim against the company or that a bankruptcy court or arbitrator will not ultimately nullify the company s termination of the enron contract 
no provision has been made for contingencies or obligations  if any  under the enron contract beyond november  
table of contents certain factors affecting callaway golf company the financial statements contained in this report and the related discussion describe and analyze the company s financial performance and condition for the periods indicated 
for the most part  this information is historical 
the company s prior results are not necessarily indicative of the company s future performance or financial condition 
the company therefore has included the following discussion of certain factors which could affect the company s future performance or financial condition 
these factors could cause the company s future performance or financial condition to differ materially from its prior performance or financial condition or from management s expectations or estimates of the company s future performance or financial condition 
these factors  among others  should be considered in assessing the company s future prospects and prior to making an investment decision with respect to the company s stock 
terrorist activity and armed conflict terrorist activities and armed conflicts such as the attacks on the world trade center and the pentagon  the incidents of anthrax poisoning and the military actions in the middle east  as well as the threat of future conflict such as the potential armed conflict with iraq  have had a significant adverse effect upon the company s business 
any such additional events would likely have an adverse effect upon an already weakened world economy discussed below and would likely adversely affect the level of demand for the company s products as consumers attention and interest are diverted from golf and become focused on these events and the economic  political  and public safety issues and concerns associated with such events 
also  such events could adversely affect the company s ability to manage its supply and delivery logistics 
if such events caused a significant disruption in domestic or international air  ground or sea shipments  the company s ability to obtain the materials necessary to produce and sell its products and to deliver customer orders also would be materially adversely affected 
furthermore  such events have negatively impacted tourism 
if this negative impact upon tourism continues  the company s sales to retailers at resorts and other vacation destinations would be materially adversely affected 
adverse global economic conditions the company sells golf clubs  golf balls and golf accessories 
these products are recreational in nature and are therefore discretionary purchases for consumers 
consumers are generally more willing to make discretionary purchases of golf products during favorable economic conditions and when consumers are feeling confident and prosperous 
adverse economic conditions in the united states or in the company s international markets which represent almost half of the company s total sales  or a decrease in prosperity among consumers  or even a decrease in consumer confidence as a result of anticipated adverse economic conditions  could cause consumers to forgo or to postpone purchasing new golf products 
such forgone or postponed purchases could have a material adverse effect upon the company 
the company believes that the current economic conditions in many of the countries where the company conducts business are unfavorable to the golf industry 
the economic conditions in many of the company s key markets around the world are currently viewed by many as uncertain or troubled 
many people in the united states have lost a substantial amount of wealth in the stock market  including some who have lost all or substantially all of their retirement savings 
furthermore  in the united states  there have been announcements by companies of significant reductions in force  and others are possible  and consumers are less likely to purchase new golf equipment when they are unemployed 
the company believes that these adverse conditions have adversely affected the company s sales and will continue to do so until such conditions improve 
foreign currency risk almost half of the company s sales are international sales 
as a result  the company conducts transactions in approximately currencies worldwide 
conducting business in such various currencies increases the company s exposure to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates relative to the us dollar 
changes in exchange rates may positively or negatively affect the company s financial results 

table of contents overall  the company is generally negatively affected by a stronger us dollar in relation to the foreign currencies in which the company conducts business 
conversely  overall  the company is generally positively affected by a weaker us dollar relative to such foreign currencies 
for the effect of foreign currencies on the company s financial results for the current reporting periods  see above results of operations 
the effects of foreign currency fluctuations can be significant 
the company therefore engages in certain hedging activities to mitigate the impact of foreign currency fluctuations over time on the company s financial results 
the company s hedging activities reduce  but do not eliminate  the effects of such foreign currency fluctuations 
factors that could affect the effectiveness of the company s hedging activities include accuracy of sales forecasts  volatility of currency markets and the availability of hedging instruments 
since the hedging activities are designed to reduce volatility  they not only reduce the negative impact of a stronger us dollar but they also reduce the positive impact of a weaker us dollar 
for the effect of the company s hedging activities during the current reporting periods  see below quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 
the company s future financial results could be significantly negatively affected if the value of the us dollar increases relative to the foreign currencies in which the company conducts business 
the degree to which the company s financial results are affected will depend in part upon the effectiveness or ineffectiveness of the company s hedging activities 
growth opportunities golf clubs 
in order for the company to significantly grow its sales of golf clubs  the company must either increase its share of the market for golf clubs or the market for golf clubs must grow 
the company already has a significant share of the worldwide premium golf club market and therefore opportunities for additional market share may be limited 
the company does not believe there has been any material increase in participation in the united states in  or golf datatech has reported that the number of rounds played in the united states during decreased as compared to the same period of and has decreased each year since at least furthermore  the company believes that since the overall worldwide premium golf club market has generally not experienced substantial growth in dollar volume from year to year 
there is no assurance that the overall dollar volume of the worldwide premium golf club market will grow  or that it will not decline  in the future 
golf balls 
the company began selling its golf balls in february and has not yet obtained a sufficient share of the golf ball market to support profitable operations 
although opportunities exist for the acquisition of additional market share in the golf ball market  such market share is currently held by some well established and well financed competitors 
there is no assurance that the company will be able to obtain additional market share in this very competitive golf ball market 
if the company is unable to obtain additional market share  its golf ball sales growth may be limited see also above liquidity 
golf ball costs the cost of entering the golf ball business has been significant 
the cost of competing in the golf ball business has also been significant and has required significant investment in advertising  tour and promotion 
to date  the development of the company s golf ball business has had a significant negative impact on the company s cash flows  financial position and results of operations 
as presently structured  the company will need to produce and sell golf balls in large volumes to cover its costs and become profitable 
although the company s golf ball sales have shown improvement  there is no assurance that the company will be able to achieve the sales volume necessary to make its golf ball business profitable 
until the golf ball business becomes profitable  the company s results of operations  cash flows and financial position will continue to be negatively affected 
the company is evaluating all available actions to reduce and eliminate the losses in its golf ball business 
some of these actions could result in a write down of a significant portion of the assets used in the company s golf ball operations see also above liquidity 

table of contents manufacturing capacity the company plans its manufacturing capacity based upon the forecasted demand for its products 
actual demand for such products may exceed or be less than forecasted demand 
the company s unique product designs often require sophisticated manufacturing techniques  which can require significant start up expenses and or limit the company s ability to quickly expand its manufacturing capacity to meet the full demand for its products 
if the company is unable to produce sufficient quantities of new products in time to fulfill actual demand  especially during the company s traditionally busy season  it could limit the company s sales and adversely affect its financial performance 
on the other hand  the company invests in manufacturing capacity and commits to components and other manufacturing inputs for varying periods of time  which can limit the company s ability to quickly react if actual demand is less than forecasted demand 
this could result in less than optimum capacity usage and or in excess inventories and related obsolescence charges that could adversely affect the company s financial performance 
in addition  if the company were to experience delays  difficulties or increased costs in its production of golf clubs or golf balls  including production of new products needed to replace current products  the company s future golf club or golf ball sales could be adversely affected 
dependence on energy resources the company s golf club and golf ball manufacturing facilities use  among other resources  significant quantities of electricity to operate 
in  some companies in california  including the company  experienced periods of blackouts during which electricity was not available 
the company has taken certain steps to provide access to alternative power supplies for certain of its operations  and believes that these measures could mitigate any impact resulting from possible future blackouts 
the company is currently purchasing wholesale energy through the company s energy service provider under short term contracts 
if energy rates were once again to increase significantly  the company s energy costs could increase significantly and adversely affect the company s results of operations 
dependence on certain suppliers and materials the company is dependent on a limited number of suppliers for its clubheads and shafts  some of which are single sourced 
in addition  some of the company s products require specifically developed manufacturing techniques and processes which make it difficult to identify and utilize alternative suppliers quickly 
the company believes that suitable clubheads and shafts could be obtained from other manufacturers in the event its regular suppliers were unable to provide components 
however  there could be a significant production delay or disruption caused by the inability of current suppliers to deliver or the transition to other suppliers  which in turn could have a material adverse impact on the company s results of operations 
the company is also single sourced or dependent on a limited number of suppliers for the materials it uses to make its golf balls 
many of the materials are customized for the company 
any delay or interruption in such supplies could have a material adverse impact upon the company s golf ball business 
if the company did experience any such delays or interruptions  there is no assurance that the company would be able to find adequate alternative suppliers at a reasonable cost or without significant disruption to its business 
the company uses united parcel service ups for substantially all ground shipments of products to its us customers 
the company uses air carriers and ships for most of its international shipments of products 
any significant interruption in ups  air carrier or ship services could have a material adverse effect upon the company s ability to deliver its products to its customers 
if there were any significant interruption in such services  there is no assurance that the company could engage alternative suppliers to deliver its products in a timely and cost efficient manner 
in addition  many of the components the company uses to build its golf clubs  including clubheads and shafts  are shipped to the company via air carrier and ship services 
any significant interruption in ups services  air carrier services or shipping services into or out of the united states could have a material adverse effect upon the company see also below international risks 
the company s size has made it a large consumer of certain materials  including titanium alloys and carbon fiber 
the company does not make these materials itself  and must rely on its ability to obtain 
table of contents adequate supplies in the world marketplace in competition with other users of such materials 
while the company has been successful in obtaining its requirements for such materials thus far  there can be no assurance that it always will be able to do so 
an interruption in the supply of the materials used by the company or a significant change in costs could have a material adverse effect on the company 
competition golf clubs 
the worldwide market for premium golf clubs is highly competitive  and is served by a number of well established and well financed companies with recognized brand names  as well as new companies with popular products 
for example  in nike began marketing and selling golf clubs that compete with the company s products  and several manufacturers in japan have announced plans to expand their businesses in the united states 
new product introductions  price reductions  consignment sales  extended payment terms and close outs including close outs of products that were recently commercially successful by competitors continue to generate increased market competition 
while the company believes that its products and its marketing efforts continue to be competitive  there can be no assurance that successful marketing activities  discounted pricing  consignment sales  extended payment terms or new product introductions by competitors will not negatively impact the company s future sales 
golf balls 
the premium golf ball business is also highly competitive and may be becoming even more competitive 
there are a number of well established and well financed competitors  including one competitor with an estimated market share in excess of of the premium golf ball business 
furthermore  as competition in this business increases  many of these competitors are substantially discounting the prices of their products 
this increased competition has resulted in significant expenses in both tour and advertising 
in order for its golf ball business to be successful  the company will need to penetrate the market share held by existing competitors  while competing with new entrants  and must do so at prices and costs that are profitable 
there can be no assurance that the company s golf balls will obtain the market acceptance or profitability necessary to be commercially successful see also above liquidity 
market acceptance of products a golf manufacturer s ability to compete is in part dependent upon its ability to satisfy the various subjective requirements of golfers  including a golf club s and golf ball s look and feel  and the level of acceptance that a golf club and ball has among professional and recreational golfers 
the subjective preferences of golf club and ball purchasers are difficult to predict and may be subject to rapid and unanticipated changes 
in addition  the company s products have tended to incorporate significant innovations in design and manufacture  which have often resulted in higher prices for the company s products relative to other products in the marketplace 
there can be no assurance that a significant percentage of the public will always be willing to pay such premium prices for golf equipment or that the company will be able to continue to design and manufacture premium products that achieve market acceptance in the future 
for example  in  the company introduced the c driver made of compression cured carbon composite 
this product did not meet the company s expectations and is indicative of the risks associated with the subjective preferences of golfers 
in general  there can be no assurance as to how long the company s golf clubs and golf balls will maintain market acceptance and therefore no assurance that the demand for the company s products will permit the company to experience growth in sales  or maintain historical levels of sales  in the future 
new product introduction and product cyclicality the company believes that the introduction of new  innovative golf clubs and golf balls is important to its future success 
a major portion of the company s revenues is generated by products that are less than two years old 
the company faces certain risks associated with such a strategy 
for example  in the golf industry  new models and basic design changes in golf equipment are frequently met with consumer rejection 
in addition  prior successful designs may be rendered obsolete within a relatively short period of time as new products are introduced into the marketplace 
further  any new products that retail at a lower price than prior products may negatively impact the company s revenues unless unit sales increase 
the rapid introduction of new golf club or golf ball products by the company could result in close outs of existing inventories at both the 
table of contents wholesale and retail levels 
such close outs can result in reduced margins on the sale of older products  as well as reduced sales of new products  given the availability of older products at lower prices 
the company s newly introduced golf club products generally have a product life cycle of approximately two years 
these products generally sell significantly better in the first year after introduction as compared to the second year 
in certain markets  such as japan  the decline in sales during the second year is even more significant 
the company s titanium metal wood products generally sell at higher price points than its comparable steel metal wood products 
the company s wood products generally achieve better gross margins than its comparable iron products 
the company generally introduces new titanium metal wood products and steel metal wood products in alternate years 
the company s sales and gross margins for a particular period may be negatively or positively affected by the mix of new products sold in such period 
seasonality and adverse weather conditions in addition to the effects of product cycles described above  the company s business is also subject to the effects of seasonal fluctuations 
the company s first quarter sales generally represent the company s sell in to the golf retail channel of its products for the new golf season 
orders for many of these sales are received during the fourth quarter of the prior year 
the company s second and third quarter sales generally represent re order business 
sales during the second and third quarters therefore are significantly affected not only by the sell through of the company s products that were sold into the channel during the first quarter but also by the sell through of the products of the company s competitors 
retailers are sometimes reluctant to re order the company s products in significant quantity when they already have excess inventory of the company s competitors products 
the company s sales during the fourth quarter are generally significantly less than the other quarters because in general in the company s principal markets less people are playing golf during that time of year due to cold weather 
furthermore  it previously was the company s practice to announce its new product line at the beginning of each calendar year 
the company has departed from that practice and now generally announces its new product line in the fourth quarter to allow retailers to plan better 
such early announcements of new products could cause golfers  and therefore the company s customers  to defer purchasing additional golf equipment until the company s new products are available 
such deferments could have a material adverse effect upon sales of the company s current products and or result in close out sales at reduced prices 
because of these seasonal trends  the company s business can be significantly adversely affected by unusual or severe weather conditions 
unfavorable weather conditions generally result in less golf rounds played  which generally results in less demand for golf clubs and golf balls 
consequently  sustained adverse weather conditions  especially during the warm weather months  could materially affect the company s sales 
conformance with the rules of golf new golf club and golf ball products generally seek to satisfy the standards established by the usga and r a because these standards are generally followed by golfers within their respective jurisdictions 
the usga rules are generally followed in the united states  canada and mexico  and the r a rules are generally followed in most other countries throughout the world 
the rules of golf as published by the r a and the usga are virtually the same except with respect to the regulation of driving clubs 
see above usga action 
all of the company s current products including the new great big bertha ii titanium drivers  with the exception of the great big bertha ii titanium drivers  are believed to be conforming under the rules of golf as published by the usga 
all of the company s products are believed to be conforming to the rules of golf as published by the r a  except as discussed above at usga action that effective january  the company s great big bertha ii titanium drivers will not be conforming in certain competitions involving highly skilled golfers and effective january  such drivers would not be conforming under the rules of golf as published by the r a 
these new r a restrictions could affect current and future sales of such drivers in r a jurisdictions  including jurisdictions in which the company previously sold such products and in which there previously were no r a restrictions 
the company also believes that the general 
table of contents confusion created by the usga as to what is a conforming or non conforming driver has hurt sales of its drivers generally 
in addition  there is no assurance that the company s future products will satisfy usga and or r a standards  or that existing usga and or r a standards will not be altered in ways that adversely affect the sales of the company s products or the company s brand 
for example  both the usga and the r a are considering rules which would limit clubhead volume 
if any such volume limitation rules were adopted and caused one or more of the company s current products to be non conforming  the company s sales of such products could be adversely affected 
furthermore  such clubhead volume limitations would restrict the company s ability to develop new golf club products 
golf professional endorsements the company establishes relationships with professional golfers in order to evaluate and promote callaway golf and odyssey branded products 
the company has entered into endorsement arrangements with members of the various professional tours  including the champions tour  the pga tour  the lpga tour  the pga european tour  the japan golf tour and the nationwide tour 
while most professional golfers fulfill their contractual obligations  some have been known to stop using a sponsor s products despite contractual commitments 
if certain of the company s professional endorsers were to stop using the company s products contrary to their endorsement agreements  the company s business could be adversely affected in a material way by the negative publicity 
golf clubs 
in the past  the company has experienced an exceptional level of club usage on the world s major professional tours  and the company has heavily advertised that fact 
many professional golfers throughout the world use the company s golf clubs even though they are not contractually bound to do so and do not grant any endorsement to the company 
the company from time to time implements programs that create cash incentives that financially reward such usage 
many other companies  however  also aggressively seek the patronage of these professionals and offer many inducements  including significant cash rewards and specially designed products 
the inducements offered by other companies could result in a decrease in usage of the company s clubs by professional golfers 
the company believes that professional usage contributes to retail sales  and it is therefore possible that a decline in the level of professional usage of the company s products could have a material adverse effect on the company s sales and business 
golf balls 
many golf ball manufacturers  including the leading us manufacturer of premium golf balls  have focused a great deal of their marketing efforts on promoting the fact that tour professionals use their balls 
some of these golf ball competitors spend large amounts of money to secure professional endorsements and or usage  and the market leader has obtained a very high degree of tour penetration 
while all of the company s staff professionals  as well as other professionals who are not on the company s staff  have decided to use the company s golf balls in play  there is no assurance they will continue to do so 
furthermore  there are many other professionals who are already under contract with other golf ball manufacturers or who  for other reasons  may not choose to play the company s golf ball products 
the company does not plan to match the endorsement spending levels of the leading manufacturer  and will instead rely more heavily upon the performance of the company s golf ball products and other factors to attract professionals to the product 
there is some evidence to suggest that there is a correlation between use by professional golfers and retail sales 
the company therefore believes that the results of the company s golf ball business could be significantly affected by its success or lack of success in securing acceptance on the professional tours 
intellectual property and proprietary rights the golf club industry  in general  has been characterized by widespread imitation of popular club designs 
the company has an active program of enforcing its proprietary rights against companies and individuals who market or manufacture counterfeits and knock off products  and asserts its rights against infringers of its copyrights  patents  trademarks  and trade dress 
however  there is no assurance that these efforts will reduce the level of acceptance obtained by these infringers 
additionally  there can be no assurance 
table of contents that other golf club manufacturers will not be able to produce successful golf clubs which imitate the company s designs without infringing any of the company s copyrights  patents  trademarks  or trade dress 
an increasing number of the company s competitors have  like the company itself  sought to obtain patent  trademark  copyright or other protection of their proprietary rights and designs for golf clubs and golf balls 
as the company develops new products  it attempts to avoid infringing the valid patents and other intellectual property rights of others 
before introducing new products  the company s legal staff evaluates the patents and other intellectual property rights of others to determine if changes are required to avoid infringing any valid intellectual property rights that could be asserted against the company s new product offerings 
from time to time  others have contacted or may contact the company to claim that they have proprietary rights that have been infringed by the company and or its products 
the company evaluates any such claims and  where appropriate  has obtained or sought to obtain licenses or other business arrangements 
to date  there have been no interruptions in the company s business as a result of any claims of infringement 
no assurance can be given  however  that the company will not be adversely affected in the future by the assertion of intellectual property rights belonging to others 
this effect could include alteration or withdrawal of existing products and delayed introduction of new products 
various patents have been issued to the company s competitors in the golf ball industry 
as the company develops its golf ball products  it attempts to avoid infringing valid patents or other intellectual property rights 
despite these attempts  it cannot be guaranteed that competitors will not assert and or a court will not find that the company s golf balls infringe certain patent or other rights of competitors 
if the company s golf balls are found to infringe on protected technology  there is no assurance that the company would be able to obtain a license to use such technology  and it could incur substantial costs to redesign them and or defend legal actions 
the company has procedures to maintain the secrecy of its confidential business information 
these procedures include criteria for dissemination of information and written confidentiality agreements with employees and suppliers 
suppliers  when engaged in joint research projects  are required to enter into additional confidentiality agreements 
while these efforts are taken seriously  there can be no assurance that these measures will prove adequate in all instances to protect the company s confidential information 
the company s code of conduct and ethics policy prohibits misappropriation of trade secrets and confidential information of third parties 
the code of conduct is contained in the company s employee handbook and available to all employees on the company s internal website 
employees also sign an employee invention and confidentiality agreement prohibiting disclosure of trade secrets and confidential information from third parties 
periodic training is provided to employees on this topic as well 
despite taking these steps  as well as others  the company cannot guarantee that these measures will be adequate in all instances to prevent misappropriation of trade secrets from third parties or the accusation by a third party that such misappropriation has taken place 
product returns golf clubs 
the company supports all of its golf clubs with a limited two year written warranty 
since the company does not rely upon traditional designs in the development of its golf clubs  its products may be more likely to develop unanticipated problems than those of many of its competitors that use traditional designs 
for example  clubs have been returned with cracked clubheads  broken graphite shafts and loose medallions 
while any breakage or warranty problems are deemed significant to the company  the incidence of defective clubs returned to date has not been material in relation to the volume of clubs that have been sold 
the company monitors the level and nature of any golf club breakage and  where appropriate  seeks to incorporate design and production changes to assure its customers of the highest quality available in the market 
significant increases in the incidence of breakage or other product problems may adversely affect the company s sales and image with golfers 
the company believes that it has adequate reserves for warranty claims 
if the company were to experience an unusually high incidence of breakage or other warranty problems in excess of these reserves  the company s financial results could be adversely affected 
see above  critical accounting policies and estimates warranty 

table of contents golf balls 
the company has not experienced significant returns of defective golf balls  and in light of the quality control procedures implemented in the production of its golf balls  the company does not expect a significant amount of defective ball returns 
however  if future returns of defective golf balls were significant  it could have a material adverse effect upon the company s golf ball business 
gray market distribution some quantities of the company s products find their way to unapproved outlets or distribution channels 
this gray market for the company s products can undermine authorized retailers and foreign wholesale distributors who promote and support the company s products  and can injure the company s image in the minds of its customers and consumers 
on the other hand  stopping such commerce could result in a potential decrease in sales to those customers who are selling callaway golf products to unauthorized distributors and or an increase in sales returns over historical levels 
while the company has taken some lawful steps to limit commerce in its products in the gray market in both the us and abroad  it has not stopped such commerce 
international risks the company s management believes that controlling the distribution of its products in certain major markets in the world has been and will be an element in the future growth and success of the company 
the company sells and distributes its products directly as opposed to through third party distributors in many key international markets in europe  asia  north america and elsewhere around the world 
these activities have resulted and will continue to result in investments in inventory  accounts receivable  employees  corporate infrastructure and facilities 
in addition  there are a limited number of suppliers of golf club components in the united states and the company has increasingly become more reliant on suppliers and vendors located outside of the united states 
the operation of foreign distribution in the company s international markets  as well as the management of relationships with international suppliers and vendors  will continue to require the dedication of management and other company resources 
as a result of this international business  the company is exposed to increased risks inherent in conducting business outside of the united states 
in addition to foreign currency risks  these risks include i increased difficulty in protecting the company s intellectual property rights and trade secrets  ii unexpected government action or changes in legal or regulatory requirements  iii social  economic or political instability  iv the effects of any anti american sentiments on the company s brands or sales of the company s products  v increased difficulty in controlling and monitoring foreign operations from the united states and vi increased exposure to interruptions in air carrier or shipping services including interruptions resulting from longshoreman labor disputes or strikes which interruptions could significantly adversely affect the company s ability to obtain timely delivery of components from international suppliers or to timely deliver its products to international customers 
although the company believes the benefits of conducting business internationally outweigh these risks  any significant adverse change in circumstances or conditions could have a significant adverse effect upon the company s operations and therefore financial performance and condition 
credit risk the company primarily sells its products to golf equipment retailers directly and through wholly owned domestic and foreign subsidiaries  and to foreign distributors 
the company performs ongoing credit evaluations of its customers financial condition and generally requires no collateral from these customers 
historically  the company s bad debt expense has been low 
however  a downturn in the retail golf equipment market could result in increased delinquent or uncollectable accounts for some of the company s significant customers 
in addition  as the company integrates its foreign distribution its exposure to credit risks increases as it no longer sells to a few wholesalers but rather directly to many retailers 
a failure by the company s customers to pay a significant portion of outstanding account receivable balances would adversely impact the company s performance and financial condition 

table of contents information systems all of the company s major operations  including manufacturing  distribution  sales and accounting  are dependent upon the company s information computer systems 
any significant disruption in the operation of such systems  as a result of an internal system malfunction  infection from an external computer virus  or otherwise  would have a significant adverse effect upon the company s ability to operate its business 
although the company has taken steps to mitigate the effect of any such disruptions  there is no assurance that such steps would be adequate in a particular situation 
consequently  a significant or extended disruption in the operation of the company s information systems could have a material adverse effect upon the company s operations and therefore financial performance and condition 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company uses derivative financial instruments for hedging purposes to limit its exposure to changes in foreign exchange rates 
transactions involving these financial instruments are with credit worthy firms 
the use of these instruments exposes the company to market and credit risk which may at times be concentrated with certain counterparties  although counterparty nonperformance is not anticipated 
the company also utilized a derivative commodity instrument  the enron contract  to manage electricity costs in the volatile california energy market during the period of june through november pursuant to its terms  the enron contract was terminated and the company has not entered into another long term energy contract that would be considered a derivative commodity instrument 
the company is also exposed to interest rate risk from its credit facilities and accounts receivable securitization arrangement 
see above certain factors affecting callaway golf company foreign currency risks 
foreign currency fluctuations in the normal course of business  the company is exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risks that could impact the company s results of operations 
the company s risk management strategy includes the use of derivative financial instruments  including forwards and purchased options  to hedge certain of these exposures 
the company s objective is to offset gains and losses resulting from these exposures with gains and losses on the derivative contracts used to hedge them  thereby reducing volatility of earnings 
the company does not enter into any trading or speculative positions with regard to foreign currency related derivative instruments 
the company is exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risk inherent primarily in its sales commitments  anticipated sales and assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the us dollar 
the company transacts business in currencies worldwide  of which the most significant to its operations are the european currencies  japanese yen  korean won  canadian dollar  and australian dollar 
for most currencies  the company is a net receiver of foreign currencies and  therefore  benefits from a weaker us dollar and is adversely affected by a stronger us dollar relative to those foreign currencies in which the company transacts significant amounts of business 
the company enters into foreign exchange contracts to hedge against exposure to changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
such contracts are designated at inception to the related foreign currency exposures being hedged  which include anticipated intercompany sales of inventory denominated in foreign currencies  payments due on intercompany transactions from certain wholly owned foreign subsidiaries  and anticipated sales by the company s wholly owned european subsidiary for certain euro denominated transactions 
hedged transactions are denominated primarily in british pounds  euros  japanese yen  korean won  canadian dollars and australian dollars 
to achieve hedge accounting  contracts must reduce the foreign currency exchange rate risk otherwise inherent in the amount and duration of the hedged exposures and comply with established risk management policies 
pursuant to its foreign exchange hedging policy  the company may hedge anticipated transactions and the related receivables and payables denominated in foreign currencies using forward foreign currency exchange rate contracts and put or call options 
foreign currency derivatives are used only to meet the company s objectives of minimizing variability in the company s operating results arising from foreign exchange rate movements 
the company does not enter into foreign 
table of contents exchange contracts for speculative purposes 
hedging contracts mature within twelve months from their inception 
at december   and  the notional amounts of the company s foreign exchange contracts were approximately million  million and million  respectively 
of the total contracts outstanding at december   and  notional amounts of approximately million  million and million  respectively  were designated as cash flow hedges 
the company estimates the fair values of derivatives based on quoted market prices or pricing models using current market rates  and records all derivatives on the balance sheet at fair value 
at december   the fair value of foreign currency related derivatives was recorded as current assets of million and current liabilities of million 
at december   the fair value of foreign currency related derivatives was recorded as current assets of million 
for derivative instruments that are designated and qualify as cash flow hedges  the effective portion of the gain or loss on the derivative instrument is initially recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income oci as a separate component of shareholders equity and subsequently reclassified into earnings in the period during which the hedged transaction is recognized in earnings 
during the years ended december   and  the company recorded the following activity in accumulated other comprehensive income year ended december  in millions beginning oci balance related to cash flow hedges add net gain loss initially recorded in oci deduct net gain reclassified from oci into earnings ending oci balance related to cash flow hedges during the year ended december   gains of million were reclassified into earnings as a result of the discontinuance of cash flow hedges 
during the years ended december  and  no gains or losses were reclassified into earnings as a result of the discontinuance of cash flow hedges 
as of december   million of deferred net losses related to derivative instruments designated as cash flow hedges were included in accumulated other comprehensive income 
these derivative instruments hedge transactions that are expected to occur within the next twelve months 
as the hedged transactions are completed  the related deferred net gain or loss is reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive income into earnings 
the company does not expect that such reclassifications would have a material effect on the company s earnings  as any gain or loss on the derivative instruments generally would be offset by the opposite effect on the related underlying transactions 
the ineffective portion of the gain or loss for derivative instruments that are designated and qualify as cash flow hedges is immediately reported in interest and other income  net 
for foreign currency contracts designated as cash flow hedges  hedge effectiveness is measured using the spot rate 
changes in the spot forward differential are excluded from the test of hedging effectiveness and are recorded currently in earnings as a component of interest and other income  net 
during the years ended december   and  the company recorded net gains of million and million and a net loss of million  respectively  as a result of changes in the spot forward differential 
assessments of hedge effectiveness are performed using the dollar offset method and applying a hedge effectiveness ratio between and 
given that both the hedged item and the hedging instrument are evaluated using the same spot rate  the company anticipates the hedges to be highly effective 
the effectiveness of each derivative is assessed quarterly 
at december   and  the notional amounts of the company s outstanding foreign exchange contracts used to hedge outstanding balance sheet exposures were approximately million  million and million  respectively 
the gains and losses on foreign currency contracts used to hedge balance sheet exposures are recognized in interest and other income in the same period as the remeasurement

during the years ended december   and  the company recorded a net loss of million and net gains of million and million  respectively  due to net realized and unrealized gains and losses on contracts used to hedge balance sheet exposures 
sensitivity analysis is the measurement of potential loss in future earnings of market sensitive instruments resulting from one or more selected hypothetical changes in interest rates or foreign currency values 
the company used a sensitivity analysis model to quantify the estimated potential effect of unfavorable movements of in foreign currencies to which the company was exposed at december  through its derivative financial instruments 
the sensitivity analysis model is a risk analysis tool and does not purport to represent actual losses in earnings that will be incurred by the company  nor does it consider the potential effect of favorable changes in market rates 
it also does not represent the maximum possible loss that may occur 
actual future gains and losses will differ from those estimated because of changes or differences in market rates and interrelationships  hedging instruments and hedge percentages  timing and other factors 
the estimated maximum one day loss from the company s foreign currency derivative financial instruments  calculated using the sensitivity analysis model described above  is million at december  the portion of the estimated loss associated with the foreign exchange contracts that offset the remeasurement gain and loss of the related foreign currency denominated assets and liabilities is million at december  and would impact earnings 
the remaining million of the estimated loss at december  is derived from outstanding foreign exchange contracts designated as cash flow hedges and would initially impact oci 
the company believes that such a hypothetical loss from its derivatives would be offset by increases in the value of the underlying transactions being hedged 
electricity price fluctuations during the second quarter of  the company entered into the enron contract to manage electricity costs in the volatile california energy market 
this derivative did not qualify for hedge accounting treatment under sfas no 
therefore  the company recognized the changes in the estimated fair value of the contract based on current market rates as unrealized energy derivative losses 
during the fourth quarter of  the company notified the energy supplier that  among other things  the energy supplier was in default of the energy supply contract and that based upon such default  and for other reasons  the company was terminating the energy supply contract 
as a result  the company adjusted the estimated value of this contract through the date of termination 
because the contract is terminated and neither party to the contract is performing pursuant to the terms of the contract  the terminated contract ceased to represent a derivative instrument in accordance with sfas no 
the company  therefore  no longer records future valuation adjustments for changes in electricity rates 
the company continues to reflect the derivative valuation account on its balance sheet  subject to periodic review  in accordance with sfas no
