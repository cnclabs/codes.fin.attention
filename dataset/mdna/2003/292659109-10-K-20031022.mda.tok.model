item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations critical accounting policies in preparing financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america gaap  management is required to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amount of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and revenues and expenses during the reported period 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
the company is impacted by factors such as the continued receipt of contracts from the us government and industrial partners  its ability to protect and maintain the proprietary nature of its technology  its continued product and technological advances and the strength and ability of the company s licensees and joint venture partners to commercialize the company s products and technologies 
we have identified the following as critical accounting policies to our company principles of consolidation  equity accounting and revenue recognition for product sales  royalties  and business agreements 
principles of consolidation and equity accounting the consolidated financial statements include the accounts of ecd and its owned subsidiaries united solar ovonic corp 
previously called united solar systems corp 
and owned prior to may  and united solar ovonic llc previously called bekaert ecd solar systems llc and owned by united solar ovonic corp 
prior to may  jointly referred to as united solar ovonic  a business formed to develop and commercialize the company s continuous web  multilayer  large area thin film amorphous silicon photovoltaic technology see note e to the consolidated financial statements  and its approximately owned subsidiary ovonic battery company  inc ovonic battery  a company formed to develop and commercialize ecd s ovonic r nickel metal hydride nimh battery technology collectively the company 
the remaining shares of ovonic battery are owned by honda motor company  ltd  sanoh industrial company  ltd 
and sanyo electric co  ltd 
no minority interest related to ovonic battery is recorded in the consolidated financial statements because there is no additional funding requirement by the minority shareholders 
the company has a number of strategic alliances and has five major investments accounted for using the equity method i texaco ovonic battery systems llc  a joint venture between ovonic battery and chevrontexaco corporation  each having interest  to manufacture and sell the company s proprietary nimh batteries for transportation and stationary applications  ii texaco ovonic hydrogen systems llc  a joint venture between ecd and chevrontexaco  each having interest  to further develop and commercialize ovonic tm solid hydrogen storage technology  iii ovonyx  inc  a owned joint venture with mr 
tyler lowrey  intel capital and other investors  to further develop and commercialize ecd s ovonic unified memory tm oum tm technology  iv ovonic media  llc  a joint venture owned by general electric ge through its ge plastics business unit and by ecd formed to design  develop  demonstrate and commercialize our proprietary continuous web roll to roll technology for ultra high speed manufacture of optical media products  and v its innovative transportation systems ag its  a german company beneficially owned by ecd formed to manufacture battery powered electric vehicles 
in addition  prior to may   the company accounted for united solar ovonic llc  owned by united solar ovonic corp 
now owned by the company using the equity method of accounting 
also  ecd has two owned joint ventures in russia  sovlux co  ltd 
sovlux and sovlux battery closed stock company sovlux battery 
see note e to the consolidated financial statements for discussion of all of the company s ventures 
the company s investments in texaco ovonic battery systems  texaco ovonic hydrogen systems and ovonic media are recorded at zero 
the company will continue to carry its investment in each of these joint ventures at zero until the venture becomes profitable based upon the venture s history of sustainable profits  at which time the company will start to recognize over a period of years its share  if any  of the then equity of each of the ventures  and will recognize its share of each venture s profits or losses on the equity method of accounting 
to the extent that the company has made cash or other contributions  it recognizes its proportionate share of any losses until the investment reaches zero 
the company has three joint ventures  rare earth ovonic  with rare earth high tech co 
ltd 
rare earth high tech of baotou steel company of inner mongolia  china  for the manufacture of its battery and other related products and components 
the company accounts for its interest in each of these joint ventures using the cost method of accounting total cash investment of in october  the company  through a newly formed company  ovonic cognitive computer  inc  which is owned by the company and by ovonyx  made a capital contribution of  in ovonyx in exchange for technology previously contributed by ecd to ovonyx 
ecd received an exclusive  royalty bearing license  subject to existing agreements  for the use of all oum tm and ovonic threshold switch and other ovonyx technology for use in the field of cognitive computers 
the company has recorded its  investment in ovonyx and accounts for this investment on the equity method and will recognize its proportionate share of ovonyx losses to the extent of its  investment 
in the year ended june   the company recorded an equity loss of  while the company believes  based upon the opinion of legal counsel  that it has no obligation to fund any losses that its joint ventures incur beyond the company s investment  the company has decided to fund certain of its joint ventures 
upon consolidation  all intercompany accounts and transactions are eliminated 
any profits on intercompany transactions are eliminated to the extent of the company s ownership percentage 
product sales product sales include revenues related to photovoltaic products  machine building and equipment sales contracts  nickel hydroxide and metal hydride materials and battery packs 
revenues related to machine building and equipment sales contracts and sales related to other long term contracts are recognized on the percentage of completion method of accounting using the costs incurred to date as a percentage of the total expected costs 
all other product sales are recognized when the product is shipped 
these products are shipped fob shipping point 
royalties most license agreements  other than those granted to certain joint ventures  provide for the company to receive royalties from the sale of products which utilize the licensed technology 
typically  the royalties are incremental to and distinct from the license fee and are recognized as revenue upon the sale of the respective licensed product 
in several instances  the company has received cash payments for nonrefundable advance royalty payments which are creditable against future royalties under the licenses 
advance royalty payments are deferred and recognized in revenues as the creditable sales occur  the underlying agreement expires  or when the company has demonstrable evidence that no additional royalties will be creditable and  accordingly  the earnings process is completed 
business agreements a substantial portion of revenues is derived through business agreements for the development and or commercialization of products based upon the company s proprietary technologies 
the company has two major types of business agreements 
the first type of business agreement relates to licensing the company s proprietary technology 
licensing activities are tailored to provide each licensee with the right to use the company s technology  most of which is patented  for a specific product application or  in some instances  for further exploration of new product applications of such technologies 
the terms of such licenses  accordingly  are tailored to address a number of circumstances relating to the use of such technology which have been negotiated between the company and the licensee 
such terms generally address whether the license will be exclusive or nonexclusive  whether the licensee is limited to very narrowly defined applications or to broader based product manufacture or sale of products using such technologies  whether the license will provide royalties for products sold which employ such licensed technology and how such royalties will be measured  as well as other factors specific to each negotiated arrangement 
in some cases  licenses relate directly to product development that the company has undertaken pursuant to product development agreements  in other cases  they relate to product development and commercialization efforts of the licensee  and other agreements combine the efforts of the company with those of the licensee 
license agreement fees are generally recognized as revenue at the time the agreements are consummated  which is the completion of the earnings process 
typically  such fees are nonrefundable  do not obligate the company to incur any future costs or require future performance by the company  and are not related to future production or earnings of the licensee 
license fees payable in installments are recorded at the present value of the amounts to be received  taking into account the collectibility of the license fee 
in some instances  a portion of such license fees is contingent upon the commencement of production or other uncertainties 
in these cases  license fee revenues are not recognized until commencement of production or the resolution of uncertainties 
generally  there are no current or future direct costs associated with license fees 
in the second type of agreement  product development agreements  the company conducts specified product development projects related to one of its principal technology specializations for an agreed upon fee 
some of these projects have stipulated performance criteria and deliverables whereas others require best efforts with no specified performance criteria 
revenues from product development agreements that contain specific performance criteria are recognized on a percentage of completion basis which matches the contract revenues to the costs incurred on a project  based on the relationship of costs incurred to estimated total project costs 
revenues from product development agreements  where there are no specific performance terms  are recognized in amounts equal to the amounts expended on the programs 
generally  the agreed upon fees for product development agreements contemplate reimbursing the company for costs considered associated with project activities including expenses for direct product development and research  patents  operating  general and administrative expenses and depreciation 
accordingly  expenses related to product development agreements are recorded as cost of revenues from product development agreements 
results of operations year ended june  compared to year ended june  the company has continued to invest to further advance its technologies 
these investments in its technologies have led to strategic alliances with companies such as chevrontexaco  general electric and china s rare earth high tech co  ltd 
of baotou steel company and our ovonyx joint venture which includes intel 
in accordance with gaap  the investments the company makes in developing its technologies are expensed as research and development expense in the periods in which they are incurred and the value of these technologies are not carried as assets on the company s balance sheet 
for the period july  through may   the company owned of united solar ovonic corp 
formerly united solar systems corp 
and consolidated that entity with a minority interest recognized  and accounted for united solar ovonic corp 
s interest in united solar ovonic llc formerly bekaert ecd solar systems llc on the equity basis 
effective may   with the purchase by the company from bekaert corporation of the remaining interests in united solar ovonic corp 
and united solar ovonic llc  the company owns of each of the entities and has consolidated the entities in their entirety for the period from may  through june  the company had a net loss of  on revenues of  in the year ended june  compared to a net loss of  on revenues of  for the year ended june  the  increase in the net loss resulted primarily from increased patent defense expenses net of  to protect ovonic battery s intellectual property  increased losses on product sales of  an increase of  in the net cost of product development as the company received lower third party funding to offset its spending on its core technologies  reduced interest income of  due to a lower cash balance and lower interest rates and increased equity in losses and writedown of joint ventures of  partially offset by increased license revenues of  in addition  the company recognized income of  attributable to the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle see note a of notes to consolidated financial statements 
the loss from operations increased to  in from  in because of o a  increased operating loss for the ecd segment  net of consolidating entries  which includes machine building  optical memory  fuel cell technology  support services for hydrogen storage  and ovonic tm cognitive computer technology  in versus  in  primarily due to higher investment in product development as ecd received lower third party funding to offset its spending on its core technologies  o an increased operating loss of  for united solar ovonic operating loss of  in versus operating loss of  in primarily due to costs associated with increasing production capacity with the february start up of new manufacturing equipment which  when fully optimized  is capable of producing mw of photovoltaic products annually and due to  after may   recognition of of united solar ovonic s operating results  o a  increased operating loss for ovonic battery operating loss of  in versus operating loss of  in primarily resulting from higher costs for patent defense and lower revenues from product development agreements 
the decrease in consolidated revenues primarily resulted from lower product sales  lower revenues from product development agreements  and lower royalties  partially offset by higher license and other agreements  in versus  in 
o the ecd segment s revenues  net of consolidating entries  decreased to  in from  in primarily due to an  decrease in revenues from product development agreements  principally from the reduced work from the advanced product development agreement with texaco ovonic hydrogen systems  and due to the discontinuance of funding by joint venture partners for both ovonic media and the development of work related to ovonic r fuel cell technology beginning january 
o the  decrease in ovonic battery s revenues was primarily due to lower equipment sales to rare earth ovonic  in versus  in as the first phase of this program nears completion  decreased revenues from product development agreements  in versus  in due to reduced work on advanced product development for texaco ovonic battery systems and decreased royalties  reduction  partially offset by increased revenues from license and other agreements  in versus  in 
o united solar ovonic s consolidated revenues increased to  in versus  in due to i increased product sales as it continues to expand its manufacturing capacity from the previous mw manufacturing equipment to the current equipment which  when fully optimized  is capable of producing mw of photovoltaic products annually  ii the acquisition of of united solar ovonic llc on may  and the resultant consolidation of their revenues from third parties after that date  and iii higher revenues from product development agreements 
product sales  consisting of machine building and equipment sales  photovoltaic products and nickel hydroxide and metal hydride materials  decreased to  in the year ended june  from  in the year ended june  machine building and equipment sales revenues decreased to  in from  in  primarily due to the near completion of the first phase of ovonic battery s contracts with rare earth ovonic to provide battery making equipment  in compared to  in 
all machine building and equipment sales contracts are accounted for using percentage of completion accounting 
partially offsetting this decrease were photovoltaic sales sales of semi finished products to an affiliate  united solar ovonic llc  prior to may   and are sales of finished products to third parties after that date which were  for and  for see note e of notes to consolidated financial statements 
sales of nickel hydroxide and metal hydride materials were  in compared to  in the company currently has a product sales backlog of  all of which is expected to be recognized as revenues in fiscal see note b notes to consolidated financial statements 
royalties decreased to  in the year ended june  from  in the year ended june  lower royalties reflect lower sales of small consumer batteries and increased production efficiencies of the company s licensees  which have resulted in lower prices 
revenues from product development agreements decreased to  in the year ended june  from  in the year ended june  the decrease was primarily a result of reduced funding from chevrontexaco for agreements with texaco ovonic hydrogen systems  for compared to  for  ovonic fuel cell which is now self funded by the company  for compared to  for and texaco ovonic battery systems  for compared to  for for advanced product development agreements 
also contributing were lower revenues from a service agreement with ovonic media  in versus  in and the completion of programs with national institute of standards and technology nist and us department of energy doe  which advanced the company s hydrogen storage and optical memory technologies zero in versus  in 
see research and development in item and note b notes to consolidated financial statements 
revenues from license and other agreements increased to  in the year ended june  from  in the year ended june  the increase primarily resulted from united solar ovonic corp 
issuing to canon inc a notice whereby united solar ovonic corp 
granted canon rights to manufacture photovoltaic products in two countries of its choice in southeast asia  excluding india and the people s republic of china 
these rights were granted in satisfaction of the outstanding obligation  plus accrued interest due canon in connection with a previous loan made to united solar ovonic corp 
by canon 
united solar ovonic corp 
recorded the satisfaction of the loan and accrued interest from canon  as revenue from license agreements in its statement of operations for the year ended june  also  ovonic battery entered into license agreements with four chinese companies for a total of  see note b notes to consolidated financial statements 
revenues from license and other agreements depend on a small number of new business arrangements  are sporadic and vary dramatically from period to period 
other revenues are primarily related to personnel  facilities and miscellaneous administrative and laboratory services provided to some of the company s joint ventures 
other revenues decreased to  in the year ended june  from  in the year ended june  this decrease was primarily due to certain adjustments which reduced revenues to reflect a change in estimate based on information received by the company pertaining to certain customers and contracts  partially offset by increases in revenues for services provided by the company s central analytical lab and production technology and machine building division to affiliates and others 
the  decrease in cost of product sales in the year ended june  resulted from the  decrease in product sales and resulted in a  loss on product sales in  compared to a  loss in the increased loss primarily relates to sales of photovoltaic products as the new manufacturing equipment for photovoltaic products was brought on line 
partially offsetting this increased loss was improved profitability on the contract to provide battery manufacturing equipment to rare earth ovonic and a smaller loss on the sales of metal hydride materials 
revenues from product development agreements funded compared to last year of the company s cost of product development 
while the company continued to spend aggressively on its core technologies  the total cost of product development decreased by  for the year ended june  however  third party funding decreased by  resulting in an increase of  in net cost of product development 
year ended june  cost of revenues from product development agreements   product development and research   total cost of product development   revenues from product development agreements   net cost of product development   the expenditures continued the development of the company s core technologies in energy storage  energy generation and information technology 
also  product development programs include work on the ovonic tm cognitive computer technology a unique multifunctional approach to computing basically different than today s computers which has the potential to accomplish many tasks in a simple manner impossible to perform on conventional computers 
it is based on the learning capability that mimics the functionality of the human brain by combining memory and processing in single sub micron device 
included in the development costs for the ovonic tm cognitive computer technology is depreciation  related to the new state of the art clean room and the related equipment 
another project  in collaboration with chevrontexaco  was the conversion of a liter internal combustion engine ice to run on hydrogen 
this converted engine is being used to power a hybrid electric vehicle a toyota prius using our ovonic tm low pressure solid hydrogen storage system 
this solid storage system can potentially be applied to hydrogen powered fuel cell vehicles and demonstrates the principles of utilizing hydrides to address the hydrogen infrastructure 
expenses were incurred in and in connection with the protection of the company s us and foreign patents covering its proprietary technologies 
total patent expenses increased to  in the year ended june  from  in the year ended june   principally due to litigation costs  in versus  in for the protection of the company s nimh battery patents and technology 
chevrontexaco has agreed to share of the battery litigation expenses  other than those related to consumer batteries  beginning in fiscal the reimbursements of  in fiscal year and  in fiscal year have been offset against the patent defense costs 
in march  ovonic battery filed suit against matsushita battery industrial co  ltd  toyota motor corporation  panasonic ev energy co  ltd 
and several related entities for infringement of patents held by ovonic battery 
in december  we and our related companies entered into an arbitration agreement with mbi and its related companies and toyota and a related company which establishes the basic terms  conditions and procedures to resume arbitration before the international chamber of commerce of the existing patent infringement disputes involving nickel metal hydride batteries used in gasoline electric hybrid vehicles and other products 
pursuant to the arbitration agreement  the existing disputes among the parties will be resolved in the arbitration and  therefore  the parties have agreed to dismiss the patent infringement litigation previously initiated by ecd s related companies in the us district court  eastern district of michigan 
operating  general and administrative expenses are allocated to product development and research expenses and to cost of revenues from research and development agreements based on a percentage of direct labor costs 
for cost of revenues from product development agreements  this allocation is limited to the amount of revenues  after direct expenses  under the applicable agreements 
the increase in operating  general and administrative expenses net of allocations from  in the year ended june  to  in the year ended june  was due primarily to reduced allocations of expenses to cost of revenues from product development agreements  partially offset by increased allocations to product development and research the following is a summary of the gross operating  general and administrative expenses and the aforementioned allocations year ended june  gross expenses   less allocations to product development and research   allocations to cost of revenues from product development agreements   amortization of negative goodwill  remaining expenses   the  decrease in other income expense  expense in compared to  income in resulted primarily from increased equity losses attributed to losses at united solar ovonic llc  in compared to  in  equity losses and the writedown of the company s investment in its innovative transportation systems  loss in and from lower interest income on the company s investments as a result of lower interest rates and a lower level of investments  in compared to  in  partially offset by increased realized gains on the sale of investments  in versus  in and because had a  write off of the company s investment in ev global
