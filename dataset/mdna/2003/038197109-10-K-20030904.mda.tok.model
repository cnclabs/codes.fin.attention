this report contains forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
our actual results may differ materially from those indicated in the forward looking statements 
please see cautionary statement regarding forward looking statements elsewhere in this report 
overview we are a leading provider of thin film deposition equipment to the flat panel display  the architectural  automotive and solar glass  and the consumer products packaging and electronics industries 
our deposition systems deposit thin films that enhance the characteristics of a base substrate  such as glass  plastic  paper or foil 
these thin films provide conductive  electronic  reflective  filter  barrier and other properties that are critical elements of our customers products 
our thin film deposition systems provide our customers with high yield and throughput  flexible modular configurations  and innovative coating and process technologies 
we also sell thin film coated glass produced by our china joint venture to the flat panel display  or fpd  industry 
our operations and financial position have been significantly affected by three corporate transactions that were implemented to advance our strategic transition from lower gross profit margin sales of coated glass to higher gross profit margin sales of thin film deposition equipment 
in  we entered into a joint venture the joint venture or china jv  with nippon sheet glass co  ltd 
to supply the low and high resolution coated glass market from a production base in suzhou  china 
the china jv began operations in april of in december  we completed the acquisition of the large area coatings  or lac  division of unaxis holding ag  or unaxis  which reported revenues of approximately million for the twelve months ended december  the lac acquisition expanded our product offering for the fpd industry 
the lac acquisition also enabled our entry into three new product markets architectural  automotive and solar glass  consumer products packaging and electronics and polyethylene terephthalate  or pet  plastic bottles 
effective september   we sold certain assets related to our contract glass coating business to information products longmont  inc since renamed optera  which is a subsidiary of magna donnelly corporation 
the assets we sold included thin film deposition equipment  inventory  office furniture and equipment  certain intellectual property rights  including know how related to the glass coating operations and certain other assets located at applied films facility in longmont  colorado 
the transaction did not affect our ownership position in the china jv or the sale of coated glass that we conduct from our hong kong office 
our china jv was formed to lower our product cost  and to operate in a closer proximity to our raw glass supply and our asian customer base 
we buy coated glass manufactured by the china jv and resell it to our customers in asia 
while our sales of coated glass products appear as revenues on our consolidated financial statements  because of the ownership structure of the china jv  the revenues and expenses of the china jv itself are not consolidated and do not appear as revenues and expenses in our financial statements 
the benefit of the lower cost structure of the china jv is captured in the net income of the china jv  of which appears as equity earnings of joint venture in our consolidated statements of operations 
the following table sets forth our net revenues net of returns and allowances by our industry segments for the last three fiscal years in thousands fiscal year ended june  june  june  thin film coated glass    thin film deposition equipment    total net revenues    the following table sets forth our net revenues as a percentage of total revenues by our industry segments for the last three fiscal years fiscal year ended june  june  june  thin film coated glass thin film deposition equipment total net revenues revenues for thin film deposition equipment are generally recognized on the percentage of completion method  measured by the percentage of the total costs incurred in relation to the estimated total costs to be incurred for each contract 
coated glass revenues and related costs are recognized when products are shipped to the customer and title transfers 
the sales cycle for thin film deposition equipment is long  involving multiple visits to and by the customer and a protracted technical sales effort 
we operate with a backlog of new and in process equipment orders 
deposition equipment backlog was million at the end of fiscal  million at the end of fiscal  and million at the end of fiscal the increase in backlog was caused by strong order volume in fiscal for all of our products 
given the average manufacturing time of our products of nine months  this increase in backlog is comprised of revenue not yet recognized from deposition equipment contracts denominated in euros  us dollars and japanese yen and  unless hedged  is subject to fluctuation depending on changes in the valuation of the foreign currencies against the dollar 
customers usually make a non refundable deposit ranging from to of the total purchase price at the time the order is placed and make progress payments during the period of manufacture 
we usually receive approximately of the purchase price in cash or letter of credit prior to shipment 
we generally ship our thin film coated glass within days of receipt of the order and therefore we do not customarily have a backlog of coated glass sales 
revenues generated from exports to customers outside of our manufacturing center in europe were in fiscal compared to of revenues for fiscal sales of products purchased from the china jv for resale to our customers are generally denominated in us dollars and sales of products manufactured in germany are generally denominated in euros 
the us dollar equivalent of gross revenues in japanese yen and euros were approximately million and million  respectively  for fiscal and million and million  respectively for fiscal currently  we engage in international currency hedging transactions to mitigate our foreign exchange exposure related to sales of certain equipment  and the effects of foreign exchange rate changes on foreign currency transactions have not been significant to date 
as of june   the us dollar equivalent of accounts receivable denominated in japanese yen and euros were approximately million and million  or approximately and respectively  of total accounts receivable 
as of june   the us dollar equivalent of accounts payable are denominated in japanese yen and euros were approximately  and million  or approximately and respectively  of total accounts payable 
results of operations the following table sets forth information derived from the consolidated statements of operations expressed as a percentage of net revenues for the periods indicated 
the amounts below have been adjusted to show the operating results of the longmont coatings division  which was sold on september   as discontinued operations 
fiscal year ended june  june  june  consolidated statement of operations data coated glass revenue equipment revenue net revenues cost of goods sold gross profit operating expenses selling  general and administrative research and development in process research and development amortization of goodwill and intangible assets operating loss interest income expense other income  net equity earnings of joint venture income loss from continuing operations before income taxes income tax benefit provision income loss from continuing operations discontinued operations results of operations  net of tax gain on sale of longmont coatings  net of tax discontinued operations  net of tax net income loss preferred stock dividends net income loss applicable to common shareholders year ended june  compared to year ended june  net revenues 
net revenues increased from million in fiscal to million in fiscal our revenue concentration remained focused on the equipment segment of our business as our revenues generated by equipment sales remained constant at of total net revenues in fiscal and fiscal net revenues from thin film deposition equipment increased from million in fiscal to million in fiscal this increased reflects orders from taiwanese display customers during fiscal compared with no order activity from taiwan during fiscal and strong orders and increased revenues from our architectural glass customers during fiscal which led to an increase in equipment backlog from million at the end of fiscal to million at the end of fiscal thin film coated glass revenues increased from million in fiscal to million in fiscal gross profit 
gross profit increased from million in fiscal to million in fiscal the increase in gross profits was due primarily to the revenue growth as gross margins were in both fiscal and fiscal selling  general and administrative 
as a result of cost management  selling  general and administrative expenses increased from million in fiscal to million in fiscal as a percentage of net revenues  selling  general and administrative expenses declined from in fiscal to in fiscal research and development 
research and development expenses increased from million in fiscal to million in fiscal in fiscal growth in research and development for display was driven by the development efforts targeted towards generation and glass sizes 
research and development expenses consist primarily of salaries  outside contractor expenses  lab expenses  and other expenses related to our ongoing product development and technology development for display  oled  solar  pet bottle process development and other research and development activities 
as a percentage of net revenues  research and development expenses were in fiscal and in fiscal amortization of other intangible assets 
in the fiscal year ended june   amortization of other intangible assets related to the lac acquisition was million 
in the fiscal year ended june   amortization of other intangible assets was million 
the increase in amortization of other intangible assets was due to the currency fluctuation between the us dollar and the euro 
the intangible assets are carried on the balance sheet of our german subsidiary and the strength of the euro during fiscal increased this amortization amount as it is reported in us dollars 
interest income 
interest income was  in fiscal and million in fiscal at the end of fiscal our average investment yield was compared to at the end of fiscal the increase in interest income was because the excess cash that was invested as a result of the equity offering that we closed in november which was invested for only part of the fiscal year as compared to a full year of investment in fiscal other income 
other income decreased from million in fiscal to million in fiscal other income includes items such as realized foreign currency transaction adjustments and royalties earned from the china jv 
we receive a royalty on all sales by the china jv  payable quarterly 
in fiscal   was reported for the reversal of unused reserves for the completion of the building in alzenau  germany 
fiscal other income arose primarily from realized currency translation 
equity earnings of joint venture 
our equity earnings of the china jv increased from  in fiscal to million in fiscal the increase in equity earnings is primarily due to the increase in the market for color stn coated glass for the cellular telephone handset market 
income tax expense 
we recorded a tax expense for fiscal of  compared to  for fiscal the income tax expense reflects the tax effect of the earnings of each operating subsidiary and their respective tax rates 
the income tax expense for fiscal was increased by a valuation allowance against the deferred tax asset 
there are several items which lower our effective tax rates in some of the countries in which we operate  such as the tax effect of the amortization of goodwill and other intangible assets in germany  tax free investment and interest income in the us  and equity earnings of the joint venture which are reported as tax free because the earnings will be reinvested in the joint venture as a permanent investment 
discontinued operations 
on september   we sold the longmont coatings division to information products for million in cash 
we accounted for the sale as a discontinuance of business and our financial statements have been restated to reflect our business without the results of the longmont coatings business 
the  loss reflected the operating results of that business for fiscal through september  the  gain was the after tax gain on the sale of assets related to discontinued operations 
year ended june  compared to year ended june  net revenues 
net revenues increased from million in fiscal to million in fiscal as a result of a full year reporting of combined company results following the lac acquisition 
our revenue concentration continued to shift to the equipment segment of our business as our revenues generated by equipment sales increased from of total net revenues in fiscal to in fiscal net revenues from thin film deposition equipment increased from million in fiscal to million in fiscal  due primarily to a full year reporting of combined company results following the lac acquisition 
however  equipment backlog declined from million at the end of fiscal to million at the end of fiscal primarily due to a weakness in bookings for new orders in the architectural and fpd portions of the equipment business during fiscal thin film coated glass revenues decreased from million in fiscal to million in fiscal this reduction resulted from lower prices which reduced our gross margins  and reduced demand for coated glass used in low end lcd displays 
gross profit 
gross profit increased from million in fiscal to million in fiscal  largely driven by the increased revenues from the equipment segment of our business as we reported a full year of combined company operations following the lac acquisition 
gross margins were in fiscal and in fiscal equipment revenues generally have higher gross margins than coated glass revenues 
gross margins were negatively affected during the year by sales of certain coated glass inventory at a market price that had moved below cost 
additionally we experienced a cost overrun on a transport system for an architectural glass equipment customer 
selling  general and administrative 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased from million in fiscal to million in fiscal this increase represents a full year of combined company results following the lac acquisition 
as a percentage of net revenues  selling  general and administrative expenses were in fiscal and in fiscal research and development 
research and development expenses increased from million in fiscal to million in fiscal this increase represents a full year of operations of the combined company following the lac acquisition 
research and development expenses consist primarily of salaries  outside contractor expenses  lab expenses  and other expenses related to our ongoing product development and technology development for oled  solar  pet bottle process development and other research and development activities 
as a percentage of net revenues  research and development expenses were in fiscal and in fiscal in process research and development 
during the fiscal year ended june   we recognized an million non recurring charge to write off in process research and development ipr d costs attributed to the lac acquisition 
several projects were included  of which the principal projects were based on the following technologies organic light emitting diodes oled for flat panel displays  barrier improvement coating technology for plastic bottles  rotatable cathodes for depositing thin films  planar cathodes for depositing thin films and thin film coating technology for solar cells used to generate electrical power 
the following table discloses by product the percentage complete at the december  acquisition date  the estimated value at the acquisition date and the estimated completion date at the time of the acquisition dollars in thousands projects complete at acquisition estimated value estimated complete date at time of acquisition oled for flat panel displays  october barrier coatings for plastic bottles  june rotatable cathode june planar cathode march thin film coating technology for solar cells  june total  the estimates used in valuing ipr d were based upon assumptions we believed to be reasonable but which are inherently uncertain and unpredictable 
risks and uncertainties associated with completing development within a reasonable period of time include the completion of all planning  designing and testing activities that are necessary to create a product that provides the functions  features and technical performance requirements suited for the market and requested by our customers 
actual results may vary from potential results 
if the ipr d projects are not completed on a timely basis  we could lose the advantage of being first to market with new technologies and achieve market share and sales that are less than what we might have achieved if such products were completed on a timely basis 
we have delivered one system using the oled technology  and that system achieved its final specification at the customer site 
we intend to continue to improve the oled technology and believe that the initial development will be concluded by the end of fiscal we expect to recognize revenues from sales of deposition equipment including oled technology in calendar and we have delivered several systems using the bestpet barrier coating technology for plastic bottles which is the first of two coatings necessary to achieve the improved barrier results 
we recently experienced a setback with the atmospheric barrier protection top coat  as our partner krones ag was not able to deliver a commercially viable coating system for the top coat 
we continue to develop the technology in our own labs in an effort to develop a process that will improve the characteristics of the barrier coatings 
we have not established a revised estimate for the completion of this technology 
we have discontinued development of the specific rotatable cathode technology projects that were outstanding at the closing and decided instead to obtain this technology from a third party 
we have also discontinued efforts to develop the specific planar cathode technology projects that were outstanding at the closing 
we are instead pursuing other planar cathode technologies 
we have delivered five systems using thin film coating technology for solar cells and continue to develop enhancements to that technology 
with these developments  we continue to position ourselves as a market leader in developing high volume manufacturing solutions for the solar cell market 
we believe that these technologies will benefit our future financial performance  although the estimated future benefits cannot be quantified with certainty and are subject to certain assumptions 
we do not believe that any of the delays we experienced in the development of the acquired ipr d technologies have materially affected our financial performance 
amortization of goodwill and other intangible assets 
in fiscal year  amortization of goodwill and other intangible assets related to the lac acquisition included million related to goodwill and million related to intangible assets 
following the adoption of statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  on july   goodwill and certain other intangible assets related to assembled workforce are no longer being amortized 
in fiscal year  amortization of other intangible assets was million 
interest income 
interest income was million in fiscal and  in fiscal because we principally used available cash and bank borrowings to fund the lac acquisition  interest income in the first half of fiscal changed to interest expense in the second half of fiscal  as we incurred interest expense under our credit facility 
the use of our bank line of credit continued until the second quarter of fiscal when we raised additional cash  through an offering of common stock  and we reduced our borrowings 
in the third and fourth quarters of fiscal  we invested the cash reserves and returned to interest income 
at the end of fiscal our average investment yield was compared to at the end of fiscal other income 
other income increased from  in fiscal to million in fiscal other income includes items such as realized foreign currency transaction adjustments and royalties earned from the china jv 
we receive a royalty on all sales by the china jv  payable quarterly 
much of the increase in fiscal was due to  for the reversal of excess reserves set aside for the completion of the required building reconditioning cost for the facility in alzenau to house all manufacturing operations in a single location and  for the recognition of a non refundable advance payment from a customer who went bankrupt which was previously recorded as a liability on our balance sheet 
equity earnings of joint venture 
our equity earnings of the china jv decreased from million in fiscal to  in fiscal the decrease in equity earnings is primarily due to the weakness in the market for cellular phones as excess handset inventories have reduced the demand for coated glass 
income tax benefit expense 
we recorded a tax expense during fiscal of 
the income tax expense for was reduced by approximately million due to the establishment of a valuation allowance on net operating loss 
the income tax benefit for fiscal of million  reflects the tax effect of goodwill and other intangible assets in germany  tax free investment and interest income  and equity earnings of the joint venture which are reported as tax free will be reinvested in the joint venture 
discontinued operations 
on september   we sold the longmont coatings division to information products for million in cash 
we accounted for the sale as a discontinuance of business and our financials have been restated to reflect our business without the results of the longmont coatings business 
the  loss reflected the operating results of that business for fiscal through september  the  gain was the after tax gain on the sale of assets related to discontinued operations 
quarterly results of operations the following table sets forth summary unaudited quarterly financial information for the eight fiscal quarters ended june  in the opinion of management  such information has been prepared on the same basis as the audited financial statements appearing elsewhere in this report and reflects all necessary adjustments consisting of only normal recurring adjustments necessary for a fair presentation of unaudited quarterly results when read in conjunction with the audited financial statements and notes thereto 
the operating results for any quarter are not necessarily indicative of results for any future period and any trends reflected in such results may not continue in the future 
our results of operations may be subject to significant quarterly variations

the volume of equipment sales is significantly dependent on our customers capital spending patterns 
during fiscal we experienced a slow down of new orders for equipment for our display coater products as well as our architectural glass coater products 
with our book to bill ratio below during each of the quarters of fiscal we experienced a drop in backlog from million at the beginning of the fiscal year to million at the end of the fiscal year the lack of new orders in these product areas reduced revenue from million in the first quarter to in the fourth quarter of fiscal  a decline of 
during fiscal  we experienced a stronger flow of orders for our systems across all of our product lines  but specifically orders for our deposition equipment products for display in taiwan and our architectural glass deposition equipment products restored a balance of revenue across our product areas and provided the momentum that resulted in growth in backlog to record levels of million at the end of fiscal from million at the end of fiscal  and growth in revenues to a high of million in the fourth quarter up from the million recognized in the first quarters of fiscal gross margin experienced some downward fluctuations during fiscal in the second and third quarters as the revenues from a low gross margin coater that was booked to secure a strategic account were recognized  and the revenue mix shifted to the lower margin architectural glass coaters 
gross margins returned to above in the fourth quarter as the revenue from a low margin coater was diminished and the revenue mix shifted to a balance from all of our products 
sg a per quarter averaged million for each of fiscal and the quarterly fluctuations resulted from restructuring costs as we reduced our workforce in longmont  colorado and from commission payments to third party sales representatives whom we use to aid in our sales coverage 
our quarterly spending in r d has been increasing as we have increased our investment in display r d 
with the roll out of generation machines in taiwan and the movement to generation and generation glass sizes we have for the first time three major new display platform sizes launching at the same time 
at the same time we have continued our investments for our other emerging technologies in oled  solar and plastic bottles 
critical accounting policies and estimates our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles gaap in the united states 
during preparation of these financial statements  we are required to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenue and expenses 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to product returns  bad debts  inventories  investments  fixed assets  intangible assets  income taxes  pension benefits and contingencies 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances 
the results form the basis of making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our financial statements 
we recognize revenues on a majority of contracts relating to the construction and sale of thin film deposition equipment using the percentage of completion method in accordance with the american institute of certified public accountants aicpa statement of position sop no 
 accounting for performance of construction type and certain production type contracts 
pursuant to sop  revenues are measured by the percentage of the total costs incurred and applied to date in relation to the estimated total costs to be incurred for each contract 
management considers costs incurred and applied to be the best available measure of progress on these contracts 
contract costs include all direct material and labor costs and those indirect costs related to contract performance 
general and administrative costs are charged to expense as incurred 
changes in performance  contract conditions and estimated profitability  including those arising from contract penalty provisions and final contract settlements  may result in revisions to costs and income and are recognized in the period in which the revisions are determined 
the company generally offers warranty coverage for equipment sales for a one year period after final installation is complete 
the company estimates the anticipated costs to be incurred during the warranty period and accrues a reserve as a percentage of revenue as revenue is recognized 
these reserves are evaluated periodically based on actual experience and anticipated activity and are adjusted if necessary 
we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
we determine the adequacy of this allowance by regularly evaluating individual customer receivables and considering a customer s financial condition  credit history  and current economic conditions 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  additional allowances may be required 
we write down our inventory for estimated obsolescence or unmarketable inventory equal to the difference between the cost of inventory and the estimated market value based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions 
if actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management  additional inventory write downs may be required 
we estimate our actual current tax exposure together with the temporary differences that have resulted from the differing treatment of items dictated by gaap versus us tax laws 
these temporary differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  we then assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income 
if we were to believe that the recovery were less likely  we would establish a valuation allowance against the deferred tax asset and charge the amount as an income tax expense in the period in which such a determination were made 
liquidity and capital resources we have funded our operations with cash generated from operations  proceeds from public offerings of our common stock and a private offering of preferred stock and bank borrowings 
cash used by operating activities was million for fiscal compared to million for fiscal as of june   we had cash and cash equivalents of approximately million  marketable securities of million and working capital of million 
as of june   we had million outstanding in a letter of credit as our portion of the security for the debt of the joint venture  compared with million outstanding in a letter of credit on june  used for the same purpose 
we are required under the terms of the china jv to provide credit support on a several basis for of the china jv s million bank indebtedness 
capital expenditures were million for fiscal and million for fiscal we anticipate capital expenditures of approximately million in fiscal our capital expenditures have consisted primarily of equipment purchases related to product development 
cash used for investing activities was million in fiscal and million in fiscal during fiscal  we purchased marketable securities of million 
we believe that our working capital and operating needs will continue to be met by cash from operations  and proceeds from the offering  which closed in november our capital requirements depend on a number of factors  including the amount and timing of orders we receive  the timing of payments received from customers  and capital requirements associated with new product introductions 
if we require additional capital  we may consider various alternatives such as additional bank financing or the public or private sale of debt or equity securities 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to raise such funds on satisfactory terms if and when such funds are needed 
contractual obligations and commercial commitments the company has the following contractual obligations and commercial commitments as of june  in thousands 
payments due by period contractual cash obligations total less than year years years after years operating leases buildings      office equipment other capital lease office equipment amount of commitment expiration per period other commercial commitments total amounts committed less than year years over years bank guarantees   other commercial commitments total commercial commitments   the operating leases primarily include leases for offices  factories and office equipment throughout our operations 
bank guarantees represents cash pledged to provide the bank guaranty for of the debt of the joint venture and other bank guarantees on cash deposits for contracts with certain customers in china 
our other commercial commitments consist of software licenses and third party service contracts 
the bank guarantees are required by our customers primarily in china ensuring the progress payments made to the company and are terminated when the contract terms are fulfilled

item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk exposure market risk represents the risk of loss that may impact our financial position  results of operations or cash flows due to adverse changes in financial market prices 
our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our investment portfolio 
we generally place our investments with high credit quality issuers and by policy are averse to principal loss and seek to protect and preserve our invested funds by limiting default risk  market risk and reinvestment risk 
as of june   our investment consisted primarily of equity securities  corporate  government and municipal bonds and money market mutual funds of million  and earned approximately million for the fiscal year  at an average interest rate of approximately 
the impact on interest income of a decrease of one percent in the average interest rate would have resulted in approximately million less interest income for the fiscal year ended june  foreign exchange exposure we are exposed to foreign exchange risk associated with accounts receivable and payable denominated in foreign currencies 
at june   we had approximately million of accounts receivable and approximately  of accounts payable denominated in japanese yen 
a one percent change in exchange rates would result in an approximate  net impact on pre tax income based on the foreign currency denominated accounts receivable and accounts payable balances at june  at june   we had approximately million of accounts receivable and approximately million of accounts payable denominated in euros 
a one percent change in exchange rates would result in an approximate  net impact on pre tax income based on the foreign currency denominated accounts receivable and accounts payable balances at june  sales of products manufactured in germany are denominated in euros  except for sales of equipment to certain japanese customers  which are denominated in japanese yen 
currently  we engage in international currency hedging transactions to mitigate our foreign exchange exposure related to sales of certain equipment  and the effects of foreign exchange rate changes on foreign currency transactions have not been significant to date 
notwithstanding the above  actual changes in interest rates and foreign exchange rates could adversely affect our operating results or financial condition 
the potential impact depends upon the magnitude of the rate change 
we are exposed to changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates primarily in our cash balance  foreign currency transactions and the operating results of our foreign affiliates 
international manufacturing operations are primarily based in germany and constitute a significant portion of our revenues and identifiable assets 
most of these identifiable assets are based in euros 
international operations result in a large volume of foreign currency commitment and transaction exposures and significant foreign currency net asset exposures 
our cash position includes amounts denominated in foreign currencies primarily euros 
the repatriation of cash balances from certain of our affiliates could have adverse consequences to the statement of operations as well as tax consequences 
however  those balances are generally available without legal restrictions to fund ordinary business operations
