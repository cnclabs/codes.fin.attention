item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview the following should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements  including the notes thereto  which are included elsewhere in this annual report 
we operate as a real estate investment trust  or reit  that principally acquires  renovates  develops and manages community and neighborhood shopping centers located predominately in high growth markets in the southern united states 
our shopping centers are primarily anchored by supermarkets or other necessity oriented retailers such as drug stores or discount retail stores 
as of december   our portfolio consisted of properties  comprising supermarket anchored shopping centers  nine drug store anchored shopping centers  other retail anchored shopping centers  one self storage facility and four retail developments  as well as non controlling interests in four unconsolidated joint ventures that own and operate commercial properties 
before giving effect to the irt merger  as of december   our existing properties were located primarily in metropolitan areas of florida and texas  contained an aggregate of million square feet of gross leasable area  and were occupied based on gross leasable area  compared to million square feet of gross leaseable area  and occupied as of december  in september  we acquired centrefund realty us corporation  or cefus  and united investors realty trust  or uirt 
as a result of these acquisitions  we acquired shopping centers and other retail properties which contained an aggregate of approximately million square feet of gross leasable area 
the acquisition of cefus has been accounted for on a push down basis and partially in a manner similar to a pooling of interests 
see the discussion of this policy in the section below entitled significant accounting policies and estimates 
the acquisition of uirt was accounted for using the purchase method of accounting and the results of uirt are included in our consolidated financial statements from the date we acquired it 
during  we sold an office building  an apartment complex  one acre parcel of undeveloped land and six shopping centers that no longer meet our investment criteria 
we also acquired six shopping centers  two free standing drugstores and three parcels of undeveloped land totaling approximately acres 
on february   we completed our acquisition of irt property company  or irt  by statutory merger 
as a result of the merger  we acquired properties encompassing approximately million square feet of gross leaseable area and including supermarket anchored shopping centers  two drug store anchored shopping center  other retail anchored shopping centers an industrial property and two development projects 
in connection with the merger  we paid aggregate cash consideration of approximately million  issued approximately million shares of our common stock valued at approximately million and assumed approximately million of mortgages  unsecured indebtedness and other liabilities  including million of irt s senior unsecured indebtedness 
the merger is being accounted for as a purchase as such term is used under accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
accordingly  irt s consolidated results of operations will be included in our consolidated results of operations from the closing of the merger and our consolidated financial statements for fiscal year and earlier periods reported upon in this annual report do not reflect the effects of the merger 
as a result of our recently completed merger with irt property company  our property portfolio  as of march   consists of properties  comprising supermarket anchored shopping centers  nine drug store anchored shopping centers  other retail anchored shopping centers  one self storage facility  one industrial and five retail developments  as well as non controlling interests in four unconsolidated joint ventures that own and operate commercial properties 
these properties are located in states in the southern united states and contain an aggregate of million square feet of gross leasable area  or gla 
we intend to continue to expand our business by acquiring and developing additional neighborhood and community shopping centers in the near future primarily through a combination of individual property acquisitions  development of new properties  property portfolio purchases and acquisitions of other reits and real estate companies 
critical accounting policies and estimates management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations provides additional information related to our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
on an ongoing basis  management evaluates and if necessary  adjusts its estimates and judgments  including those related to real estate and development assets  revenue recognition in conjunction with providing development  leasing and management services and equity in earnings of unconsolidated joint ventures 
management believes that the following critical accounting policies  among others  affect its more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
real estate development assets 
we capitalize acquisition and construction costs  property taxes  interest and other miscellaneous costs that are directly identifiable with a project  from pre acquisition until the time that construction is complete and the development is ready for its intended use  in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
and sfas no 
we allocate the capitalized project costs to the various components of the project based on the components relative fair value 
our cost allocation method requires the use of management estimates regarding the fair market value of each project component 
management bases its estimates on current market appraisals  comparable sales  existing sale and purchase contracts  historical experience  and various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the fair market value of real estate assets 
actual results may differ from these estimates and anticipated returns on a project  as well as the gain or loss on disposition of the individual project components  could vary significantly from estimated amounts 
management reviews long lived assets used in operations for impairment when there is an event or change in circumstances that indicates that the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable and the future undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by the asset are less than its carrying amount 
if such asset is considered to be impaired  we record impairment losses and reduce the carrying amount of the impaired asset to an amount that reflects the fair value of the asset at the time impairment is evident 
our impairment review process relies on management s judgment regarding the indicators of impairment  the remaining life of the asset used to generate the asset s undiscounted cash flows  and the fair value of the asset at a particular point in time 
management uses historical experience  current market appraisals and various other assumptions to form the basis for making judgments about the impairment of real estate assets 
under different assumptions or conditions  the asset impairment analysis may yield a different outcome  which would alter the ultimate return on our assets  as well as the gain or loss on the eventual disposition of the asset 
revenue recognition 
we  as lessor  retain substantially all the risks and benefits of property ownership and account for our leases as operating leases 
revenue from percentage rent is recognized when tenants reported sales have reached certain levels specified in the respective leases 
recoveries from tenants for real estate taxes and other operating expenses are recognized as revenue in the period when the applicable costs are incurred 
investments in unconsolidated joint ventures 
we do not consider ourselves to be in control of joint ventures when major business decisions require the approval of at least one other managing equity owner 
accordingly  we account for our joint ventures in which we do not retain unilateral control under the equity method 
we calculate the equity in income or loss earned from our unconsolidated joint ventures based on each equity owners economic ownership  which is estimated based on anticipated stabilized cash flows as they would be allocated to each equity owner based on how cash flow is distributed 
generally  under the terms of the respective joint venture agreements  net ordinary cash flow is distributed to each equity owner in accordance with such owner s equity ownership percentages 
accounting for stock options 
we apply the intrinsic value method as prescribed by accounting principles board opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  and related interpretations in measuring stock based compensation  including options 
accordingly  no compensation expense has been recognized for options granted under our compensation plan as no grants were made at less than market value 
in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  compensation expense would be recognized based upon the fair value of the award at the grant date 
results of operations we derive substantially all of our revenues from rents received from tenants under existing leases on each of our properties 
these revenues include fixed rents  recoveries of expenses that we have incurred and which we pass through to the individual tenants and percentage rents that are based on specified percentages of tenants revenues  in each case as provided in the particular leases 
our primary cash expenses consist of our property operating expenses  which include real estate taxes  repairs and maintenance  payroll  insurance  utilities and other expenses  general and administrative expenses  which include payroll  office expenses  professional fees and other administrative expenses  and interest expense  primarily on mortgage indebtedness 
in addition  we incur substantial non cash charges for depreciation and amortization on our properties 
we also capitalize certain expenses  such as taxes and interest  incurred in respect of property under development or redevelopment until the property is ready for its intended use 
year ended december  compared to year ended december  total revenues increased by million  or  to million for the year ended december  from million in this increase was primarily due to the increase in revenue of million relating to the properties acquired in the uirt transaction in september  an increase of million as a result of the acquisitions of six shopping centers and two drugstores  and an increase in same property revenues of million  or  to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  primarily as a result of higher rental rates and occupancy

in addition  interest increased million from the closing of four new loans and increased  from higher average balances on the revolving credit facilities 
these increases were partially offset by the repayment of nine loans which reduced interest by million  an increase in capitalized interest of  related to increased development activity  lower interest rates on the variable rate mortgages which reduced interest incurred by million and reduced interest on all other loans of  rental property depreciation and amortization increased by million  or  to million for the year ended december  from million for this increase was primarily due to an increase in depreciation and amortization of million relating to the acquisition of uirt and a  increase related to property acquisitions and capital improvements 
general and administrative expenses increased by million  or  to million for the year ended december  from million for the primary reason for the increase in general and administrative expenses relates to our growth  as reflected by an increase in compensation and employee related expenses of million  an increase in professional fees of  the write off of previously capitalized pre acquisition due diligence costs for projects that did not materialize totaling  an increase in public relations costs of  and an increase in all other expenses of  during  we recorded the following related to the acquisition of cefus minority interest of million  a loss on sale of real estate of  and a current and deferred income tax benefit of  which we no longer record because cefus operated as a c corporation rather than as a reit 
in addition  we prepaid a mortgage and incurred a loss on early debt extinguishment of million 
during  we settled an outstanding mortgage note payable at less than fair value and recognized a gain on early debt extinguishment of million 
in addition  we settled a lawsuit which was related to one of the properties acquired from uirt for million  including legal fees 
all other income loss items primarily relate to earnings from joint ventures 
operating income from properties sold during is reflected as discontinued operations of million for the year ended december  and million for the year ended december  the sale of these properties produced a gain of million 
as a result of the foregoing  net income increased by million  or  to million for the year ended december  compared to million for year ended december  compared to year ended december  total revenues increased by million  or  to million for the year ended december  from million in this increase was primarily due to an increase in revenues of million resulting from the consolidation of the results of cefus for all of compared to the period from august  to december  for the prior year and an additional million of revenues from the acquisition of uirt in september in addition  revenues increased by million for the year ended december  compared to as a result of our acquisition of two shopping centers and the completion of development projects in and the latter part of same property revenues increased by million  or  to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  as a result of higher rental rates and the completion of additions to some of our properties 
finally  investment revenue increased by  and management fees  consisting primarily of real estate services provided to third parties  increased by  for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december   partially offset by reduction of termination fees of  property operating expenses increased by million  or  to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  the increase in property operating expenses was primarily the result of million of increased operating expenses from the consolidation of cefus for all of compared to the shorter period in and million of operating expenses for uirt from its acquisition date 
in addition  operating expenses increased by  for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  as a result of our acquisition of two shopping centers and the completion of development projects in and the latter part of same property operating expenses increased by  or  to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  as a result of higher operating costs and the completion of additions to some of our properties 
finally  property management expenses increased by million for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  as a result of managing a substantially larger portfolio of properties  of which million was due to an increase in employee salaries and benefits 
interest expense increased by million  or  to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  amortization of deferred financing fees increased by  or  to million for the year ended december  from  in the net increase in interest expense was primarily due to an increase in interest expense of million on indebtedness assumed in connection with the acquisition of cefus and million of interest expense on indebtedness assumed in connection with the acquisition of uirt 
in addition  interest expense increased for the year ended december  as compared to the year ended december  as a result of increased mortgage interest of million from the assumption of two loans  the closing of two new loans and an increase of  in interest on convertible partnership units and decreased capitalized interest expense of  these increased interest expenses were partially offset by reductions of  due to decreased borrowing under our revolving credit facility with city national bank of florida 
rental property depreciation and amortization expense increased by million  or  to million for the year ended december   from million for the year ended december  the increase resulted primarily from depreciation and amortization expenses attributable to cefus and uirt in the amounts of million and  respectively  and  attributable to our acquisition of new properties and completion of new development 
general and administrative expenses increased by  or  to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  the increase was primarily the product of our growth 
included in these expenses  compensation expenses increased by  directors fees increased by  professional fees increased by  general and administrative costs increased by  and all other costs increased  minority interest in cefus increased by million to million for the year ended december  from  for the year ended december  this increase was a result of the consolidation of cefus for the period from january to september   subject to a minority interest as described above  compared to the shorter period in in addition  we recorded loss on extinguishment of debt of million for the year ended december  as a result of the payment of a prepayment penalty in connection with the prepayment of a loan secured by one of our properties 
the increase in equity in income of unconsolidated subsidiaries of  for the year ended december  relates primarily to our interest in the four joint ventures acquired in the cefus acquisition and is attributable to the inclusion of cefus s results for the full year in  as well as commencement of operations at those properties upon completion of development 
the income from depreciable rental properties sold and or held for sale as of december  is reflected as discontinued operations for the year ended december  and as of december   there were nine properties being reported in discontinued operations producing income from discontinued operations of million for and  in as a result of the foregoing  net income increased by million  or  to million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  liquidity and capital resources we anticipate that cash generated from operating activities will provide the necessary funds on a short term basis for our operating expenses  interest expense  scheduled payments on outstanding indebtedness  recurring capital expenditures necessary to properly maintain the shopping centers and distributions to stockholders 
during  we generated cash from operations of million  reflecting our net income of million plus an add back for non cash deductions to income  the most significant of which were depreciation and amortization of million  partially offset by gain on debt extinguishment of million and a gain on the disposal of real estate of million 
in addition  operating cash benefited from  among other items  a million increase in accounts payable and accrued expenses and  of other liabilities  partially offset by an increase in accounts and other receivables and other assets of million 
we used million of cash in investing activities  reflecting million used for acquisitions of properties  payment of leasing costs of million and escrowed funds on the sale of properties to utilize tax deferred exchanges for million 
these uses were partially offset by proceeds from the disposal of properties of million  receipt of  in distributions received from joint ventures  proceeds from repayments of notes receivable of million and  of proceeds from the sale of securities available for sale 
we generated million in cash from financing activities reflecting million in net proceeds from issuance of common stock 
this was partially offset by million in repayments in excess of mortgage note borrowings  million in net repayments on revolving credit facilities  million in payments of financing fees and million in cash dividends to shareholders 
during  we incurred cash payments for interest  net of capitalized interest  of million 
capitalized interest  which includes interest for development properties and additions and renovations to rental properties  totaled million 
we expect to meet long term liquidity requirements for maturing debt  non recurring capital expenditures and acquisition  renovation and development of shopping centers from excess cash generated from operating activities  working capital reserves  additional borrowings under our existing credit facilities  long term secured and unsecured indebtedness and through the issuance of additional equity or debt securities in the private or public markets 
our total mortgage notes payable at december  and consisted of the following in thousands mortgage notes payable fixed rate mortgage loans   variable rate mortgage loans   total mortgage notes payable   each of these loans is secured by a mortgage on one or more of our properties 
as of december   the percentage of the total real estate cost of our properties that was encumbered by debt was 
for a more complete description of our mortgage indebtedness  see mortgage indebtedness below 
the merger with irt has increased our outstanding indebtedness  as of december   as follows o mortgage notes payable of approximately million  bearing interest at an effective rate of o senior unsecured debt of million  bearing interest at rates ranging from to o revolving credit facility of million  bearing interest at libor plus certain of the mortgages on the merged company properties involving an aggregate principal amount of approximately million contain prohibitions on transfers of ownership which may have been violated by our previous issuances of common stock or in connection with past acquisitions and may be violated by transactions involving our capital stock in the future 
if a violation were established  it could serve as a basis for a lender to accelerate amounts due under the affected mortgage 
we are in the process of obtaining the necessary consents from the lenders 
based on discussions with various lenders to date  current credit market conditions and other factors  we believe that such consents will be obtained or that the mortgages will not be accelerated 
accordingly  we believe that the ultimate outcome of this matter will not have a material adverse impact on our results of operations  financial condition or cash flows 
on february  we entered into a million unsecured revolving credit facility with a group of banks for which wells fargo bank  national association is the sole lead arranger and administrative agent 
this facility bears interest at our option at i libor plus to  depending on the credit ratings of our senior unsecured long term indebtedness or ii at the greater of x wells fargo s prime rate and y the federal funds rate plus 
the facility also includes a competitive bid option which allows us to conduct auctions among the participating banks for borrowings in an amount not to exceed million  a million swing line facility for short term borrowings and a million letter of credit commitment 
the facility expires february  with a one year extension option 
in addition  the facility contains customary covenants  including financial covenants regarding debt levels  total liabilities  interest coverage  ebitda levels  unencumbered properties  permitted investments and others 
the facility also prohibits stockholder distributions in excess of of funds from operations calculated at the end of each fiscal quarter for the four fiscal quarters then ending 
notwithstanding this limitation  we can make stockholder distributions to avoid income taxes on asset sales 
if a default under the facility exists  our ability to pay dividends would be limited to the amount necessary to maintain our status as a reit unless the default is a payment default or bankruptcy event in which case we would be prohibited from paying any dividends 
the facility is guaranteed by several of our wholly owned subsidiaries 
on february   the date of the irt merger  we borrowed million to fund million for the cash portion of the irt merger with the remaining funds prepaying a variable rate mortgage facility  both the bank leumi and our prior secured wells fargo revolving credit facilities  various other mortgage loans and transaction costs related to the irt merger 
as a result of our merger with irt  we assumed irt s obligations relating to million principal amount of senior notes  bearing interest at fixed annual interest rates ranging from to and maturing between and one of the notes interest rate is dependent on our senior unsecured debt rating 
these notes have also been guaranteed by several of our wholly owned subsidiaries 
we have debt and other liabilities outstanding after the merger with irt in the aggregate amount of approximately million 
as of december   we had a million credit agreement secured by four properties with city national bank of florida 
in february  this credit agreement was restructured to a million unsecured credit agreement in connection with the execution of the new wells fargo facility 
as of december   we had million revolving line of credit with bank leumi le israel bm in february  this credit facility was retired with execution of the new wells fargo facility 
as of december   we had a variable rate revolving credit facility with wells fargo under which we could borrow up to million against a borrowing base of six properties pledged to secure the facility 
in february  this credit facility was retired with the execution of the new wells fargo facility 
as of december   we had accounts payable and accrued expenses outstanding of approximately million relating to increased operating costs  real estate taxes and construction payables 
our debt level could subject us to various risks  including the risk that our cash flow will be insufficient to meet required payments of principal and interest  and the risk that the resulting reduced financial flexibility could inhibit our ability to develop or improve our rental properties  withstand downturns in our rental income or take advantage of business opportunities 
in addition  because we currently anticipate that only a small portion of the principal of our indebtedness will be repaid prior to maturity  it is expected that it will be necessary to refinance the majority of our debt 
accordingly  there is a risk that such indebtedness will not be able to be refinanced or that the terms of any refinancing will not be as favorable as the terms of our current indebtedness 
we have entered into a ground lease with a drug store and expect to commence development in early of a  square foot drug store anchored shopping center on a parcel of land we already own at the northeast corner of sw th avenue and coral way in miami dade county  florida at a total cost of million 
development of phase three of the shops at skylake  totaling approximately  square feet is anticipated to be completed in late at an estimated cost of approximately million 
development of  square feet of retail space on our four acre site at port st 
lucie  florida  adjacent to our cashmere corners retail center  at a cost of million is expected to be completed in late in addition  as of december   in order to complete the construction of other in progress development projects  we have committed to fund construction costs of million 
these obligations  comprise principally of construction contracts and are generally due as the work is performed 
we expect to fund the costs of the development projects from cash flow from operations  borrowings under our various revolving credit facilities and other sources of cash 
we believe  based on currently proposed plans and assumptions relating to our operations  that our existing financial arrangements  together with cash flows from operations  will be sufficient to satisfy our cash requirements for a period of at least twelve months 
in the event that our plans change  our assumptions change or prove to be inaccurate or cash flows from operations or amounts available under existing financing arrangements prove to be insufficient to fund our expansion and development efforts or to the extent we discover suitable acquisition targets the purchase price of which exceed our existing liquidity  we would be required to seek additional sources of financing 
there can be no assurance that any additional financing will be available on acceptable terms  or at all and any equity financing could be dilutive to existing shareholders 
if adequate funds are not available  our business operations could be materially adversely affected 
we believe that we qualify and intend to qualify as a reit under the internal revenue code 
as a reit  we are allowed to reduce taxable income by all or a portion of our distributions to stockholders 
as distributions have exceeded taxable income  no provision for federal income taxes has been made 
while we intend to continue to pay dividends to our stockholders  we also will reserve such amounts of cash flow  as we consider necessary for the proper maintenance and improvement of our real estate  while still maintaining our qualification as a reit

the transitional disclosure requirements will take effect almost immediately and are required for all financial statements initially issued after january  the consolidated provisions of fin are effective immediately for variable interests in vies created after january  for variable interests in vies created before february   the provisions of fin are effective for the first interim period beginning after june  the adoption of fin is not expected to have a material impact on our financial statements 
environmental matters we are subject to numerous environmental laws and regulations 
the operation of dry cleaning facilities at our shopping centers is the principal environmental concern 
we believe that the tenants who operate these facilities do so in accordance with current laws and regulations and we have established procedures to monitor their operations 
additionally  we use all legal means to cause tenants to remove dry cleaning plants from our shopping centers 
where available  we have applied and been accepted into state sponsored environmental programs 
we have also placed environmental insurance on specific properties with known contamination in order to mitigate our environmental risk 
we believe that the ultimate disposition of currently known environmental matters will not have a material effect on our financial position  liquidity or operations 
inflation and recession considerations most of our leases contain provisions designed to partially mitigate the adverse impact of inflation 
most of our leases require the tenant to pay its share of operating expenses  including common area maintenance  real estate taxes and insurance  thereby reducing our exposure to increases in costs and operating expenses resulting from inflation 
a small portion of our leases also include clauses enabling us to receive percentage rents based on a tenant s gross sales above predetermined levels  which sales generally increase as prices rise  or escalation clauses which are typically related to increases in the consumer price index or similar inflation indices 
our financial results are affected by general economic conditions in the markets in which our properties are located 
an economic recession  or other adverse changes in general or local economic conditions  could result in the inability of some of our existing tenants to meet their lease obligations and could otherwise adversely affect our ability to attract or retain tenants 
supermarkets  drugstores and other anchor tenants that offer day to day necessities rather than luxury items anchor our existing properties 
these types of tenants  in our experience  generally maintain more consistent sales performance during periods of adverse economic conditions 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the primary market risk to which we have exposure is interest rate risk 
changes in interest rates can affect our net income and cash flows 
as changes in market conditions occur  interest rates can either increase or decrease  and interest expense from the variable component of our debt balances will move in the same direction 
with respect to our investment portfolio  changes in interest rates generally do not affect our interest income as our investments are predominantly in equity securities 
in addition  most of our mortgage notes payable currently have fixed interest rates and therefore changes in interest rates generally do not have a material effect on our operations 
in addition  each of our revolving credit facilities have a variable rate component and we may enter into additional variable rate facilities in the future 
therefore  increases in interest rates could in the future have a materially adverse impact on our results of operations and cash flows 
moreover  increases in long term real estate mortgage rates that may occur over a decade or more may decrease the overall value of real estate 
we estimate the fair value of our long term  fixed rate mortgage loans generally using discounted cash flow analysis based on current borrowing rates for similar types of debt 
at december   the fair value of the fixed rate mortgage notes payable was estimated to be approximately million compared to a carrying value amount of approximately million 
if the weighted average interest rate on our fixed rate debt at december  were basis points higher or lower  the fair market value would be approximately million and approximately million  respectively 
if the weighted average interest rate on our variable rate debt at december  were basis points higher or lower  annual interest expense would be increased or decreased by approximately  our objective in managing our exposure to interest rate changes is to limit the impact of interest rate changes on earnings and cash flows 
we may use a variety of financial instruments to reduce our interest rate risk  including interest rate swap agreements whereby we exchange our variable interest costs on a defined amount of principal for another party s obligation to pay fixed interest on the same amount of principal  or interest rate caps  which will set a ceiling on the maximum variable interest rate we will incur on the amount of debt subject to the cap and for the time period specified in the interest rate cap 
as of december   we have no market risk sensitive instruments 
off balance sheet commitments we have off balance sheet joint ventures and other unconsolidated arrangements with varying structures 
as of december   the company s off balance sheet commitments were as follows o we have has aggregate revolving credit facilities available of million of which million was outstanding as of december  o letters of credit totaling million have been provided as security for certain performance criteria 
o the company s unconsolidated joint ventures have aggregate outstanding indebtedness of approximately million  of which the company has guaranteed a million loan for one of the unconsolidated joint ventures 
the company s investment in these joint ventures is million 
o the company has committed to fund the construction costs of million in order to complete our started development projects 
these obligations  comprise principally of construction contracts  are generally due as the work is performed and are expected to be financed by the available credit facilities 
for more information regarding our off balance sheet joint ventures and other unconsolidated arrangements please refer to note of our consolidated financial statements contained in this annual report and incorporated herein by reference
