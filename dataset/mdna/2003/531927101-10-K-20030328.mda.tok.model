item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion of operations and financial condition of lifecell should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and notes thereto included elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
special note certain statements set forth below constitute forward looking statements made pursuant to the safe harbor provisions of the private securities litigation reform act of see business special note regarding forward looking statements and business risk factors 
in the following discussions  most percentages and dollar amounts have been rounded to aid the presentation 
as a result  all such figures are approximations 
general and background we develop and market biological products for the repair and replacement of damaged or inadequate human tissue in numerous different clinical applications 
our proprietary tissue matrix technology removes cells from the tissue and preserves the tissue without damaging the essential biochemical and structural components necessary for normal tissue regeneration 
we currently market four proprietary human tissue based products alloderm r for plastic reconstructive  burn and periodontal procedures  cymetra r  a version of alloderm in particulate form for non surgical correction of soft tissue defects  repliform r for urologic and gynecologic procedures  and graft jacket tm  an acellular periosteum replacement graft 
we also distribute cryopreserved allograft skin for use as a temporary dressing in the treatment of burns and we are the exclusive marketing agent for the smartprep tm platelet concentration system in the united states to ear  nose and throat ent  plastic reconstructive and general surgeons in hospitals 
our development programs include the potential application of our tissue matrix technology to vascular  nerve and orthopedic tissues  investigation of human tissues as carriers for therapeutics  thrombosol tm  a formulation for extended storage of platelets and technologies to enhance the storage of red blood cells for transfusion 
critical accounting policies we have identified the policies below as critical to the understanding of our financial statements 
the application of these polices requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the valuation of assets and expenses during the reporting period 
there can be no assurance that actual results will not differ from these estimates 
the impact and any associated risks related to these policies on our business operations are discussed below 
for a detailed discussion on the application of these and other accounting policies  including the impact of recent accounting pronouncement  see note in the notes to the financial statements in part iv  item 
of this annual report on form k 
revenue recognition 
we recognize revenue for product sales when title to products and risk of loss are transferred to customers 
additional conditions for recognition of revenue are that collection of sales proceeds is reasonably assured and we have no further performance obligations 
for products held by our sales agents  boston scientific corporation and omp  inc we recognize revenue when the products are delivered to the third party customer  as this is when title and risk of loss to the product transfers 
amounts billed to customers for shipping and handling are included in revenue at the time the related product revenue is recognized 
research grant revenues are recognized as the work is performed  unless we have continuing performance obligations  in which case revenue is recognized upon the satisfaction of such obligations 
accounts receivable 
we maintain an allowance for estimated bad debt losses on our accounts receivable based upon our historical experience and any specific customer collection issues that we have identified 
in addition  we monitor collections and payments from our customers and perform credit evaluations of their financial condition 
since our accounts receivable are not concentrated within a relatively few number of customers  we believe that a significant change in the liquidity or financial position of any one customer would not have a material adverse impact on the collectability of our accounts receivable and therefore our future operating results 
while bad debt losses depend to a large degree on future economic conditions affecting our customers  we do not anticipate significant bad debt losses in inventories 
we value our inventory at the lower of cost or market  with cost being determined on a first in  first out basis 
we record a provision for excess and obsolete inventory based primarily on inventory quantities on hand  our historical product sales  and estimated forecast of future product demand and production requirements 
although we believe that our current inventory reserves are adequate  any significant change in demand or technological developments could have a significant impact on the value of our inventory and therefore our future operating results 
income taxes 
we apply an asset and liability approach to accounting for income taxes 
deferred tax liabilities and assets are recognized for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse 
the recoverability of deferred tax assets is dependent upon our assessment of whether it is more likely than not that sufficient future taxable income will be generated to utilize the deferred tax asset 
in the event we determine that future taxable income will not be sufficient to utilize the deferred tax asset  a valuation allowance is recorded 
at december   we have provided for a full valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets  which principally relate to federal and state net operating loss and credit carryforwards 
in the event we determine that it is more likely than not that some or all of these assets will be realized  the reversal of this valuation allowance would lead to a significant tax benefit being recorded for financial reporting purposes in the period of reversal 
results of operations years ended december  and total revenues for the year ended december  increased to million compared to million in the increase was principally attributable to a increase in product revenues to million in the current year as compared to million in the prior year 
the increase in product revenues was largely due to increased demand for our alloderm products 
alloderm revenues increased to million in the year ended december  compared to million in the same period in repliform revenues increased to million in the year ended december  compared to million for the same period in cymetra revenues decreased to million in compared to million in for the year ended december   our sales and marketing agents and distributors generated of our total product revenues 
boston scientific corporation is our exclusive worldwide sales and marketing representative for repliform for use in the urology and gynecology markets and omp  inc is our exclusive sales and marketing representative for cymetra to office based dermatologists and plastic surgeons 
during  sales of our products through boston scientific corporation and omp  inc represented and  respectively  of our total product revenues compared to and  respectively  in both boston scientific and omp are paid agency fees based on the amount of product revenues they generate for us 
such fees are recorded as selling and marketing expenses 
no other individual distributor generated more than of our total product revenues in total revenues were also favorably impacted by a increase in research grant revenues  which totaled million in compared to million in this increase was primarily due to an increase in research spending on projects funded by research grants  since research grant revenues are recognized as qualified expenses are incurred 
during  we were awarded grants from the department of defense and the national institute of health totaling  as of december   approximately million of approved grant funding was available to fund future research and development expenses through cost of products sold for the year ended december  was million  or of product revenues  compared to cost of products sold of million  or for the same period in the cost of products sold decreased as a percentage of product revenues due to efficiencies realized in our processing operation as a result of volume increases and process improvements 
total research and development expenses increased to million in compared to million in the increase was primarily associated with higher spending on research focused on the potential application of our tissue matrix technology to vascular tissue  which is funded through a grant from the department of defense  and to increased spending on other product development projects 
general and administrative expenses increased to million in compared to million in the increase was primarily the result of increased investor relations activities  higher recruiting expenses and payroll related costs 
selling and marketing expenses increased to million in compared to million in the same period in the increase in was primarily attributable to higher selling expense associated with the increase in product revenues 
selling and marketing expenses decreased as a percentage of product revenues from in to in interest and other income expense  net decreased  in compared to the net decrease was due to a  decrease in interest expense  resulting from a decrease in debt outstanding  partially offset by a  decline in interest income resulting from lower average interest rates during the period 
in the year ended december   we recorded a net tax benefit of  consisting of a provision for state income taxes of  offset by proceeds of  from the sale of state net operating losses 
the sale was made through the technology business tax certificate program sponsored by the new jersey economic development authority 
no federal provision for income taxes has been recorded as we intend to utilize net operating loss carryforwards to offset our estimated federal tax liability of  we were unable to utilize net operating loss carryforwards to offset our state tax liability in because the state of new jersey enacted tax legislation during the year suspending the use of loss carryforwards to offset taxable income in and we have provided a full valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets based on the uncertainty as to whether it is more likely than not that we will realize future benefit of these assets 
net income for the year ended december  was million  representing a million improvement from the million loss for the same period in the improvement in net income in was principally due to the positive contribution from higher product revenues 
preferred stock and deemed dividends totaled million for the year ended december  and consisted of preferred stock dividends  which ceased accruing september   of  and a non cash deemed dividend of million recorded in connection with issuance of additional shares and the repricing of warrants  pursuant to the terms of an investment made in basic net income per common share increased to and diluted net income per common share increased to in the year ended december   compared to basic and diluted per share net loss in the same period in the net loss per common share in included per share attributable to dividends on preferred stock and per share attributable to the deemed dividend 
years ended december  and total revenues for the year ended december  increased to million compared to million in the increase was principally attributable to a increase in product revenues to million in the current year as compared to million in the prior year 
the increase in product revenues was largely due to increased demand for repliform and alloderm 
repliform revenues increased to million in the year ended december  compared to million for the same period in alloderm revenues increased to million in the year ended december  compared to million in the same period in cymetra revenues contributed million in compared to million in cymetra unit demand increased slightly  however revenues decreased due to a reduction in the average per unit selling price 
during the year ended december   sales of our products generated through boston scientific corporation and omp  inc represented and  respectively  of our total product revenues  compared to and  respectively  for the same period in total revenue was also impacted by a decrease in research grant revenues  which totaled million in compared to million in this decrease was primarily due to a decrease in research spending on projects funded by research grants 
cost of products sold for the year ended december  was million  or of product revenues  compared to cost of products sold of million  or for the same period in the cost of products sold as a percentage of sales remained unchanged for the year 
certain efficiencies realized in manufacturing cost  as a result of volume increases and process improvements  were offset by a reduction in the average selling price of cymetra 
total research and development expenses decreased to million in compared to million in the decrease was due primarily to a reduction in expenditures for cymetra product development related to the product launch in general and administrative expenses decreased to million in compared to million in general and administrative expenses were higher in because they included recruiting expenses and other employee related costs associated with hiring new employees in conjunction with our relocation from texas to new jersey and settlement costs and legal fees associated with the settlement of litigation with inamed corporation 
selling and marketing expenses increased to million in compared to million in the same period in the increase in compared to was primarily attributable to an increase in agency fees earned by our independent marketing agents for the distribution of repliform and cymetra  partially offset by a reduction in promotion expenses 
interest and other income expense  net increased  in compared to the net increase was due to a  increase in interest expense and a  decline in interest income resulting from lower average interest rates during the period 
the net loss for the year ended december  decreased to million compared to million in the decrease in net loss in compared to was principally due to higher product revenues and the decrease in general and administrative expenses discussed above 
preferred stock and deemed dividends increased to million for the year ended december  compared to million in preferred stock dividends decreased in to  from  as series b preferred stockholders were entitled to receive dividends through september  in  we recorded a non cash deemed dividend of million in connection with the issuance of additional shares and repricing of warrants  pursuant to the terms of an investment made in liquidity and capital resources at december   we had cash  cash equivalents and short term investments of million compared to million at the end of working capital increased to million at december  from million at december  the increase resulted principally from increases in cash and investments  receivables and inventories  partially offset by increases in accounts payable and accrued liabilities 
inventories and accounts payable increased as a result of planned higher receipts of tissue from our organ procurement organizations and tissue banks 
accounts receivable increased as a result of higher sales in the fourth quarter of compared to the same period in accrued liabilities increased as a result of higher fees owed to our sales agents based on revenue generated and higher employee compensation accruals as a result of improved company performance 
our operating activities generated net cash of million in compared to net cash used of million for the same period in the increase in resulted primarily from higher net income  partly offset by increases in inventories and accounts receivable as discussed above 
additionally  in  we used million in cash to reduce accounts payable and accrued liabilities 
our investing activities  which consist principally of purchases of capital equipment in  used net cash of  for the year ended december  compared to  for the same period in in  we expect to invest approximately million for the purchase of capital equipment principally related to the implementation of an enterprise resource planning erp system and manufacturing equipment to support anticipated revenue growth 
our financing activities used million in for principal payments on long term debt 
for the year ended december  our financing activities provided net cash of million as the result of the receipt of million from the proceeds of a private placement of common stock  net of million used to reduce notes payable and long term debt 
at december   we had an aggregate of  outstanding under our borrowing arrangements compared to million outstanding at december  in january  we secured a million credit facility through a financial institution 
the credit facility consists of a million revolving line of credit due in january and an equipment line for up to an additional million due in january the credit facility is collateralized by our accounts receivable  inventory  intellectual property  intangible and fixed assets 
the agreement contains certain financial covenants and a subjective acceleration clause 
the revolving line of credit bears interest at the bank prime rate plus and the equipment term note bears interest at the bank prime rate plus and requires equal monthly principal payments over a twenty four month term 
in january  we received proceeds of  under the equipment line portion of the credit facility and used such proceeds to repay all of our debt and accrued interest outstanding at december  the balance of the equipment line is available to fund equipment purchases through march the following table reflects a summary of our contractual cash obligations as of december   after giving effect to the refinancing of our outstanding indebtedness payments due by period less than one total year to years to years after years long term debt    operating leases      total contractual cash obligations      under our debt agreements  the maturity of our outstanding debt could be accelerated if we do not maintain certain covenants 
we believe that our current cash resources together with anticipated product revenues  committed research and development grant funding and remaining availability under our credit facility will be sufficient to finance our planned operations  research and development programs and fixed asset requirements in the foreseeable future 
however  there can be no assurance that such sources of funds will be sufficient to meet our long term needs and as a result  we may need additional funding 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain additional funding from either debt or equity financing  collaborative arrangements or other sources on terms acceptable to us  or at all 
any additional equity financing may be dilutive to stockholders  and debt financing  if available  may involve significant restrictive covenants 
collaborative arrangements  if necessary to raise additional funds  may require us to relinquish our rights to certain of our technologies  products or marketing territories 
it is possible that our results of operations or liquidity and capital resources could be adversely affected by the ultimate outcome of pending litigation or as a result of the cost of contesting such legal action 
for a discussion of these matters see note of notes to financial statements and part i  item legal proceedings 
at december   there were  shares of common stock outstanding that are subject to redemption by us under certain conditions 
these shares were issued to one investor in a private placement in november pursuant to the terms of the purchase agreement  if we do not maintain a listing on or quotation of our shares of common stock on a us stock exchange or market system we will be required to redeem such shares at per share or  in the aggregate 
since our inception in through we incurred net losses and therefore have not been subject to federal income taxes 
as of december   we had net operating loss nol and research and development tax credit carryforwards for federal income tax purposes of million and million  respectively  available to reduce future federal income taxes 
federal tax laws provide for a limitation on the use of nol and tax credit carryforwards generated prior to certain ownership changes 
our public offering of common stock in resulted in an ownership change for federal income tax purposes  and as a result we estimate that at december   million of our total federal nol carryforwards is subject to an annual limitation 
accordingly  if we generate taxable income in any year in excess of our limitation  we may be required to pay federal income taxes even though we have unexpired nol carryforwards 
in addition  we have million of nol s available to reduce future state income taxes 
in  the state of new jersey enacted tax legislation suspending the use of loss carryforwards to offset taxable income in and accordingly  if we generate taxable income for state income tax purposes in  we will be required to pay new jersey income taxes even though we have unexpired nol carryforwards 
in january  we realized  through the sale and transfer of million of state tax net operating losses 
the sale and transfer was made through the technology business tax certificate program sponsored by the new jersey economic development authority 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk we are exposed to changes in interest rates primarily from our debt arrangements and  secondarily  from our investments in certain securities 
although our short term investments are available for sale  we generally hold such investments until maturity 
we do not utilize derivative instruments or other market risk sensitive instruments to manage exposure to interest rate changes 
we believe that a hypothetical basis point adverse move in interest rates along the entire interest rate yield curve would not materially affect the fair value of our interest sensitive financial instruments at december
