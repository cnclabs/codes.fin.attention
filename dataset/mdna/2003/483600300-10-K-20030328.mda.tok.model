on june   we completed a merger with broadbase 
this transaction was accounted for using the purchase method of accounting 
the purchase price approximated million 
in december  our our stockholders approved a one for ten reverse stock split of the common stock for stockholders of record on december  all share and per share amounts have been retroactively restated to reflect the effect of this stock split 
in  we initiated our kana online business 
our kana online business provided a hosted environment of our software to customers 
our servers for this business were maintained by a third party service provider 
in the second quarter of  we adopted a plan to discontinue the kana online business 
in the second quarter of  all kana online operations ceased 
we have accounted for our kana online business as a discontinued operation 
since  we have incurred substantial costs to develop our products and to recruit  train and compensate personnel for our engineering  sales  marketing  client services and administration departments 
as a result  we have incurred substantial losses since inception 
for the twelve months ended december   we incurred a net loss of million 
included in the net loss is million related to the impairment of goodwill in as of december   we had an accumulated deficit of billion  which includes approximately billion related to goodwill impairment charges 
we expect to decrease our operating losses in as a result of our restructuring activities in  as well as ongoing personnel and facility cost reductions throughout we expect our cash and cash equivalents and short term investments on hand will be sufficient to meet our working capital and capital expenditure needs for the next months 
as of december   we had full time employees  which is a decrease from employees at december  the decrease during was based primarily upon attrition 
we restructured our organization throughout  with net workforce reductions of approximately employees  in order to streamline operations  eliminate redundant positions after the merger with broadbase  reduce costs and bring our staffing and structure in line with industry standards and current economic conditions 
these reductions have been significant  particularly in light of the addition of approximately employees upon our merger with broadbase in june of critical accounting policies and estimates the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect our reported assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and our related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
we continually evaluate our estimates  including those related to revenue recognition  collectibility of receivables  goodwill and intangible assets  contract loss reserve  income taxes  and restructuring 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
this forms the basis of judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies and the related judgments and estimates significantly affect the preparation of our consolidated financial statements revenue recognition 
in addition to determining our results of operations for a given period  our revenue recognition determines the timing of certain expenses  such as commissions and royalties 
revenue recognition rules for software companies are complex  and various judgments affect the application of our revenue policy 
the amount and timing of our revenue is difficult to predict  and any shortfall in revenue or delay in recognizing revenue could cause our operating results to vary significantly from quarter to quarter and could result in future operating losses 
license revenue is recognized when there is persuasive evidence of an arrangement  delivery to the customer has occurred  provided the arrangement does not require significant customization of the software  the fee is fixed or determinable and collectibility is reasonably assured 
in software arrangements that include rights to multiple software products and or services  we allocate the total arrangement fee among each of the deliverables using the residual method  under which revenue is allocated to undelivered elements based on vendor specific objective evidence of fair value of such undelivered elements with the residual amounts of revenue being allocated to the delivered elements 
elements included in multiple element arrangements primarily consist of software products  maintenance which includes customer support services and unspecified upgrades  or consulting services 
vendor specific objective evidence for software products and consulting services is based on the price charged when an element is sold separately or  in the case of an element not yet sold separately  the price established by authorized management  if it is probable that the price  once established  will not change before market introduction 
vendor specific objective evidence for maintenance is based upon stated contractual renewal rates 
evaluating whether sufficient and appropriate vendor specific objective evidence exists to use in allocating revenue to undelivered elements  and the interpretation of such evidence to determine the fair value of undelivered elements is subject to judgment and estimates that affect when and to what extent we may recognize revenues from a given contractual arrangement 
probability of collection is based upon assessment of the customer s financial condition through review of their current financial statements or credit reports 
for sales to existing customers  prior payment history is also considered in assessing probability of collection 
we are required to exercise significant judgment in deciding whether collectibility is reasonably assured  and such judgments may materially affect the timing of our revenues and our results of operations 
revenues from customer support services are recognized ratably over the term of the contract  typically one year 
consulting revenues are primarily related to implementation services performed on a time and materials basis or  in certain situations  on a fixed fee basis  under separate service arrangements 
implementation services are performed under fixed fee arrangements and are generally recognized on a percentage of completion basis 
when acceptance is not assured or an ability to reliably estimate costs is not possible  we use the completed contract method  whereby revenues are deferred until all contractual obligations are met  and acceptance  if required in the contract  is received 
revenues from consulting and training services are recognized as services are performed 
collectibility of receivables 
in order to recognize revenue from a transaction  collectibility must be determined by management to be reasonably assured 
if collectibility is not determined to be reasonably assured  amounts billed to customers are recorded as deferred revenue 
for sales to existing customers  prior payment history is a factor in assessing probability of collection 
we make judgments as to our ability to collect outstanding receivables and provide allowances for receivables that may not be collectible 
a considerable amount of judgment is required to assess the ultimate realization of receivables 
in assessing collectibility  we consider the age of the receivable  our historical collection experience  current economic trends  and the current credit worthiness of each customer 
in the future  additional provisions for doubtful accounts may be needed and the future results of operations could be materially affected 
reserve for loss contract 
we were party to a contract with a customer that provided for fixed fee payments in exchange for services upon meeting certain milestone criteria 
in order to assess whether a loss reserve was necessary  we estimated the total expected costs of providing services necessary to complete the contract and compared these costs to the fees expected to be received under the contract 
based on analysis we performed in the fourth quarter of  we expected the costs to complete the project to exceed the associated fees  and accordingly we recorded a loss reserve of million in the quarter ended december  as a result of our restructuring in the third quarter of  substantially all of the remaining professional services required under the contract were being provided by a third party  and we recorded an additional loss reserve of million in the quarter ended september   based upon an analysis of costs to complete these services 
in the second quarter of  we began discussions with the customer regarding the timing and scope of the project deliverables  which led to an amendment to the original contract in august based on the amendment and associated negotiations with a third party integrator that had been providing implementation services to the customer  we recorded a charge of approximately million to cost of services revenue in the second quarter of and in accordance with the terms of the amendment were relieved from providing any further implementation services under the contract 
the amendment required us to transfer million to an escrow account which included million previously reported as restricted cash to compensate any third party integrator for the continued implementation of the customer s system 
the charge also included million of fees which we had paid the third party integrator prior to the amendment and approximately  of related expenditures 
during the second quarter of  we received a scheduled payment of million associated with the original agreement which is reported as deferred revenue 
the million will be recognized in future periods as revenue as we fulfill our maintenance and training obligations 
accounting for internal use software 
internal use software costs  including fees paid to third parties to implement the software  are capitalized beginning when we have determined various factors are present  including among others  that technology exists to achieve the performance requirements  we have made a decision as to whether we will purchase the software or develop it internally and we have authorized funding for the project 
capitalization of software costs ceases when the software implementation is substantially complete and is ready for its intended use  and the capitalized costs are amortized over the software s estimated useful life generally five years using the straight line method 
as of december   we had million of capitalized costs of internal use software  of which million has been subject to depreciation based upon deployment dates of the related projects 
the remainder was attributable to software that we deployed in january  at which time we began depreciating the associated capitalized costs 
when events or circumstances indicate the carrying value of internal use software might not be recoverable  we assess the recoverability of these assets by determining whether the amortization of the asset balance over its remaining life can be recovered through undiscounted future operating cash flows 
the amount of impairment  if any  is recognized to the extent that the carrying value exceeds the projected discounted future operating cash flows and is recognized as a write down of the asset 
in addition  if it is no longer probable that computer software being developed will be placed in service  the asset will be adjusted to the lower of its carrying value or fair value  if any  less direct selling costs 
any such adjustment would result in an expense in the period recorded  which could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated statement of operations 
based on our assessment as of december   we determined that no such impairment of internal use software existed 
restructuring 
during  we recorded significant reserves in connection with our restructuring program 
these reserves included estimates pertaining to contractual obligations related to excess leased facilities 
we have worked with external real estate advisors in each of the markets where the properties are located to help us estimate the amount of the accrual 
this process involves significant judgments regarding these markets 
if the real estate market continues to worsen  additional adjustments to the reserve may be required  which would result in additional restructuring expenses in the period in which such determination is made 
likewise  if the real estate market strengthens  and we are able to sublease the properties earlier or at more favorable rates than projected  or if we are otherwise able to negotiate early termination of obligations on favorable terms  adjustments to the reserve may be required that would increase income in the period in which such determination is made 
in november of  we entered into an amendment to a facility lease 
in connection with this lease amendment  our evaluation of real estate market conditions relating to this and other excess leased facilities  and discussions with our other landlords  we reduced our associated restructuring reserve by approximately million 
this reduction was primarily comprised of a million payment made in connection with the amendment  as well as approximately million in restructuring cost savings resulting from this amendment that were reflected as a reduction in the restructuring reserve in our operating results for the quarter ended december  goodwill and intangible assets 
consideration paid in connection with acquisitions is required to be allocated to the acquired assets  including identifiable intangible assets  and liabilities acquired 
acquired assets and liabilities are recorded based on our estimate of fair value  which requires significant judgment with respect to future cash flows and discount rates 
for intangible assets other than goodwill  we are required to estimate the useful life of the asset and recognize its cost as an expense over the useful life 
we use the straight line method to expense long lived assets  which results in an equal amount of expense in each period 
amortization of goodwill ceased as of january  upon our adoption of statement of financial accounting standards no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets sfas 
instead  we are now required to test goodwill for impairment under certain circumstances and write down goodwill when it is impaired 
we have determined that the consolidated results of kana comprise one reporting unit for the purpose of impairment testing throughout we regularly evaluate acquired businesses for potential indicators of impairment of goodwill and intangible assets 
our judgments regarding the existence of impairment indicators are based on market conditions  operational performance of our acquired businesses and identification of reporting units 
future events could cause us to conclude that impairment indicators exist and that goodwill and other intangible assets associated with our acquired businesses are impaired 
under the transition provisions of sfas no 
 there was no goodwill impairment at january  based upon our analysis completed at that time 
however  during the quarter ended june   circumstances developed that indicated the goodwill was likely impaired and we performed an impairment analysis as of june  this analysis resulted in a million impairment expense to reduce goodwill 
the circumstances that led to the impairment included the lower than previously expected revenues and net loss for the second quarter of and the revision of estimates of our revenues and net loss for subsequent quarters  based upon financial results for the second quarter of and the reduction of estimated revenue and cash flows in future quarters 
we used relevant market data  including kana s market capitalization during the period following the announcement of preliminary results for the second quarter of  to calculate an estimated fair value and the resulting goodwill impairment 
the estimated fair value was compared to the corresponding carrying value of goodwill at june   which resulted in a revaluation of goodwill as of june  the remaining amount of goodwill as of december  was million 
any further impairment loss could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations 
income taxes 
we estimate our income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate as part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements 
this process involves us estimating our actual current tax exposure together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items  such as deferred revenue  for tax and accounting purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities 
we then assess the likelihood that our net deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income and to the extent we believe that recovery is not likely  we establish a valuation allowance 
we concluded that a full valuation allowance was required for all periods presented 
while we have considered future taxable income in assessing the need for the valuation allowance  in the event we were to determine that we would be able to realize our deferred tax assets in the future in excess of its net recorded amount  an adjustment to the valuation allowance would be made  increasing our income in the period in which such determination was made 
contingencies and litigation 
we are subject to lawsuits and other claims and proceedings 
we assess the likelihood of any adverse judgments or outcomes to these matters as well as ranges of probable losses 
a determination of the amount of loss contingency required  if any  for these matters are made after careful analysis of each individual matter 
the required loss contingencies may change in the future as the facts and circumstances of each matter changes 
quarterly results of operations the following tables set forth a summary of our unaudited quarterly operating results for each of the eight quarters in the period ended december  the information has been derived from our unaudited consolidated financial statements that  in management s opinion  have been prepared on a basis consistent with the audited consolidated financial statements contained elsewhere in this annual report and include all adjustments  consisting only of normal recurring adjustments  necessary for a fair presentation of this information when read in conjunction with our audited consolidated financial statements and notes thereto

our revenues and operating results are difficult to forecast and will fluctuate  and we believe that period to period comparisons of our operating results will not necessarily be meaningful 
as a result  you should not rely upon them as an indication of future performance 
results of operations the following table sets forth selected data for the periods presented 
percentages are expressed as a percentage of total revenues 
year ended december  revenues license    service    total revenues    cost of revenues license    service    total cost of revenues    gross profit    operating expenses sales and marketing    research and development    general and administrative    comparison of the years ended december  and revenues total revenues decreased by to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  primarily as a result of decreased service revenues 
license revenues increased by to million for the year ended december  from million for this increase in license revenue was primarily due to an increase in the average selling price of licenses  particularly in europe  as well as sales of products formerly offered by broadbase  which were not included in our revenues prior to the june merger license revenues recorded by broadbase through june totaled million 
the increase in the average selling price of licenses in recent periods reflects the growth in our sales to larger organizations that often license our applications for more users and that need more functionality 
we believe this growth has resulted  in significant part  from our increased use of indirect channels to market and sell our products  which allow us to market our products more effectively to global organizations 
in addition  we believe the introduction of our kana icare suite in  with its deployment and integration advantages  has facilitated sales of licenses for multiple applications to our customers resulting in larger transaction sizes than those involving a stand alone application 
we expect that license transactions closed in any particular quarter will continue to constitute a significant percentage of our license revenues in that quarter 
one customer accounted for of our total revenues in license revenues represented of total revenues in and in our license revenue increased as a percentage of total revenue mostly due to the reduction in our professional services personnel resulting from our shift during the fourth quarter of to encourage our customers to increase their use of third party integrators to provide implementation services  rather than purchase those services from us 
we expect license revenues to increase moderately in absolute dollars in from  primarily due to our expectations of increasing total contract value with existing and new customers 
however  the market for our products is unpredictable and intensely competitive  and sales of our products are impacted by the current economic environment and the corresponding effect it has on corporate purchasing habits 
our service revenues consist of support revenues primarily from customer support  product maintenance and updates and professional services revenues primarily from consulting and implementation services 
service revenues decreased by to million for the year ended december  from million for service revenues decreased primarily due to our customers increased use of third party integrators for implementation services as discussed above 
service revenues represented of total revenues for the year ended december  and of total revenues for we expect that service revenues in will be fairly consistent with in absolute dollars as we continue to focus on license sales and using third party integrators for implementation services 
revenues from international sales were million in the year ended december  and million in the year ended december  the increase in international sales in is primarily as a result of sales through our integration partner in the uk 
our international revenues were derived from sales in europe  canada  asia pacific and latin america 
cost of revenues total cost of revenues decreased by to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  cost of license revenues consist primarily of third party software royalties  costs of product packaging  documentation  and production and delivery costs for shipments to customers 
cost of license revenues as a percentage of license revenue for was compared to in the slight increase was due to greater sales of certain licenses in  which have higher associated royalty rates 
we expect that our cost of license revenue as a percentage of sales in will be approximately the same as in cost of service revenues consists primarily of salaries and related expenses for our customer support  implementation and training services organization and allocation of facility costs and system costs incurred in providing customer support 
cost of service revenues decreased to of service revenues for compared to for the prior year 
cost of service revenues in included approximately million  or of service revenues  related to a loss contract with a customer 
see reserve for loss contract under critical accounting policies above 
the improvement in service margins was primarily due to the change in service revenues mix following our shift to have customers increase their use of third party integrators to provide implementation services  rather than purchase those services from us 
as a result  support revenues comprised a larger percentage of service revenues  which have yielded better margins than training and consulting revenues due to higher utilization of customer support personnel than training and consulting personnel 
maintenance revenues comprised million  or of total revenues in  compared to million  or in we anticipate that our cost of service revenues will significantly decrease in absolute dollars  and as a percentage of service revenue  in compared to as a result of the finalization of the restructuring of a contract with a customer discussed above 
operating expenses sales and marketing 
sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of compensation and related costs for sales and marketing personnel and promotional expenditures  including public relations  advertising  trade shows and marketing materials 
sales and marketing expenses decreased by to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  this decrease was primarily attributable to reductions in sales and marketing personnel since the second half of  which reduced sales and marketing related positions from positions as of june  to positions at december   and related decreases in benefits  travel  and facility costs 
as a percentage of total revenues  sales and marketing expenses were for the year ended december  and for the year ended december  we anticipate that sales and marketing expenses in will be fairly consistent with in absolute dollars  and will fluctuate as a percentage of revenues depending on the timing and amount of revenues 
research and development 
research and development expenses consist primarily of compensation and related costs for research and development employees and contractors and enhancement of existing products and quality assurance activities 
research and development expenses decreased by to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  this decrease was attributable primarily to the reduction of personnel since the second half of  which reduced research and development related positions from as of june  to at december  as a percentage of total revenues  research and development expenses were for the year ended december  and for the year ended december  we anticipate that research and development expenses will be slightly lower in absolute dollars in than in due to cost reductions implemented in impacting the full year in as discussed in the business section of this report under overview research and development  and will fluctuate as a percentage of revenues depending on the timing and amount of revenues 
general and administrative 
general and administrative expenses consist primarily of compensation and related costs for finance  legal  human resources  corporate governance  various taxes  and bad debt expense 
information technology and facilities costs are allocated among all operating departments 
general and administrative expenses decreased by to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  this decrease was attributable to the reduction in bad debts charged to general and administrative expenses  from million in to approximately  in this decrease was also attributable to the reduction of personnel since the second half of  which reduced finance  legal and human resources related positions from as of june  to at december  as a percentage of total revenues  general and administrative expenses were for the year ended december  and for the year ended december  we anticipate that general and administrative costs will be slightly lower in absolute dollars in compared to  and will fluctuate as a percentage of revenues depending on the timing and amount of revenues 
amortization of stock based compensation 
in connection with our stock option grants to employees  we recorded unearned stock based compensation charges 
these charges represent the total difference between the exercise prices of stock options and the deemed fair value of the underlying common stock for accounting purposes on the date these stock options were granted 
the majority of these charges relate to grants made prior to our initial public offering as well as options assumed in connection with our merger with broadbase in in  options granted with an exercise price below the fair value of the option shares on the date of grant resulted in a charge of  and cancellations of grants with previous associated charges resulted in a reversal of million 
in  options granted with an exercise price below the fair value of the option shares on the date of grant resulted in a charge of million  and cancellations of grants with previous associated charges resulted in a reversal of million 
in connection with the merger with broadbase  we recorded unearned stock based compensation totaling approximately million during the year ended december  these amounts are included as a component of stockholders equity and are being amortized on an accelerated basis by charges to operations over the vesting period of the options  consistent with the method described in fasb interpretation no 
in september  we issued to accenture  shares of common stock and a warrant to purchase up to  shares of our common stock at an exercise price of per share pursuant to a stock and warrant purchase agreement in connection with our global strategic alliance 
the shares of the common stock issued were fully vested  and we recorded a deferred stock based compensation charge of approximately million to be amortized over the four year term of the agreement 
as of december    shares of common stock subject to the warrant were fully vested and  had been forfeited  with the remaining  warrants subject to vesting upon the achievement of certain performance goals 
the vested portion of the warrant was valued using the black scholes model resulting in charges totaling million of which million was immediately expensed in the fourth quarter of and million is being amortized over the term of the agreement 
we will incur a stock based compensation charge for the unvested portion of the warrant when and if annual performance goals are achieved 
as of december   unvested shares of common stock under the warrant had a fair value of approximately  based upon the fair market value of our common stock at such date 
in june  we entered into an agreement to issue to a customer a fully vested and exercisable warrant to purchase up to  shares of common stock at an exercise price of per share pursuant to a warrant purchase agreement 
the warrant was valued using the black scholes model  resulting in a deferred stock based compensation charge of  which was fully amortized as a reduction of revenue in in september  we issued to a customer a warrant to purchase up to  shares of common stock at an exercise price of per share pursuant to a warrant purchase agreement 
the warrant will become fully vested in september and has a provision for acceleration of vesting by  shares annually over four years if certain marketing criteria are met by the customer 
as of december   no such marketing criteria has been met 
the warrant was valued using the black scholes model  resulting in a deferred stock based compensation charge of approximately  which is being amortized over the four year term of the agreement 
in september  we issued to accenture a fully vested warrant to purchase up to  shares of common stock at an exercise price of per share pursuant to a warrant purchase agreement in connection with our global strategic alliance 
the warrant was valued using the black scholes model resulting in a charge of approximately  which is being amortized over the four year term of the agreement 
accenture exercised this additional warrant in march in november  we issued to two investment funds warrants to purchase up to  shares of our common stock at an exercise price of per share in connection with a proposed financing which was to have been completed in february upon attaining stockholder approval 
these warrants were initially exercisable for an aggregate of  shares 
the exercisable warrants were valued using the black scholes model resulting in a charge of approximately million to deferred stock based compensation 
on february   our stockholders voted against the proposed financing  which resulted in us terminating the share purchase agreement and caused the warrants to become exercisable with respect to all  shares 
the warrants are exercisable until february using the black scholes model  the warrants issued in november that were initially exercisable were re valued as of february   and the warrants that became exercisable on february  were valued as of such date  resulting in a charge totaling approximately million which was reflected as amortization of stock based compensation in the first quarter of as of december   a total of approximately million of unearned deferred stock based compensation remained to be amortized 
we anticipate stock based compensation expense to approximate from million to million in  to million in  and the remainder in the amortization of stock based compensation for and  by operating expense  is detailed as follows in thousands year ended december  cost of service  sales and marketing   research and development   general and administrative   total   amortization of goodwill

under sfas  goodwill is no longer amortized

we recorded million in amortization of identifiable intangibles in both and this amortization relates to million of purchased technology recorded as an intangible asset in connection with the merger with silknet in april we expect amortization of these identifiable intangibles to conclude in april the remaining unamortized portion of identifiable intangibles is million at december  merger and related cost 
there were no merger related costs incurred in in connection with the merger with broadbase  we recorded million of merger related expenses in the merger costs included personnel costs of million  and million relating to duplicate facility and insurance costs  redundant assets  and professional fees associated with the merger 
as of december   no accrued merger related costs remained on the consolidated balance sheet 
restructuring costs 
for the year ended december   we recorded approximately million in restructuring cost savings related to an amendment to a facility lease  our evaluation of real estate market conditions relating to this and other excess leased facilities  and discussions with our other landlords 
for the year ended december   we incurred restructuring charges of approximately million primarily related to reductions in our workforce and costs associated with certain excess leased facilities and asset impairments 
the restructuring charges included million for assets disposed of or removed from operations 
assets disposed of or removed from operations consisted primarily of computer equipment and related software  office equipment  furniture and fixtures and leasehold improvements 
the restructuring charge in also included million for severance  benefits and related costs associated with reductions in our workforce 
as of december   we had full time employees 
we restructured our organization throughout  with net workforce reductions of approximately employees  or from december   in order to streamline operations  eliminate redundant positions after the merger with broadbase  reduce costs and bring our staffing and cost structure in line with industry standards and current economic conditions 
the restructuring charge in also included million resulting from our decision to exit and reduce some of our facilities 
the estimated facility costs were based on our contractual obligations  net of estimated sublease income  based on current comparable rates for leases in the respective markets 
the following table summarizes our restructuring expenses  payments  and liabilities at and for the years ended december  and in thousands fixed asset severance facilities disposals totals restructuring reserve at restructuring charge    non cash charges   payments made   restructuring reserve at  non cash reduction of restructuring  payments made  sublease payments received restructuring reserve at  we expect payments relating to restructuring liabilities to approximate million in  with the remainder being paid fairly evenly from until during  we realized personnel related costs savings associated with reductions in headcount as a result of our restructuring in  of approximately million 
cost savings in relating to facilities reductions relating to our restructuring in included  in sublease payments received and  in reduced rent obligations relating to an amendment in to a facility lease 
reductions in rent obligations related to this amendment range from approximately million in and increasing to approximately million in and  in to the extent we are able to sublease excess facilities sooner than anticipated  or for greater dollar amounts than assumed  we will experience further cost reductions 
likewise  to the extent that our sublease expectations are not met  we may experience adjustments to our restructuring reserve in future periods which may have a material adverse effect on our financial statements 
goodwill impairment 
on january   we adopted statement of financial accounting standards no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets sfas 
sfas requires goodwill to be tested for impairment under certain circumstances and written down when impaired 
sfas requires purchased intangible assets other than goodwill to be amortized over their useful lives unless these lives are determined to be indefinite 
under the transition provisions of sfas no 
 there was no goodwill impairment at january  based upon our analysis at that time 
however  during the quarter ended june   circumstances developed that indicated the goodwill was likely impaired and we performed an impairment analysis as of june  this analysis resulted in a million impairment expense to reduce goodwill 
the circumstances that led to the impairment included the lower than previously expected revenues and net loss for the second quarter of and the revision of estimates of our revenues and net loss for subsequent quarters  based upon financial results for the second quarter of and the reduction of estimated cash flows in future quarters 
we used relevant market data  including kana s market capitalization during the period following the revision of estimates  to calculate an estimated fair value and the resulting goodwill impairment 
the estimated fair value was compared to the corresponding carrying value of goodwill at june   which resulted in a revaluation of goodwill as of june  the remaining amount of goodwill as of december  was million 
any further impairment loss could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations 
the remaining goodwill balance was approximately million at december  in  we performed an impairment assessment of the identifiable intangibles and goodwill recorded in connection with the silknet merger 
the assessment was performed primarily due to the significant sustained decline in our stock price since the valuation date of the shares issued in the silknet acquisition which had resulted in the net book value of our assets prior to the impairment charge significantly exceeding our market capitalization  the overall decline in the industry growth rates  and our lower than projected operating results 
as a result  we recorded an impairment charge of approximately million in the first quarter of to reduce our goodwill 
the charge was based upon the estimated discounted cash flows over the remaining useful life of the goodwill using a discount rate of 
impairment of investment in connection with the merger with silknet  we assumed a million investment in preferred stock of a privately held company 
we recorded a million impairment charge in the fourth quarter of in order to reduce the carrying value of the investment to  the impairment charge was based on a substantial decline in the estimated fair value of the investment based  in part  on the terms of a recent financing involving significant new investors 
this investment is included under other assets in our consolidated balance sheet at december  other income expense  net other income expense  net in and consisted primarily of interest earned on cash and short term investments offset by interest expense related to our line of credit and other non operating expenses such as gains and losses on asset disposals 
other income expense  net was  for the year ended december  and million for the year ended december  the decrease in other income expense  net related to lower amounts of interest income earned due to lower average cash balances in than in provision for income taxes we have incurred operating losses for all periods from inception through december  we have recorded a valuation allowance for the full amount of our gross deferred tax assets  as the future realization of the tax benefit is not currently likely 
as of december   we had net operating loss carryforwards for federal and state tax purposes of approximately million and million  respectively 
the federal net operating loss carryforwards  if not offset against future taxable income  will expire from through under the provisions of the internal revenue code of  as amended  substantial changes in ownership may limit the amount of net operating loss carryforwards that could be utilized annually in the future to offset taxable income 
discontinued operation during the second quarter of  we adopted a plan to discontinue the kana online business 
we no longer seek any new kana online business or have any remaining contractual obligations to provide kana online to customers 
accordingly  kana online is reported as a discontinued operation 
the estimated loss on the disposal of kana online recorded during the second quarter of was million  consisting of an estimated loss on disposal of the business of million and a provision of million for the anticipated operating losses during the phase out period 
the loss on disposal was recorded in the second quarter of and adjusted in the second quarter of  resulting in a gain of  this operation has been presented as a discontinued operation for all periods presented 
the kana online operating results are as follows in thousands year ended dece mber  revenues  income loss from operations of discontinued operation 
gain loss on disposal  total income loss on discontinued operations  comparison of the years ended december  and revenues total revenues decreased by to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  primarily as a result of decreased license revenue 
license revenues decreased by to million for the year ended december  from million for this decrease in license revenue was primarily due to a decrease in the number of license transactions  resulting from a decline in economic conditions throughout  and particularly in the third quarter of following the events of september  this decrease was partially offset in the fourth quarter by sales of products formerly offered by broadbase which were not included in our revenues prior to the june merger license revenues recorded by broadbase through june totaled million 
license revenues represented of total revenues in and in we anticipate license revenue will increase as a percentage of total revenue in the future due to the reduction in our professional services as a result of our shift during the fourth quarter of to increase our use of third party integrators for providing implementation services to our customers 
service revenues increased by to million for the year ended december  from million for service revenues increased primarily due to service engagements in quarters following increased licensing activity in the third and fourth quarters of given the increase in licensing activity in compared to  as well as the first quarter of compared to the first quarter of  service revenue in increased from service revenues represented of total revenues for the year ended december  and of total revenues for revenues from international sales were million in the year ended december  and million in the year ended december  our international revenues were derived from sales in europe  canada  asia pacific and latin america 
cost of revenues total cost of revenues decreased by to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december   primarily due to the reduction in cost of services discussed below 
cost of license revenue consists primarily of third party software royalties  product packaging  documentation  and production and delivery costs for shipments to customers 
cost of license revenue as a percentage of license revenue for was compared to in the increase was due to the reduced license revenue and fixed nature of some of the license costs  as well as an increase in certain royalty rates from cost of service revenue consists primarily of salaries and related expenses for our customer support  implementation and training services organization and allocation of facility costs and system costs incurred in providing customer support 
our support revenues relate to providing telephone support and product maintenance and updates 
our professional services revenues relate to providing consulting and implementation services 
cost of service revenue decreased to of service revenue for compared to for the same period in the prior year 
this was primarily due to more consistent utilization of our professional services personnel in revenue generating services during the first half of  offset by a million increase of the estimated costs to complete a fixed fee contract recorded in the third quarter of during the fourth quarter of  service margins improved due to the change in service revenue mix following the shift to increase customers use of third party integrators to provide implementation services  rather than to purchasing these services from us 
as a result  support revenues comprised a larger percentage of service revenues  which have yielded better margins than training and consulting revenues 
operating expenses sales and marketing 
sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of compensation and related costs for sales and marketing personnel and promotional expenditures  including public relations  advertising  trade shows and marketing collateral materials 
sales and marketing expenses decreased by to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  this decrease was attributable primarily to reductions in sales and marketing personnel during  from positions as of december  to positions at december  we also experienced decreases in sales commissions associated with decreased revenues and decreases in marketing costs  primarily in advertising and promotional activities 
as a percentage of total revenues  sales and marketing expenses were for the year ended december  and for the year ended december  research and development 
research and development expenses consist primarily of compensation and related costs for research and development employees and contractors and enhancement of existing products and quality assurance activities 
research and development expenses decreased by to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  this decrease was attributable primarily to the reduction of personnel during  from positions december  to at december  as a percentage of total revenues  research and development expenses were for the year ended december  and for the year ended december  general and administrative 
general and administrative expenses consist primarily of compensation and related costs for finance  legal  human resources  corporate governance  various taxes  and bad debt expense 
information technology and facilities costs are allocated among all operating departments 
general and administrative expenses increased by to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  the increase resulted from higher overall general and administrative costs in the first quarter of compared to the same period in due to internal growth  and the acquisition and integration of broadbase in the second quarter of as a percentage of total revenues  general and administrative expenses were for the year ended december  and for the year ended december  amortization of stock based compensation 
as of december   approximately million of total unearned deferred stock based compensation remained to be amortized 
the amortization of stock based compensation by operating expense  for and  is detailed as follows in thousands year ended december  cost of service   sales and marketing   research and development   general and administrative  total   amortization of goodwill and identifiable intangibles 
we recorded million in amortization in compared to million in the decrease was due to the impairments of goodwill recorded in and  as well as the amortization of negative goodwill recorded in connection with the broadbase merger in as a result of our merger with silknet in april  billion was allocated to goodwill and identifiable intangibles 
this amount was being amortized on a straight line basis over a period of three years from the date of acquisition in the goodwill amount was reduced upon recording impairment charges of approximately million in the first quarter of and billion in the fourth quarter of merger related cost 
in connection with the merger with broadbase  we recorded million of merger related integration expenses in the merger costs included personnel costs of million  and million relating to duplicate facility and insurance costs  redundant assets  and professional fees associated with the merger 
in connection with the silknet merger  we recorded million of transaction costs and merger related integration expenses in these amounts consisted primarily of merger related advertising and announcements of million and duplicate facility costs of million 
restructuring costs 
as discussed above under comparison of the years ended december  and  we incurred restructuring charges of approximately million for the year ended december   primarily related to reductions in our workforce and costs associated with certain excess leased facilities and asset impairments 
a summary of restructuring expenses  payments  and liabilities for the year ended and as at december  is as follows in thousands fixed asset severance facilities disposals totals restructuring reserve at restructuring charge    non cash charges   payments made   restructuring reserve at  in process research and development 
in connection with the silknet merger  net intangibles of million were allocated to in process research and development in the fair value allocation to in process research and development was determined by identifying the research projects for which technological feasibility had not been achieved and which had no alternative future use at the merger date  assessing the stage and expected date of completion of the research and development effort at the merger date  and calculating the net present value of the cash flows expected to result from the successful deployment of the new technology resulting from the in process research and development effort 
the stages of completion were determined by estimating the costs and time incurred to date relative to the costs and time incurred to develop the in process technology into a commercially viable technology or product  while considering the relative difficulty of completing the various tasks and obstacles necessary to attain technological feasibility 
as of the date of the acquisition  silknet had two projects in process that were complete 
these projects have since been completed 
the estimated net present value of cash flows was based on incremental future cash flows from revenues expected to be generated by the technologies in the process of development  taking into account the characteristics and applications of the technologies  the size and growth rate of existing and future markets and an evaluation of past and anticipated technology and product life cycles 
estimated net future cash flows included allocations of operating expenses and income taxes but excluded the expected completion costs of the in process projects  and were discounted at a rate of to arrive at a net present value 
the discount rate included a factor that took into account the uncertainty surrounding the successful deployment of in process technology projects 
this net present value was allocated to in process research and development based on the percentage of completion at the merger date 
goodwill impairment 
in and  as discussed above under comparison of the years ended december  and  in  we performed impairment assessments of the identifiable intangibles and goodwill recorded in connection with the silknet merger 
the assessments were performed primarily due to the significant sustained decline in our stock price since the valuation date of the shares issued in the silknet acquisition  resulting in our net book value of our assets prior to the impairment charge significantly exceeding our market capitalization  the overall decline in the industry growth rates  and our lower than projected operating results 
as a result  we recorded impairment charges of approximately million in the first quarter of and billion in the fourth quarter of to reduce our goodwill 
the charges were based upon the estimated discounted cash flows over the remaining useful life of the goodwill using a discount rate of 
impairment of investment as discussed above under comparison of the years ended december  and  in connection with the merger with silknet  we assumed a million investment in preferred stock of a privately held company and recorded a million impairment charge in the fourth quarter of in order to reduce the carrying value of the investment to  the impairment charge was based on a substantial decline in the estimated fair value of the investment based  in part  on the terms of a recent financing involving significant new investors 
this investment was included under other assets in our consolidated balance sheet at december  other income expense  net other income expense  net in and consisted primarily of interest earned on cash and short term investments offset by interest expense related to our line of credit and other non operating expenses such as gains and losses on asset disposals 
other income expense  net was million for the year ended december  and million for the year ended december  the decrease in other income expense  net related to lower amounts of interest income earned due to lower average cash balances in than in provision for income taxes we have incurred operating losses for all periods from inception through december   and therefore have recorded a valuation allowance for the full amount of our gross deferred tax assets  as the future realization of the tax benefit is not currently likely 
as of december   we had net operating loss carryforwards for federal tax purposes of approximately million 
the federal net operating loss carryforwards  if not offset against future taxable income  will expire from through under the provisions of the internal revenue code of  as amended  substantial changes in ownership may limit the amount of net operating loss carryforwards that could be utilized annually in the future to offset taxable income 
discontinued operation during the second quarter of  we adopted a plan to discontinue the kana online business 
net assets of the discontinued operation at december   consisted primarily of computers and servers 
the estimated loss on the disposal of kana online recorded during the second quarter of was million  consisting of an estimated loss on disposal of the business of million and a provision of million for the anticipated operating losses during the phase out period 
revenues from kana online for the year ended december  were million compared to million in liquidity and capital resources as of december   we had million in cash  cash equivalents and short term investments  compared to million as of december  as of december   we had negative working capital of million 
our operating activities used million of cash for the year ended december  these expenditures were primarily attributable to the net loss we experienced during  as well as million in payments relating to restructuring and merger liabilities  offset in part by non cash charges primarily relating to goodwill impairment  depreciation and amortization of intangibles and stock based compensation 
our operating activities used million of cash for the year ended december  and million of cash for the year ended december  these expenditures were primarily attributable to net losses experienced during these periods  offset in part by non cash charges 
our investing activities provided million of cash for the year ended december   and consisted primarily of reductions of restricted cash of million and transfers of short term investments to cash totaling million  offset by purchases of property and equipment of million 
our investing activities provided million of cash for the year ended december   and consisted primarily of transfers of short term investments to cash  and cash acquired from the acquisition of broadbase  offset by purchases of computer equipment  furniture  fixtures and leasehold improvements of million  and a transfer of million of cash to restricted cash 
our investing activities provided million of cash for the year ended december   which was primarily due transfers of short term investments and cash acquired from the acquisition of silknet  offset by purchases of computer equipment  furniture  fixtures and leasehold improvements of million 
our financing activities provided million in cash for the year ended december   primarily due to net proceeds of approximately million from our private placement of approximately million shares of our common stock in february our financing activities provided million in cash for the year ended december   primarily due to net proceeds of million from a private placement of approximately million shares of our common stock 
our financing activities provided million for the year ended december   primarily due to net proceeds of approximately million from a private placement of  shares of our common stock 
we have a line of credit totaling million  which is collateralized by all of our assets  bears interest at the bank s prime rate plus as of december   and expires in november at which time the entire balance under the line of credit will be due 
total borrowings as of december  and were million and million  respectively  under this line of credit 
the line of credit requires that we maintain at least an million dollar balance in any account at the bank or that we provide cash collateral with funds equivalent to of the outstanding debt obligation 
the line of credit also requires that we maintain at all times a minimum of million as short term unrestricted cash  cash equivalents and investments with a maturity within twelve months 
if we default under this line of credit  including through a violation of any of these covenants  the entire balance under the line of credit will become immediately due and payable 
as of december   we were in compliance with all covenants of the line of credit agreement 
in june  we entered into a non recourse receivables purchase agreement with a bank which provides for the sale of up to million in certain qualified receivables subject to an administrative fee and a discount schedule ranging from the bank s prime rate of interest plus to the bank s prime rate of interest plus 
as of december   we had not sold any receivables under this agreement 
future payments due under debt and lease obligations as of december  are as follows in thousands obligations non cancelable line of under capital operating year ending december  credit leases leases total thereafter  in november  we renewed our line of credit with a million facility 
as of december   total borrowings under this line were million 
during  we will make interest payments totaling  in relation to the obligations under capital leases  this interest component is included in th e commitment schedule above 
includes leases previously subject to abandonment and included in the restructuring charge 
as a result of our restructuring activities in  as well as personnel and facility cost reductions throughout  we expect our cash and cash equivalents and short term investments on hand will be sufficient to meet our working capital and capital expenditure needs through december  significant expected cash outflows in addition to our operating expenses through include approximately million in lease payments relating to accrued restructuring costs and approximately million of capital expenditures on certain corporate infrastructure 
additionally  in january  we began implementing an outsourcing strategy  which involves subcontracting a significant portion of our software programming  quality assurance and technical documentation activities to development partners with staffing in india and china 
as a result of the first phase of this strategy  in the first quarter of we transferred the responsibilities of us based employees to these development partners 
we expect to transfer additional positions to these development partners in future quarters of we signed contracts with some of these development partners in march  with expected payments in of approximately million dollars  primarily on a time and materials basis  but with minimum payments of million in we expect to sign contracts with additional development partners in the second quarter of if we experience a decrease in demand for our products from the level experienced in  then we would need to reduce expenditures to a greater degree than anticipated 
our expectations as to when we can achieve positive cash flows  and as to our future cash balances  are subject to a number of assumptions  including assumptions regarding anticipated increases in our revenue  improvements in general economic conditions and customer purchasing and payment patterns  many of which are beyond our control 
recent accounting pronouncements sfas no 
primarily addresses the accounting for goodwill and intangible assets subsequent to their acquisition and supercedes apb no 
 intangible assets 
the provisions of sfas no 
were adopted as of january  for calendar year entities 
the most significant changes made by sfas no 
are goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets will no longer be amortized  goodwill will be tested for impairment at least annually at the reporting unit level  intangible assets deemed to have an indefinite life will be tested for impairment at least annually  and the amortization period of intangible assets with finite lives will no longer be limited to forty years 
as a result of our adoption of sfas no 
 effective january   we no longer amortize existing goodwill 
at december   net goodwill was million and goodwill amortization expense was million for the year ended december  in addition  we were required to measure goodwill for impairment effective january  as part of the transition provisions 
impairment resulting from the transition provisions was recorded as of january  and was recognized as the effect of a change in accounting principle 
at december   negative goodwill approximated million 
we were also required as part of the adoption of sfas no 
to immediately recognize the unamortized negative goodwill that existed on january  this adjustment was recognized as the effect of a change in accounting principle 
in june  the fasb issued sfas  accounting for exit or disposal activities sfas 
sfas addresses significant issues regarding the recognition  measurement  and reporting of costs that are associated with exit and disposal activities  including restructuring activities that are currently accounted for under eitf no 
 liability recognition for certain employee termination benefits and other costs to exit an activity including certain costs incurred in a restructuring 
the scope of sfas also includes costs related to terminating a contract that is not a capital lease and termination benefits that employees who are involuntarily terminated receive under the terms of a one time benefit arrangement that is not an ongoing benefit arrangement or an individual deferred compensation contract 
sfas will be effective for exit or disposal activities that are initiated after december  and early application is encouraged 
the provisions of eitf no 
shall continue to apply for an exit activity initiated under an exit plan that met the criteria of eitf no 
prior to the adoption of sfas the effect on adoption of sfas will change on a prospective basis the timing of when restructuring charges are recorded from a commitment date approach to when the liability is incurred 
in november  the eitf reached a consensus on issue no 
accounting for revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables eitf on a model to be used to determine when a revenue arrangement with multiple deliverables should be divided into separate units of accounting and  if separation is appropriate  how the arrangement consideration should be allocated to the identified accounting units 
the eitf also reached a consensus that this guidance should be effective for all revenue arrangements entered into in fiscal periods beginning after june   which for us would be the quarter ending september  we believe that the adoption of eitf will have no material impact on our financial statements 
in november  the fasb issued interpretation no 
fin guarantor s accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees  including indirect guarantees of indebtedness of others 
fin elaborates on the existing disclosure requirements for most guarantees  including loan guarantees 
it also clarifies that at the time a company issues a guarantee  the company must recognize an initial liability for the fair value  or market value  of the obligations it assumes under that guarantee 
however  the provisions related to recognizing a liability at inception of the guarantee for the fair value of the guarantor s obligations does not apply to product warranties or to guarantees accounted for as derivatives 
the initial recognition and initial measurement provisions apply on a prospective basis to guarantees issued or modified after december  the disclosure requirements of fin are effective for financial statements of interim or annual periods ending after december  the adoption of fin did not have a significant impact on our financial statements 
in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  transition and disclosure sfas 
sfas no 
provides alternative methods of transition for a voluntary change to the fair value based method of accounting for stock based employee compensation 
sfas no 
also requires that disclosures of the pro forma effect of using the fair value method of accounting for stock based employee compensation be displayed more prominently and in a tabular format 
additionally  sfas no 
requires disclosure of the pro forma effect in interim financial statements 
the transition and annual disclosure requirements of sfas no 
are effective for fiscal years ended after december  the interim disclosure requirements are effective for interim periods beginning after december  we believe that the adoption of this standard will have no material impact on our financial statements 
in january  the fasb issued interpretation no 
fin consolidation of variable interest entities 
until this interpretation  a company generally included another entity in its consolidated financial statements only if it controlled the entity through voting interests 
fin requires a variable interest entity to be consolidated by a company if that company is subject to a majority of the risk of loss from the variable interest entity s activities or entitled to receive a majority of the entity s residual returns 
disclosure of any newly created agreements after january  which apply under fin is required effectively immediately 
by june   full consolidation of assets and liabilities of applicable entities is required 
we do not expect the adoption of this interpretation to have a material impact to our results of operations or financial position 
however  changes in our business relationships with various entities could occur which may impact our financial statements under the requirements of fin risk factors our future operating results may vary substantially from period to period 
the price of our common stock will fluctuate in the future  and an investment in our common stock is subject to a variety of risks  including but not limited to the specific risks identified below 
the risks described below are not the only ones facing our company 
additional risks not presently known to us  or that we currently deem immaterial  may become important factors that impair our business operations 
inevitably  some investors in our securities will experience gains while others will experience losses depending on the prices at which they purchase and sell securities 
prospective and existing investors are strongly urged to carefully consider the various cautionary statements and risks set forth in this report and our other public filings 
risks related to our business because we have a limited operating history  there is limited information upon which you can evaluate our business 
we are still in the early stages of our development  and our limited operating history makes it difficult to evaluate our business and prospects 
any evaluation of our business and prospects must be made in light of the risks and uncertainties often encountered by early stage companies in internet related markets 
we were incorporated in july and first recorded revenue in february thus  we have a limited operating history upon which you can evaluate our business and prospects 
due to our limited operating history  it is difficult or impossible to predict future results of operations 
for example  we cannot forecast operating expenses based on our historical results or those of similar companies because they are limited  and we are required to forecast expenses in part on future revenue projections based on assumptions 
moreover  due to our limited operating history and evolving product offerings  our insights into trends that may emerge and affect our business are limited 
in addition  our business is subject to a number of risks  any of which could unexpectedly harm our results of operations 
many of these risks are discussed in the subheadings below  and include our ability to attract more customers and retain existing customers  implement our sales  marketing and after sales service initiatives  both domestically and internationally  execute our product development activities  anticipate and adapt to the changing markets  attract  retain and motivate qualified personnel  respond to actions taken by our competitors  continue to build an infrastructure to effectively manage growth and handle any future increased usage  and integrate acquired businesses  technologies  products and services 
our quarterly revenues and operating results may fluctuate in future periods and we may fail to meet the expectations of investors and public market analysts  which could cause the price of our common stock to decline 
our quarterly revenues and operating results are difficult to predict and may fluctuate significantly from quarter to quarter particularly because our products and services are relatively new and our prospects are uncertain 
we believe that period to period comparisons of our operating results may not be meaningful and you should not rely on these comparisons as an indication of our future performance 
if quarterly revenues or operating results fall below the expectations of investors or public market analysts  the price of our common stock could decline substantially 
factors that might cause quarterly fluctuations in our operating results include the factors described under the subheadings of this risks factors section as well as the evolving and varying demand for our customer communication software products and services for e businesses  budget and spending decisions by information technology departments of our customers  our ability to manage our expenses  the timing of new releases of our products  changes in our pricing policies or those of our competitors  the timing of execution of large contracts that materially affect our operating results  uncertainty regarding the timing of the implementation cycle for our products  changes in the level of sales of professional services as compared to product licenses  the mix of sales channels through which our products and services are sold  the mix of our domestic and international sales  costs related to the customization of our products  our ability to expand our operations  and the amount and timing of expenditures related to this expansion  decisions by customers and potential customers to delay purchasing our products  a trend of continuing consolidation in our industry  and global economic and political conditions  as well as those specific to our customers or our industry 
in addition  we experience seasonality in our revenues  with the fourth quarter of the year typically having the highest revenue for the year 
we believe that this seasonality primarily results from customer budgeting cycles 
we expect that this seasonality will continue 
customers decisions to purchase our products and services are discretionary and subject to their internal budgets and purchasing processes 
due to the continuing slowdown in the general economy  we believe that many existing and potential customers are reassessing or reducing their planned technology and internet related investments and deferring purchasing decisions 
further delays or reductions in business spending for information technology could have a material adverse effect on our revenues and operating results 
as a result  there is increased uncertainty with respect to our expected revenues 
our failure to complete our expected sales in any given quarter could materially harm our operating results because of the increasingly large size of many of our orders 
our quarterly revenues are especially subject to fluctuation because they depend on the completion of relatively large orders for our products and related services 
the average size of our license transactions has increased in recent periods as we have focused on larger enterprise customers and on licensing our more comprehensive integrated products and have utilized system integrators in our sales process 
we expect the percentage of larger orders  as compared to total orders  to increase 
for example  during  one customer  ibm  represented of our total revenues 
this dependence on large orders makes our net revenue and operating results more likely to vary from quarter to quarter  and more difficult to predict  because the loss of any particular large order is significant 
as a result  our operating results could suffer if any large orders are delayed or canceled in any future period 
in addition  large orders  and orders obtained through the activities of system integrators  often have longer sales cycles  increasing the difficulty of predicting future revenues 
we expect the concentration of revenues among fewer customers to continue in the future  due to targeting sales opportunities with larger customers who would be interested in purchasing our full suite of products 
our sales cycle is subject to a number of significant risks  including customers budgetary constraints and internal acceptance reviews  over which we have little or no control 
consequently  if sales expected from a specific customer in a particular quarter are not realized in that quarter  we are unlikely to be able to generate revenue from alternate sources in time to compensate for the shortfall 
as a result  and due to the relatively large size of a typical order  a lost or delayed sale could result in revenues that are lower than expected 
moreover  to the extent that significant sales occur earlier than anticipated  revenues for subsequent quarters may be lower than expected 
consequently  we face difficulty predicting the quarter in which sales to expected customers will occur  which contributes to the uncertainty of our future operating results 
in recent periods  we have experienced an increase in the size of our typical orders  and in the length of a typical sales cycle 
these trends may increase the uncertainty of our future operating results and reduce our ability to anticipate our future revenues 
our expenses are generally fixed and we will not be able to reduce these expenses quickly if we fail to meet our revenue forecasts 
most of our expenses  such as employee compensation and rent  are relatively fixed in the short term 
moreover  our budget is based  in part  upon our expectations regarding future revenue levels 
as a result  if total revenues for a particular quarter are below expectations  we could not proportionately reduce operating expenses for that quarter 
accordingly  such a revenue shortfall would have a disproportionate effect on our expected operating results for that quarter 
we may not be able to forecast our revenues accurately because our products have a long and variable sales cycle 
the long sales cycle for our products may cause license revenue and operating results to vary significantly from period to period 
to date  the sales cycle for our products has taken anywhere from to months in the united states and longer in foreign countries 
consequently  we face difficulty predicting the quarter in which expected sales will actually occur 
this contributes to fluctuations in our future operating results 
our sales cycle has required pre purchase evaluation by a significant number of individuals in our customers organizations 
along with third parties that often jointly market our software with us  we invest significant amounts of time and resources educating and providing information to prospective customers regarding the use and benefits of our products 
many of our customers evaluate our software slowly and deliberately  depending on the specific technical capabilities of the customer  the size of the deployment  the complexity of the customer s network environment  and the quantity of hardware and the degree of hardware configuration necessary to deploy our products 
in the event that the present economic downturn were to continue  the sales cycle for our products may become longer and we may require more resources to complete sales 
we have a history of losses and may not be profitable in the future and may not be able to generate sufficient revenue to achieve and maintain profitability 
since we began operations in  our revenues have not been sufficient to support our operations  and we have incurred substantial operating losses in every quarter 
as of december   our accumulated deficit was approximately billion  which includes approximately billion related to goodwill impairment charges 
our history of losses has previously caused some of our potential customers to question our viability  which has in turn hampered our ability to sell some of our products 
additionally  our revenue has been affected by the increasingly uncertain economic conditions both generally and in our market 
as a result of these conditions  we have experienced and expect to continue to experience difficulties in collecting outstanding receivables from our customers and attracting new customers  which means that we may continue to experience losses  even if sales of our products and services grow 
although we have restructured our operations to reduce operating expenses  we continue to commit a substantial investment of resources to sales and marketing  developing new products and enhancements  and expanding our operations domestically and internationally  and we will need to increase our revenue to achieve profitability and positive cash flows 
as a result  our revenue may decline  or fail to grow  in future periods 
our expectations as to when we can achieve positive cash flows  and as to our future cash balances  are subject to a number of assumptions  including assumptions regarding improvements in general economic conditions and customer purchasing and payment patterns  many of which are beyond our control 
we reduced the size of our professional services team in and now customers rely more on independent third party providers for customer services such as product installations and support rather than purchasing those services from us 
however  if third parties do not provide the support our customers need  we may be required to hire subcontractors to provide these professional services 
increased use of subcontractors would harm our revenues and margins because it costs us more to hire subcontractors to perform these services than to provide the services ourselves 
we rely on marketing  technology and distribution relationships for the sale  installation and support of our products that may generally be terminated at any time  and if our current and future relationships are not successful  our growth might be limited 
we rely on marketing and technology relationships with a variety of companies that  in part  generate leads for the sale of our products 
these marketing and technology relationships include relationships with systems integrators and consulting firms  vendors of e commerce and internet software  vendors of software designed for customer relationship management or for management of organizations operational information  vendors of key technology and platforms  and demographic data providers 
if we cannot maintain successful marketing and technology relationships or if we fail to enter into additional marketing and technology relationships  we could have difficulty expanding the sales of our products and our growth might be limited 
while some of these companies do not resell or distribute our products  we believe that many of our direct sales are the result of leads generated by vendors of e business and enterprise software and we expect to continue relying heavily on sales from these relationships in future periods 
our marketing and technology relationships are generally not documented in writing  or are governed by agreements that can be terminated by either party with little or no prior notice 
in addition  companies with which we have marketing  technology or distribution relationships may promote products of several different companies including those of our competitors 
if these companies choose not to promote our products or if they develop  market or recommend software applications that compete with our products  our business will be harmed 
in addition  we rely on distributors  value added resellers  systems integrators  consultants and other third party resellers to recommend our products and to install and support these products 
our reduction in the size of our professional services team in increased our customers reliance on third parties for product installations and support 
if the companies providing these services fail to implement our products successfully for our customers  we might be unable to complete implementation on the schedule required by the customers and we may have increased customer dissatisfaction or difficulty making future sales as a result 
we might not be able to maintain these relationships and enter into additional relationships that will provide timely and cost effective customer support and service 
if we cannot maintain successful relationships with our indirect sales channel partners around the world  we might have difficulty expanding the sales of our products and our international growth could be limited 
if we fail to expand our direct and indirect sales channels  we will not be able to increase revenues 
in order to grow our business  we need to increase market awareness and sales of our products and services 
to achieve this goal  we need to increase the size  and enhance the productivity  of our direct sales force and indirect sales channels 
if we fail to do so  this failure could harm our ability to increase revenues 
the expansion of our sales and marketing department will require the hiring and retention of personnel for whom there is a high demand 
we plan to hire additional sales personnel  but competition for qualified sales people is intense  and we might not be able to hire a sufficient number of qualified sales people 
furthermore  while historically we have received substantially all of our revenues from direct sales  we increased our reliance on sales through indirect sales channels by selling our software through systems integrators  or si s 
we depend on these relationships to promote our products and drive sales  particularly in light of our reductions in direct sales personnel 
our business depends on our ability to create and maintain relationships with si s and any failure to do so would impair our sales efforts and revenue growth 
if systems integrators fail to adequately promote our products  our sales and revenue would be impaired 
a significant percentage of our revenues depend on the efforts of sis and their recommendations of our products  and we expect an increasing percentage of our revenues to be derived from our relationships with sis that market and sell our products 
if sis do not successfully market our products  our operating results will be materially harmed 
in addition  many of our direct sales are to customers that will be relying on sis to implement our products  and if sis are not familiar with our technology or able to successfully implement our products  our operating results will be materially harmed 
we expect to continue building our network of sis and other indirect sales channels and  if this strategy is successful  our dependence on the efforts of these third parties for revenue growth and customer service will increase 
our reliance on third parties for these functions will reduce our control over such activities and reduce our ability to perform such functions internally 
if we come to rely primarily on a single si that subsequently terminates its relationship with us  becomes insolvent or is acquired by another company with which we have no relationship  or decides not to support our products  we may not be able to internally generate sufficient revenue or increase the revenues generated by our other si relationships to offset the resulting lost revenues 
furthermore  sis typically offer our solution in combination with other products and services  some of which may compete with our solution 
sis are not required to sell any fixed quantities of our products  are not bound to sell our products exclusively  and may act as indirect sales channels for our competitors 
difficulties in implementing our products could harm our revenues and margins 
we generally recognize revenue from a customer sale when persuasive evidence of an agreement exists  the product has been delivered  the arrangement does not involve significant customization of the software  the license fee is fixed or determinable and collection of the fee is probable 
since the fourth quarter of  we typically do not provide a significant portion of implementation services to our customers 
instead  our customers typically purchase such services from third party providers 
however  some implementation services may be purchased from us 
if an arrangement requires significant customization or implementation services from kana  recognition of the associated license and service revenue could be delayed 
the timing of the commencement and completion of the these services is subject to factors that may be beyond our control  as this process requires access to the customer s facilities and coordination with the customer s personnel after delivery of the software 
in addition  customers could delay product implementations 
implementation typically involves working with sophisticated software  computing and communications systems 
if we experience difficulties with implementation or do not meet project milestones in a timely manner  we could be obligated to devote more customer support  engineering and other resources to a particular project 
some customers may also require us to develop customized features or capabilities 
if new or existing customers have difficulty deploying our products or require significant amounts of our professional services support or customized features  our revenue recognition could be further delayed and our costs could increase  causing increased variability in our operating results 
we may incur non cash charges resulting from acquisitions and equity issuances  which could harm our operating results 
in connection with outstanding stock options and warrants to purchase shares of our common stock  as well as other equity rights we may issue  we are incurring and may incur substantial charges for stock based compensation 
accordingly  significant increases in our stock price could result in substantial non cash charges and variations in our results of operations 
for example  in the first quarter of  we incurred a stock based compensation charge of approximately million associated with warrants issued pursuant to an equity financing agreement that was terminated 
furthermore  we will continue to incur charges to reflect amortization and any impairment of identified intangible assets acquired in connection with our acquisition of silknet  and we may make other acquisitions or issue additional warrants  shares of common stock or other securities in the future that could result in further accounting charges 
in addition  a new standard for accounting for goodwill acquired in a business combination has recently been adopted 
this new standard requires recognition of goodwill as an asset but does not permit amortization of goodwill 
instead goodwill must be separately tested for impairment 
as a result  our goodwill amortization charges ceased in however  in the future  we may incur less frequent  but potentially larger  impairment charges related to the goodwill already recorded  as well as goodwill arising out of any future acquisitions 
for example  we performed a goodwill impairment analysis as of june   which resulted in a million impairment expense to reduce goodwill 
current and future accounting charges like these could result in significant losses and delay our achievement of profitability 
the reductions in workforce associated with our cost reduction initiatives may adversely affect the morale and performance of our personnel and our ability to hire new personnel 
in connection with our effort to streamline operations  reduce costs and bring our staffing and cost structure in line with industry standards  we restructured our organization in  an effort that included substantial reductions in our workforce 
in addition  in january  we began implementing an outsourcing strategy  which involves subcontracting a significant portion of our software programming  quality assurance and technical documentation activities to development partners with staffing in india and china 
as a result of the first phase of this strategy  in the first quarter of we transferred the responsibilities of us based employees to these development partners 
we expect to transfer additional positions to these development partners in future quarters of there have been and may continue to be substantial costs associated with the workforce reductions  including severance and other employee related costs  and our restructuring plan may yield unanticipated consequences  such as attrition beyond our planned reduction in workforce 
as a result of these staff reductions  our ability to respond to unexpected challenges may be impaired and we may be unable to take advantage of new opportunities 
we also reduced our employees salaries in the fourth quarter of  and to a lesser extent  in the third quarter of  in order to bring employee compensation in line with current market conditions 
if market conditions change  we may find it necessary to raise salaries in the future beyond the anticipated levels  or issue additional stock based compensation  which would be dilutive to shareholders 
in addition  many of the employees who were terminated possessed specific knowledge or expertise that may prove to have been important to our operations 
in that case  their absence may create significant difficulties 
this personnel reduction may also subject us to the risk of litigation  which may adversely impact our ability to conduct our operations and may cause us to incur significant expense 
we may be unable to hire and retain the skilled personnel necessary to develop and grow our business 
our reductions in force and salary levels may reduce employee morale and may create concern among existing employees about job security  which could lead to increased turnover and reduce our ability to meet the needs of our current and future customers 
as a result of the reductions in force  we may also need to increase our staff to support new customers and the expanding needs of our existing customers 
because our stock price has recently suffered a significant decline  stock based compensation  including options to purchase our common stock  may have diminished effectiveness as employee hiring and retention devices 
if we are unable to retain qualified personnel  we could face disruptions to operations  loss of key information  expertise or know how and unanticipated additional recruitment and training costs 
if employee turnover increases  our ability to provide client service and execute our strategy would be negatively affected 
our ability to increase revenues in the future depends considerably upon our success in recruiting  training and retaining additional direct sales personnel and the success of our direct sales force 
we might not be successful in these efforts 
our products and services require sophisticated sales efforts 
there is a shortage of sales personnel with the requisite qualifications  and competition for such qualified personnel is intense in our industry 
also  it may take a new salesperson a number of months to become a productive member of our sales force 
our business will be harmed if we fail to hire or retain qualified sales personnel  or if newly hired salespeople fail to develop the necessary sales skills or develop these skills more slowly than anticipated 
we face substantial competition and may not be able to compete effectively 
the market for our products and services is intensely competitive  evolving and subject to rapid technological change 
in recent periods  some of our competitors reduced the prices of their products and services substantially in certain cases in order to obtain new customers 
competitive pressures could make it difficult for us to acquire and retain customers and could require us to reduce the price of our products 
our customers requirements and the technology available to satisfy those requirements are continually changing 
therefore  we must be able to respond to these changes in order to remain competitive 
changes in our products may also make it more difficult for our sales force to sell effectively 
in addition  changes in customers demand for the specific products  product features and services of other companies may result in our products becoming uncompetitive 
we expect the intensity of competition to increase in the future 
increased competition may result in price reductions  reduced gross margins and loss of market share 
we may not be able to compete successfully against current and future competitors  and competitive pressures may seriously harm our business 
our competitors vary in size and in the scope and breadth of products and services offered 
we currently face competition for our products from systems designed by in house and third party development efforts 
we expect that these systems will continue to be a major source of competition for the foreseeable future 
our primary competitors for ecrm platforms are larger  more established companies such as siebel systems  inc and peoplesoft  inc  and to a lesser extent  oracle and sap 
we also face competition from e 
piphany  inc  chordiant software  inc  primus knowledge solutions and pegasystems  inc with respect to specific applications we offer 
we may face increased competition upon introduction of new products or upgrades from competitors  or if we expand our product line through acquisition of complementary businesses or otherwise 
as we have combined and enhanced our product lines to offer a more comprehensive e business software solution  we are increasingly competing with large  established providers of customer management and communication solutions as well as other competitors 
our combined product line may not be sufficient to successfully compete with the product offerings available from these companies  which could slow our growth and harm our business 
many of our competitors have longer operating histories  significantly greater financial  technical  marketing and other resources  significantly greater name recognition and a larger installed base of customers than we have 
in addition  many of our competitors have well established relationships with our current and potential customers and have extensive knowledge of our industry 
we may lose potential customers to competitors for various reasons  including the ability or willingness of competitors to offer lower prices and other incentives that we cannot match 
it is possible that new competitors or alliances among competitors may emerge and rapidly acquire significant market share 
we also expect that competition will increase as a result of recent industry consolidations  as well as anticipated future consolidations 
our stock price has been highly volatile and has experienced a significant decline  and may continue to be volatile and decline 
the trading price of our common stock has fluctuated widely in the past and is expected to continue to do so in the future  as a result of a number of factors  many of which are outside our control  such as variations in our actual and anticipated operating results  changes in our earnings estimates by analysts  the volatility inherent in stock prices within the emerging sector within which we conduct business  and the volume of trading in our common stock  including sales of substantial amounts of common stock issued upon the exercise of outstanding options and warrants 
in addition  the stock market  particularly the nasdaq national market  has experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have affected the market prices of many technology and computer software companies  particularly internet related companies 
such fluctuations have often been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of these companies 
these broad market fluctuations could adversely affect the market price of our common stock 
in the past  following periods of volatility in the market price of a particular company s securities  securities class action litigation has often been brought against that company 
securities class action litigation could result in substantial costs and a diversion of our management s attention and resources 
since becoming a publicly traded security listed on nasdaq in september  our common stock has reached a closing high of  per share and closing low of per share 
the last reported sale price of our shares on march  was per share 
under nasdaq s listing maintenance standards  if the closing bid price of our common stock is under per share for consecutive trading days  nasdaq may choose to notify us that it may delist our common stock from the nasdaq national market 
if the closing bid price of our common stock does not thereafter regain compliance for a minimum of consecutive trading days during the days following notification by nasdaq  nasdaq may delist our common stock from trading on the nasdaq national market 
there can be no assurance that our common stock will remain eligible for trading on the nasdaq national market 
if our stock were delisted  the ability of our shareholders to sell any of our common stock at all would be severely  if not completely  limited  causing our stock price to continue to decline 
our business depends on the acceptance of our products and services  and it is uncertain whether the market will accept our products and services 
our ability to achieve increased revenue depends on overall demand for e business software and related services  and in particular for customer relationship applications 
we expect that our future growth will depend significantly on revenue from licenses of our e business applications and related services 
market acceptance of these products will depend on the growth of the market for e business solutions 
our assumptions regarding the size and growth of this market are based on assumptions that both companies and their customes will increasingly elect to communciate via the internet and  consequently  that companies doing business on the internet will demand real time sales and customer service technology and related services 
our future financial performance will depend on the growth of internet customer interactions  and on successful development  introduction and customer acceptance of new and enhanced versions of our products and services 
in the future  we may not be successful in marketing our products and services  including any new or enhanced products 
the demand for of our products also depends in part on the widespread adoption and use of these products by customer support personnel 
some of our customers who have made initial purchases of this software have deferred or suspended implementation of these products due to slower than expected rates of internal adoption by customer support personnel 
if more customers decide to defer or suspend implementation of these products in the future  our ability to increase our revenue from these customers through additional licenses or maintenance agreements will also be impaired  and our financial position could be seriously harmed 
we depend on increased business from new customers  and if we fail to grow our customer base or generate repeat business  our operating results could be harmed 
our business model generally depends on the sale of our products to new customers as well as on expanded use of our products within our customers organizations 
if we fail to grow our customer base or generate repeat and expanded business from our current and future customers  our business and operating results will be seriously harmed 
in some cases  our customers initially make a limited purchase of our products and services for pilot programs 
these customers may not purchase additional licenses to expand their use of our products 
if these customers do not successfully develop and deploy initial applications based on our products  they may choose not to purchase deployment licenses or additional development licenses 
in addition  as we introduce new versions of our products or new product lines  our current customers might not require the functionality of our new products and might not ultimately license these products 
because the total amount of maintenance and support fees we receive in any period depends in large part on the size and number of licenses that we have previously sold  any downturn in our software license revenue would negatively affect our future services revenue 
in addition  if customers elect not to renew their maintenance agreements  our services revenue could decline significantly 
further  some of our customers are internet based companies  which have been forced to significantly reduce their operations in light of limited access to sources of financing and the current economic slowdown 
if customers were unable to pay for their current products or are unwilling to purchase additional products  our revenues would decline 
if we fail to respond to changing customer preferences in our market  demand for our products and our ability to enhance our revenues will suffer 
if we do not continue to improve our products and develop new products that keep pace with competitive product introductions and technological developments  satisfy diverse and rapidly evolving customer requirements and achieve market acceptance  we might be unable to attract new customers 
the development of proprietary technology and necessary service enhancements entails significant technical and business risks and requires substantial expenditures and lead time 
we might not be successful in marketing and supporting recently released versions of our products  or developing and marketing other product enhancements and new products that respond to technological advances and market changes  on a timely or cost effective basis 
in addition  even if these products are developed and released  they might not achieve market acceptance 
we have experienced delays in releasing new products and product enhancements in the past and could experience similar delays in the future 
these delays or problems in the installation or implementation of our new releases could cause us to lose customers 
our failure to manage multiple technologies and technological change could reduce demand for our products 
rapidly changing technology and operating systems  changes in customer requirements  and evolving industry standards might impede market acceptance of our products 
our products are designed based upon currently prevailing technology to work on a variety of hardware and software platforms used by our customers 
however  our software may not operate correctly on evolving versions of hardware and software platforms  programming languages  database environments and other systems that our customers use 
if new technologies emerge that are incompatible with our products  or if competing products emerge that are based on new technologies or new industry standards and that perform better or cost less than our products  our key products could become obsolete and our existing and potential customers could seek alternatives to our products 
we must constantly modify and improve our products to keep pace with changes made to these platforms and to database systems and other back office applications and internet related applications 
for example  our analytics products were designed to work with databases such as oracle and microsoft sql server 
any changes to those databases  or increasing popularity of other databases  could require us to modify our analytics products  and could cause us to delay releasing future products and enhancements 
furthermore  software adapters are necessary to integrate our analytics products with other systems and data sources used by our customers 
we must develop and update these adapters to reflect changes to these systems and data sources in order to maintain the functionality provided by our products 
as a result  uncertainties related to the timing and nature of new product announcements  introductions or modifications by vendors of operating systems  databases  customer relationship management software  web servers and other enterprise and internet based applications could delay our product development  increase our product development expense or cause customers to delay evaluation  purchase and deployment of our analytics products 
if we fail to modify or improve our products in response to evolving industry standards  our products could rapidly become obsolete 
failure to license necessary third party software incorporated in our products could cause delays or reductions in our sales 
we license third party software that we incorporate into our products 
these licenses may not continue to be available on commercially reasonable terms or at all 
some of this technology would be difficult to replace 
the loss of any such license could result in delays or reductions of our applications until we identify  license and integrate or develop equivalent software 
if we are required to enter into license agreements with third parties for replacement technology  we could face higher royalty payments and our products may lose certain attributes or features 
in the future  we might need to license other software to enhance our products and meet evolving customer needs 
if we are unable to do this  we could experience reduced demand for our products 
failure to develop new products or enhancements to existing products on a timely basis would hurt our sales and damage our reputation 
to be competitive  we must develop and introduce on a timely basis new products and product enhancements for companies with significant e business customer interactions needs 
our ability to deliver competitive products may be negatively affected by the diversion of resources to development of our suite of products  and responding to changes in competitive products and in the demands of our customers 
if we experience product delays in the future  we may face customer dissatisfaction  cancellation of orders and license agreements  negative publicity  loss of revenues  slower market acceptance  and legal action by customers 
furthermore  delays in bringing new products or enhancements to market can result  for example  from potential difficulties with managing outsourced research and development  including overseeing such activities occurring in india and china or from loss of institutional knowledge through reductions in force  or the existence of defects in new products or their enhancements 
the challenges of developing new products and enhancements require us to commit a substantial investment of resources  and we might not be able to develop or introduce new products on a timely or cost effective basis  or at all  which could be exploited by our competitors and lead potential customers to choose alternative products 
our pending patents may never be issued and  even if issued  may provide little protection 
our success and ability to compete depend to a significant degree upon the protection of our software and other proprietary technology rights 
we regard the protection of patentable inventions as important to our future opportunities 
we currently have three issued us patents and multiple us patent applications pending relating to our software 
although we have filed international patent applications corresponding to some of our us patent applications  none of our technology is patented outside of the united states 
it is possible that our pending patent applications may not result in the issuance of patents  any issued patents may not be broad enough to protect our proprietary rights  any issued patents could be successfully challenged by one or more third parties  which could result in our loss of the right to prevent others from exploiting the inventions claimed in those patents  current and future competitors may independently develop similar technology  duplicate our products or design around any of our patents  and effective patent protection may not be available in every country in which we do business 
we rely upon trademarks  copyrights and trade secrets to protect our proprietary rights  which may not be sufficient to protect our intellectual property 
we also rely on a combination of laws  such as copyright  trademark and trade secret laws  and contractual restrictions  such as confidentiality agreements and licenses  to establish and protect our proprietary rights 
however  despite the precautions that we have taken laws and contractual restrictions may not be sufficient to prevent misappropriation of our technology or deter others from developing similar technologies  current federal laws that prohibit software copying provide only limited protection from software pirates  and effective trademark  copyright and trade secret protection may be unavailable or limited in foreign countries  other companies may claim common law trademark rights based upon state or foreign laws that precede the federal registration of our marks  and policing unauthorized use of our products and trademarks is difficult  expensive and time consuming  and we may be unable to determine the extent of this unauthorized use 
also  the laws of other countries in which we market our products may offer little or no effective protection of our proprietary technology 
reverse engineering  unauthorized copying or other misappropriation of our proprietary technology could enable third parties to benefit from our technology without paying us for it  which would significantly harm our business 
we may become involved in litigation over proprietary rights  which could be costly and time consuming 
substantial litigation regarding intellectual property rights exists in our industry 
we expect that software in our industry may be increasingly subject to third party infringement claims as the number of competitors grows and the functionality of products in different industry segments overlaps 
some of our competitors in the market for customer communications software may have filed or may intend to file patent applications covering aspects of their technology that they may claim our technology infringes 
such competitors could make a claim of infringement against us with respect to our products and technology 
third parties may currently have  or may eventually be issued  patents upon which our current or future products or technology infringe 
any of these third parties might make a claim of infringement against us 
for example  we have been contacted by a company that has asked us to evaluate the need for a license of certain patents that this company holds  relating to certain call center applications 
although the patent holder has not filed any claims against us  we cannot assure you that it will not do so in the future 
the patent holder may also have applications on file in the united states covering related subject matter  which are confidential until the patent or patents  if any  are issued 
many of our software license agreements require us to indemnify our customers from any claim or finding of intellectual property infringement 
we periodically receive notices from customers regarding patent license inquiries they have received which may or may not implicate our indemnity obligations  and currently we are assuming defense of a recently filed patent infringement case against one such customer 
this case was filed subsequent to december  and we intend to defend it vigorously 
as an additional example  tumbleweed communications corp 
filed suit against our customer ameritrade  inc alleging infringement of a patent  and seeking injunctive relief  damages and attorneys fees 
any litigation  brought by others  or us could result in the expenditure of significant financial resources and the diversion of management s time and efforts 
in addition  litigation in which we are accused of infringement might cause product shipment delays  require us to develop non infringing technology or require us to enter into royalty or license agreements  which might not be available on acceptable terms  or at all 
if a successful claim of infringement were made against us and we could not develop non infringing technology or license the infringed or similar technology on a timely and cost effective basis  our business could be significantly harmed 
we may face higher costs and lost sales if our software contains errors 
we face the possibility of higher costs as a result of the complexity of our products and the potential for undetected errors 
due to the mission critical nature of many of our products and services  errors are of particular concern 
in the past  we have discovered software errors in some of our products after their introduction 
we have only a few beta customers that test new features and functionality of our software before we make these features and functionalities generally available to our customers 
if we are not able to detect and correct errors in our products or releases before commencing commercial shipments  we could face loss of or delay in revenues expected from the new product and an immediate and significant loss of market share  loss of existing customers that upgrade to the new product and of new customers  failure to achieve market acceptance  diversion of development resources  injury to our reputation  increased service and warranty costs  legal actions by customers  and increased insurance costs 
we may face liability claims that could result in unexpected costs and damages to our reputation 
our licenses with customers generally contain provisions designed to limit our exposure to potential product liability claims  such as disclaimers of warranties and limitations on liability for special  consequential and incidental damages 
in addition  our license agreements generally cap the amounts recoverable for damages to the amounts paid by the licensee to us for the product or service giving rise to the damages 
however  all domestic and international jurisdictions may not enforce these contractual limitations on liability 
we may be subject to claims based on errors in our software or mistakes in performing our services including claims relating to damages to our customers internal systems 
a product liability claim could divert the attention of management and key personnel  could be expensive to defend and could result in adverse settlements and judgments 
in april  office depot  inc filed a complaint against kana claiming that kana breached its license agreement with office depot 
office depot is seeking relief in the form of a refund of license fees and maintenance fees paid to kana  attorneys fees and costs 
we believe we have meritorious defenses to these claims and intend to defend the action vigorously 
growth in our international operations exposes us to additional risks 
sales outside north america represented of our total revenues in  of our total revenues in the  and of our revenues in we have established offices in the united kingdom  germany  japan  the netherlands  france  belgium  australia  hong kong and south korea 
sales outside north america could increase as a percentage of total revenues as we attempt to expand our international operations 
any expansion of our existing international operations and entry into additional international markets will require significant management attention and financial resources  as well as additional support personnel 
for any such expansion  we will also need to  among other things expand our international sales channel management and support organizations and develop relationships with international service providers and additional distributors and system integrators 
in addition  as international operations become a larger part of our business  we could encounter  on average  greater difficulty with collecting accounts receivable  longer sales cycles and collection periods  greater seasonal reductions in business activity and increases in our tax rates 
furthermore  products must be localized  or customized to meet the needs of local users  before they can be sold in particular foreign countries 
developing localized versions of our products for foreign markets is difficult and can take longer than we anticipate 
we have only licensed our products internationally since january and have limited experience in developing localized versions of our software and marketing and distributing them internationally 
our investments in establishing facilities in other countries may not produce desired levels of revenues 
even if we are able to expand our international operations successfully  we may not be able to maintain or increase international market demand for our products 
international laws and regulations may expose us to potential costs and litigation 
our international operations increase our exposure to international laws and regulations 
if we cannot comply with foreign laws and regulations  which are often complex and subject to variation and unexpected changes  we could incur unexpected costs and potential litigation 
for example  the governments of foreign countries might attempt to regulate our products and services or levy sales or other taxes relating to our activities 
in addition  foreign countries may impose tariffs  duties  price controls or other restrictions on foreign currencies or trade barriers  any of which could make it more difficult for us to conduct our business 
the european union has enacted its own privacy regulations that may result in limits on the collection and use of certain user information  which  if applied to the sale of our products and services  could negatively impact our results of operations 
we may suffer foreign exchange rate losses 
our international revenues and expenses are denominated in local currency 
therefore  a weakening of other currencies compared to the us dollar could make our products less competitive in foreign markets and could negatively affect our operating results and cash flows 
we have not yet experienced  but may in the future experience  significant foreign currency transaction losses  especially because we do not engage in currency hedging 
as the international component of our revenues grows  our results of operations will become more sensitive to foreign exchange rate fluctuations 
if our operations require more cash than anticipated  failure to obtain needed financing could affect our ability to maintain current operations and pursue future growth  and the terms of any financing we obtain may impair the rights of our existing stockholders 
in the future  we may be required to seek additional financing to fund our operations or growth 
our operating activities used million of cash in factors such as the commercial success of our existing products and services  the timing and success of any new products and services  the progress of our research and development efforts  our results of operations  the status of competitive products and services  and the timing and success of potential strategic alliances or potential opportunities to acquire or sell technologies or assets may require us to seek additional funding sooner than we expect 
in the event that we require additional cash  we may not be able to secure additional financing on terms that are acceptable to us  especially in the uncertain market climate  and we may not be successful in implementing or negotiating such other arrangements to improve our cash position 
if we raise additional funds through the issuance of equity or convertible debt securities  the percentage ownership of our stockholders would be reduced and the securities we issue might have rights  preferences and privileges senior to those of our current stockholders 
if adequate funds were not available on acceptable terms  our ability to achieve or sustain positive cash flows  maintain current operations  fund any potential expansion  take advantage of unanticipated opportunities  develop or enhance products or services  or otherwise respond to competitive pressures would be significantly limited 
if we acquire companies  products or technologies  we may face risks associated with those acquisitions 
if we are presented with appropriate opportunities  we may make other investments in complementary companies  products or technologies 
we may not realize the anticipated benefits of any other acquisition or investment 
if we acquire another company  we will likely face risks  uncertainties and disruptions associated with the integration process  including  among other things  difficulties in the integration of the operations  technologies and services of the acquired company  the diversion of our management s attention from other business concerns and the potential loss of key employees of the acquired businesses 
if we fail to successfully integrate other companies that we may acquire  our business could be harmed 
furthermore  we may have to incur debt or issue equity securities to pay for any additional future acquisitions or investments  the issuance of which could be dilutive to our existing stockholders or us 
in addition  our operating results may suffer because of acquisition related costs or amortization expenses or charges relating to acquired goodwill and other intangible assets 
the role of acquisitions in our future growth may be limited  which could seriously harm our continued operations 
in the past  acquisitions have been an important part of the growth strategy for us 
to gain access to key technologies  new products and broader customer bases  we have acquired companies in exchange for shares of our common stock 
because the recent trading prices of our common stock have been significantly lower than in the past  the role of acquisitions in our growth may be substantially limited 
if we are unable to acquire companies in exchange for our common stock  we may not have access to new customers  needed technological advances or new products and enhancements to existing products 
this would substantially impair our ability to respond to market opportunities 
we have adopted anti takeover defenses that could delay or prevent an acquisition of the company 
our board of directors has the authority to issue up to  shares of preferred stock 
without any further vote or action on the part of the stockholders  the board of directors has the authority to determine the price  rights  preferences  privileges and restrictions of the preferred stock 
this preferred stock  if issued  might have preference over and harm the rights of the holders of common stock 
although the issuance of this preferred stock will provide us with flexibility in connection with possible acquisitions and other corporate purposes  this issuance may make it more difficult for a third party to acquire a majority of our outstanding voting stock 
we currently have no plans to issue preferred stock 
our certificate of incorporation  bylaws and equity compensation plans include provisions that may deter an unsolicited offer to purchase us 
these provisions  coupled with the provisions of the delaware general corporation law  may delay or impede a merger  tender offer or proxy contest involving us 
furthermore  our board of directors is divided into three classes  only one of which is elected each year 
directors are removable by the affirmative vote of at least of all classes of voting stock 
these factors may further delay or prevent a change of control of us 
risks related to our industry if the internet and web based communications fail to grow and be accepted as media of communication  demand for our products and services will decline 
we sell our products and services primarily to organizations that receive large volumes of e mail and web based communications 
consequently  our future revenues and profits  if any  substantially depend upon the continued acceptance and use of the internet and e mail  which are evolving as media of communication 
rapid growth in the use of the internet and e mail is a recent phenomenon and may not continue 
as a result  a broad base of enterprises that use e mail as a primary means of communication may not develop or be maintained 
in addition  the market may not accept recently introduced products and services that process e mail  including our products and services 
moreover  companies that have already invested significant resources in other methods of communications with customers  such as call centers  may be reluctant to adopt a new strategy that may limit or compete with their existing investments 
consumers and businesses might reject the internet as a viable commercial medium  or be slow to adopt it  for a number of reasons  including potentially inadequate network infrastructure  slow development of enabling technologies  concerns about the security of transactions and confidential information and insufficient commercial support 
the internet infrastructure may not be able to support the demands placed on it by increased internet usage and bandwidth requirements 
in addition  delays in the development or adoption of new standards and protocols required to handle increased levels of internet activity  or increased governmental regulation  could cause the internet to lose its viability as a commercial medium 
if these or any other factors cause use of the internet for business to decline or develop more slowly than expected  demand for our products and services will be reduced 
even if the required infrastructure  standards  protocols or complementary products  services or facilities are developed  we might incur substantial expenses adapting our products to changing or emerging technologies 
future regulation of the internet may slow our growth  resulting in decreased demand for our products and services and increased costs of doing business 
state  federal and foreign regulators could adopt laws and regulations that impose additional burdens on companies that conduct business online 
these laws and regulations could discourage communication by e mail or other web based communications  particularly targeted e mail of the type facilitated by our products  which could reduce demand for our products and services 
the growth and development of the market for online services may prompt calls for more stringent consumer protection laws or laws that may inhibit the use of internet based communications or the information contained in these communications 
the adoption of any additional laws or regulations may decrease the expansion of the internet 
a decline in the growth of the internet  particularly as it relates to online communication  could decrease demand for our products and services and increase our costs of doing business  or otherwise harm our business 
any new legislation or regulations  application of laws and regulations from jurisdictions whose laws do not currently apply to our business  or application of existing laws and regulations to the internet and other online services could increase our costs and harm our growth 
the imposition of sales and other taxes on products sold by our customers over the internet could have a negative effect on online commerce and the demand for our products and services 
the imposition of new sales or other taxes could limit the growth of internet commerce generally and  as a result  the demand for our products and services 
recent federal legislation limits the imposition of state and local taxes on internet related sales until november  congress may choose not to renew this legislation  in which case state and local governments would be free to impose taxes on electronically purchased goods 
we believe that most companies that sell products over the internet do not currently collect sales or other taxes on shipments of their products into states or foreign countries where they are not physically present 
however  one or more states or foreign countries may seek to impose sales or other tax collection obligations on out of jurisdiction companies that engage in e commerce within their jurisdiction 
a successful assertion by one or more states or foreign countries that companies that engage in e commerce within their jurisdiction should collect sales or other taxes on the sale of their products over the internet  even though not physically in the state or country  could indirectly reduce demand for our products 
privacy concerns relating to the internet are increasing  which could result in legislation that negatively affects our business  in reduced sales of our products  or both 
businesses using our products capture information regarding their customers when those customers contact them on line with customer service inquiries 
privacy concerns could cause visitors to resist providing the personal data necessary to allow our customers to use our software products most effectively 
more importantly  even the perception of privacy concerns  whether or not valid  may indirectly inhibit market acceptance of our products 
in addition  legislative or regulatory requirements may heighten these concerns if businesses must notify web site users that the data captured after visiting certain web sites may be used by marketing entities to unilaterally direct product promotion and advertising to that user 
if consumer privacy concerns are not adequately resolved  our business could be harmed 
government regulation that limits our customers use of this information could reduce the demand for our products 
a number of jurisdictions have adopted  or are considering adopting  laws that restrict the use of customer information from internet applications 
the european union has required that its member states adopt legislation that imposes restrictions on the collection and use of personal data  and that limits the transfer of personally identifiable data to countries that do not impose equivalent restrictions 
in the united states  the childrens online privacy protection act was enacted in october this legislation directs the federal trade commission to regulate the collection of data from children on commercial websites 
in addition  the federal trade commission has begun investigations into the privacy practices of businesses that collect information on the internet 
these and other privacy related initiatives could reduce demand for some of the internet applications with which our products operate  and could restrict the use of these products in some e commerce applications 
this could  in turn  reduce demand for these products 
our security could be breached  which could damage our reputation and deter customers from using our services 
we must protect our computer systems and network from physical break ins  security breaches and other disruptive problems caused by the internet or other users 
computer break ins could jeopardize the security of information stored in and transmitted through our computer systems and network  which could adversely affect our ability to retain or attract customers  damage our reputation and subject us to litigation 
we have been in the past  and could be in the future  subject to denial of service  vandalism and other attacks on our systems by internet hackers 
although we intend to continue to implement security technology and establish operational procedures to prevent break ins  damage and failures  these security measures may fail 
our insurance coverage in certain circumstances may be insufficient to cover losses that may result from such events 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we develop products in the united states and sell these products in north america  europe  asia  australia and latin america 
in  revenues from customers outside of the united states approximated of total revenues 
generally  our sales are made in local currency 
as a result  our financial results and cash flows could be affected by factors such as changes in foreign currency exchange rates or weak economic conditions in foreign markets 
we do not currently use derivative instruments to hedge against foreign exchange risk 
our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our investment portfolio 
the primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve principal while at the same time maximizing yields without significantly increasing risk 
at december   our investments consist primarily of short term municipals and commercial paper  which have a weighted average fixed yield rate of 
these all mature within seven months 
we do not consider our cash equivalents to be subject to interest rate risk due to their short maturities 
we are exposed to market risk from fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates  principally from the exchange rate between the us dollar and the euro and british pound 
we manage exposure to variability in foreign currency exchange rates primarily through the use of natural hedges  as both liabilities and assets are denominated in the local currency 
however  different durations in our funding obligations and assets may expose us to the risk of foreign exchange rate fluctuations 
we have not entered into any derivative instrument transactions to manage this risk 
based on our overall foreign currency rate exposure at december   we do not believe that a hypothetical change in foreign currency rates would materially adversely affect our financial position
