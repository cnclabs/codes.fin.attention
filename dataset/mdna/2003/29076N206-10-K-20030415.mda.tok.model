item management s discussion and analysis of financial conditions and results of operations the following discussion should be read together with our financial statements and the notes to those statements and other financial information appearing elsewhere in this report 
our fiscal year ends december overview emagin corporation designs  develops  and markets oled organic light emitting diode on silicon microdisplays and related information technology solutions 
we integrate oled technology with silicon chips to produce high resolution microdisplays smaller than one inch diagonally which  when viewed through a magnifier  create a virtual image that appears comparable to that of a computer monitor or a large screen television 
we shipped initial samples of our first commercial microdisplay product in march we are now accepting orders and shipping larger quantities of our first two commercial microdisplay products 
these products are being applied or considered for near eye and headset applications in products such as entertainment and gaming headsets  handheld internet and telecommunication appliances  viewfinders  and wearable computers to be manufactured by original equipment manufacturer oem customers 
company history emagin corporation was originally incorporated as fashion dynamics corporation on january  under the laws of the state of nevada 
for the three years prior its acquisition of fed corporation  fashion dynamics corporation had no active business operations  and sought to acquire an interest in a business with long term growth potential 
on march   fashion dynamics corporation acquired fed corporation derived from field emissive device  subsequently changed its name to emagin corporation derived from electronic imaging and listed its common stock on the american stock exchange under the ema trading symbol 
under the terms of the merger agreement that facilitated our acquisition of fed corporation  fashion dynamics corporation issued approximately million shares of its common stock to fed corporation shareholders and issued approximately million options and warrants in exchange for existing fed options and warrants 
the total purchase price of the transaction was approximately million  including million of value relating to the shares issued at a fair value of per share  the value of a simultaneous private placement transaction of similar securities  million of value relating to the options and warrants exchanged and million of assumed liabilities 
the transaction was accounted for using the purchase method of accounting 
under the purchase method of accounting  the assets and liabilities were recorded based upon their fair values at the date of acquisition as determined by an independent appraisal 
since for the three year period prior to the acquisition of fed corporation  fashion dynamics corporation had no active business operations  management believes that the comparison of emagin s financial results to that of the operating entity fed corporation provides the most meaningful comparative information to the reader 
accordingly  the following comparative information reflects the operating results of fed corporation for all periods prior to the merger and it should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto 
the comparison of financial information below for the period ended december  reflects pro forma results of emagin for the period january  through december  and its predecessor fed corporation for the period january  to march   on a combined basis  such that the amounts presented and discussed reflect the full year of operations for each period 
reference is made to our consolidated financial statements included herein for further detail on the results of emagin and fed corporation for their respective periods of ownership 
at our annual meeting of stockholders held on july   the stockholders approved the reincorporation of emagin corporation as a delaware corporation 
the reincorporation became effective on july  by merging emagin corporation  a nevada corporation emagin nevada  into its then wholly owned subsidiary  emagin corporation  a delaware corporation formerly known as fed corporation as described above emagin delaware 
upon completion of this merger  emagin nevada ceased to exist as a corporate entity and emagin delaware succeeded to the assets and liabilities of emagin nevada 
under the merger agreement for the reincorporation  each outstanding share of emagin nevada common stock was automatically converted into one share of emagin delaware common stock at the time the merger became effective 
there has been no interruption in the trading of our common stock as a result of the reincorporation 
the reincorporation also resulted in the implementation of a new certificate of incorporation and by laws for the company  as the existing certificate of incorporation and by laws of emagin delaware continues as the certificate of incorporation and by laws of the company and has replaced the articles of association and by laws of emagin nevada 
no change in the corporate name  board members  business  management  fiscal year  assets  liabilities  employee benefit plans or location of principal facilities of emagin occurred as a result of the reincorporation 
our history has been as a developmental stage company 
we are now transitioning to manufacturing and intend to significantly increase our marketing  sales  and research and development efforts  and expand our operating infrastructure 
most of our operating expenses are fixed in the near term 
if we are unable to generate significant revenues  our net losses in any given period could be greater than expected 
critical accounting policies the securities and exchange commission sec defines critical accounting policies as those that require application of management s most difficult  subjective or complex judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain and may change in subsequent periods 
not all of the accounting policies require management to make difficult  subjective or complex judgments or estimates 
however  the following policies could be deemed to be critical within the sec definition 
revenue recognition revenue on product sales is recognized when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  such as when a purchase order or contract is received from the customer  the price is fixed  title to the goods has changed and there is a reasonable assurance of collection of the sales proceeds 
we obtain written purchase authorizations from our customers for a specified amount of product at a specified price and consider delivery to have occurred at the time of shipment 
revenue is recognized at shipment and we record a reserve for estimated sales returns  which is reflected as a reduction of revenue at the time of revenue recognition 
revenues from research and development activities relating to firm fixed price contracts are generally recognized on the percentage of completion method of accounting as costs are incurred cost to cost basis 
revenues from research and development activities relating to cost plus fee contracts include costs incurred plus a portion of estimated fees or profits based on the relationship of costs incurred to total estimated costs 
contract costs include all direct material and labor costs and an allocation of allowable indirect costs as defined by each contract  as periodically adjusted to reflect revised agreed upon rates 
these rates are subject to audit by the other party 
amounts can be billed on a bi monthly basis 
billing is based on subjective cost investment factors research and development cost amounts incurred in connection with research and development activities are expensed as incurred 
statement of operations the following are descriptions of the revenue and expense components of our statement of operations total revenues currently represent revenues mostly from contracts funded by us government programs 
we have historically earned revenues from certain of our research and development activities under both fixed price contracts and cost type contracts  including some cost plus fee contracts 
revenues relating to fixed price contracts are generally recognized on the percentage of completion method of accounting as costs are incurred cost to cost basis 
revenues on cost plus fee contracts include costs incurred plus a portion of estimated fees or profit based on the relationship of costs and the allocation of allowable indirect costs as defined by each contract 
the amount of revenues earned is dependent upon the execution of new government contracts  which may not be predictable or consistent from period to period because of variations in government funds allocated to research and development in our field of technology 
research and development expenses represent salaries  development materials  external contracts  equipment lease and depreciation expense  electronics  rent  utilities and costs associated with operating our manufacturing facility 
these costs are expensed as incurred 
we have received cost sharing awards from certain us government agencies to fund certain research and development 
funding from this type of contract is recognized as a reduction in research and development operating expenses during the period in which the services are performed and related direct expenses are incurred 
as of december   we have no remaining amounts in cost sharing contracts to either incur or bill 
non cash stock based compensation expense represents expenses associated with stock option grants to our officers and employees at below fair market value as additional compensation for their services and to induce them to lock up their options for a longer time than would normally be specified under the company s standard option grant 
deferred compensation is amortized over the remaining vesting period of the underlying options 
the expense also represents warrant grants with exercise prices below fair market value to security holders of emagin for a reduced number of warrants to induce them to lock up prior to the merger 
amortization of purchased intangibles represents the cost of amortization of the value of other acquired intangible assets 
the purchased intangibles are amortized over their expected useful lives of three years on a straight line basis 
in  the company adopted sfas no business combinations and sfas no goodwill and other intangible assets 
after an evaluation  the company recorded an impairment write down of its goodwill in selling  general and administrative expenses principally represent the cost of salaries and fees for professional services  legal fees incurred in connection with patent filings and related matters  depreciation and amortization  and other administrative expenses as well as expenses associated with marketing 
basic and diluted net loss per common share is computed by using the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the period  restated for the effect of the merger upon the number of shares outstanding in the current year  and for the presentation of the net loss per share for the predecessor  a stock split effected during no common stock equivalents have been included in the computation of weighted average shares outstanding  as their effect would be anti dilutive

we expect to devote substantial capital resources to continue our development programs directed at commercializing our products in our target markets  hire and train additional staff  expand our research and development activities  develop and expand our manufacturing capacity and begin production activities
