excluding the impact of foreign currency  sales of medsurg equipment increased in physical therapy services revenues were million for  representing an increase of as a result of new physical therapy centers and higher revenue from existing centers 
cost of sales represented of sales compared with in the slightly lower cost of sales percentage in is due to an increase in the absorption of fixed manufacturing costs caused by increased production at certain of the company s manufacturing plants to meet current demand and higher sales growth for the higher margin orthopaedic implant products  offset partially by higher product obsolescence resulting from product launches 
while research  development and engineering expenses in were consistent with prior year amounts  they decreased to of sales from in research  development and engineering spending was affected in by the commercial launch of the osteogenic protein op product  which occurred in various markets in the second and fourth quarters of following the launch  in stryker biotech recorded a greater proportion of its expenses as cost of sales and selling  general and administrative expenses  compared with when this division classified substantially all of its costs as research  development and engineering 
increased spending from the company s continued focus on new product development partially offset the decreased research  development and engineering expenses related to stryker biotech

the company continually assesses the overall capacity provided by its manufacturing plants relative to cost  inventory management and expected sales growth 
a slight increase in orthopaedic implant margins was more than offset by higher sales and revenues of lower margin medsurg equipment products and physical therapy services 
research  development and engineering expenses increased in and represented of sales compared with in the increase in research  development and engineering spending in resulted from continued company wide focus on new product development

per basic and diluted share 
net earnings were million basic and diluted net earnings per share of and  respectively compared with million basic and diluted net earnings per share of and  respectively in liquidity and capital resources the company s working capital at december  decreased million to million from million at december  the working capital decrease is due primarily to lower cash balances  additional liabilities resulting from restructuring and acquisition related items recorded during and increases in other accrued liabilities  partially offset by increases in accounts receivable and inventories 
the additional liabilities from restructuring and acquisition related items is the result of the aforementioned pending closure of the company s rutherford  new jersey manufacturing facility

accounts receivable days sales outstanding  excluding the effect of the company s million accounts receivable securitization program  decreased day to days at december  from days at december  the lower days sales outstanding at december  is the result of improved collection efforts as well as an increase in the allowance for bad debts to provide for potential exposures in europe and latin america 
days sales in inventory decreased days to days at december  from days at december  the lower days sales in inventory is primarily the result of improved inventory management and higher provisions for product obsolescence as a result of product launches 
the company generated cash of million from operations in compared with million in the generation of cash in is the result of strong cash earnings net earnings plus noncash adjustments and increases in accrued expenses and income tax liabilities and decreases in the accounts receivable and inventory days mentioned previously 
these items were partially offset by increases in deferred charges and accounts receivable from increased sales and payments of million attributable to restructuring and acquisition related liabilities and acquisition purchase liabilities

the company had million in cash and cash equivalents at december  the company also had outstanding borrowings totaling million at that date 
current maturities of long term debt at december  are million and will decrease to million in and million in the company s million day revolving credit agreement expires in december and is renewable at the company s and the lenders discretion 
the company s million five year  nonamortizing  revolving credit agreement expires in december the company believes its cash on hand as well as anticipated cash flows from operations will be sufficient to fund future operating and capital requirements and required debt repayments 
should additional funds be required  the company had million of additional borrowing capacity available under all of its existing credit facilities at december  the company s future contractual obligations for agreements with initial terms greater than one year are summarized as follows payment period thereafter long term debt operating leases the company s additional borrowing capacity  along with the expected expiration period of the commitments  are summarized as follows amount of commitment total expiration per period amount less than in excess of committed year year lines of credit standby letters of credit critical accounting policies the preparation of the company s consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes 
on an on going basis  management evaluates these estimates 
estimates are based on historical experience  when available  and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
management believes that an understanding of the following critical accounting policies is important in obtaining an overall understanding of the consolidated financial statements 
inventory reserves the company maintains reserves for excess and obsolete inventory resulting from the potential inability to sell its products at prices in excess of current carrying costs 
the markets in which the company operates are highly competitive  with new products and surgical procedures introduced on an on going basis 
such marketplace changes may cause the company s products to become obsolete 
the company makes estimates regarding the future recoverability of the costs of these products and records a provision for excess and obsolete inventories based on historical experience  expiration of sterilization dates and expected future trends 
if actual product life cycles  product demand or acceptance of new product introductions are less favorable than projected by management  additional inventory write downs may be required  which could unfavorably affect future operating results 
income taxes the company operates in multiple tax jurisdictions both inside and outside the united states 
accordingly  management must determine the appropriate allocation of income in accordance with local law for each of these jurisdictions 
tax audits associated with the allocation of this income and other complex issues that may arise require an extended period of time to resolve and may result in income tax adjustments if changes to the income allocation are required between jurisdictions with different tax rates 
the company believes its income tax accruals are adequate to cover exposures related to such potential changes in income allocation between tax jurisdictions 
to the extent additional information becomes available  such accruals are adjusted to reflect revised probable outcomes 
impairment of goodwill and indefinite lived intangibles the company follows the provisions of fasb statement no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  in determining the amount  if any  by which the company s goodwill may be impaired in value 
the company uses the two step process prescribed in statement no 
the first step is a screen for potential impairment 
the second step  if necessary  measures the amount of the impairment 
inherent in the two step process are certain assumptions and estimates necessary to determine fair values for reportable units  as defined in statement no 
should actual results or changes in future expectations differ from those projected by management  goodwill impairment charges may be required which could unfavorably affect future operating results 
see other matters for further discussion regarding the adoption of statement no 
other matters the company distributes its products throughout the world 
as a result  the company s financial results could be significantly affected by factors such as changes in foreign currency exchange rates or weak economic conditions in foreign markets 
the company s operating results are primarily exposed to changes in exchange rates among the united states dollar and the japanese yen and european currencies  particularly the euro and the british pound 
when the united states dollar strengthens against foreign currencies  the dollar value of foreign currency sales declines 
when the united states dollar weakens  the opposite situation occurs 
the company manufactures its products in the united states  france  germany  ireland  switzerland  canada and puerto rico and incurs the costs to manufacture in the applicable local currencies 
this worldwide deployment of factories serves to partially mitigate the impact of currency exchange rate changes on the company s cost of sales 
the company has certain investments in net assets in international locations that are not hedged that are subject to translation gains and losses due to changes in foreign currencies 
for the year ended december   the strengthening of foreign currencies increased the value of these investments in net assets by million 
this gain reduced the previously recorded cumulative loss from weakening of foreign currencies that is deferred and recorded as a separate component of stockholders equity 
as of january   the company adopted fasb statement no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  as amended by statements no 
and no 
the statements require the company to recognize all derivatives on the balance sheet at fair value 
derivatives that are not hedges must be adjusted to fair value through earnings 
if a derivative is a hedge  depending on the nature of the hedge  changes in the fair value of derivatives are either offset against the change in fair value of the hedged assets  liabilities or firm commitments through earnings or recognized in accumulated other comprehensive gain loss until the hedged item is recognized in earnings 
the company enters into forward currency exchange contracts to mitigate the impact of currency fluctuations on transactions denominated in nonfunctional currencies  thereby limiting risk to the company that would otherwise result from changes in exchange rates 
these nonfunctional currency exposures principally relate to intercompany payables arising from intercompany purchases of manufactured products 
the periods of the forward currency exchange contracts correspond to the periods of the exposed transactions  with realized gains and losses included in the measurement and recording of transactions denominated in the nonfunctional currencies 
at december   the company had outstanding forward currency exchange contracts to purchase million and sell million of various currencies principally united states dollars and euros with maturities ranging principally from to days 
at december   the company had outstanding forward currency exchange contracts to purchase million and sell million of various currencies principally united states dollars and euros with maturities ranging principally from to days 
the estimated fair value of forward currency exchange contracts represents the measurement of the contracts at month end spot rates as adjusted for amortized forward points 
a hypothetical change in exchange rates for these currencies would change the fair value by approximately million and would have changed the fair value by approximately million 
the company s exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates to its borrowings and the accounts receivable securitization facility 
the company manages the interest rate risk on its borrowings through interest rate swap agreements  which have fixed the base rate on a million notional amount of the million of variable rate borrowings outstanding at december  if market interest rates for similar borrowings had averaged more than they did in  the company s interest expense  after considering the effects of its interest rate swaps  would have increased  and earnings before income taxes would have decreased by million 
by comparison  if market interest rates had averaged less than they did during  the company s interest expense  after considering the effects of its interest rate swaps  would have decreased  and earnings before income taxes would have increased by million 
if market interest rates for the accounts receivable securitization facility had averaged more than they did in  the company s discount expense would have increased  and earnings before income taxes would have decreased by million 
by comparison  if market interest rates had averaged less than they did in  the company s discount expense would have decreased  and earnings before income taxes would have increased by million 
these amounts are determined by considering the impact of hypothetical interest rates on the company s borrowing cost  interest rate swap agreements and accounts receivable securitization facility without any actions by management to mitigate its exposure to such changes 
the company is exposed to credit loss in the event of nonperformance by counterparties on the above instruments  but does not anticipate nonperformance by any of the counterparties 
the company s interest rate swap agreements effectively convert a portion of its variable rate borrowings to a fixed rate basis through  thus reducing the impact of changes in interest rates on future interest expense 
approximately of the company s outstanding variable rate borrowings as of december  have been hedged through the designation of interest rate swap agreements classified as cash flow hedges 
a gain of million attributable to changes in the fair value of interest rate swap agreements was recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive gain loss in if in the future the interest rate swap agreements were determined to be ineffective or were terminated before the contractual termination dates  or if it became probable that the hedged variable cash flows associated with the variable rate borrowings would stop  the company would be required to reclassify into earnings all or a portion of the unrealized losses on cash flow hedges included in accumulated other comprehensive gain loss 
interest rate differentials to be paid or received as a result of interest rate swaps are recognized as an adjustment of interest expense related to the designated borrowings 
based on the maturities of the company s interest rate swap agreements  interest expense for the year ending december  is expected to be million higher than the interest cost on the variable rate borrowings through the recognition of amounts included as unrealized losses on cash flow hedges at december  the company uses yen denominated floating rate borrowings to protect a portion of the value of its investment in its subsidiary in japan 
realized and unrealized gains and losses from this hedge are not included in the consolidated statements of earnings  but are recorded as foreign currency translation adjustments within accumulated other comprehensive gain loss in stockholders equity 
net gains losses of million  million and million attributable to the yen denominated floating rate borrowings hedge were recorded as foreign currency translation adjustments in  and  respectively 
as of january   the company adopted the provisions of fasb statement no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  related to acquisitions completed before july  statement no

 and determined that recorded goodwill was not impaired and no goodwill write down was necessary 
in october  the company purchased the dekompressor product line from pain concepts  inc  at a total cost of million giving the company access to intellectual property and other commercial rights relating to the design and manufacture of certain medical devices 
intangible assets acquired  principally patents  are being amortized over years 
the company is contingently liable for potential future milestone payments of up to million  primarily based on future sales growth over the next five years 
on october   the company entered into an agreement with curis  inc  which eliminated all royalties payable to curis relating to future stryker sales of op under terms of the agreement  the company made a one time cash payment of million to curis

on july   the company acquired sdi from tyco international ltd  for million in cash 
the acquisition expands the company s spinal product line by adding interbody spinal cages for the united states market as well as other thoracolumbar and cervical spinal fixation devices 
the acquisition was funded using existing credit facilities 
the acquisition of sdi was accounted for using the purchase method of accounting 
the results of operations for the acquired business are included in the company s consolidated financial statements beginning july  the acquisition of sdi added million to the company s sales for the second half of sdi had sales of million for the year ended december  and sales of million for the six months ended june  the purchase price of million in cash and liabilities assumed has been preliminarily allocated to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair value at the date of acquisition 
based on the preliminary purchase price allocation  million of the purchase price was allocated to patent licensing agreements to be amortized over their remaining life of years  million to inventory  million to deferred tax assets related to future tax deductions  million to other tangible assets and million to liabilities assumed
