item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations included elsewhere in this annual report on form k  and statements preceded by  followed by or that include the words believes  expects  anticipates  intends  estimates  may or similar expressions 
these statements are subject to risks and uncertainties and united therapeutics actual results may differ materially from anticipated results 
factors that may cause such a difference include  but are not limited to  those discussed below 
united therapeutics undertakes no obligation to publicly update forward looking statements  whether as a result of new information  future events or otherwise 
risks related to our business actual revenues and net losses may differ from united therapeutics projections 
united therapeutics has made public its projections of its estimated remodulin annual revenue run rates and estimated average monthly net losses in its quarterly sec filings 
those projections were based on numerous factors and assumptions taken into consideration at the time the estimates were made 
those factors and assumptions are inherently subject to a degree of uncertainty 
as a result  the actual revenues and net losses may be greater or less than projected 
even small differences can lead to significant changes in united therapeutics stock price 
united therapeutics had net losses of approximately million in and million in factors that could affect the accuracy of united therapeutics estimated remodulin annual revenue run rates include the following retention of current patients  addition of new patients to replace patients who discontinue remodulin therapy  remodulin side effects  including impact of infusion site pain and reaction  changes in the current pricing and dosing of remodulin  willingness of private insurance companies  medicare and medicaid to reimburse remodulin at current pricing levels  continued regulatory approval of remodulin  outcome of the phase iv post marketing study of remodulin  impact of other approved and investigational competitive products  continued performance by current remodulin distributors  actual expenses incurred in future periods  and establishment of additional strategic acquisitions or licensing arrangements 
factors that could affect the accuracy of united therapeutics estimated net loss and capital requirements include the following continued regulatory approval of remodulin  retention and growth of patients treated with remodulin  collection of accounts receivable  size  scope and outcome of the remodulin post marketing phase iv clinical study  size  scope and outcome of development efforts for existing and additional products  future milestone and royalty payments  cost  timing and outcomes of regulatory reviews  rate of technological advances  recovery of goodwill  intangible assets and investments in affiliates  status of competitive products  defending and enforcing intellectual property rights  development of manufacturing resources or the establishment  continuation or termination of third party manufacturing arrangements  establishment  continuation or termination of third party clinical trial arrangements  development of sales and marketing resources or the establishment  continuation or termination of third party sales and marketing arrangements  and establishment of additional strategic acquisitions or licensing arrangements 
united therapeutics has a history of losses and may not be profitable 
united therapeutics has lost money since its inception in  and its accumulated deficit was approximately million at december  united therapeutics expects to incur substantial additional losses  whether or not it continues to generate revenue  as it continues to develop its products 
united therapeutics expects its quarterly and annual operating results to fluctuate  depending primarily on the following factors extent and timing of sales of remodulin to distributors  level of patient demand for remodulin and other products  levels of research and development  general and administrative expenses and sales and marketing expenses  and establishment of additional strategic acquisitions or licensing arrangements 
timing of payments to licensors and corporate partners 
most of united therapeutics pharmaceutical products are in clinical studies 
united therapeutics might not maintain or obtain new regulatory approvals for its pharmaceutical products and may not be able to sell its pharmaceutical products commercially 
even if united therapeutics sells its products  united therapeutics may never be profitable and may not be able to sustain any profitability it achieves 
if united therapeutics cannot maintain regulatory approvals for its products  it cannot sell those products and its revenues will suffer 
the process of obtaining and maintaining regulatory approvals for new drugs is lengthy  expensive and uncertain 
the manufacturing  distribution  advertising and marketing of these products are subject to extensive regulation 
any new product approvals united therapeutics receives in the future could include significant restrictions on the use or marketing of the product 
product approvals  if granted  can be withdrawn for failure to comply with regulatory requirements or upon the occurrence of adverse events following commercial introduction of the products 
the fda has approved remodulin for the treatment of pulmonary arterial hypertension in patients with nyha class ii iv symptoms to diminish symptoms associated with exercise 
this approval is subject to united therapeutics agreement to perform a post marketing phase iv clinical study to further assess the clinical benefits of remodulin 
continued fda approval of remodulin is subject to the results of that trial 
if approvals are withdrawn for a product  united therapeutics cannot sell that product and its revenues will suffer 
in addition  governmental authorities could seize united therapeutics products or force united therapeutics to recall its products 
finally  united therapeutics and its officers and directors could be subject to civil and criminal penalties for failure to comply with these regulatory requirements 
if united therapeutics products fail in clinical studies  united therapeutics will not be able to obtain fda and foreign approvals and will not be able to sell those products 
in order to sell its pharmaceutical products  united therapeutics must receive regulatory approvals 
to obtain those approvals  united therapeutics must conduct clinical studies demonstrating that the drug and the delivery mechanism for the drug are safe and effective 
if united therapeutics cannot obtain approval from the us food and drug administration for a product  that product cannot be sold  and united therapeutics revenues will suffer 
on may   the fda approved remodulin treprostinil sodium injection for the treatment of pulmonary arterial hypertension in patients with nyha class ii iv symptoms to diminish symptoms associated with exercise 
united therapeutics agreed to perform a post marketing phase iv clinical study to further assess the clinical benefits of remodulin 
the phase iv study must be completed within months from the may approval  and continued fda approval is conditioned on the completion and outcome of the phase iv study 
as of march  four patients had been enrolled in the patient phase iv study 
additionally  united therapeutics has initiated pre pivotal clinical studies of remodulin in critical limb ischemia 
the lead glycobiology anti viral agent  ut b  has completed acute and chronic phase i clinical dosing studies in normal volunteers 
united therapeutics is also currently conducting two phase iii pivotal studies of ovarex for the treatment of metastatic ovarian cancer 
united therapeutics is still completing pre clinical studies for its other products 
united therapeutics ongoing and planned clinical studies might be delayed or halted for various reasons  including the drug is not effective  or physicians think that the drug is not effective  other investigational or approved therapies are viewed as more effective by physicians  patients experience severe side effects during treatment  patients die during the clinical study because their disease is too advanced or because they experience medical problems that are not related to the drug being studied  patients do not enroll in the studies at the rate united therapeutics expects  drug supplies are not available or suitable for use in the studies  and the results of preclinical testing cause delays in clinical trials 
in addition  the fda and foreign regulatory authorities have substantial discretion in the approval process 
the fda and foreign regulatory authorities may not agree that united therapeutics has demonstrated that its products are safe and effective 
united therapeutics products may not be commercially successful because physicians and patients may not accept them 
even if regulatory authorities approve united therapeutics products  these products may not be commercially successful 
united therapeutics expects that most of its products  including remodulin  which is already approved  will be very expensive 
patient acceptance of and demand for united therapeutics products will depend largely on the following factors acceptance by physicians and patients of united therapeutics products as safe and effective therapies  reimbursement of drug and treatment costs by third party payers such as medicare  medicaid and private insurance companies  pricing of alternative products  convenience and ease of administration of united therapeutics products  and prevalence and severity of side effects associated with united therapeutics products  including the infusion site pain and reaction associated with use of remodulin 
discoveries or developments of new technologies by others may make united therapeutics products obsolete 
other companies may conduct research  make discoveries or introduce new products that render all or some of united therapeutics technologies and products obsolete or not commercially viable 
researchers are continually making new discoveries that may lead to new technologies to treat the diseases for which united therapeutics products are intended 
in addition  alternative approaches to treating chronic diseases  such as gene therapy  may make united therapeutics products obsolete or noncompetitive 
one therapy approved in the united states in is tracleer  an oral endothelin antagonist developed by actelion  ltd 
which competes with remodulin 
united therapeutics is aware that other endothelin antagonists are being developed  such as sitaxentan by texas biotechnology corporation and ambrisentan by myogen  inc united therapeutics is also aware that sildenafil  being developed by pfizer  inc and iloprost  being developed by schering ag  are being studied for use in pulmonary hypertension 
sildenafil and iloprost are currently approved for the treatment of other diseases 
if third party payers will not reimburse patients for united therapeutics drug products  sales will suffer 
united therapeutics commercial success will depend in part on third party payers  such as medicare  medicaid and private insurance companies  agreeing to reimburse patients for the costs of united therapeutics pharmaceutical products 
third party payers frequently challenge the pricing of new drugs 
remodulin and the associated infusion pump and supplies are very expensive 
united therapeutics believes its investigational products  if approved  will also be very expensive 
presently  most third party payers  including medicare and medicaid  reimburse patients for the cost of remodulin therapy 
third party payers may not approve united therapeutics new products for reimbursement or continue to approve remodulin for reimbursement 
if third party payers do not approve a united therapeutics product for reimbursement  sales will suffer  as patients will opt for a competing product that is approved for reimbursement 
united therapeutics relies on third parties to develop  market  distribute and sell most of its products and those third parties may not perform 
united therapeutics is currently marketing products in three of its five therapeutic platforms remodulin in the prostacyclin analog platform  the heartbar product line in the arginine formulations platform  and cardiopal cardiac event monitors and holter monitors in the telemedicine platform 
united therapeutics does not have the ability to independently conduct clinical studies  obtain regulatory approvals  market  distribute or sell most of its products and intends to rely substantially on experienced third parties to perform all of those functions 
united therapeutics may not locate acceptable contractors or enter into favorable agreements with them 
if third parties do not successfully carry out their contractual duties or meet expected deadlines  united therapeutics will be unable to obtain marketing approvals and will be unable to sell its products 
medtronic minimed is united therapeutics exclusive partner for the subcutaneous delivery of remodulin using the minimed microinfusion device for pulmonary arterial hypertension 
united therapeutics is relying on medtronic minimed s experience  expertise and performance 
similarly  united therapeutics is relying on accredo therapeutics  inc and priority healthcare corporation to market  distribute  and sell remodulin in the united states 
if united therapeutics partners in the united states and internationally are unsuccessful in their efforts  united therapeutics revenues will suffer 
united therapeutics may not successfully compete with established drug companies 
united therapeutics competes with established drug companies during product development for  among other things  funding  access to licenses  expertise  personnel and third party collaborators 
united therapeutics will also compete with these companies following approval of its products 
almost all of these competitors have substantially greater financial  marketing  sales  distribution and technical resources  and more experience in research and development  clinical trials and regulatory matters  than united therapeutics 
united therapeutics is aware of existing treatments that compete with its products 
for the treatment of pulmonary arterial hypertension  approved products that compete with remodulin include the intravenous prostacyclin  flolan  marketed by glaxosmithkline plc  and tracleer  an oral endothelin antagonist marketed by actelion  ltd 
with respect to the prostacyclin segment of the pulmonary arterial hypertension market  united therapeutics estimates that approximately of the patients being treated with prostacyclin in the united states are using remodulin 
products that are being developed that may also compete with remodulin include endothelin antagonists  such as sitaxsentan being developed by texas biotechnology corporation and ambrisentan  being developed by myogen  inc sildenafil  being developed by pfizer  inc and iloprost  being developed by schering ag 
are both currently approved for the treatment of diseases other than pulmonary arterial hypertension 
many companies market and are developing products containing arginine which will compete with the heartbar product line 
cardiac holter and event monitoring services and systems are provided by many local and regional competitors and a few national competitors 
a number of drug companies are pursuing treatments for ovarian and other cancers and hepatitis  that will compete with products in united therapeutics immunotherapeutic monoclonal antibody platform and glycobiology anti viral agents platform 
if the licenses and assignments united therapeutics depends on are breached or terminated  united therapeutics would lose its right to develop and sell the products covered by the licenses and assignments 
united therapeutics business depends upon the acquisition  assignment and license of drugs and other products which have been discovered and initially developed by others  including remodulin  all of its products in the immunotherapeutic monoclonal antibody platform  all of its products in the glycobiology anti viral agents platform  and the heartbar line of products 
under our license agreements  we retain ownership of the intellectual property subject to the terms of the license agreement  whereas our assignment agreement transfers all right  title and ownership of the intellectual property to us  subject to the terms of the assignment agreement 
in addition  united therapeutics has obtained and will be required to obtain licenses to other third party technology to conduct its business  including licenses for its products and a license for the minimed microinfusion device for the administration of remodulin 
this dependence on licenses has the following risks united therapeutics may not be able to obtain future licenses and assignments at a reasonable cost or at all  if any of united therapeutics licenses or assignments are terminated  united therapeutics will lose its rights to develop and market some or all of its products  the licenses and assignments that united therapeutics holds generally provide for termination by the licensor or assignor in the event united therapeutics breaches the license or assignment agreement  including failing to pay royalties and other fees on a timely basis  in the event that glaxosmithkline formerly glaxo wellcome terminates its assignment agreement  united therapeutics will have no further rights to utilize the assigned patents or trade secrets to develop and commercialize remodulin 
in the twelve month period ended december   sales of remodulin accounted for the majority of united therapeutics revenues  or approximately million 
glaxosmithkline could seek to terminate the assignment in the event that united therapeutics failed to pay royalties based on sales of remodulin  and if licensors fail to maintain the intellectual property licensed or assigned to united therapeutics as required by most of united therapeutics license and assignment agreements  united therapeutics may lose its rights to develop and market some or all of its products and may be forced to incur substantial additional costs to maintain the intellectual property itself or force the licensor or assignor to do so 
if united therapeutics patent and other intellectual property protection is inadequate  united therapeutics sales and profits could suffer or competitors could force united therapeutics products completely out of the market 
the us patent for the method of treating pulmonary hypertension with remodulin expires in ovarex and its method of use are the subject of a combination of issued patents and pending applications in the united states and around the world 
the issued patents have expiration dates ranging from to united therapeutics may not be able to extend these or any other patents 
competitors may develop products based on the same active ingredients as united therapeutics products  including remodulin  and market those products after the patents expire  or may design around united therapeutics existing patents 
if this happens  united therapeutics sales would suffer and united therapeutics profits could be severely impacted 
patents may be issued to others which prevent the manufacture or sale of united therapeutics products 
united therapeutics may have to license those patents and pay significant fees or royalties to the owners of the patents in order to keep marketing its products 
this would cause profits on sales to suffer 
united therapeutics has been granted a patent in the united states for the synthesis of remodulin  but pending patent applications which have been or may be filed by united therapeutics may not issue 
the scope of any patent that issues may not be sufficient to protect united therapeutics technology 
the laws of foreign jurisdictions in which united therapeutics intends to sell its products may not protect united therapeutics rights to the same extent as the laws of the united states 
in addition to patent protection  united therapeutics also relies on trade secrets  proprietary know how and technology advances 
united therapeutics enters into confidentiality agreements with its employees and others  but these agreements may not be effective in protecting united therapeutics proprietary information 
others may independently develop substantially equivalent proprietary information or obtain access to united therapeutics know how 
litigation  which is very expensive  may be necessary to enforce or defend united therapeutics patents or proprietary rights and may not end favorably for united therapeutics 
any of united therapeutics licenses  patents or other intellectual property may be challenged  invalidated  canceled  infringed or circumvented and may not provide any competitive advantage to united therapeutics 
the only currently pending litigation to which united therapeutics is a party relates to suits initiated by united therapeutics against other parties believed to have violated united therapeutics patents related to its arginine products line 
united therapeutics has limited experience with manufacturing and depends on third parties  who may not perform  to synthesize and manufacture many of its products 
united therapeutics itself has limited experience with manufacturing 
in october  united therapeutics acquired synquest  inc  a company that manufactured treprostinil  the bulk active ingredient in remodulin  for united therapeutics 
in december  synquest was dissolved and merged into united therapeutics as its synthesis and manufacturing division 
prior to the acquisition of synquest  united therapeutics had no experience with manufacturing 
even though united therapeutics retained the employees and managers of synquest in connection with the acquisition  united therapeutics may be unsuccessful in maintaining drug manufacturing operations 
united therapeutics relies on third parties for the manufacture of all its products other than remodulin and its telemedicine systems 
united therapeutics is relying on baxter healthcare corporation formerly cook imaging corporation for the formulation of remodulin 
united therapeutics relies on cardinal health formerly magellan laboratories incorporated to test the purity of each batch of remodulin and other products that united therapeutics is developing 
united therapeutics relies on nellson nutraceuticals to manufacture heartbar products 
united therapeutics relies exclusively on toray industries  inc to manufacture beraprost 
although there are a limited number of companies that could replace each of these suppliers  management believes that other suppliers could provide similar services and materials 
a change in suppliers  however  could cause a delay in distribution of remodulin and other products  and in the conduct of clinical trials and commercial launch  which would adversely affect united therapeutics research and development efforts  and future sales efforts 
united therapeutics manufacturing strategy presents the following risks the manufacturing processes for some of united therapeutics products have not been tested in quantities needed for commercial sales  delays in scale up to commercial quantities could delay clinical studies  regulatory submissions and commercialization of united therapeutics products  a long lead time is needed to manufacture remodulin  and the manufacturing process is complex  united therapeutics and manufacturers of united therapeutics products are subject to the fda s good manufacturing practices regulations and similar foreign standards  and although united therapeutics controls compliance issues with respect to synthesis and manufacturing conducted internally  united therapeutics does not have control over compliance with these regulations by its third party manufacturers  if united therapeutics has to change to another manufacturing contractor or abandon its captive manufacturing operations  fda and comparable foreign regulators would require new testing and compliance inspections and the new manufacturer would have to be educated in the processes necessary for the production of the affected product  without satisfactory long term agreements with its manufacturers  united therapeutics will not be able to develop or commercialize its products  other than remodulin  as planned or at all and will have to rely solely on internal manufacturing capacity  without substantial experience in operating a manufacturing facility  united therapeutics may not be able to successfully continue to manufacture remodulin  and united therapeutics may not have intellectual property rights  or may have to share intellectual property rights  to many improvements in the manufacturing processes or new manufacturing processes for its products 
any of these factors could delay clinical studies or commercialization of united therapeutics products  entail higher costs and result in united therapeutics being unable to effectively sell its products 
united therapeutics may not have adequate insurance and may have substantial exposure to payment of product liability claims 
the testing  manufacture  marketing  and sale of human drugs involves product liability risks 
although united therapeutics currently has product liability insurance covering claims up to million per occurrence  united therapeutics may not be able to maintain this product liability insurance at an acceptable cost  if at all  and this insurance may not provide adequate coverage against potential losses 
if claims or losses exceed united therapeutics liability insurance coverage  united therapeutics may go out of business 
if united therapeutics highly qualified management and technical personnel leave united therapeutics  its business may suffer 
united therapeutics is dependent on its current management  particularly its founder and chief executive officer  martine rothblatt  phd  its president and chief operating officer  dr 
roger jeffs  phd  its chief financial officer  fred hadeed  and its senior vice president  general counsel and corporate secretary  paul mahon  all of whom are employed pursuant to multi year employment agreements 
united therapeutics does not maintain key person life insurance on these officers 
united therapeutics success will depend in part on retaining the services of its existing management and key personnel and attracting and retaining new highly qualified personnel 
expertise in the field of cardiovascular medicine  infectious disease and oncology is not generally available in the market  and competition for qualified management and personnel is intense 
united therapeutics may not have  or may have to share rights to  future inventions arising from its outsourcing agreements and may lose potential profits or savings 
pursuant to united therapeutics agreements with certain of its business partners  any new inventions or intellectual property that arise from united therapeutics activities will be owned jointly by united therapeutics and these partners 
if united therapeutics does not have rights to new developments or inventions that arise during the terms of these agreements  or united therapeutics has to share the rights with others  united therapeutics will lose the benefit of the new rights which may mean a loss of future profits or savings generated from improved technology 
if united therapeutics needs additional financing and cannot obtain it  product development and sales may be limited 
united therapeutics may need to spend more money than currently expected because it may need to change its product development plans or product offerings to address difficulties with clinical studies  preparing for commercial sales or continued sales of remodulin 
united therapeutics may not be able to obtain additional funds on commercially reasonable terms or at all 
if additional funds are not available  united therapeutics may be compelled to delay clinical studies  curtail operations or obtain funds through collaborative arrangements that may require it to relinquish rights to certain products or potential markets 
risks related to owning united therapeutics common stock united therapeutics stock price could be volatile and could decline 
the market prices for securities of drug and biotechnology companies are highly volatile  and there are significant price and volume fluctuations in the market that may be unrelated to particular companies operating performances 
the table below sets forth the high and low closing bid prices for united therapeutics common stock for the periods indicated closing bids high low january  december  january  december  united therapeutics stock price could decline suddenly due to the following factors quarterly and annual financial results  failure to meet estimates or expectations of securities analysts  rate of product acceptance  public concern as to the safety of products developed by united therapeutics or by others  announcements by united therapeutics or others of technological innovations or new products  developments in patent or other proprietary rights  establishment of additional strategic acquisitions or licensing arrangements  future sales of substantial amounts of common stock by existing united therapeutics stockholders  results of clinical trials  maintaining approvals to sell remodulin  timing and outcome of additional regulatory approvals  and general market conditions 
future sales of shares may depress the stock price 
if the stockholders sell a substantial number of shares of united therapeutics common stock in the public market  or investors become concerned that substantial sales might occur  the market price of the common stock could decrease 
such a decrease could make it difficult for united therapeutics to raise capital by selling stock or to pay for acquisitions using stock 
to the extent outstanding options are exercised or additional shares of capital stock are issued  existing stockholders may incur additional dilution 
provisions of united therapeutics certificate of incorporation  by laws and rights plan could prevent or delay a change of control or change in management that could be beneficial to united therapeutics and the public stockholders 
certain provisions of united therapeutics amended and restated certificate of incorporation  amended and restated by laws and shareholder rights plan may prevent  delay or discourage a merger  tender offer or proxy contest  the assumption of control by a holder of a large block of united therapeutics securities  and the replacement or removal of current management by united therapeutics stockholders 
for example  united therapeutics amended and restated certificate of incorporation divides the board of directors into three classes  with members of each class to be elected for staggered three year terms 
this provision may make it more difficult for stockholders to change the majority of directors and may frustrate accumulations of large blocks of common stock by limiting the voting power of such blocks 
this may further result in discouraging a change of control or change in current management 
united therapeutics has a shareholder rights plan designed to discourage takeovers that involve abusive tactics or do not provide fair value to shareholders 
generally  the shareholder rights plan requires a hostile purchaser to pay a price per share that is substantially higher than the current quoted price of united therapeutics common stock 
these provisions of united therapeutics amended and restated certificate of incorporation and the shareholder rights plan could discourage or make more difficult a merger or other change of control transaction  whether or not the transaction is favored by current management or would be favorable to united therapeutics stockholders 
in addition  these provisions may make removal of current management by united therapeutics stockholders more difficult  even if such removal would be beneficial to the stockholders generally 
existing directors and executive officers of united therapeutics own a substantial block of stock and might be able to direct the outcome of matters requiring stockholder approval 
united therapeutics directors and named executive officers beneficially own approximately percent of its outstanding common stock as of march  accordingly  these stockholders as a group might be able to direct the outcome of matters requiring approval by united therapeutics stockholders  including the election of its directors 
such stockholder control could delay or prevent a change of control of united therapeutics 
if stockholders do not receive dividends  stockholders must rely on stock appreciation for any return on their investment in united therapeutics 
united therapeutics has never declared or paid cash dividends on any of its capital stock 
united therapeutics currently intends to retain its earnings for future growth and therefore does not anticipate paying cash dividends in the future 
executive officers of the registrant the following is a list  as of march   setting forth certain information regarding the executive officers of united therapeutics 
each executive officer holds office until the first meeting of the board of directors after the annual meeting of shareholders  and until his or her successor is elected and qualified or until his or her earlier resignation or removal 
each executive officer s employment will end pursuant to the terms of his or her employment contract 
each of the employment contracts generally provide for a term of service of five years

item legal proceedings the federal trade commission ftc  through the staff of the ftc s division of advertising practices  is reviewing certain advertising and promotional claims made by unither pharma  inc about the heartbar product line  including claims made prior to united therapeutics acquisition of heartbar and certain other assets and liabilities of cooke ph  inc formerly cooke pharma  inc in december the ftc staff has asked that united therapeutics and unither pharma agree to enter into a consent order relating to those claims 
a settlement with the ftc may limit unither pharma s ability to make certain claims concerning the beneficial effects of the heartbar product line  which may adversely affect those product sales 
additionally  the terms of a settlement or litigation outcome may result in fines  penalties and other restrictions that could adversely affect the assets and operations of unither pharma 
at december   intangible assets relating to heartbar patents  trade name and base technology totaled approximately million 
united therapeutics does not believe that these intangible assets have been or will be impaired 
further  united therapeutics does not believe that the outcome of the ftc s investigation will have a material adverse effect on united therapeutics 
however  there can be no assurances that a settlement with the ftc or an ftc enforcement action  such as administrative litigation seeking the issuance of a cease and desist order  will not result in impairment of intangible assets or have a material adverse effect on unither pharma or united therapeutics 
if the intangible assets and or operations of unither pharma became materially impaired  this would have a material adverse effect on unither pharma and united therapeutics

overview united therapeutics is a biotechnology company focused on the development and commercialization of unique therapeutic products to treat chronic and life threatening cardiovascular  infectious and oncological diseases 
united therapeutics commenced operations in june and  since its inception  has devoted substantially all of its resources to acquisitions and research and development programs 
united therapeutics lead product is remodulin 
on may   the united states food and drug administration fda approved remodulin treprostinil sodium injection for the treatment of pulmonary arterial hypertension in patients with nyha class ii iv symptoms to diminish symptoms associated with exercise 
united therapeutics agreed with the fda that it would perform a post marketing phase iv clinical study to further assess the clinical benefits of remodulin 
the phase iv study commenced in late and must be completed within months from the may approval 
continued fda approval is conditioned on the completion and outcome of the phase iv study 
on october   the canadian therapeutics products directorate approved remodulin for long term subcutaneous treatment of pulmonary arterial hypertension in nyha class iii and iv patients who did not respond adequately to conventional therapy 
on october   the israeli ministry of health  drug registration department  approved remodulin for the treatment of primary pulmonary arterial hypertension and pulmonary arterial hypertension associated with connective tissue disorders 
remodulin marketing applications are under review in france  australia and switzerland with additional european filings to follow approval in france 
united therapeutics has generated pharmaceutical revenues from sales of remodulin to united states based distributors and on a government reimbursed basis in certain european countries  arginine product sales  chemical synthesis services  the resale of certain medical supplies used for its pharmaceutical products and government grants 
in addition  united therapeutics has generated non pharmaceutical revenues from telemedicine products and services 
united therapeutics has funded its operations primarily from the proceeds of the sales of common stock 
as of january   approximately patients receive remodulin therapy worldwide  of which approximately are reimbursable patients 
virtually all of the currently non reimbursable patients reside in countries where remodulin is not yet approved 
non reimbursable patients are those patients who do not yet pay for remodulin 
remodulin is sold and marketed to reimbursable patients in the united states by priority healthcare corporation and accredo therapeutics  inc formerly gentiva health services  inc and by six international distributors outside of the united states 
united therapeutics is the manufacturer of remodulin and sells remodulin in bulk shipments to its distributors 
the timing and extent of united therapeutics sales of remodulin are impacted by the timing and extent of these bulk orders from distributors 
therefore  sales of remodulin to distributors in any given quarter may not be indicative of patient demand in that quarter 
sales of remodulin and remodulin delivery pumps and supplies are recognized as revenue when delivered to the distributors 
united therapeutics has incurred net losses each year since inception and had an accumulated deficit of million at december  united therapeutics expects to continue to incur net losses and cannot provide assurances that  in the future  it will become profitable 
major research and development projects the major research and development projects of united therapeutics are remodulin for cardiovascular diseases  immunotherapeutic monoclonal antibodies antibodies that activate a patient s immune response for a variety of cancers and glycobiology antiviral agents a class of small molecules that may be effective as oral therapies for infectious diseases 
remodulin was approved in may for the treatment of pulmonary arterial hypertension in nyha class ii iv patients to diminish symptoms associated with exercise 
remodulin was also approved in canada and israel in october for similar uses 
regulatory applications and reviews of remodulin for pulmonary arterial hypertension are ongoing in europe and other countries and are expected to be completed in and a condition of fda approval is that a phase iv clinical study must be completed within two years of the approval date 
material net cash inflows from the sales of remodulin for pulmonary arterial hypertension commenced in may after fda approval was received 
remodulin is also being developed for the treatment of critical limb ischemia the advanced stage of vascular disease affecting blood vessels in the legs 
united therapeutics has completed one phase ii clinical study and pre pivotal clinical studies are currently underway 
united therapeutics incurred expenses of approximately million  million  and million during the years ended december   and  respectively  on remodulin development 
approximately million from inception to date has been incurred for remodulin 
united therapeutics monoclonal antibody immunotherapies were in licensed in april from altarex corp 
ovarex is the lead product and is currently being studied in two identical phase iii clinical trials in advanced ovarian cancer patients 
these studies commenced in january and are expected to require two years to become fully enrolled 
united therapeutics incurred expenses of approximately million from inception to date  all of which was incurred for these programs since april united therapeutics infectious disease program includes drug candidates in the preclinical and clinical stages of testing 
the drugs in this program are being developed for hepatitis c  hepatitis b and other infectious diseases 
the first candidate for hepatitis c  ut b  completed acute and chronic phase i clinical dosing studies to assess safety in healthy volunteers in early united therapeutics incurred expenses of approximately million  million  and million during the years ended december   and  respectively  for its infectious disease programs 
approximately million from inception to date has been incurred for these programs 
due to the inherent uncertainties involved in the drug development  regulatory review and approval processes  the anticipated completion dates  the cost of completing the research and development and the period in which material net cash inflows from these projects are expected to commence are not known or estimable 
there are many risks and uncertainties associated with completing the development of remodulin  ovarex and ut b 
these include products may fail in clinical studies  hospitals  physicians and patients may not be willing to participate in clinical studies  the drugs may not be effective or may not be perceived as effective  other investigational therapies may be viewed as more effective  patients may experience severe side effects during treatment  patients may die during the clinical study because their disease is too advanced or because they experience medical problems that are not related to the drug being studied  patients may not enroll in the studies at the rate united therapeutics expects  the fda and foreign regulatory authorities may delay or withhold approvals to commence clinical trials  the fda and foreign regulatory authorities may request that additional studies be performed  higher than anticipated costs may be incurred due to the high cost of contractors for its research and clinical trials  drug supplies may not be sufficient to treat the patients in the studies  and the results of preclinical testing may cause delays in clinical trials 
if these projects are not completed timely  regulatory approvals would be delayed and united therapeutics operations  liquidity and financial position could suffer 
without regulatory approvals  united therapeutics may not commercialize and sell these products and  therefore  potential revenues and profits from these products would be delayed or impossible to achieve

in process research development during  united therapeutics acquired the assets and assumed certain liabilities of cooke pharma  inc in a purchase transaction which resulted in a write off of in process research and development ipr d related to in process projects that had not yet reached technological feasibility and had no alternative future uses 
the projects under development at the valuation date were expected to address the coronary and peripheral arterial disease markets as well as the market of persons that are at risk of developing some form of heart disease 
it was anticipated that research and development related to these projects would be completed by however  united therapeutics has decided to initiate studies of arginine in pulmonary hypertension prior to coronary and peripheral arterial diseases 
these studies in pulmonary hypertension commenced in and are expected to be completed in the delay in the coronary and peripheral arterial disease studies is not expected to have a material impact on united therapeutics

liquidity and capital resources until june  united therapeutics financed its operations principally through various private placements of common stock 
on june   united therapeutics completed its initial public offering 
net proceeds to united therapeutics from the initial public offering and sale of the over allotment shares  after deducting underwriting commissions and offering expenses  were approximately million 
in  united therapeutics closed two private placements and received aggregate net proceeds of approximately million 
united therapeutics working capital at december  was approximately million  as compared with approximately million at december  the increase of approximately million is due primarily to the sale of noncurrent marketable investments in july and their reinvestment in commercial paper and money market funds which are classified as current assets  and an increase in accounts receivable due to sales of remodulin and related infusion pumps after the may fda approval 
current liabilities at december  were approximately million  as compared with approximately million at december  united therapeutics debt at december  and december  was approximately million and consisted of equipment leases  two mortgage notes  one secured by a certificate of deposit and both secured by the buildings and property owned by united therapeutics located at spring street in silver spring  maryland 
both mortgages are due in monthly installments over years 
net cash used in operating activities was approximately million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
for the years ended december  and  united therapeutics invested approximately million and  respectively  in cash for property  plant and equipment 
in september  united therapeutics purchased the property next to its silver spring  maryland headquarters for approximately million in cash 
in april and august  united therapeutics invested approximately million in altarex corp 
for the year ended december   united therapeutics generated approximately million of cash from sales and maturities of marketable investments  net of reinvestments 
for the year ended december   united therapeutics used approximately million of cash to purchase marketable investments  net of sales and maturities 
net cash provided by financing activities for the year ended december  was approximately  net cash used by financing activities was approximately million for the year ended december  cash flows used in financing activities for the year ended december  were primarily used to repurchase united therapeutics common stock pursuant to a stock repurchase program that expired in december united therapeutics currently expects to spend approximately million over the next three years to construct a laboratory production facility for use in the ovarex program 
united therapeutics expects to make milestone payments totaling  pursuant to existing license agreements during united therapeutics expects to make royalty payments on sales of remodulin  if annual net sales exceed million  and on all heartbar products during in december  pharmacia corporation formerly pharmacia upjohn company exclusively licensed to united therapeutics patents and a patent application for the composition and production of a prostacyclin analog 
the pharmacia agreement required milestone payments of up to  for orphan indications of a prostacyclin analog manufactured utilizing technology licensed from pharmacia and royalties between in the us and in certain other countries of all net sales  subject to certain offsets  until the later of the expiration of the applicable patent or years after the date of the first commercial sale of a product in a country defined as a milestone country under the agreement 
in october  united therapeutics and pharmacia amended the license agreement to change the royalties to pharmacia to  subject to a reduction  on annual net sales of remodulin in excess of million 
united therapeutics also pays royalties on sales of substantially all of its other products 
royalties on sales of all products in will range up to of sales of those products 
united therapeutics believes that sales of remodulin to distributors for use by the current base of approximately reimbursable patients in the us and europe could provide an average annual revenue to united therapeutics of approximately million based on current pricing and dosing levels 
based on this current estimate  united therapeutics believes it will continue to incur net losses 
factors that could affect the accuracy of these expectations include the following retention of current remodulin patients  addition of new remodulin patients to replace lost patients  impact of infusion site pain and reaction and other remodulin side effects  changes in the current pricing and remodulin dosing  continued regulatory approval of remodulin  additional regulatory approvals in other countries for remodulin  outcome of the fda required phase iv post marketing study of remodulin  impact of other approved and investigational competitive products  reimbursement of remodulin by public and private payers  impact of medical and scientific opinion on all united therapeutics products  continued performance by current remodulin distributors  actual expenses incurred in future periods  establishment of additional strategic acquisitions or licensing arrangements  and ability of united therapeutics to maintain and grow its telemedicine service and arginine product sales 
united therapeutics expects that net cash generated from remodulin sales at the level discussed above together with existing capital resources comprised primarily of cash and cash equivalents will be adequate to fund its operations through united therapeutics future capital requirements and the adequacy of its available funds will depend on many factors  including continued regulatory approval of remodulin  retention and growth of reimbursable patients treated with remodulin  collection of accounts receivable  size  scope and outcome of remodulin post marketing phase iv clinical studies  size  scope and outcome of its development efforts for existing and additional products  future milestone and royalty payments  cost  timing and outcomes of regulatory reviews  rate of technological advances  status of competitive products  defending and enforcing intellectual property rights  development of manufacturing resources or the establishment  continuation or termination of third party manufacturing arrangements  establishment  continuation or termination of third party clinical trial arrangements  development of sales and marketing resources or the establishment  continuation or termination of third party sales and marketing arrangements  establishment of additional strategic acquisitions or licensing arrangements  and risks associated with acquisitions  including the ability to integrate acquired businesses 
as of december   united therapeutics had available approximately million in net operating loss carryforwards and approximately million in business tax credit carryforwards for federal income tax purposes that expire at various dates through the portions of these carryforward items that were generated prior to june are subject to certain limitations 
united therapeutics does not believe that the limitations will cause the net operating loss and general business credit carryforwards to expire unused 
summary of critical accounting policies remodulin revenue recognition product sales of remodulin are recognized when delivered to distributors  which are united therapeutics customers for remodulin 
product sales of remodulin delivery pumps and related supplies are recognized when delivered to distributors on a gross basis in accordance with eitf issue no 
 reporting revenue gross as a principal versus net as an agent 
title to these products passes upon delivery 
prompt payment discounts are estimated and recognized as reductions of revenue in the same period that revenues are recognized 
return policies provide that product that has expired or become damaged in shipment may be exchanged  but not returned 
to date  united therapeutics has not experienced any returns from customers and does not expect future returns 
therefore  no accruals for expired or damaged product have been recorded 
intangible assets united therapeutics adopted the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets sfas no 
during  which eliminated the amortization of goodwill 
rather  goodwill is subject to at least an annual assessment for impairment by applying a fair value based test 
united therapeutics continually evaluates whether events and circumstances have occurred that indicate that the remaining value of goodwill may not be recoverable 
at december   management believes that goodwill was not impaired 
this conclusion is based on management s judgment  taking into consideration expectations regarding future profitability and the status of the reporting units which have reported goodwill 
however  changes in strategy or adverse changes in market conditions could impact this judgment and require an impairment loss to be recognized for the amount that the carrying value of goodwill exceeds its fair value 
marketable investments currently  united therapeutics invests portions of its cash in money market funds  commercial paper and securities issued by federally sponsored agencies 
prior to and during july  united therapeutics invested portions of its cash in marketable debt securities 
due to united therapeutics intent and ability to hold these marketable debt investments until their maturities  they had historically been reported at their amortized cost in the consolidated balance sheets 
in june  united therapeutics began reassessing its investment program 
as a result  united therapeutics liquidated all its marketable investments in july in order to invest the proceeds in money market funds  commercial paper and federal instruments 
as a result  united therapeutics was required to reclassify these investments as available for sale and report them in the june  balance sheet at their current fair market values based on quoted market prices 
this resulted in a write down of approximately million in june and an additional loss of approximately million upon the sale of these investments in july inventory capitalization prior to fda approval of remodulin  united therapeutics capitalized inventory costs associated with the synthesis and manufacture of remodulin  based on management s judgment of probable future commercialization 
remodulin received fda approval on may  stock options united therapeutics applies the principles of apb no 
in accounting for its stock options issued to its employees 
had united therapeutics applied the fair value principles of sfas no 
for its employee options  its net loss for the years ended december   and would have been approximately million  million and million  respectively  as compared to approximately million  million and million  respectively 
investments in affiliates the equity method of accounting is used to account for most of united therapeutics investments in affiliates 
the equity method of accounting generally requires united therapeutics to report its share of the affiliates net losses or profits in its financial statements  but does not require that assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses of the affiliates be consolidated with united therapeutics financial statements 
the equity method of accounting is being applied generally due to the lack of control over these affiliates and the levels of ownership held by united therapeutics 
other investments in affiliates are accounted for on the cost method generally due to the lack of significant influence over these affiliates and a less than ownership by united therapeutics 
the cost method of accounting does not require that united therapeutics report its share of the affiliates net losses or profits in its financial statements  nor are affiliates assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses consolidated with united therapeutics financial statements 
options issued in exchange for license in connection with the license from toray industries for the sustained release formulation of beraprost  united therapeutics agreed to grant  options to toray upon toray s transfer of clinical trial material for use in clinical trials in the us these options will not be priced until the clinical trial material milestone has been met by toray 
before toray can produce the clinical trial material  it will need to complete formulation  preclinical testing and early clinical studies 
due to the uncertainties in drug development  it is not yet known if toray will provide the appropriate clinical trial material 
therefore  in accordance with eitf issue no 
 accounting for equity instruments that are issued to other than employees  these options are measured at their lowest aggregate fair value at each interim reporting date  which amount has been zero 
as a result  no expense related to these options has been recorded in the consolidated financial statements 
recent accounting pronouncements in july  the financial accounting standards board the fasb issued sfas no 
 business combinations sfas  and sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets sfas 
sfas addresses the accounting for acquisitions of businesses and is effective for acquisitions occurring on or after july  sfas addresses the method of identifying and measuring goodwill and other intangible assets acquired in a business combination  eliminates further amortization of goodwill  and requires periodic evaluations of impairment of goodwill balances 
united therapeutics adopted sfas as of january  the main impact of the adoption was to reduce amortization of goodwill expense by approximately million in in october  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for impairment or disposal of long lived assets sfas 
the provisions of sfas require the use of a consistent accounting model for long lived assets to be disposed of by sale  whether previously held and used or newly acquired and extends the presentation of discontinued operations to include more disposal transactions 
united therapeutics adopted sfas as of january  the adoption had no impact on the consolidated financial statements 
in june  the financial accounting standards board issued sfas no 
 accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities sfas 
sfas addresses the financial accounting and reporting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities and is effective for exit or disposal activities initiated after december  sfas no 
will be adopted effective january   and is not expected to have a significant impact on united therapeutics financial statements 
in december  the financial accounting standards board issued sfas  accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure an amendment of fasb statement no 
sfas 
sfas provides financial accounting guidance for changes in the accounting method for stock options issued to employees and disclosure requirement for stock based employee compensation for financial statements issued after december  united therapeutics adopted sfas as of december   which resulted in additional disclosures in the notes to consolidated financial statements 
item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk at december   a substantial portion of united therapeutics assets were comprised of investment grade corporate commercial paper and debt securities issued by federally sponsored agencies 
the market value of these investments fluctuates with changes in current market interest rates 
in general  as rates increase  the market value of a debt instrument would be expected to decrease 
the opposite is also true 
to minimize such market risk  united therapeutics holds such instruments to maturity at which time these instruments would be redeemed at their stated or face value 
at december   united therapeutics had approximately million in commercial paper with a weighted average stated interest rate of approximately maturing in january additionally  united therapeutics had one federal home loan mortgage corporation freddie mac note in the amount of million at december  the freddie mac note is callable annually by freddie mac  matures in and bears a stated interest rate of which automatically increases by basis points each year
