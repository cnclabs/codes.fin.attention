item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations this report contains certain forward looking statements within the meaning of section a of the securities act of  as amended  and section e of the securities exchange act of  as amended 
the corporation desires to take advantage of the safe harbor provisions of the private securities litigation reform act of and is including this statement for the expressed purpose of availing itself of the protection of the safe harbor with respect to all of such forward looking statements 
these forward looking statements describe future plans or strategies and include the corporation s expectations of future financial results 
the corporation s ability to predict results or the effect of future plans or strategies is inherently uncertain and the corporation can give no assurance that those results or expectations will be attained 
factors that could affect actual results include but are not limited to i general market rates  ii changes in market interest rates and the shape of the yield curve  iii general economic conditions  iv real estate markets  v legislative regulatory changes  vi monetary and fiscal policies of the us treasury and the federal reserve  vii changes in the quality or composition of the corporation s loan and investment portfolios  viii demand for loan products  ix the level of loan and mbs repayments  x deposit flows  xi competition  xii demand for financial services in the corporation s markets  and xiii changes in accounting principles  policies or guidelines 
these factors should be considered in evaluating the forward looking statements  and undue reliance should not be placed on such statements 
the corporation does not undertake and specifically disclaims any obligation to update any forward looking statements to reflect occurrence of anticipated or unanticipated events or circumstances after the date of such statements 
significant accounting policies there are a number of accounting policies that require the use of judgment 
some of the more significant policies are as follows establishing the amount of the allowance for loan losses requires the use of judgment as well as other systematic objective and quantitative methods 
assets are evaluated at least quarterly and risk components reviewed as a part of that evaluation 
see notes to consolidated financial statements summary of significant accounting policies allowances for loan losses for a discussion of risk components 
valuation of mortgage servicing rights requires the use of judgment 
mortgage servicing rights are established on loans that are originated and subsequently sold 
a portion of the loan s book basis to mortgage servicing rights is allocated when a loan is sold 
the fair value of mortgage servicing rights is the present value of estimated future net cash flows from the servicing relationship using current market assumptions for prepayments  servicing costs and other factors 
as the loans are repaid and net servicing revenue is earned  mortgage servicing rights are amortized into expense 
net servicing revenues are expected to exceed this amortization expense 
however  if actual prepayment experience exceeds what was originally anticipated  net servicing revenues may be less than expected and mortgage servicing rights may be impaired 
judgment is also used in the valuation of other intangible assets core deposit intangibles 
core deposit intangibles have been recorded for core deposits defined as checking  money market and savings deposits that have been acquired in acquisitions that were accounted for as purchase business combinations 
the core deposit intangible assets have been recorded using the assumption that they provide a more favorable source of funding than more expensive wholesale borrowings 
an intangible asset has been recorded for the present value of the difference between the expected interest to be incurred on these deposits and interest expense that would be expected if these deposits were replace by wholesale borrowings  over the expected lives of the core deposits 
the current estimate of the underlying lives of the core deposits is seven to fifteen years 
if it is determined that these deposits have a shorter life  the asset will be adjusted to reflect an expense associated with the amount that is impaired 
goodwill is reviewed at least annually for impairment  which requires judgment 
goodwill has been recorded as a result of an acquisition in which purchase price exceeded fair value of net assets acquired 
the price paid for the acquisition is analyzed and compared to a number of current indices 
if goodwill is determined to be impaired  it would be expensed in the period in which it became impaired 
the following discussion is designed to provide a more thorough discussion of the corporation s financial condition and results of operations as well as to provide additional information on the corporation s asset liability management strategies  sources of liquidity and capital resources 
management s discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and supplemental data contained elsewhere in this report 
results of operations comparison of years ended march  and general 
net income increased million to million in fiscal from million in fiscal the primary component of this increase in earnings for fiscal  as compared to fiscal  was an increase of million in net interest income after the provision for loan losses 
in addition  non interest income increased million 
these increases were partially offset by an increase in non interest expense of million and an increase in tax expense of million 
the returns on average assets and average stockholders equity for fiscal were and  respectively  as compared to and  respectively  for fiscal net interest income 
net interest income increased by million during fiscal due to a larger increase in the volume of interest earning assets compared to the volume of interest bearing liabilities coupled with a greater decrease in rates of interest bearing liabilities as compared to the decrease in rates of interest earning assets 
the average balances of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities increased to billion and billion in fiscal  respectively  from billion and billion  respectively  in fiscal the ratio of average interest earning assets to average interest bearing liabilities decreased to in fiscal from in fiscal the average yield on interest earning assets in fiscal versus in fiscal decreased  as did the average cost on interest bearing liabilities in fiscal versus in fiscal 
the net interest margin increased to in fiscal from in fiscal and the interest rate spread increased to from in fiscal and  respectively 
the increase in the net interest margin is reflective of a decrease in the cost of funds  offset by a smaller decrease in yields on loans as interest rates decreased 
these factors are reflected in the analysis of changes in net interest income  arising from changes in the volume of interest earning assets  interest bearing liabilities and the rates earned and paid on such assets and liabilities 
the analysis indicates that the decreases in the volume of interest earning liabilities increased net interest income in fiscal by approximately million 
in addition  there was a million decrease in net interest income caused by the combination of rate volume changes 
provision for loan losses 
provision for loan losses decreased  from million in fiscal to million in fiscal based on management s ongoing evaluation of asset quality 
there was a decrease in net charge offs of  in fiscal  primarily due to decreased commercial business loan charge offs  and continued improvement in the quality of the loan portfolio 
the corporation s allowance for loan losses decreased million from million at march  to million at march  this amount represented of total loans at march   as compared to of total loans at march  for further discussion of the allowance for loan losses  see financial condition allowance for loan and foreclosure losses 
future provisions for loan losses will continue to be based upon management s assessment of the overall loan portfolio and the underlying collateral  trends in non performing loans  current economic conditions and other relevant factors in order to maintain the allowance for loan losses at adequate levels to provide for probable and estimable future losses 
the establishment of the amount of the loan loss allowance inherently involves judgments by management as to the adequacy of the allowance  which ultimately may or may not be correct 
higher rates of loan defaults than anticipated would likely result in a need to increase provisions in future years 
also  as multi family and commercial loan portfolios increase  additional provisions would likely be added to the loan loss allowance as they carry a higher risk of loss 
non interest income 
non interest income increased million to million for fiscal compared to million for fiscal primarily due to an increase of million in gain on sale of loans 
this increase was largely due to the lower interest rate environment which resulted in significantly higher levels of refinancing activity 
loan refinance activity and the ability to recognize gains from the sale of fixed rate loans is significantly dependent on decreasing interest rates and  as a result  there can be no assurance that the loan refinance activity and gains from the sale of loans recorded in prior periods will be recorded in future periods 
other non interest income  which includes a variety of loan fee and other miscellaneous fee income  also increased million for fiscal net gain on sale of investments and securities increased  service charges on deposits increased  essentially due to a growth in deposits and income from insurance commissions increased  due to increased sales 
partially offsetting these increases were decreases in other categories 
loan servicing income decreased million due to increased amortization of mortgage servicing rights 
net income from operations of real estate investments also decreased  non interest expense 
non interest expense increased million to million for fiscal compared to million for fiscal as a result of several factors 
the majority of the increase was attributed to an increase in compensation expense of million  largely due to an increase in incentive compensation resulting from increased loan production 
occupancy expense increased million due to increased maintenance and repairs and increased depreciation 
data processing expense increased  and other non interest expense increased  due to increases in postage and other expenses 
in addition  furniture and equipment expense increased  in fiscal  primarily due to normal replacement costs and increased depreciation expense  and marketing expense increased  during this fiscal year 
income taxes 
income tax expense increased million for fiscal as compared to fiscal the effective tax rate for fiscal was as compared to for fiscal see note to the consolidated financial statements included in item comparison of years ended march  and general 
net income increased million to million in fiscal from million in fiscal the primary component of this increase in earnings for fiscal  as compared to fiscal  was an increase of million in net interest income after the provision for loan losses 
in addition  non interest income increased million 
these increases were partially offset by an increase in non interest expense of million and an increase in tax expense of million 
the returns on average assets and average stockholders equity for fiscal were and  respectively  as compared to 
and  respectively  for fiscal net interest income 
net interest income increased by million during fiscal due to a larger increase in the volume of interest earning assets compared to the volume of interest bearing liabilities coupled with a greater decrease in rates of interest bearing liabilities as compared to the decrease in rates of interest earning assets 
the average balances of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities increased to billion and billion in fiscal  respectively  from billion and billion  respectively  in fiscal the ratio of average interest earning assets to average interest bearing liabilities increased to in fiscal from in fiscal the average yield on interest earning assets in fiscal versus in fiscal decreased  as did the average cost on interest bearing liabilities in fiscal versus in fiscal 
the net interest margin increased to in fiscal from in fiscal and the interest rate spread increased to from in fiscal and  respectively 
the increase in the net interest margin is reflective of a decrease in the cost of funds  offset by a smaller decrease in yields on loans as interest rates decreased 
these factors are reflected in the analysis of changes in net interest income  arising from changes in the volume of interest earning assets  interest bearing liabilities and the rates earned and paid on such assets and liabilities 
the analysis indicates that the decreases in the volume of interest earning liabilities increased net interest income in fiscal by approximately million 
in addition  there was a million increase in net interest income caused by the combination of rate and rate volume changes 
provision for loan losses 
provision for loan losses increased million from  in fiscal to million in fiscal based on management s ongoing evaluation of asset quality 
there was an increase in net charge offs of million in fiscal  primarily due to increased commercial business loan charge offs  however the quality of the loan portfolio continues to be good 
the corporation s allowance for loan losses increased million from million at march  to million at march  this amount represented of total loans at march   as compared to 
of total loans at march  for further discussion of the allowance for loan losses  see financial condition allowance for loan and foreclosure losses 
non interest income 
non interest income increased million to million for fiscal compared to million for fiscal primarily due to an increase of million in gain on sale of loans 
this increase was largely due to the lower interest rate environment which resulted in significantly higher levels of refinancing activity 
this resulted in increased mortgage servicing rights gains due to increased loan sales 
net income from operations of real estate investments also increased million largely due to increased lot sales 
other non interest income  which includes a variety of loan fee and other miscellaneous fee income  also increased million for fiscal service charges on deposits increased  essentially due to a growth in deposits and net gain on sale of investments and securities increased  for fiscal partially offsetting these increases were decreases in other categories 
loan servicing income decreased million due to increased amortization of mortgage servicing rights and income from insurance commissions decreased  due to decreased sales 
non interest expense 
non interest expense increased million to million for fiscal compared to million for fiscal as a result of several factors 
the majority of the increase was attributed to an increase in compensation expense of million  largely due to an increase in incentive compensation resulting from increased loan production 
other non interest expense increased million  largely due to the partial impairment of three securities  and increases in postage  office supplies  retail and other expenses 
in addition  furniture and equipment expense increased  in fiscal  primarily due to normal replacement costs and increased contractual services  and data processing expense increased  occupancy expense increased  and marketing expense increased  during this fiscal year 
income taxes 
income tax expense increased million for fiscal as compared to fiscal the effective tax rate for fiscal was as compared to for fiscal see note to the consolidated financial statements included in item net interest income information average interest earning assets  average interest bearing liabilities and interest rate spread and margin

the average balances of loans include non performing loans  interest of which is recognized on a cash basis 
rate volume analysis the most significant impact on the corporation s net interest income between periods is derived from the interaction of changes in the volume of and rates earned or paid on interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities 
the volume of earning dollars in loans and investments  compared to the volume of interest bearing liabilities represented by deposits and borrowings  combined with the spread  produces the changes in net interest income between periods 
the following table shows the relative contribution of the changes in average volume and average interest rates on changes in net interest income for the periods indicated

financial condition general 
total assets of the corporation increased million or 
from billion at march  to billion at march  this increase was primarily funded by net increases in deposits of million 
these funds were generally invested in loans receivable and investment securities 
mortgage related securities 
mortgage related securities both available for sale and held to maturity decreased million as a net result during the year of i purchases of million  ii principal repayments and market value adjustments of million and iii sales of million 
mortgage related securities consisted of million of mortgage backed securities million were available for sale and million were held to maturity and million of mortgage derivative securities million were available for sale and million were held to maturity at march  see notes and to the consolidated financial statements included in item mortgage related securities are subject to inherent risks based upon the future performance of the underlying collateral ie  mortgage loans for these securities 
among these risks are prepayment risk and interest rate risk 
should general interest rate levels decline  the mortgage related securities portfolio would be subject to i prepayments as borrowers typically would seek to obtain financing at lower rates  ii a decline in interest income received on adjustable rate mortgage related securities  and iii an increase in fair value of fixed rate mortgage related securities 
conversely  should general interest rate levels increase  the mortgage related securities portfolio would be subject to i a longer term to maturity as borrowers would be less likely to prepay their loans  ii an increase in interest income received on adjustable rate mortgage related securities  iii a decline in fair value of fixed rate mortgage related securities  and iv a decline in fair value of adjustable rate mortgage related securities to an extent dependent upon the level of interest rate increases  the time period to the next interest rate repricing date for the individual security  and the applicable periodic annual and or lifetime cap which could limit the degree to which the individual security could reprice within a given time period 
loans receivable 
total net loans including loans held for sale increased million during fiscal from billion at march   to billion at march  the activity included i originations and purchases of billion  ii sales of billion  and iii principal repayments and other reductions of billion 
see note to the corporation s consolidated financial statements included in item for more information 
non performing assets 
non performing assets consisting of non accrual loans  non performing real estate held for development and sale  foreclosed properties and repossessed assets increased to million or of total assets at march  from million or of total assets at march non performing assets are summarized as follows for the dates indicated at march  dollars in thousands non accrual loans single family residential      multi family residential commercial real estate   construction and land consumer commercial business   total non accrual loans     real estate held for development and sale  foreclosed properties and repossessed assets  net   total non performing assets      performing troubled debt restructurings  total non accrual loans to total loans total non performing assets to total assets allowance for loan losses to total loans allowance for loan losses to total non accrual loans allowance for loan and foreclosure losses to total non performing assets non accrual loans increased million in fiscal to million at march  this increase was largely attributable to one commercial business loan 
at march   there was one non accrual commercial real estate loan with a carrying value of greater than million which was acquired in connection with the acquisition of ledger capital corp 
the loan is secured by a unit motel located in schiller park  illinois  and had a carrying value of million 
the original loan was for million  of which the bank is an participant 
there was also one non accrual commercial business loan with a carrying value of greater than million at march  the loan is to a manufacturer of mri scanning equipment in eden prairie  minnesota  and had a carrying value of million at march  loans are placed on non accrual status when  in the judgment of management  the probability of collection of interest is deemed to be insufficient to warrant further accrual 
when a loan is placed on non accrual status  previously accrued but unpaid interest is deducted from interest income 
as a matter of policy  the corporation does not accrue interest on loans past due more than days 
non performing real estate held for development and sale decreased slightly by  during fiscal at march   there were no properties in non performing real estate held for development and sale with a carrying value greater than million 
foreclosed properties and repossessed assets increased  in fiscal this increase was not attributable to any one property 
at march   there were no properties in foreclosed properties with a carrying value greater than million 
the total of performing troubled debt restructurings at march  increased by million and includes one loan larger than million 
the increase was attributable to a commercial real estate loan secured by a room lodge located in sonoma  california  with a carrying value of million  which was acquired in the acquisition of ledger capital corp 
on november  allowances for loan and foreclosure losses 
the corporation s loan portfolio  foreclosed properties  and repossessed assets are evaluated on a continuing basis to determine the necessity for additions to the allowances for losses and the related balance in the allowances 
these evaluations consider several factors including  but not limited to  general economic conditions  collateral value  loan portfolio composition  loan delinquencies  prior loss experience  anticipated loss of interest and losses inherent in the portfolio 
the evaluation of the allowance for loan losses includes a review of known loan problems as well as potential loan problems based upon historical trends and ratios 
to determine the level and composition of the loan loss allowance  the loan portfolio is broken out by categories of single family residential  multi family residential  commercial real estate  construction and land  and commercial business 
these categories are then further divided into performing and non performing groups 
a five year historical trend is applied to each category of performing loans to arrive at the appropriate levels of loss reserves for those respective categories 
the non performing groups are analyzed using the trends of the current year in which they are being evaluated 
the corporation has allocated a larger percentage of reserves to specific categories over the past several fiscal years as a result of more precise analysis of loan portfolio performance 
foreclosed properties are recorded at the lower of carrying or fair value with charge offs  if any  charged to the allowance for loan losses prior to transfer to foreclosed property 
the fair value is primarily based on appraisals  discounted cash flow analysis the majority of which are based on current occupancy and lease rates and pending offers 
a summary of the activity in the allowance for loan losses follows year ended march  dollars in thousands allowance at beginning of year      purchase of ledger capital corp

historically  the corporation s non performing and classified assets have fluctuated with economic trends  both locally and nationally 
at march   the bank s present level of classified assets increased  from the year ended march  this is in keeping with local and national economic conditions 
management believes that the present level of the allowance at march  is prudent 
loan charge offs were million and million for the fiscal years ending march  and  respectively 
total charge offs for the years ended march  and decreased  and increased million  respectively  from the prior fiscal years 
the decrease in charge offs for fiscal was largely due to a decrease of  in commercial business charge offs 
mortgage loan charge offs increased  while consumer loan charge offs decreased  for the year ended march  the increase in charge offs for fiscal was largely due to an increase of million in commercial business loan charge offs largely resulting from two loans to a software consulting firm totalling million 
mortgage loan charge offs increased  while consumer loan charge offs decreased  for the year ended march  recoveries slightly offset the charge offs for the year ended march  and such recoveries increased  from  in fiscal to  in fiscal recoveries decreased  during the fiscal year ended march  management believes that the decreased level in net charge offs of  for the year ended march  and the increased level in net charge offs of million for the year ended march  do not represent changes in the quality of the loan portfolio  but instead generally reflect the local and national trends in overall consumer debt levels and bankruptcy filings

management also continues to pursue all practical and legal methods of collection  repossession and disposal  and adheres to high underwriting standards in the origination process in order to continue to maintain strong asset quality 
deposits 
deposits increased million during fiscal to billion  of which million was due to increases in now accounts and million was due to increases in passbook accounts 
these increases were offset by a million decrease in certificates of deposit  and a million decrease in money market accounts 
the increases were due to promotions and related growth of deposit households 
the weighted average cost of deposits decreased to at fiscal year end compared to at fiscal year end borrowings 
fhlb advances decreased million during fiscal because as advances matured they were not replaced with new borrowings 
cash proceeds from securities called during the low interest rate environment as well as increases in deposit accounts reduced the need for new borrowings as advances matured 
at march   advances totaled million with a weighted average interest rate of compared to advances of million with a weighted average interest rate of at march  other loans payable decreased million from the prior fiscal year 
for additional information  see note to the consolidated financial statements included in item stockholders equity 
stockholders equity at march  was million  or of total assets  compared to million  or of total assets at march  stockholders equity increased during the year as a result of i comprehensive income of million  which includes net income of million and a change in net unrealized gains on available for sale securities as a part of accumulated other comprehensive income of million  ii the exercise of stock options of million  iii the vesting of recognition plan shares of  iv employee stock plan purchases of million  and v the tax benefit from certain stock options of million 
these increases were partially offset by i the purchase of treasury stock of million and ii the payment of cash dividends of million 
liquidity and capital resources during fiscal  the bank made dividend payments of million to the corporation 
the bank is subject to certain regulatory limitations relative to its ability to pay dividends to the corporation 
management believes that the corporation will not be adversely affected by these dividend limitations and that projected future dividends from the bank will be sufficient to meet the corporation s liquidity needs 
in addition to dividends from the bank  the corporation also could sell capital stock or debt issues through the capital markets as alternative sources of funds  as well as obtain loans from outside banks 
the bank s primary sources of funds are principal and interest payments on loans receivable and mortgage related securities  sales of mortgage loans originated for sale  fhlb advances  deposits and other borrowings 
while maturities and scheduled amortization of loans and mortgage related securities are a predictable source of funds  deposit flows and mortgage prepayments are greatly influenced by general interest rates  economic conditions and competition 
the bank is required by the ots to maintain levels of liquid investments in qualifying types of us government and agency securities and other investments sufficient to ensure its safe and sound operation 
at march  and  the bank s liquidity ratio was and  respectively 
in fiscal  operating activities resulted in a net cash inflow of million 
operating cash flows for fiscal included earnings of million and million of net proceeds from the origination and sale of mortgage loans held for sale 
investing activities in fiscal resulted in a net cash outflow of million 
primary investing activities resulting in cash outflows were million for the purchase of securities and million for the increase in net loans receivable 
the most significant cash inflows from investing activities were principal repayments on loans of billion  proceeds of sales and maturities of investment securities of million  and million of principal repayments received on mortgage related securities 
financing activities resulted in a net cash outflow of million including a net increase in deposits of million  a net decrease in borrowings of million and a cash outflow of million for treasury stock purchases 
at march   the corporation had outstanding commitments to originate million of loans  commitments to extend funds to or on behalf of customers pursuant to lines and letters of credit of million  and  of loans sold with recourse to the corporation in the event of default by the borrower 
see note to the consolidated financial statements included in item scheduled maturities of certificates of deposit during the twelve months following march  amounted to billion  and scheduled maturities of borrowings during the same period totaled million 
the bank has entered into agreements with certain brokers that will provide blocks of funds at specified interest rates for an identified fee 
management believes adequate capital and borrowings are available from various sources to fund all commitments to the extent required 
at march   the bank s capital exceeded all capital requirements of the ots as mandated by federal law and regulations 
see note to the consolidated financial statements included in item item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk asset and liability management 
the primary function of asset and liability management is to provide liquidity and maintain an appropriate balance between interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities within specified maturities and or repricing dates 
interest rate risk is the imbalance between interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities at a given maturity or repricing date  and is commonly referred to as the interest rate gap the gap 
a positive gap exists when there are more assets than liabilities maturing or repricing within the same time frame 
a negative gap occurs when there are more liabilities than assets maturing or repricing within the same time frame 
the corporation s strategy for asset and liability management is to maintain an interest rate gap that minimizes the impact of interest rate movements on the net interest margin 
as part of this strategy  the corporation sells substantially all new originations of long term  fixed rate  single family residential mortgage loans in the secondary market  invests in adjustable rate or medium term  fixed rate  single family residential mortgage loans  invests in medium term mortgage related securities  and invests in consumer loans which generally have shorter terms to maturity and higher and or adjustable interest rates 
the corporation occasionally sells adjustable rate loans at origination to private investors 
the corporation also originates multi family residential and commercial real estate loans  which generally have adjustable or floating interest rates and or shorter terms to maturity than conventional single family residential loans 
long term  fixed rate  single family mortgage loans originated for sale in the secondary market are generally committed for sale at the time the interest rate is locked with the borrower 
as such  these loans involve little interest rate risk to the corporation 
although management believes that its asset liability management strategies reduce the potential effects of changes in interest rates on the corporation s operations  material and prolonged changes in interest rates would adversely affect the corporation s operations 
the corporation s cumulative net gap position at march  for one year or less was a positive of total assets  as compared to a positive at march  the calculation of a gap position requires management to make a number of assumptions as to when an asset or liability will reprice or mature 
management believes that its assumptions approximate actual experience and considers them reasonable  although the actual amortization and repayment of assets and liabilities may vary substantially 
the corporation utilizes certain prepayment assumptions and decay rates from various sources such as the ots and as determined by management 
the following tables summarize the corporation s interest rate sensitivity gap position as of march  and  respectively
