in october  we acquired the business of embark  which further augmented our online offerings by significantly expanding the web based products we offer to academic institutions 
primarily as a result of our heavy investment in these newer businesses  we have incurred losses from continuing operations and net losses in the last several years 
however  in and  as revenue from our newer businesses has grown  we have narrowed our operating losses significantly  and returned to profitability on a quarterly basis in each of the last two fiscal quarters of during this period  the percentage of our revenue derived from our newer businesses has also increased 
in order to sustain and increase profitability we will need to continue to grow the percentage of revenue we derive from these newer businesses  while effectively controlling costs

with regard to reporting the effects of a disposal of a segment of a business and required expected future operating losses from discontinued operations to be displayed in discontinued operations in the period s in which the losses are incurred

are effective for fiscal years ending after december  as provided for in sfas no 
 we have elected to continue to follow the intrinsic value method of accounting as prescribed by apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  to account for stock options 
critical accounting policies the estimates  methods and judgments we use in applying our accounting policies significantly impact the results we report in our financial statements 
some of our accounting policies require us to make subjective and difficult judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates of matters that are inherently uncertain 
our most critical accounting estimates include the assessment of the collectability of our accounts receivable balances  which impacts bad debt write offs  recoverability of goodwill  which impacts write offs of goodwill  valuation of non marketable equity securities  which impacts gains losses on equity securities when we record impairments  assessment of recoverability of long lived assets  which primarily impacts operating margin when we impair assets or accelerate their depreciation  and recognition and measurement of current and deferred income tax assets and liabilities  which impacts our tax provision 
below  we discuss these policies further  as well as the estimates and judgments involved 
we also have other policies that we consider to be key accounting policies  such as our policies for revenue recognition  including the deferral of revenues on certain contracts 
however  these policies do not meet the definition of critical accounting estimates because they do not generally require us to make estimates or judgments that are difficult or subjective 
accounts receivable 
we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
we review our aged receivables monthly 
this review includes discussions with our customers and their account representatives  the customers payment history and other factors 
based on these reviews we may increase or decrease our allowance for bad debt if we determine there is a change in the collectability of our accounts receivable 
goodwill 
in conjunction with the implementation of the new accounting rules for goodwill as of the beginning of  we completed a goodwill impairment review for the reporting units that have substantially all of our recognized goodwill 
according to our accounting policy  we also performed an annual review during the fourth quarter of  and in both reviews we found no impairment 
we will perform a similar review in the fourth quarter of each year  or more frequently if indicators of potential impairment exist 
our impairment review process is based on a discounted future cash flow approach that uses our estimates of revenue for the reporting units  driven by assumed market growth rates as well as appropriate discount rates 
these estimates are consistent with the plans and estimates that we use to manage the underlying businesses 
we may incur charges for impairment of goodwill in the future if our admissions services division s products fail to gain expected market acceptance or if we fail to achieve our assumed revenue growth 
non marketable equity securities 
our ability to recover our investments in private  non marketable equity securities and to earn a return on these investments is primarily dependent on how successfully these companies are able to execute their business plans and how well their products are accepted  as well as their ability to obtain funding to continue operations and to grow 
in the current equity market environment  their ability to obtain additional funding as well as to take advantage of liquidity events  such as initial public offerings  mergers and private sales  is significantly constrained 
under our accounting policy  the carrying value of a non marketable investment is the amount paid for the investment unless it has been determined to be other than temporarily impaired  in which case we write the investment down to its impaired value 
the impairment analysis for non marketable securities requires significant judgment 
this analysis includes assessment of each investee s financial condition  its projected results and cash flows  the business outlook for its products and technology  the likelihood of obtaining subsequent rounds of financing and the impact of any relevant contractual equity preferences held by us or other parties 
if an investee obtains additional funding at a valuation lower than our carrying amount  we presume that the investment is other than temporarily impaired 
during  we recorded impairments of non marketable equity investments of  long lived assets 
we assess the impairment of long lived assets when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the assets or the asset grouping may not be recoverable 
factors we consider in deciding when to perform an impairment review include significant under performance of a business or product line in relation to expectations  significant negative industry or economic trends and significant changes or planned changes in our use of the assets 
recoverability of assets that will continue to be used in our operations is measured by comparing the carrying amount of the asset grouping to the related total future net cash flows 
if an asset grouping s carrying value is not recoverable through those cash flows  the asset grouping is considered to be impaired 
the impairment is measured by the difference between the assets carrying amount and their fair value  based on the best information available  including market prices or discounted cash flow analysis 
income taxes 
in determining income for financial statement purposes  we must make certain estimates and judgments 
these estimates and judgments occur in the calculation of certain tax liabilities and in the determination of the recoverability of certain of the deferred tax assets  which arise from temporary differences between the tax and financial statement recognition of revenue and expense 
we must assess the likelihood that we will be able to recover our deferred tax assets 
if recovery is not likely  we must increase our provision for taxes by recording a reserve  in the form of a valuation allowance  for the deferred tax assets that we estimate will not ultimately be recoverable 
as of december   we believe that all of our recorded deferred tax assets will ultimately be recovered 
however  should there be a change in our ability to recover our deferred tax assets  our tax provision would increase in the period in which we determine that the recovery is not probable 
seasonality in results of operations we experience  and we expect to continue to experience  seasonal fluctuations in our revenue because the markets in which we operate are subject to seasonal fluctuations based on the scheduled dates for standardized admissions tests and the typical school year 
these fluctuations could result in volatility or adversely affect our stock price 
in addition  as our revenue grows  these seasonal fluctuations may become more evident 
we typically generate the largest portion of our test preparation revenue in the third quarter 
the electronic application revenue from the business we acquired from embark is highest in the first and fourth quarters  corresponding with the busiest times of year for submission of applications to academic institutions 
our k services division may also experience seasonal fluctuations in revenue  but we are not yet able to predict the impact of seasonal factors on this business with any degree of accuracy 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our portfolio of marketable securities includes primarily short term money market funds 
the fair value of our portfolio of marketable securities would not be significantly impacted by either a basis point increase or decrease in interest rates due primarily to the short term nature of the portfolio 
our outstanding long term debt bears interest at fixed rates 
we do not currently hold or issue derivative financial instruments 
royalty payments from our international franchisees constitute an insignificant percentage of our revenue 
accordingly  our exposure to exchange rate fluctuations is minimal
