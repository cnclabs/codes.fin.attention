the following tables disclose certain financial measures  such as ebitda earnings before interest and other  taxes  depreciation and amortization and free cash flow  which may be considered non gaap financial measures 
generally  a non gaap financial measure is a numerical measure of a company s performance  financial position or cash flows that either excludes or includes amounts that are not normally excluded or included in the most directly comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with gaap 
in order to fully assess our financial results  we believe that ebitda and free cash flow are appropriate measures of evaluating operating performance and liquidity  respectively 
furthermore  we believe that ebitda provides useful information because this information is used in calculating certain financial covenants under our credit facility 
however  these measures should be considered in addition to  and not as a substitute for  operating income  cash flows or other measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with gaap 
the non gaap measures included below have been reconciled to the nearest gaap measure  as included in our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report

overview we are the largest direct marketing company for supplemental educational supplies to schools and teachers for prek in the united states 
we offer more than  items through an innovative two pronged marketing approach that targets both school administrators and individual teachers 
our broad product range enables us to provide our customers with one source for virtually all of their non textbook school supplies and furniture needs 
we have grown significantly in recent years through acquisitions and internal growth 
for information on our recent acquisitions see the business combinations note in the notes to our consolidated financial statements 
our revenues for fiscal were million and our operating income was million  which represented compound annual revenue growth of and compounded annual operating income growth of  compared to our fiscal results 
our gross margin has improved in recent years primarily due to acquisitions  product mix and increased buying power 
we have acquired many specialty businesses  which tend to have higher gross margins than our traditional business 
the specialty businesses have also experienced higher revenue growth than the traditional business  resulting in an improved product mix 
in addition  our acquisitions of both specialty and traditional businesses have increased our buying power  resulting in reduced costs of the products we purchase 
our operating profit and margins also improved significantly over the last several years 
this improvement reflects our acquisitions of specialty businesses  which typically have higher operating margins than our traditional business 
in addition  through the integration of acquired businesses  we have been able to further improve our operating profit and margins by eliminating redundant expenses  leveraging overhead costs and improving purchasing power 
as a result of integrating acquired operations  we have recorded restructuring charges in fiscal and fiscal these charges have primarily been to close existing facilities and to consolidate operations that  when combined with acquired operations  became redundant 
to the extent our integrations have resulted in certain exit costs such as the closure of acquired facilities  the costs were accrued in purchase accounting 
our business and working capital needs are highly seasonal with peak sales levels occurring from june through october 
during this period  we receive  ship and bill the majority of our orders so that schools and teachers receive their merchandise by the start of each school year 
our inventory levels increase in april through june in anticipation of the peak shipping season 
the majority of shipments are made between june and october and the majority of cash receipts are collected from september through december 
as a result  we usually earn more than of our annual net income in the first two quarters of our fiscal year and operate at a net loss in our third and fourth fiscal quarters 
results of operations the following table sets forth certain information as a percentage of revenues on a historical basis concerning our results of operations for the fiscal years   and fiscal year revenues cost of revenues gross profit selling  general and administrative expenses restructuring costs operating income interest expense  net other expense income before provision for income taxes provision for income taxes net income consolidated historical results of operations fiscal compared to fiscal revenues revenues increased from million in fiscal to million in fiscal traditional segment revenues decreased from million in fiscal to million in fiscal decrease in traditional segment revenues was primarily due to a generally weakened economic environment which has placed pressure on some state and local budgets  partially offset by revenues from acquired businesses 
specialty segment revenues increased from million in fiscal to million in fiscal increase in specialty segment revenues was primarily due to acquisitions and modest growth in existing businesses 
gross profit gross profit increased from million in fiscal to million in fiscal increase in gross profit was due to an increase in revenues and gross margins  and a shift in revenues to the higher margin specialty segment 
in fiscal  specialty segment revenues accounted for of total revenues  up from in fiscal gross margin grew basis points from of revenues in fiscal to of revenues in fiscal increase in gross margin was primarily due to improvement in the specialty segment gross margin from of revenues in fiscal to of revenues in fiscal increase in gross margin in the specialty segment was primarily driven by mix  with higher gross margins from acquired businesses  and successful pricing initiatives in core businesses 
traditional segment gross margin expanded basis points from of revenues in fiscal to of revenues in fiscal  driven primarily by improved consumable pricing and reduced product cost 
selling  general and administrative expenses selling  general and administrative expenses sg a include selling expenses  the most significant component of which is sales wages and commissions  operations expenses  which includes customer service  warehouse and warehouse shipments transportation costs  catalog costs  general administrative overhead  which includes information systems  accounting  legal  and human resources and depreciation and intangible asset amortization expense 
sg a increased from million or of revenues in fiscal to million or of revenues in fiscal increase in sg a and sg a as a percent of revenues was primarily due to acquisitions  an increase in revenues  and a shift in revenue mix to increased specialty segment revenues  which generally have higher operating costs than the traditional segment primarily due to increased marketing costs 
these increases were partially offset by efficiencies obtained from integration efforts and successful expense reduction efforts 
traditional segment sg a increased million from million or of revenues in fiscal to million or of revenues in fiscal increase in traditional segment sg a was primarily due to costs associated with closing our lufkin  texas facility  which supported the traditional segment  of approximately million and costs related to operating businesses acquired during the off season 
specialty segment sg a increased million from million in fiscal to million 
increase in specialty segment sg a was primarily due to an increase in revenues and costs related to operating acquired businesses which were purchased during the off season 
specialty segment sg a as a percent of revenues decreased basis points from of revenues in fiscal to of revenues in fiscal decrease in sg a as a percent of revenues was primarily due to the inclusion of premier agendas for a full fiscal year  which was acquired during the off season in fiscal and contributed minimal revenue and a non recurring charge that occurred in fiscal related to closing the birmingham  alabama distribution center 
interest expense net interest expense increased from million in fiscal to million in fiscal increase in net interest expense was due to an increase in average debt outstanding  partially offset by a reduction in our effective borrowing rate on our credit facility 
other expenses other expense decreased million from million in fiscal to million in fiscal other expenses for fiscal primarily represented the discount and loss on securitized accounts receivable of million 
discount and loss on securitized accounts receivable for fiscal was million 
the decrease in the discount and loss was primarily due to a reduction in the discount rate partially offset by an increase in the average securitized accounts receivable 
other expenses for fiscal included a million write off of a long term investment  and million realized gain on the sale of available for sale securities 
provision for income taxes the provision for income taxes increased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal  reflecting effective income tax rates of for each period 
the higher effective tax rate  compared to the federal statutory rate of  was primarily due to state  local and foreign income taxes 
fiscal compared to fiscal revenues revenues increased from million for fiscal to million for fiscal traditional segment revenues increased from million in fiscal to million in fiscal  primarily due to acquisitions 
specialty segment revenues increased from million in fiscal to million in fiscal increase in specialty segment revenues was due to internal growth and acquisitions  partially offset by the exclusion of revenues from three businesses disposed of since january gross profit gross profit increased from million  or of revenues in fiscal to million  or of revenues in fiscal increase in gross profit was due to an increase in revenues and gross margin 
increase in gross margin was primarily due to strong improvement in the traditional segment from of revenues in fiscal to of revenues in fiscal this increase in gross margin in the traditional segment was primarily due to improvement in the consumable business  driven by improved purchasing power and modest selling price increases 
specialty segment gross margin improved to of revenues in fiscal from of revenues in fiscal this improvement was primarily driven by the classroomdirect business  which improved gross margin primarily through an increase in selling price and the childcraft business  which improved gross margin primarily through improved operating efficiencies and purchasing power 
on a consolidated basis  gross margin was impacted by an increase in traditional segment revenue mix driven by the november acquisition of jl hammett s k wholesale business from of revenues in fiscal to of revenues in fiscal the traditional segment historically has lower gross margins than the specialty segment 
selling  general and administrative expenses sg a increased from million or of revenues in fiscal to million or of revenues in fiscal traditional segment sg a increased million from million or of revenues in fiscal to million or of revenues in fiscal increase in traditional segment sg a was primarily due to an increase in variable costs related to increased revenues and an increase in fixed operating costs  primarily due to redundancies created with the hammett acquisition 
specialty segment sg a increased million from million or of revenues in fiscal to million or of revenues in fiscal increase in specialty segment sg a was primarily due to the acquisition of premier agendas  and costs to consolidate existing operations into acquired businesses 
these traditional and specialty segment increases were partially offset by our early adoption at the beginning of fiscal of sfas no 
which resulted in the discontinuance of amortization of goodwill 
corporate expenses increased million from million in fiscal to million in fiscal increase was primarily due to an increase in salaries and wages  salary continuation obligations related to the death of our chief executive officer and depreciation 
decrease in traditional segment sg a as a percent of revenues was primarily due to the adoption of sfas no 
at the beginning of fiscal the increase in specialty segment sg a as a percent of revenues was primarily due to operating costs of premier agendas  a highly seasonal business acquired during a seasonally low period  costs associated with closing our distribution center in birmingham  alabama  costs associated with integrating our hammond stephens sales force with the premier agendas sales force and increased catalog costs  primarily due to the inclusion of a full fiscal year of catalog expense for teacher s video  which has higher catalog costs as a percentage of revenues than our other specialty businesses 
these increases were partially offset by a reduction in amortization expense  due to our adoption of sfas no 
at the beginning of fiscal interest expense net interest expense increased from million in fiscal to million in fiscal increase in interest expense was primarily due to an increase in average debt outstanding  partially offset by a reduction in our effective borrowing rate on our credit facility 
other expenses other expense increased million from million in fiscal to million in fiscal other expenses in fiscal primarily consisted of the discount and loss on the accounts receivable securitization of million  a million write off of a long term investment and a million realized loss on the sale of available for sale securities 
other expense in fiscal primarily consisted of the discount and loss on an accounts receivable securitization of million 
provision for income taxes the provision for income taxes for fiscal increased million over fiscal  reflecting effective tax rates of and for fiscal years and  respectively 
the change in the effective tax rate to in fiscal as compared to in fiscal was due primarily to the impact of our adoption of sfas no 
 and its impact on non deductible goodwill amortization 
the higher effective tax rate  compared to the federal statutory rate of  was primarily due to state  local and foreign income taxes 
liquidity and capital resources at april   we had working capital of million 
our capitalization at april  was million  consisting of total debt of million and shareholders equity of million 
on april  we amended and extended our revolving credit facility with bank of america  na  acting as agent 
the new credit agreement matures on april  and provides for million of availability 
the amount outstanding as of april  under the credit facility was million 
the credit facility is secured by substantially all of our assets and contains certain financial and other covenants 
during fiscal  we borrowed under our credit facility primarily for seasonal working capital  acquisitions  and capital expenditures 
our borrowings are usually significantly higher during the first two quarters of our fiscal year to meet the working capital needs of our peak selling season 
as of april   our effective interest rate on borrowings under our credit facility was approximately  which includes amortization of loan origination fee costs and the commitment fees on unborrowed funds 
on july   we sold an aggregate principal amount of million of six percent convertible subordinated notes due august  the notes are convertible at any time prior to maturity into shares of our common stock at a conversion price of per share and accrue interest payable semi annually 
net proceeds from the sale of these notes were approximately million 
on august   the initial purchasers of the notes exercised their option to purchase additional notes in full and purchased an additional million of these notes 
we used the total net proceeds from the offering of million to repay a portion of the debt outstanding under the credit facility 
we currently have a million accounts receivable securitization facility which expires in november the facility was amended during november to extend the expiration date to november and may be extended further with the financial institution s consent 
at april   million was advanced under the accounts receivable securitization and accordingly  that amount of accounts receivable has been removed from our consolidated balance sheet 
costs associated with the sale of receivables  primarily related to the discount and loss on sale  for fiscal were million and are included in other expenses in our condensed consolidated statement of operations 
in november  we entered into two sale leaseback transactions which are accounted for as financings 
under the agreements  we recorded million of debt  which has an effective interest rate of  excluding amortization of related fees 
the leases expire in november the amount outstanding as of april  under the agreements was million 
net cash provided by operating activities was million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal the decrease in cash from operating activities was primarily due to significant liquidation of acquired working capital in fiscal and a million reduction in amounts advanced under the accounts receivable securitization in fiscal  partially offset by an increase in net income in fiscal net cash used in investing activities during fiscal was million 
of this amount  million was used for acquisitions and million was used for capital expenditures  primarily consisting of computer hardware and software related to the implementation of our new business systems and distribution and manufacturing equipment 
net cash used in investing activities during fiscal was million  including million for acquisitions primarily premier agendas and million for capital expenditures 
these uses were partially offset by net proceeds of million from the sale of available for sale securities 
net cash provided by financing activities during fiscal was million 
net repayments on bank borrowings and capital leases of million and payment of related debt fees of million  primarily relating to new credit facility  were offset by million of proceeds from stock option exercises 
net cash provided by financing activities during fiscal was million 
net proceeds from our convertible debt offering of approximately million were used to repay a portion of the debt outstanding on our credit facility 
we anticipate that our cash flow from operations  borrowings available from our existing credit facility and other sources of capital will be sufficient to meet our liquidity requirements for operations  including anticipated capital expenditures and our contractual obligations 
we expect our fiscal capital expenditures to be approximately million and to consist primarily of computer hardware and software costs related to continued implementation of our new business systems 
summary of contractual obligations the following table summarizes our contractual debt and operating lease obligations as of april  payments due in thousands total less than year years years more than years debt obligations operating lease obligations total contractual obligations fluctuations in quarterly results of operations our business is subject to seasonal influences 
our historical revenues and profitability have been dramatically higher in the first two quarters of our fiscal year  primarily due to increased shipments to customers coinciding with the start of each school year 
quarterly results also may be materially affected by the timing of acquisitions  the timing and magnitude of costs related to such acquisitions  variations in our costs for the products sold  the mix of products sold and general economic conditions 
moreover  the operating margins of companies we acquire may differ substantially from our own  which could contribute to further fluctuation in quarterly operating results 
therefore  results for any quarter are not indicative of the results that we may achieve for any subsequent fiscal quarter or for a full fiscal year 
the following table sets forth certain unaudited consolidated quarterly financial data for fiscal years and we derived this quarterly data from our unaudited consolidated financial statements 
fiscal first second third fourth total revenues gross profit operating income loss net income loss per share amounts basic diluted fiscal first second third fourth total revenues gross profit operating income loss net income loss per share amounts basic diluted inflation inflation has had and is expected to have only a minor effect on our results of operations and our internal and external sources of liquidity 
critical accounting policies we believe the policies identified below are critical to our business and the understanding of our results of operations 
the impact and any associated risks related to these policies on our business are discussed throughout md a where applicable 
refer to the notes to our consolidated financial statements in item for detailed discussion on the application of these and other accounting policies 
the preparation of the consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
we evaluate our estimates on an ongoing basis and base them on a combination of historical experience and various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
our critical accounting policies that require significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements are as follows revenue recognition revenue is recognized upon the shipment of products or upon the completion of services provided to customers  which corresponds to the time when risk of ownership transfers 
catalog costs and related amortization we accumulate all direct costs incurred  net of vendor cooperative advertising payments  in the development  production and circulation of our catalogs on our balance sheet until such time as the related catalog is mailed 
they are subsequently amortized into sg a over the expected sales realization cycle  which is one year or less 
our initial estimation of the expected sales realization cycle for a particular catalog is based on  among other possible considerations  our historical sales experience with identical or similar catalogs and our assessment of prevailing economic conditions and various competitive factors 
we track our subsequent sales realization  reassess the marketplace  and compare our findings to our previous estimate and adjust our prospective amortization  if necessary 
vendor rebates we receive rebates from our vendors which are generally a percentage of volume purchased 
amounts expected to be received from vendors relating to the purchase of inventories are recognized as a reduction of cost of goods sold over the estimated inventory sale cycle 
goodwill and intangible assets at april   goodwill and intangible assets represented approximately of our total assets 
the recoverability of these assets requires considerable judgment and is evaluated on an annual basis or more frequently if events or circumstances indicate that the assets may be impaired 
as it relates to goodwill and indefinite life intangible assets  we apply the impairment rules in accordance with sfas no 
as required by sfas no 
 the recoverability of these assets is subject to a fair value assessment which includes several significant judgments regarding financial projections and comparable market values 
as it relates to definite life intangible assets  we apply the impairment rules as required by sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets which also requires significant judgment and assumptions related to the expected future cash flows attributable to the intangible asset 
the impact of modifying any of these assumptions can have a significant impact on the estimate of fair value and  thus  the recoverability of the asset 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk our financial instruments include cash and cash equivalents  accounts receivable  accounts payable  accrued liabilities and debt 
market risks relating to our operations result primarily from changes in interest rates 
our borrowings under our credit facility and our discount expense related to our accounts receivable securitization are primarily dependent upon libor rates 
assuming no change in our financial structure  if variable interest rates were to average basis points higher during fiscal  pre tax earnings would decrease by approximately million 
this amount was determined by considering a hypothetical basis point increase in interest rates on average variable rate debt outstanding and the average advanced under the receivable securitization during fiscal the estimated fair value of long term debt approximated its carrying value at april   with the exception of our convertible debt which at april  had a carrying value of million and a fair market value of million 
to manage interest rate risk on the variable rate borrowings under our credit facility  we have historically entered into interest rate swap agreements 
these interest rate swap agreements had the effect of locking in  for a specified period  the base interest rate we paid on a notional principal amount established in the swaps 
as a result  while these hedging arrangements were structured to reduce our exposure to interest rate increases  it also limits the benefit we might otherwise have received from any interest rate decreases 
the swaps were typically cash settled monthly  with interest expense adjusted for amounts paid or received 
the swap agreements had the effect of increasing interest expense by approximately million in fiscal and decreasing interest expense by approximately million in fiscal no swap agreements were in place during fiscal we do not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for trading purposes
