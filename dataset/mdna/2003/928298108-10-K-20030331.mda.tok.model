item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview market conditions in the electronics industry remained difficult in the continuing worldwide economic slowdown  general lack of investor confidence  consumer ambivalence and political instabilities were reflected in the markets we serve 
with regard to particular industries in  our management perceived stability in the automotive market  continuing weakness in the markets for telecom equipment and consumer products generally  and signs of modest recovery in computer laptops and game consoles 
geographically  our business in the americas and europe remained at depressed levels  while our asian business faired relatively better 
our visibility of future demand is limited  and management cannot gauge with any confidence when the current cyclical downturn is likely to reverse itself 
product demand and pricing sales volume and pricing are the top line indicators of demand for our products 
compared to the substantial drop off in business in  results remained relatively weak but without major signs of increasing deterioration 
sales rose slightly in as compared to  with higher volumes offsetting the effects of still declining prices 
the increased volumes were due in part to the effects of acquisition activity 
average selling prices continued their decline in  but at a rate that was less than in we experienced a weighted average pricing decline in compared to of  while the decline for compared to was 
backlog  which is one indication of trends in customer demand  was relatively stable in as compared to  but still down substantially from in uncertain economic times  such as those we experienced in and  orders are more susceptible to cancellation 
accordingly  backlog as a measure of future sales in these circumstances becomes less reliable 
another important indicator of demand in our industry is the book to bill ratio  which is the ratio of the amount of product ordered during a period as compared with the product that we ship during that period 
a book to bill ratio that is greater than one indicates that our orders are building and that we are likely to see increasing revenues in future periods 
conversely  a book to bill ratio that is less than one is an indicator of declining demand and may foretell declining sales 
the quarter to quarter trends in backlog and book to bill ratio can also be an important indicator of the likely direction of our business 
the following table shows the end of period backlog and the book to bill ratio for our business as a whole during the five quarters beginning with the fourth quarter of and through the fourth quarter of the relatively flat backlog amounts and book to bill ratios hovering at or slightly below one are consistent with a business environment that remains stagnant and with no clear signs of recovery 
th quarter st quarter nd quarter rd quarter th quarter end of period backlog      book to bill ratio includes  of backlog attributable to the business of general semiconductor  which was acquired november  includes  of backlog attributable to the business of bccomponents  which was acquired in december segments our management evaluates our operating results along the lines of two major segments  passive components and active components 
passive components include resistors  capacitors and inductors 
these are necessary elements of all electronic circuits and are referred to as passive because they do not require power to operate 
we include in this segment our measurements group  which manufactures and markets strain gages  load cells  transducers  instruments and weighing systems 
the core components of these devices are resistors that are sensitive to various types of mechanical stress 
we began our business as a manufacturer of passive components  and this remains a significant part of our business 
in december  we completed our first major acquisition in the passive segment in over ten years with the purchase of bccomponents holdings bv  a manufacturer of a broad line of resistors and capacitors 
we also completed a series of smaller acquisitions in the measurements group in  including celtron technologies  the blh and nobel businesses of thermo electron corporation  tedea huntleigh bv and the transducer and strain gage businesses of sensortronics  inc with these acquisitions  we established ourselves as one of the world s leading manufacturers and suppliers of strain gage products 
we are now also one of the world s leading manufacturers of active electronic components 
these include transistors  diodes  rectifiers  certain types of integrated circuits and optoelectronic products 
these components are referred to as active because they require power to function 
we entered the active component business in when vishay purchased a interest in lite on power semiconductor corporation lpsc  a taiwan based company that is a major supplier of discrete active electronic components in asia 
in march  we agreed to sell our interest in lpsc to lite on jv corporation the lite on group  the owner of the remaining interest in lpsc  for consideration consisting of cash and the assignment or transfer to vishay of the lite on group s rights under stock appreciation rights 
in  we increased our entry into the active components business with the acquisition from daimler benz of temic telefunken microelectronics gmbh  a manufacturer of optoelectronic components and small signal transistors  and of an interest in siliconix incorporated  a manufacturer of power integrated circuits 
in  we substantially increased our presence in the active component market  first with the acquisition in july of the optoelectronic infrared business of infineon ag  and later with the acquisition in november of general semiconductor  inc  a manufacturer of rectifiers and power management components whose business is complementary to that of siliconix 
as a percentage of our total sales  active components were in  in and in the passive and active segments of our business have historically responded differently to phases of the business cycle 
having strong capabilities in both areas not only gives us a broad line of products to offer our customers  it also smoothes  to some extent  the business swings that we experience 
when business slows down  active components are usually first to feel the effects of the downturn that are later experienced by passive components 
similarly  when business begins to increase  our semiconductor products usually lead the recovery  followed some time later by resistors  inductors and capacitors 
results in were on the whole better in the active segment than the passive segment  but results and trends varied for products within the two segments 
our resistor and inductor business stabilized in  but capacitors continued to deteriorate 
as in the past  specialty products performed reasonably well despite the economic downturn  but commodity products continued to suffer from strong pricing pressures 
the active side of our business evidenced improvement in  mainly at siliconix and to a lesser extent in our remaining semiconductor operations 
even in the active segment  however  backlog and book to bill ratios do not reflect strong near term recovery 
the following table shows our sales and book to bill ratios broken out by segment for the five quarters beginning with the fourth quarter of and through the fourth quarter of sales book to bill th quarter st quarter nd quarter rd quarter th quarter passive      components active      components includes  attributable to general semiconductor for active components 
excluding general semiconductor  the book to bill ratio for active components during the fourth quarter of would have been 
the book to bill ratio for the active components for the quarter ended march  reflected  in part  an unusual spike in orders in march the increase in backlog in the actives segment reflects the increase in demand for computer notebooks and feature rich cell phones with multiple functions  especially in asia 
the decrease in passives backlog is due to the global slowdown in the electronics industry  particularly in the general personal computer and cell phone markets 
cost and inventory management we place a strong emphasis on reducing our costs 
one way we do this is by moving production to the extent possible from high labor cost markets  such as the united states and western europe  to lower labor cost markets  such as israel  mexico  the republic of china taiwan  the people s republic of china and eastern europe 
the percentage of our total headcount in lower labor cost countries is a measure of the extent to which we are successful in implementing this program 
this percentage was at the end of as compared to at the end of and at the end of we expect that this trend will continue with the acquisition in december of bccomponents  where we intend to move production to lower cost jurisdictions  primarily in asia 
we are placing particular emphasis on cost reduction in our capacitor lines  which have been hardest hit by the current downturn and where the business continues to suffer from worldwide overcapacity 
we expect to complete the transfer of our power capacitor production from western europe to the czech republic by mid year and to begin moving our molded tantalum capacitor business to the people s republic of china 
we also expect to consolidate our existing film capacitor line within the newly acquired business of bccomponents 
we also focus on our inventory turns as a measure of how well we are managing our inventory 
we define inventory turns for a financial reporting period as our cost of products sold for that period divided by our average inventory for the period 
a higher level of inventory turns reflects more efficient use of our capital 
in  inventory turns improved to from in  which we attribute to somewhat improved selling conditions and enhanced selling efficiencies implemented during the year 
israeli government incentives our production facilities in israel benefit from incentives offered by the israeli government for creation of jobs and capital investment in that country 
these benefits take the form of government grants and reduced tax rates that are lower than those in the united states 
these reduced tax rates apply to projects specifically approved by the israeli government and  depending on project size  are available for periods of ten or fifteen years 
due to the write down of inventories and the loss on long term purchase commitments in  the application of the israeli tax rates rather than united states tax rates resulted in an increase in net loss of  in and  lower tax rates in israel  as compared to the statutory rate in the united states  resulted in an increase in net earnings of  and  respectively 
israeli government grants are awarded to specific projects 
these grants are intended to promote sales and employment in israel s industrial sector and are conditioned on the recipient maintaining certain prescribed employment levels 
grants are paid when the related projects become operational  and the israeli government approves the project 
israeli government grants  recorded as a reduction in the costs of products sold  were   and  in the years  and  respectively 
at december   our balance sheet reflected  in deferred grant income 
during the second quarter of  the government of israel informed us that since the headcount in our israeli subsidiaries decreased significantly over the previous months  the government intended to withhold a  grant otherwise due to us 
the grant  which was made by the israeli government under an economic stimulus program  was conditioned in part on the employment levels at certain of our israeli facilities 
the israeli government argued that we had not maintained employment at the required minimum levels 
during the fourth quarter of  we settled our dispute with the government of israel by negotiating certain of our commitments  and the government agreed to continue making grant payments to us 
we therefore recorded a catch up adjustment of approximately  of grant income for the fourth quarter of and reversed the allowances against the grant and deferred income reflected on the september  balance sheet 
if we were no longer able to maintain the required level of employment in the future  we could be required to return some grant funds that were previously awarded to us 
the effect of the return of these funds would be to reduce our income in future years 
also  if the current business climate continues  we might not initiate new projects that qualify for grants or reduced tax rates or the israeli government could curtail or eliminate the programs from which we have benefited in the past 
write downs of inventory and purchase commitments tantalum is the principal material used in the manufacture of tantalum capacitors 
we generally purchase this metal in powder or wire form  although in and early  when we perceived possible supply shortages  we also stockpiled quantities of tantalum ore 
in july and november of  we entered into purchase contracts with cabot corporation for tantalum powder and wire that committed us to minimum purchases of these materials at fixed prices through we regularly utilize tantalum powder and wire in the production of tantalum capacitors but have not used our stockpile of tantalum ore since palladium is a precious metal used in the production of multi layer ceramic capacitors that we purchase under short term contracts 
in  as a result of the general downturn in the electronics business  we experienced a significant decrease in capacitor sales 
prices of tantalum ore  powder and wire and of palladium also experienced significant declines 
accordingly  we recorded write downs of our raw material inventories of these metals including  for tantalum ore   for tantalum wire and powder and  for palladium 
in june  following initiation of a lawsuit by cabot regarding its tantalum supply contracts with vishay  we agreed with cabot to modify the contracts  including reducing prices  providing for purchases at regular intervals and extending one of the contracts through in the fourth quarter of  our management concluded that the depressed prices for tantalum were not attributable to temporary imbalances in distributor inventories for tantalum capacitors and that the prices for tantalum were likely to remain at their currently depressed levels for the foreseeable future 
also during the fourth quarter  one of our competitors settled its dispute with cabot regarding long term tantalum purchase commitments at prices that we understand are in the same range as the prices under our june settlement with cabot 
our management therefore concluded that it was unlikely to obtain further price concessions from cabot 
accordingly  we determined that it was appropriate to accrue a loss of our purchase commitments under our supply contracts with cabot to reflect the difference between the prices that we are required to pay under the contracts and current market prices for tantalum 
for the same reasons  we also determined to further write down our raw material inventories of tantalum ore  powder and wire 
these charges amounted to approximately  for the purchase commitments and  for inventory 
in  we also recorded a write down of  on palladium inventories 
we anticipate  based on current and foreseeable demand for tantalum capacitors  that our minimum purchase commitments under the contracts with cabot will substantially exceed our requirements over the terms of the contracts 
see contractual commitments below 
also  we do not anticipate utilizing our stockpile of tantalum ore at any time in the foreseeable future 
tantalum ore  powder and wire have an indefinite shelf life  therefore  we believe that we will eventually utilize all of the material in our inventory or purchased under the contracts 
our visibility of future demand is limited  however  and actual consumption may differ substantially from the amounts that we now estimate 
foreign currency in  we realized approximately of our revenues from customers outside the united states 
any third party sales not using the us dollar as the functional currency must be reported in the local currency and be translated at the weighted average exchange rate 
this translation will have an impact on the net sales line of the income statement and also on the expense lines of the income statement 
we generally do not purchase foreign currency exchange contracts or other derivative instruments to hedge our exposure to foreign currency fluctuations 
critical accounting policies our significant accounting policies are summarized in note to our consolidated financial statements 
we identify here a number of policies that entail significant judgments or estimates 
revenue recognition we record revenues at the time that we ship products to our customers 
many of our shipments are to distributors  who purchase for resale to end users 
the distributors have certain limited rights to return products 
they are also entitled to certain price protection benefits  which give them credit for unsold products that they continue to hold in inventory when we reduce our book prices for these items 
at the time we record sales to these distributors  we also recognize allowances against net sales for estimated product returns and price protection 
to estimate these allowances  we review historical returns and price adjustments on both a consolidated level and on an individual distributor level as well as the general business and economic climate 
these procedures require the exercise of significant judgments  but we believe they enable us to estimate reasonably future credits for returns and price adjustments 
accounts receivable our receivables represent a significant portion of our current assets 
we are required to estimate the collectability of our receivables and to establish allowances for the amount of receivables that will prove uncollectible 
we base these allowances on our historical collection experience  the length of time our receivables are outstanding  the financial circumstances of individual customers  and general business and economic conditions 
inventories we value our inventories at the lower of cost or market  with cost determined under the first in first out method and market based upon net realizable value 
the valuation of our inventories requires our management to make market estimates 
for instance  in the case of tantalum powder  we estimate market value by obtaining current quotations from available sources of supply 
for work in progress goods  we are required to estimate the cost to completion of the products and the prices at which we will be able to sell the products 
for finished goods  we must assess the prices at which we believe the inventory can be sold 
as noted  we recorded substantial write downs of our tantalum and palladium inventories in estimates of restructuring expense and purchase related restructuring costs in  we recorded restructuring costs of approximately  related to our acquisitions and  related to our existing businesses 
our acquisition related restructuring costs included  among other things  costs related to our acquisition of bccomponents in december our restructuring activities related to our existing business were designed to reduce both our fixed and variable costs  particularly in response to the reduced demand for our products occasioned by the continuing electronics industry downturn in these included the disposition of fixed assets and the termination of employees 
acquisition related costs are included in the allocation of the cost of the acquired business and generally add to goodwill 
other restructuring costs are expensed during the period in which we determine that we will incur those costs  and all of the requirements for accrual are met 
because these costs are recorded based upon estimates  our actual expenditures for the restructuring activities may differ from the initially recorded costs 
if this happens  we will have to adjust our estimates in future periods 
in the case of acquisition related restructuring costs  this would generally require a change in value of the goodwill appearing on our balance sheet  but would not affect our earnings 
in the case of other restructuring costs  we could be required either to record additional expenses in future periods  if our initial estimates were too low  or to reverse part of the charges that we recorded initially  if our initial estimates were too high 
raw material write downs as indicated  in the fourth quarter of we took charges of approximately  against contractual commitments to purchase tantalum powder and wire through and wrote off approximately  of our existing inventory of tantalum ore  powder and wire 
we did this because the current market prices of tantalum are substantially below the prices at which we are committed to purchase tantalum in the future under long term contracts and the prices at which we were carrying our tantalum raw materials inventory 
these actions involved significant judgments on our part  including decisions of whether to take these charges and write downs  their timing and their amount 
we made the decision to take the charges and write downs after our management concluded that the substantial fall off in the demand for tantalum capacitors was likely to continue for the foreseeable future 
combining this assessment with the worldwide over capacity in tantalum production  we could not foresee when tantalum prices might recover from their currently depressed levels 
we made this determination in the fourth quarter of after it was apparent that the inventory levels of our customers had dropped without any effect on the demand or pricing for tantalum capacitors and after the settlement of our competitor s tantalum pricing litigation  described above 
although we believe that both the charges and write downs as well as their timing were appropriate under the circumstances  our visibility for future demand and pricing is limited and the judgments made by our management necessarily involved subjective assessments 
the write down of our current tantalum inventory and the charges with respect to our future tantalum commitments were calculated based on current market prices for tantalum 
there is no established market on which tantalum raw materials are regularly traded and quoted 
we based our determination of current market price on quotations from two suppliers of these materials 
we cannot say that the prices at which we could currently enter into contracts for the purchase of tantalum would be the same as these quoted prices 
also  in quantifying the charges that we took against our future purchase commitments  we assumed for lack of any other benchmark that current market prices would continue through  when our purchase commitments end 
had we made other assumptions on current and future prices for tantalum  the amount of the inventory write downs and the charges against our purchase commitments would have been different 
if tantalum prices were to recover in the future  we would not reverse the write downs that we have taken on our raw materials inventory or the charges that we have recorded against our purchase commitments  so that our cost of materials will continue to reflect these write downs and charges regardless of future price increases in tantalum 
this could have the effect of increasing the earnings that we realize in future periods from what they would have been had we not taken these actions until future raw material prices were known with certainty 
we could also be required to take further write downs and charges if tantalum prices experience further declines 
goodwill goodwill represents the excess of the cost of businesses acquired over the fair value of the related net assets at the date of acquisition 
in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  we no longer amortize goodwill  but test for impairment of goodwill using a market multiple approach 
long lived assets we assess the impairment of our long lived assets  other than goodwill and trademarks  including property  plant and equipment  and identifiable intangible assets subject to amortization whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable 
factors we consider important which could trigger an impairment review include significant changes in the manner of our use of the acquired asset  changes in historical or projected operating performance and significant negative economic trends 
results of operations income statement captions as a percentage of sales and the effective tax rates were as follows year ended december costs of products sold gross profit selling  general and administrative expenses operating loss income loss earnings before income taxes benefit and minority interest net loss earnings effective tax rate net sales  gross profits and margins sales for the year ended december  increased by  or over the prior year 
this combines a substantial increase in sales in the active segment  attributable in large measure to acquisitions reflected only partially in but fully in  and a continuing drop in sales in the passive segment in the weakening of the us dollar against foreign currencies for the year ended december   in comparison to the prior year  resulted in increases in reported sales of  costs of products sold as a percentage of net sales were for the year ended december  as compared to for the prior year 
gross profit  as a percentage of net sales  for the year ended december  was as compared to for the prior year 
the erosion in overall profit margins reflects the continuing weakness in the passive segment  offset in substantial part by improvements in the active segment 
both volume reduction and further declines in average selling prices contributed to the declining profit margins in the passive segment 
profit margins in the active segment benefited from higher volumes  even as average selling prices continued to decline in various product lines 
for the year ended december   costs of products sold included  for the write down of tantalum and palladium inventories as compared to  for the write down of tantalum and palladium inventories in sales for the year ended december  decreased  or from the prior year  reflecting the downturn in the electronics industry that we experienced in the strengthening of the us dollar against foreign currencies for the year ended december   in comparison to the prior year  resulted in decreases in reported sales of  we experienced lower sales in both our active and passive components businesses 
the decline was particularly pronounced in our commodity business for passive components such as capacitors and resistors 
the decline in the year to year sales numbers reflects both lower unit sales volume and substantial downward pricing pressure 
the decline was evidenced in virtually all of our end markets  but was particularly pronounced in wireless communications and computers 
costs of products sold as a percentage of net sales were for the year ended december  as compared to for the prior year 
gross profit  as a percentage of net sales  for the year ended december  was as compared to for the prior year 
the erosion in profit margins  in both the active and passive segments  reflected reduced volume and lower prices in  offset  to some extent  by a reduction in fixed costs during the year 
for the year ended december   costs of products sold included  for the write down of tantalum and palladium inventories 
see israeli government incentives regarding israeli government grants  which are recorded as a reduction in costs of products sold 
the following tables show sales and gross profit margins separately for our passive and active segments 
passive components year ended december net sales    gross profit margin net sales of passive components for the year ended december  decreased by  or from comparable sales of the prior year 
the decrease in net sales was attributable to a combination of lower volume and a continuing slide in prices 
while our resistor and inductor business has stabilized and even showed signs of improvement in the second half of the year over the prior year s depressed results  the capacitor business continues to be extremely problematic 
this business is suffering from the poor environment for electronics generally  and worldwide overcapacity for capacitor production and supply in particular 
however  with a slowing of the erosion in average selling prices for capacitors in the fourth quarter of  it is possible that the capacitor business may also be stabilizing  albeit at a low level 
additionally  write downs of  on tantalum and palladium inventories were taken during the year ended december   negatively impacting gross profit 
gross profit margin for the segment in combined a positive profit margin of for resistors and inductors and a negative for capacitors 
the passive segment includes our measurements group  which experienced significant acquisition activity in see overview segments above 
excluding these acquisitions  sales in the passive segment decreased by  or from the prior year 
the acquisition of bccomponents  a worldwide manufacturer of resistors and capacitors  in december had no effect on the results for the passive segment 
net sales of passive components for the year ended december  decreased by  or from comparable sales of the prior year 
the decrease in net sales was primarily due to low volume and strong pricing pressure with respect to commodity products and  in particular  for tantalum molded capacitor products 
the decrease in the passive components business gross profit margins in was related to strong pricing pressure  particularly with respect to commodity products  excess capacity and higher costs for palladium and tantalum powder 
additionally  write downs of  on tantalum and palladium inventories were taken during the year ended december   negatively impacting gross profit 
active components year ended december net sales    gross profit margin net sales of the active components business for the year ended december  increased by  or from comparable sales of the prior year 
the increase was in substantial measure due to the acquisitions of general semiconductor and the infineon infrared business in  which were included in our results for all of but for only portions of however  it also reflects sales recovery at our existing semiconductor operations 
the increased volume that we experienced in was offset to some extent by modest declines in average selling prices in various product lines 
the improvement in gross profit margins to from is attributable primarily to improvements at our owned siliconix subsidiary and to a lesser extent at our other semiconductor operations 
siliconix s net sales for were  as compared to  in  a increase  and its gross profit margins rose from for the year ended december  to for the year ended december  revenues in the active segment for included revenues of  from the infineon infrared business and general semiconductor  compared to revenues of  from these businesses in excluding the contribution of these acquisitions  net sales in would have increased by as compared to and gross profit margin would have been 
net sales of the active components business for the year ended december  decreased by  or from comparable sales of the prior year 
the decrease in the active components business net sales was primarily due to the decrease in net sales of siliconix 
siliconix s net sales for the year ended december  were  as compared to  a decrease 
the decrease from the prior year was primarily due to the downturn in the computer and cell phone handset markets  which resulted in reduced demand for our products  and overly optimistic industry forecasts for the cell phone handset market  which led to excess handset inventories 
revenues in the active segment for reflect revenues of  from the infineon infrared business acquired in july and general semiconductor acquired in november excluding the contribution of these acquisitions  net sales in would have decreased by as compared to and gross profit margin would have been 
selling  general and administrative expenses selling  general  and administrative expenses for the year ended december  were of net sales as compared to of net sales for the prior year 
the amount of these expenses increased by  for the year ended december  as compared to the prior year 
the higher percentage and amount in was due primarily to acquisition activity 
we continue to implement cost reduction initiatives company wide  with particular emphasis on reducing headcount in high labor cost countries 
selling  general  and administrative expenses for the year ended december  were of net sales as compared to of net sales for the prior year 
the higher percentage in was due to reduced sales levels 
selling  general and administrative expenses decreased by  for the year ended december  as compared to the prior year 
restructuring expense our restructuring activities have been designed to cut both fixed and variable costs  particularly in response to the reduced demand for products occasioned by the electronics industry downturn beginning in these activities included the closing of facilities and the termination of employees 
restructuring costs are expensed during the period in which we determine that we will incur those costs and all applicable requirements of accrual accounting for recognizing such expenses are satisfied 
because costs are recorded based upon estimates  actual expenditures for the restructuring activities may differ from the initially recorded costs 
if the initial estimates were too low or too high  we could be required either to record additional expenses in future periods or to reverse previously recorded expenses 
we anticipate that we will realize the benefits of the restructuring through lower labor costs and other operating expenses in future periods  although it is not possible to quantify the expected savings 
we recorded restructuring expense for the year ended december  of  these expenses are comprised of termination costs for  employees in europe  israel and the united states 
through the end of  we paid  of these costs  corresponding to the termination of employees 
the balance remaining at december  is expected to be paid out by the end of we recorded  in restructuring expense in  including costs for both employee termination and facility closure 
the remaining balance at december  of  is expected to be paid out by the end of for additional detail on restructuring expense in and  see note to our consolidated financial statements 
restructuring expense is separate from plant closure  employee termination and similar integration costs we incur in connection with our acquisition activities 
these amounts are included in the costs of our acquisitions and do not affect earnings or losses on our statement of operations 
for a discussion of these costs in and  see note to our consolidated financial statements 
interest expense interest expense for the year ended december  increased by  compared to the prior year 
this increase was a result of higher average outstanding bank borrowings attributable to our acquisition activity  offset in part by somewhat lower interest rates 
interest expense for the year ended december  decreased by  compared to the prior year 
this decrease was a result of lower average outstanding bank borrowings and lower interest rates on borrowings in as compared to the prior year 
during the second quarter of  we paid down the debt then outstanding under our revolving credit agreement with the proceeds received from the issuance of liquid yield option notes lyons 
we also added  principal amount of convertible subordinated debentures and  of bank debt in november from the acquisition of general semiconductor 
other income other income for the year ended december  was  as compared to  for the comparable prior year period 
other income for the year ended december  was  as compared to  for the comparable prior year period 
other income in both and consisted primarily of interest income  as well as gains on disposal of property and equipment  and foreign exchange gains 
for additional information  see note to our consolidated financial statements 
minority interest minority interest increased by  for the year ended december  as compared to the prior year  primarily due to the increase in net earnings of siliconix  of which we own 
minority interest decreased by  for the year ended december  as compared to the prior year  primarily due to the decrease in net earnings of siliconix 
income taxes the effective tax rate for the year ended december  was  reflecting an income tax benefit  compared to for the prior year  reflecting income tax expense 
the low effective rate in is primarily a consequence of the losses before income taxes in low tax jurisdictions 
while we continue to benefit from low tax rates in israel  we recognized a large taxable loss in israel in  with the effect of reducing our overall tax benefit on our losses 
the more favorable israeli tax rates are applied to specific approved projects and are normally available for a period of ten or fifteen years see the discussion of our israeli tax benefits in overview israeli government incentives above 
comparatively  in  the high effective tax rate was due to low net earnings and the non tax deductibility of purchased research and development expense related to the general semiconductor acquisition 
the effective tax rate for the year ended december  was as compared to for the prior year 
the increase in the tax rate for reflected a significant decrease in net earnings  as compared to  in low tax jurisdictions  and the non tax deductibility of the purchased research and development expense  related to the acquisition of general semiconductor 
the low tax rates in israel applicable to us  as compared to the statutory rate in the united states  resulted in increases in net earnings of  and  for the years ended december  and  respectively 
financial condition and liquidity cash flows from operations were  for the year ended december  compared to  for the prior year 
the increase in cash generated from operations reflects improved working capital management  including reductions in inventory and accounts receivable 
the inventory reduction reflects production adjustments we implemented in response to the business slowdown in order to control inventory levels 
net purchases of property and equipment for the year ended december  were  compared to  in the prior year 
the decrease reflects an effort to rationalize our capital spending to the realities of the current economic environment  while making prudent investments in our capital infrastructure in order to remain competitive and efficient 
we also used  in cash for acquisitions in  primarily for our acquisitions of bccomponents in december and other smaller acquisitions in our measurements group during the year 
the acquisitions were funded in part by our cash balances and in part from borrowings 
see note to our consolidated financial statements for discussion of these acquisitions 
we made net payments of  on our revolving credit lines during  funded from cash flow from operations 
see notes and to our consolidated financial statements for discussion of acquisition related restructuring costs paid during and expected to be paid in the future 
other accrued expenses include  of acquisition related costs and other restructuring costs expected to be paid in cash subsequent to in may  we completed the offering of million aggregate principal amount at maturity of liquid yield option notes lyons at an offering price of per  aggregate principal amount at maturity of notes 
the net proceeds to us of this offering were approximately million 
the lyons are convertible into approximately million shares of our common stock 
the lyons may be put to us at their accreted value on june of each of   and at a purchase price per  aggregate principal amount at maturity of   and  respectively 
see note to our consolidated financial statements for discussion of the terms of the lyons 
we completed our acquisition of general semiconductor on november  in a stock for stock transaction resulting in the issuance of  shares of our common stock 
general semiconductor had outstanding million principal amount convertible notes  which as a result of the acquisition are now convertible into approximately million shares of our common stock 
as required by the terms of the notes  following the merger  general semiconductor made an offer to repurchase the notes at of their principal amount plus accrued interest 
as a result of this offer  we acquired notes with a principal amount of million in january in connection with our acquisition of bccomponents in december  we issued  principal amount of our floating rate unsecured loan notes due the notes bear interest at libor plus through december  and at libor thereafter 
the interest payable on the notes could be further reduced to of libor after december  if the price of our common stock trades above a specified target price  as provided in the notes 
the notes are subject to a put and call agreement under which the holders may at any time put the notes to us in exchange for  shares of our common stock in the aggregate  and we may call the notes in exchange for cash or for shares of our common stock after years from the date of issuance 
also in december  we amended our long term revolving credit and swing line facility to  among other things  reduce the aggregate bank commitments under this facility from  to  this amount may be increased in the future under certain circumstances 
as of december   we had  outstanding under this facility 
letters of credit totaling  were outstanding at december  borrowings under the facility bear interest at variable rates based  at our option  on the prime rate or a eurocurrency rate  and in the case of any swing line advance  the quoted rate 
the borrowings are secured by pledges of stock in certain of our significant subsidiaries and indirect subsidiaries and guaranteed by certain of our significant subsidiaries 
we are required to pay facility fees on the long term facility 
the credit facility restricts us from paying cash dividends  and requires us to comply with certain financial covenants 
the facility expires on june   although we may request year to year renewals 
see note to our consolidated financial statements for additional information 
at december   we had a current ratio current assets to current liabilities of to  compared with a ratio of to at december  the decrease in is attributable to cash spent on acquisitions  lower inventories resulting from our inventory management efforts and lower accounts receivable 
our ratio of long term debt  less current portion  to stockholders equity was to at december  compared to to at december  the increase in long term debt ratio reflects the issuance of the floating rate notes in connection with the bccomponents acquisition and the net loss for contractual commitments as of december  the company had contractual obligations in the form of non cancelable operating leases see note to our consolidated financial statements and long term contracts for the purchase of tantalum powder and wire see note to our consolidated financial statements  as follows in thousands payments due by period after less than total year years years years operating leases      tantalum purchases     total      inflation normally  inflation does not have a significant impact on our operations as our products are not generally sold on long term contracts 
consequently  we can adjust our selling prices  to the extent permitted by competition  to reflect cost increases caused by inflation 
safe harbor statement from time to time  information provided by us  including but not limited to statements in this report  or other statements made by or on our behalf  may contain forward looking information within the meaning of the private securities litigation reform act of such statements involve a number of risks  uncertainties and contingencies  many of which are beyond our control  which may cause actual results  performance or achievements to differ materially from those anticipated 
set forth below are important factors that could cause our results  performance or achievements to differ materially from those in any forward looking statements made by us or on our behalf 
economic environment  competition  backlog o we and others in the electronic and semiconductor component industry have for the past several years experienced a decline in product demand on a global basis  resulting in order cancellations and deferrals 
this decline is primarily attributable to a slowing of growth in the personal computer and cellular telephone product markets 
this slowdown may continue and may become more pronounced 
the current slowdown in demand  as well as recessionary trends in the global economy  makes it more difficult for us to predict our future sales  which also makes it more difficult to manage our operations  and could adversely impact our results of operations 
o our business is highly competitive worldwide  with low transportation costs and few import barriers 
we compete principally on the basis of product quality and reliability  availability  customer service  technological innovation  timely delivery and price 
the electronic components industry has become increasingly concentrated and globalized in recent years and our major competitors  some of which are larger than us  have significant financial resources and technological capabilities 
o many of the orders that comprise our backlog may be canceled by customers without penalty 
customers may on occasion double and triple order components from multiple sources to ensure timely delivery when backlog is particularly long 
customers often cancel orders when business is weak and inventories are excessive  a phenomenon that we are experiencing in the current economic slowdown 
therefore  we cannot be certain the amount of our backlog does not exceed the level of orders that will ultimately be delivered 
our results of operations could be adversely impacted if customers cancel a material portion of orders in our backlog 
product development  business expansion  military qualifications o our future operating results are dependent  in part  on our ability to develop  produce and market new and innovative products  to convert existing products to surface mount devices and to customize certain products to meet customer requirements 
there are numerous risks inherent in this complex process  including the risks that we will be unable to anticipate the direction of technological change or that we will be unable to timely develop and bring to market new products and applications to meet customers changing needs 
o our long term historical growth in revenues and net earnings has resulted  in large part  from our strategy of expansion through acquisitions 
however  we cannot assure you that we will identify or successfully complete transactions with suitable acquisition candidates in the future 
we also cannot assure you that acquisitions we complete will be successful 
if an acquired business fails to operate as anticipated or cannot be successfully integrated with our other businesses  our results of operations  enterprise value  market value and prospects could all be materially and adversely affected 
o if we were to undertake a substantial acquisition for cash  the acquisition would likely need to be financed in part through bank borrowings or the issuance of public or private debt 
this would likely decrease our ratio of earnings to fixed charges and adversely affect other leverage criteria 
under our existing credit facility  we are required to obtain our lenders consent for certain additional debt financing  to comply with other covenants including the application of specific financial ratios  and are restricted from paying cash dividends on our capital stock 
we cannot assure you that the necessary acquisition financing would be available to us on acceptable terms when required 
if we were to undertake an acquisition for equity  the acquisition may have a dilutive effect on the interests of the holders of our common stock 
o any drop in demand or increase in supply of our products due to the overcapacity of our competitors could cause a dramatic drop in average sales prices causing a decrease in gross margins 
o we have qualified certain of our products under various military specifications 
products from some of our united states manufacturing facilities experience a reduction in product classification levels from time to time 
during the time that the classification level is reduced for a product with military application  net sales and earnings attributable to that product may be adversely affected 
foreign operations and sales o we have operations in countries around the world outside the united states  and approximately of our revenues during were derived from sales to customers outside the united states 
some of the countries in which we operate have in the past experienced and may continue to experience political  economic and military instability or unrest 
these conditions could have an adverse impact on our ability to operate in these regions and  depending on the extent and severity of these conditions  could materially and adversely affect our overall financial condition and operating results 
in particular  current tensions in the middle east could adversely affect our business operations in israel and elsewhere 
o we have increased our operations in israel over the past several years 
the low tax rates in israel applicable to earnings of our operations in that country compared to the rates in the united states  have historically had the effect of increasing our net earnings  although that was not the effect in in addition  we have taken advantage of certain incentive programs in israel  which take the form of grants designed to increase employment in israel 
any significant increase in the israeli tax rates or reduction or elimination of the israeli grant programs that have benefited us could have an adverse impact on our results of operations 
see note to our consolidated financial statements for a description of our accounting policy for grants received by certain subsidiaries from governments outside the united states 
restructuring and cost reduction activities o our strategy is aimed at achieving significant production cost savings through the transfer and expansion of manufacturing operations to and in countries with lower production costs  including the czech republic  hungary  india  israel  malaysia  mexico  the people s republic of china  the philippines  portugal and the republic of china taiwan 
in this process  we may experience under utilization of certain plants and factories in high labor cost regions and capacity constraints in plants and factories located in lower labor cost regions 
this may result  initially  in production inefficiencies and higher costs 
these costs include those associated with compensation in connection with work force reductions and plant closings in the higher labor cost regions  start up expenses  manufacturing and construction delays  and increased depreciation costs in connection with the initiation or expansion of production in lower labor cost regions 
o as we implement transfers of certain of our operations  we may experience strikes or other types of labor unrest as a result of lay offs or termination of employees in higher labor cost countries 
o our strategy also focuses on the reduction of selling  general and administrative expenses through the integration or elimination of redundant sales offices and administrative functions at acquired companies 
our inability to achieve these goals could have an adverse effect on our results of operations 
raw materials o our results of operations may be adversely impacted by difficulties in obtaining raw materials  supplies  power  natural resources and any other items needed for the production of our products  the effects of quality deviations in raw materials  particularly tantalum powder  palladium and ceramic dielectric materials  and the effects of significant fluctuations in the prices for tantalum or palladium on existing inventories and purchase commitments for these materials 
see description of the business sources of supplies above 
environmental issues o our manufacturing operations  products and or product packaging are subject to environmental laws and regulations governing air emissions  wastewater discharges  the handling  disposal and remediation of hazardous substances  wastes and certain chemicals used or generated in our manufacturing processes  employee health and safety labeling or other notifications with respect to the content or other aspects of our processes  products or packaging  restrictions on the use of certain materials in or on design aspects of our products or product packaging and responsibility for disposal of products or product packaging 
more stringent environmental regulations may be enacted in the future  and we cannot presently determine the modifications  if any  in our operations that any such future regulations might require  or the cost of compliance with these regulations 
in order to resolve liabilities at various sites  we have entered into various administrative orders and consent decrees  some of which may be  under certain conditions  reopened or subject to renegotiation 
the class b common stock o we have two classes of common stock common stock and class b common stock 
the holders of common stock are entitled to one vote for each share held  while the holders of class b common stock are entitled to votes for each share held 
currently  dr 
zandman  our chairman and ceo  owns or has voting power over substantially all of our class b common stock and accordingly controls approximately of our outstanding voting power 
as a result  dr 
zandman is able to effectively control stockholder action 
o effective control of our company by holders of the class b common stock may make us less attractive as a target for a takeover proposal 
it may also make it more difficult or discourage a merger proposal or proxy contest for the removal of the incumbent directors 
accordingly  this may deprive the holders of common stock of an opportunity they might otherwise have to sell their shares at a premium over the prevailing market price in connection with a merger or acquisition of the company with or by another company
