cash flows as shown in nvr s consolidated statement of cash flows for the year ended december   nvr s operating activities provided cash of  for this period 
the cash was provided primarily by homebuilding operations and by the utilization of a tax benefit of approximately  as a result of stock option exercises

cash was used for entering into contract land deposits with developers to acquire control of finished lots under lot option contracts and for increasing homebuilding inventory

table of contents of the consolidated financial statements 
included in net cash used for financing is an approximate  increase in borrowings under credit lines to finance mortgage loan inventory by nvr s mortgage banking segment 
at december   the homebuilding and mortgage banking segments had restricted cash of  and  respectively  which includes certain customer deposits  mortgagor tax  insurance  completion escrows and other amounts collected at closing which relates to mortgage loans held for sale and to home sales 
nvr believes that internally generated cash and borrowings available under credit facilities will be sufficient to satisfy near and longer term cash requirements for working capital and debt service in both its homebuilding and mortgage banking operations 
critical accounting policies general the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements  and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods 
nvr continually evaluates the estimates it uses to prepare the consolidated financial statements  and updates those estimates as necessary 
in general  management s estimates are based on historical experience  on information from third party professionals  and other various assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the facts and circumstances 
actual results could differ materially from those estimates made by management 
homebuilding inventory the carrying value of inventory is stated at the lower of cost or market value 
cost of lots and completed and uncompleted housing units represent the accumulated actual cost thereof 
field construction supervisors salaries and related direct overhead expenses are included in inventory costs 
interest costs are not capitalized into inventory 
upon settlement  the cost of the units is expensed on a specific identification basis 
cost of manufacturing materials is determined on a first in  first out basis 
recoverability and impairment  if any  is primarily evaluated by analyzing sales of comparable assets 
management believes that its accounting policy is designed to properly assess the carrying value of homebuilding inventory 
contract land deposits nvr purchases finished lots under option contracts that require deposits that may be forfeited if nvr fails to perform under the contract 
the deposits are in the form of cash or letters of credit in varying amounts and represent a percentage of the aggregate purchase price of the finished lots 
nvr maintains an allowance for losses on contract land deposits that it believes is sufficient to provide for losses in the existing contract land deposit portfolio 
the allowance reflects management s judgment of the present loss exposure at the end of the reporting period  considering market and economic conditions  sales absorption and profitability within specific communities and terms of the various contracts 
although nvr considers the allowance for losses on contract land deposits reflected on the december  balance sheet to be adequate  there can be no assurance that this allowance will prove to be adequate over time to cover losses due to unanticipated adverse changes in the economy or other events adversely affecting specific markets or the homebuilding industry 
intangible assets nvr adopted the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards no  goodwill and other intangible assets sfas no during excess reorganization value in excess of identifiable assets excess reorg value and goodwill is no longer subject to amortization 
rather  excess reorg value and goodwill is subject to at least an annual assessment for impairment by applying a fair value based test 
nvr 
table of contents continually evaluates whether events and circumstances have occurred that indicate that the remaining value of excess reorg value and goodwill may not be recoverable 
at december   management believes that excess reorg value and goodwill were not impaired 
this conclusion is based on management s judgment  considering such factors as nvr s history of operating success  nvr s well recognized brand names and the significant positions held in the markets in which nvr operates 
however  changes in strategy or adverse changes in market conditions could impact this judgment and require an impairment loss to be recognized for the amount that the carrying value of excess reorg value and or goodwill exceeds their fair value 
mortgage servicing rights nvr sells its servicing rights on a flow basis through fixed price servicing sales contracts 
due to the short period of time the servicing rights are held  from one to four months  nvr does not amortize the servicing asset 
since the servicing rights are recorded at the value in the servicing sales contracts  there are no impairment issues related to these assets 
warranty product liability accruals warranty and product liability accruals are established to provide for estimated future expenses as a result of construction and product defects  product recalls and litigation incidental to nvr s business 
liability estimates are determined based on management judgment considering such factors as historical experience  the likely current cost of corrective action  manufacturers and subcontractors participation in sharing the cost of corrective action  consultations with third party experts such as engineers  and discussions with our general counsel and other outside counsel retained to handle specific product liability cases 
although nvr considers the warranty and product liability accrual reflected on the december  balance sheet to be adequate  there can be no assurance that this accrual will prove to be adequate over time to cover losses due to increased costs for material and labor  the inability or refusal of manufacturers or subcontractors to financially participate in corrective action  unanticipated adverse legal settlements  or other unanticipated changes to the assumptions used to estimate the warranty and product liability accrual 
impact of inflation  changing prices and economic conditions see risk factors previously discussed 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk market risk is the risk of loss arising from adverse changes in market prices and interest rates 
nvr s market risk arises from interest rate risk inherent in its financial instruments 
interest rate risk is the possibility that changes in interest rates will cause unfavorable changes in net income or in the value of interest rate sensitive assets  liabilities and commitments 
lower interest rates tend to increase demand for mortgage loans for home purchasers  while higher interest rates make it more difficult for potential borrowers to purchase residential properties and to qualify for mortgage loans 
nvr has no market rate sensitive instruments held for speculative or trading purposes 
nvr s mortgage banking segment is exposed to interest rate risk as it relates to its lending activities 
the mortgage banking segment originates mortgage loans  which are either sold through optional or mandatory forward delivery contracts into the secondary markets 
all of the mortgage banking segment s loan portfolio is held for sale and subject to forward sale commitments 
nvr also sells predominantly all of its mortgage servicing rights in bulk sales at predetermined prices which significantly reduces the market risk associated with these interest sensitive assets 
nvr s homebuilding segment generates operating liquidity and acquires capital assets through fixed rate and variable rate debt 
the homebuilding segment s primary variable rate debt is a working capital revolving credit facility that currently provides for unsecured borrowings up to  subject to certain borrowing base limitations 
the working capital credit facility expires may  and outstanding amounts bear interest at the election of nvr  at i the base rate of interest announced by the 
table of contents working capital credit facility agent or ii above the eurodollar rate 
the weighted average interest rate for the amounts outstanding under the facility was during there were no amounts outstanding under the working capital revolving credit facility at december  nvrm generates operating liquidity primarily through the mortgage warehouse facility which currently has a borrowing limit of  the interest rate under the mortgage warehouse facility is either i the london interbank offering rate libor plus  or ii to the extent that nvrm provides compensating balances 
the weighted average interest rate for amounts outstanding under the mortgage warehouse facility was during mortgage loans and gestation mortgage backed securities collateralize the mortgage warehouse facility borrowings 
the mortgage warehouse facility is annually renewable and currently expires august  there was  outstanding under the mortgage warehouse facility at december  the mortgage warehouse facility agreement includes  among other items  restrictions on nvrm incurring additional borrowings and making intercompany dividends and tax payments 
in addition  nvrm is required to maintain a minimum net worth of  nvrm from time to time enters into various gestation and repurchase agreements 
nvrm currently has available an aggregate of  of borrowing capacity in such uncommitted facilities 
amounts outstanding thereunder accrue interest at various rates tied to the libor rate and are collateralized by gestation mortgage backed securities and whole loans 
the uncommitted facilities generally require nvrm to  among other items  maintain a minimum net worth and limit its level of liabilities in relation to its net worth 
the weighted average interest rates for amounts outstanding under these uncommitted facilities were and during and  respectively 
there was  outstanding under these uncommitted facilities at december  the following table represents the contractual balances of nvr s on balance sheet financial instruments in dollars at the expected maturity dates  as well as the fair values of those on balance sheet financial instruments  at december  the expected maturity categories take into consideration historical and anticipated prepayment speeds  as well as actual amortization of principal and does not take into consideration the reinvestment of cash or the refinancing of existing indebtedness 
because nvr sells all of the mortgage loans it originates into the secondary markets  nvr has made the assumption that the portfolio of mortgage loans held for sale will mature in the first year 
consequently  outstanding warehouse borrowings and repurchase facilities are also assumed to mature in the first year
