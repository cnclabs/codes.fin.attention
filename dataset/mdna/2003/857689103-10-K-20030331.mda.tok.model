other operations and corporate includes the accounts of wild wild west  our management fees from barley s and green valley ranch station since december   southwest gaming sold september  and corporate expense 
the results of operations for the year ended december  were substantially different from that of the year ended december   due to the impact of various transactions 
on december   we completed the sale of substantially all of the assets of the missouri operations for approximately million 
we purchased substantially all of the assets of santa fe station formerly santa fe hotel casino for approximately million  fiesta rancho formerly fiesta casino hotel for million and fiesta henderson formerly the reserve hotel casino for million on october   january  and january   respectively 
in addition  we sold our slot route operations  southwest gaming  on september   and opened green valley ranch station  a joint venture  on december  consolidated net revenues  operating income and operating margin all declined for the year ended december  as compared to the year ended december   as the contributions from the three acquired properties were less than those of the missouri operations 
net revenues consolidated net revenues for the year ended december  decreased to million as compared to million for the year ended december  the decrease in consolidated net revenues was due in part to the prior year including the operations of southwest gaming  which was sold on september  in addition  revenues at sunset station declined due to the impact from green valley ranch station  which opened on december   and is accounted for under the equity method 
combined net revenues from our major las vegas operations decreased to million for the year ended december  as compared to million for the year ended december  the decline in revenues was due in large part to a decline in revenues at sunset station due to the impact from green valley ranch station 
total net revenues from all properties that we manage including green valley ranch station increased by over the same period 
for the year ended december   as compared to the year ended december   net revenues for our major las vegas operations increased to million due to the acquisitions of santa fe station  fiesta rancho and fiesta henderson 
same store palace station  boulder station  texas station and sunset station net revenues for the year ended december  declined as compared to the year ended december  the terrorist attacks on september  significantly impacted our business for the last four months of in particular  we experienced a substantial decline in revenues subsequent to those events 
although revenues have recovered substantially  the amounts of revenue generated during each customer visit was lower than in recent years 
in addition to the events of september   we faced many other challenges  including the integration of the three newly acquired hotel casinos  softer general economic conditions  higher utility costs  new competition in west las vegas which had an impact on texas station  continued road construction near palace station  construction necessary to transition the reserve to a fiesta branded property and competitive supply increases on the boulder strip and surrounding areas 
operating income operating margin our operating income was impacted by certain charges credits in each year that affect the ability to analyze year to year comparisons 
the following table identifies these charges credits dollars in thousands years ended december  operating income    operating margin certain charges credits impairment loss   preopening expenses   gain on sale of properties   missouri nevada investigations and fines  operating income  excluding certain charges credits   operating margin  excluding certain charges credits consolidated operating income  excluding certain charges credits  increased in the year ended december  as compared to the year ended december  this increase is due to an aggressive cost containment program we implemented as part of our continued focus on operating efficiencies and realizing synergies from the three acquired properties and the opening of green valley ranch station 
as a result  our consolidated operating margin  excluding certain charges credits  improved percentage points in the year ended december  as compared to the prior year 
consolidated operating income  excluding certain charges credits  declined in the year ended december  as compared to the year ended december  this decrease was primarily due to the operating income for the three acquired properties being less than those of the missouri operations 
same store operating income  excluding certain charges credits  decreased to million for the year ended december  from million in the prior year 
the decrease in same store operating income is due to the same factors mentioned above for net revenues 
consolidated operating margin  excluding certain charges credits  decreased percentage points in the year ended december  as compared to the year ended december  same store operating margin  excluding certain charges credits  decreased percentage points for the year ended december  as compared to the prior year 
we implemented a cost reduction program in response to the decline in revenue during the year  however  there is a delayed effect to any such program 
as a result  expenses represented a much higher percentage of revenues for the year ended december  than has historically been the case 
in addition  depreciation and amortization expense increased over the prior year  which negatively affected the operating margin 
the following table highlights our various sources of revenues and expenses as compared to prior years dollars in thousands year ended december  percent change year ended december  percent change year ended december  casino revenues    casino expenses    margin food and beverage revenues food and beverage expenses    margin room revenues room expenses    margin other revenues other expenses    management fees selling  general and administrative expenses percent of net revenues corporate expense percent of net revenues earnings from joint ventures casino 
casino revenues decreased for the year ended december  as compared to the year ended december   due to the same factors affecting the combined net revenues for our major las vegas operations 
the casino profit margin increased percentage points for the year ended december  as compared to the year ended december  we were able to increase our casino profit margin  despite the revenue decline  by taking advantage of our size and scale and due to aggressive cost containment efforts throughout all areas of the casino  particularly marketing through the use of technology with products such as the boarding pass card  xtra play cash and jumbo bingo 
casino revenues decreased for the year ended december  as compared to the year ended december   due to the same factors affecting consolidated net revenues 
the casino profit margin increased to for the year ended december  as compared to for the year ended december  this increase can be attributed primarily to gaming taxes in missouri that are significantly higher than in nevada  which caused the missouri operations to have a comparatively lower profit margin 
food and beverage 
food and beverage revenues decreased for the year ended december  as compared to the year ended december  not withstanding the decrease in food and beverage revenue  the food and beverage net profit margin increased percentage points over the same periods 
we were able to increase our food and beverage net profit margin  despite the decline in revenues  by taking advantage of economies of scale in terms of purchasing power as well as implementing additional cost cutting measures 
food covers declined by for the year ended december  as compared to the year ended december  the reduction in food covers was due to generally soft economic conditions  as well as additional competition in the market from new restaurants 
average ticket prices decreased over the same periods  which was due primarily to selected menu price reductions 
food and beverage revenues increased for the year ended december  as compared to the year ended december   due to the net addition of restaurants resulting from the purchase of the three new properties and to the sale of the missouri operations 
food and beverage net profit margin remained relatively consistent for the year ended december  as compared to the year ended december  same store food covers declined for the year ended december  as compared to the year ended december  the reduction in food covers was due to additional competition in the market from new restaurants and the same factors discussed previously that affected net revenues 
the decline in same store food covers was offset somewhat by a increase in the average ticket price over the same periods  which was due to selected menu price increases 
room 
room revenues increased for the year ended december  as compared to the year ended december  room occupancy increased to from  while the average daily room rate decreased to from over the same periods 
room revenues increased for the year ended december  as compared to the year ended december  the increase is primarily due to the addition of rooms as a result of the acquisition of santa fe station  fiesta rancho and fiesta henderson  net of the loss of rooms from the sale of station casino kansas city 
the same store room occupancy remained unchanged at for the years ended december  and the same store average daily room rate decreased to for the year ended december  as compared to for the year ended december  the events of september  had a significant impact on room revenues from a room rate standpoint 
while occupancy returned to normal levels  room rates remain lower than in prior years 
other 
other revenues primarily include income from the gift shops  bowling  entertainment  leased outlets and arcades 
other revenues decreased for the year ended december  as compared to the year ended december  this decrease was due primarily to the sale of southwest gaming on september   which provided slot route revenues of approximately million for the year ended december  also included in other revenues for the year ended december   were insurance proceeds of approximately million 
other operating expenses decreased for the year ended december  as compared to the same period in the prior year 
the decrease in other operating expenses was due primarily to the sale of southwest gaming mentioned above 
other revenues decreased for the year ended december  as compared to the year ended december  the decrease in other revenues was primarily due to the sale of southwest gaming on september   in addition to the same factors mentioned above for consolidated net revenues 
management fees 
we are the managing partner for both barley s and green valley ranch station and receive a management fee equal to of earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization ebitda from barley s and of revenues and approximately of ebitda from green valley ranch station 
for the year ended december   management fees increased to approximately million  as compared to million for the year ended december   and million for the year ended december  the increase in management fees is directly related to green valley ranch station  which opened on december  selling  general and administrative sg a 
sg a as a percentage of net revenues increased to in the year ended december  as compared to in the year ended december  a large portion of these costs are fixed and  as a result  as revenues declined the percentage of sg a to net revenues increased 
sg a expenses decreased to million for the year ended december   from million for the year ended december  the decrease in sg a expenses is a result of an aggressive cost containment program in addition to taking advantage of economies of scale in terms of marketing  purchasing power  advertising and promotions  which was offset somewhat by an increase in energy costs 
sg a as a percentage of net revenues increased to in the year ended december  as compared to in the year ended december  we implemented a cost reduction program in response to the decline in revenue during the year  however  there is a delayed effect to any such program 
as a result  expenses represented a much higher percentage of revenues for the year than has historically been the case 
also  a large portion of these costs are fixed and  as a result  as revenues declined the percentage of sg a to net revenues increased 
sg a expenses also increased due to the significant increase in energy costs over the prior year 
corporate expense 
corporate expense as a percentage of net revenues increased to in the year ended december  as compared to in the year ended december  corporate expense as a percentage of net revenues increased to in the year ended december  as compared to in the year ended december  a large portion of these corporate expenses are fixed  which causes an increase in the percentage of net revenues as revenues decline 
in addition  during the year ended december   we experienced an increase in litigation costs  which included approximately million related to the harrah s patent litigation  as well as an increase in incentive compensation as compared to the prior year 
during the year ended december   we also experienced an increase of approximately million in litigation costs as well as an increase of approximately million in charitable contributions as compared to the year ended december  depreciation and amortization 
depreciation and amortization increased in the year ended december  to million as compared to million in the year ended december  the increase is due primarily to capital spent throughout  which included the retheming of the reserve to a fiesta branded property  the completion of the expansion project at santa fe station and the purchase of new slot machines and a new slot system 
this increase was offset partially due to a portion of the original equipment at sunset station having been fully depreciated during depreciation and amortization increased in the year ended december  to million  as compared to million in the year ended december  this increase is due in part to the expansion project at texas station  which was completed in december and the purchase of new slot machines and other related equipment in the increase in depreciation expense for the three acquired properties was offset by a reduction from the sale of the missouri operations 
impairment loss 
we recorded an impairment loss of million and million in the years ended december  and  respectively  to adjust the carrying value of our other assets to their estimated fair value 
in the year ended december   approximately million of the impairment loss related to the write down of certain assets related to our investments in an internet  intra state gaming platform and related technology 
in may  the nevada gaming commission communicated that it had general concerns regarding the security and reliability of internet gaming platforms 
the impairment of these assets was based upon our decision to no longer pursue nevada based internet gaming activities as a result of the uncertainty of regulatory approval of these types of activities 
as a result  all of the hardware  software and internal development costs that we had incurred were written off in  as they were deemed to have no value 
in addition  approximately million of the impairment loss was related to our option to invest in the internet wagering business 
in february  we announced that we intended to purchase a interest in kerzner interactive limited formerly sunonline limited kerzner interactive  a wholly owned subsidiary of kerzner international limited formerly sun international hotels limited kerzner 
kerzner interactive was to be the exclusive vehicle for both kerzner and us to pursue the internet wagering business 
in july  we converted our agreement to acquire a interest in kerzner interactive into an option to do so  and paid million for such option 
kerzner has decided to discontinue kerzner interactive  as it targeted internet wagering only from jurisdictions that permitted online gaming 
as these jurisdictions became more restrictive in their acceptance of internet gaming  the market size was reduced and competition intensified  resulting in a substantial decrease in the probability of achieving profitability in the short to medium term 
as a result  we have written off the option payment and other costs related to this investment 
in the year ended december   we recorded an impairment loss with respect to a acre parcel  near the intersection of martin luther king jr 
drive and craig road in north las vegas 
this impairment loss was necessary because  after evaluating all of our options  we determined not to develop a casino on this site 
the assets included capitalized rent and design costs  which had no value after we made the decision not to develop a gaming facility on this parcel 
as of december   gaming is not permitted on this site due to zoning restrictions 
preopening expenses 
preopening expenses for the year ended december  were million  which included costs incurred prior to the acquisitions of fiesta rancho and fiesta henderson and costs incurred prior to the opening of green valley ranch station 
preopening expenses during the year ended december  were million  which included costs incurred prior to the acquisitions of santa fe station  fiesta rancho and fiesta henderson  the expansion project at texas station and costs incurred prior to the opening of green valley ranch station 
gain on sale of properties 
on september   we sold southwest gaming services  inc southwest gaming  our wholly owned subsidiary  to blake l 
sartini  our former executive vice president and chief operating officer 
we transferred our stock in southwest gaming to mr 
sartini in exchange for our common stock valued at approximately million 
we recorded a gain on the sale of million in the year ended december  the gain reflected the difference between the carrying value of our investment in the southwest gaming assets to be distributed of million and the fair value of our common stock of million  which was based on its average trading price for five days before september   the transaction closing date 
on december   we completed the sale of substantially all of the assets of the missouri operations for approximately million 
we recorded a gain on the sale of million in the year ended december  missouri nevada investigations and fines

earnings from joint ventures 
we jointly own a interest in green valley ranch station and barley s 
for the year ended december   we recorded million as our share of the earnings from these joint ventures 
we recorded our share of the earnings from these joint ventures of million and million for the years ended december and december  respectively 
the earnings from joint ventures increased as a result of the opening of green valley ranch station on december  interest expense  net 
interest costs incurred expensed and capitalized decreased to million in the year ended december  as compared to million in the year ended december  this decrease is directly related to a decrease of million in total long term debt from the prior year excluding the interest rate swap mark to market adjustment 
the decrease in interest expense was also related to a decrease in the average cost of debt to for the year ended december  from for the year ended december   which is directly related to the interest rate swaps that have converted a portion of our fixed rate debt to a floating rate 
the net effect of the interest rate swaps resulted in a reduction in interest expense of million for the year ended december  as compared to a reduction of million in the year ended december  interest costs incurred expensed and capitalized increased to million in the year ended december  as compared to million in the year ended december  this increase is directly related to an increase of million in total long term debt from the prior year excluding the interest rate swap mark to market adjustment  resulting from the addition of million in senior notes  which was offset by the elimination of million in senior subordinated notes 
the increase in interest expense was tempered somewhat by a decrease in the average cost of debt to for the year ended december  from for the year ended december  interest expense from joint ventures 
for the years ended december  and  we recorded million and million  respectively  in interest expense related to our unconsolidated joint ventures 
the increase in interest expense from joint ventures is directly related to the opening of green valley ranch station on december  loss on early retirement of debt

in  and have reclassified prior period losses on early retirement of debt as an item in other non operating income expense  rather than classified as an extraordinary item shown net of the applicable tax benefit 
during the year ended december   we recorded a loss on early retirement of debt of approximately million  of which approximately million relates to the write off of the unamortized loan costs on our previous revolving facility see liquidity and capital resources description of certain indebtedness and capital stock 
the remaining million relates to the redemption of our million senior subordinated notes on october  we recorded a charge of approximately million to reflect the write off of the unamortized debt discount  unamortized loan costs and the premium to redeem our million senior subordinated notes  which was partially offset by approximately million from the adjusted basis of the debt as a result of the fair value hedge termination that was tied directly to our million senior subordinated notes

we implemented sfas no 
on january  and tested for impairment in accordance with the provisions of sfas no 
in the first quarter of as a result of an independent third party appraisal  we recorded an impairment loss of million  net of the applicable tax benefit  related to the acquisition of fiesta rancho  which is shown as a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle in our consolidated statements of operations

future development united auburn indian community we have entered into a development services agreement and a management agreement with the uaic 
pursuant to those agreements  and in compliance with a memorandum of understanding entered by the uaic and placer county  california  we are developing  with the uaic  thunder valley casino  a gaming and entertainment facility on acres located approximately seven miles north of interstate  in placer county  california  near sacramento 
on september   the united states department of the interior accepted the land into trust on behalf of the uaic 
the acceptance of the land into trust followed the decision of the united states district court for the district of washington  dc  dismissing a lawsuit filed by the cities of roseville and rocklin  california  and citizens for safer communities  which challenged the united states department of the interior s preliminary decision to accept the land into trust 
immediately following the district court s decision  the plaintiffs appealed the decision to the washington  dc court of appeals and filed an emergency motion for stay of the district court s decision 
the court of appeals denied the plaintiffs emergency action 
notwithstanding the denial of the plaintiffs emergency motion and the acceptance of the land into trust  there can be no assurances that the plaintiffs will not seek other extraordinary remedies and there can be no assurances as to the ultimate outcome of the plaintiffs pending appeal 
our seven year management agreement to manage thunder valley casino was approved by the national indian gaming commission in december upon the opening of thunder valley casino  we will receive a management fee equal to of the facility s income 
we will also receive a development fee equal to of the cost of the project 
the development fee is payable upon the opening of the facility 
it is anticipated that thunder valley casino will house between  and  class iii slot machines and approximately table games  including a private vip gaming area 
the facility will have numerous dining and entertainment amenities  including a center pit bar  three specialty restaurants  a seat buffet  a food court and parking for over  vehicles 
construction began on october   and we anticipate that the casino will open in june with the remainder of the facility to be completed during the fourth quarter of the cost of the project is expected to be approximately million 
we also assisted the uaic in obtaining million of financing for the project through a group of lenders  and we provided an unlimited completion guaranty and credit support for all amounts outstanding under such financing 
any amounts required under the completion guaranty are recoverable after the facility has opened 
we  along with the uaic  are currently working on completing the remainder of the financing  however  to the extent the additional funds cannot be raised through third parties  we will fund any shortfall 
as of december   we had advanced approximately million to the uaic for the development of thunder valley casino  which is included as a note receivable on our consolidated balance sheets 
based on the current terms of the credit financing  our advances cannot be repaid prior to the maturity of the credit facility  which is scheduled for january our advances to the uaic are subordinated to the credit facility and carry an interest rate of  which will be recorded upon the opening of the facility 
as of december   the accrued interest on our advances to the uaic was approximately million 
wildfire casino we purchased the wildfire casino in january for million  which was funded with borrowings from our revolving facility 
the wildfire casino is located on rancho road in las vegas  across from texas station 
the  square foot facility features slot machines  six table games  a sports book  lounge  outdoor patio and a full service restaurant 
land acquisition we have acquired certain parcels of land in the las vegas valley and in sacramento  california as part of our development activities 
our decision on whether to proceed with any new gaming opportunity is dependent upon future economic and regulatory factors  the availability of financing and competitive and strategic considerations 
as many of these considerations are beyond our control  no assurances can be made that we will be able to secure additional  acceptable financing in order to proceed with any particular project 
as of december   we had million of land held for development that consists primarily of five sites that are owned or leased  which comprise acres in the las vegas valley and acres in the sacramento area near the thunder valley casino project 
in addition  we have options to purchase a total of acres adjacent to two of the sites in the las vegas valley 
the rhodes ranch site consists of two parcels totaling acres we own acres and have an option to purchase acres  located at the intersection of durango road and the southern beltway interstate located in the southwest quadrant of las vegas 
the boulder tropicana site is a acre site consisting of two parcels at the intersection of boulder highway and tropicana avenue in eastern las vegas 
we are leasing with an option to purchase acres of the site and hold an option to purchase the adjacent acre parcel 
we also own a acre gaming entitled parcel in southwest las vegas at the intersection of flamingo road and interstate and a acre gaming entitled parcel at the intersection of boulder highway and nellis boulevard 
in july  we entered into an agreement that gives us the right to acquire approximately acres of land in the summerlin master planned community in las vegas  nevada 
the land is located on charleston boulevard at the interstate charleston interchange 
the purchase price for the land is approximately million 
we exercised our option to purchase the property and made a payment of million in october  which will be fully applicable to the purchase price 
we anticipate completing the purchase during the second quarter of  however  no assurances can be made that the purchase will actually be completed 
regulation and taxes we are subject to extensive regulation by the nevada gaming authorities and will be subject to regulation  which may or may not be similar to that in nevada  by any other jurisdiction in which we may conduct gaming activities in the future  including the national indian gaming commission and tribal gaming agency of the uaic 
changes in applicable laws or regulations could have a significant impact on our operations 
the gaming industry represents a significant source of tax revenue  particularly to the state of nevada and its counties and municipalities 
from time to time  various state and federal legislators and officials have proposed changes in tax law  or in the administration of such law  affecting the gaming industry 
the nevada legislature is currently considering various proposals to increase taxes on our operations 
while the final tax bill has not been enacted  it is likely that we will be subject to increased taxes  however  the magnitude of any increase in taxes is yet to be determined 
we believe that our recorded tax balances are adequate 
however  it is not possible to determine with certainty the likelihood of possible changes in tax law or in the administration of such law 
such changes  if adopted  could have a material adverse effect on our operating results 
description of certain indebtedness and capital stock revolving facility in september  we completed financing on a new million revolving credit facility the revolving facility 
the revolving facility contains no principal amortization and matures in september the borrowers are our major operating subsidiaries and the revolving facility is secured by substantially all of our assets 
borrowings under the revolving facility bear interest at a margin above the alternate base rate or the eurodollar rate each  as defined in the revolving facility  as selected by us 
the margin above such rates  and the fee on the unfunded portions of the revolving facility  will vary quarterly based on our combined consolidated ratio of debt to adjusted ebitda each  as defined in the revolving facility

we have pledged the stock of all of our major subsidiaries 
senior and senior subordinated notes in  we completed offerings for a total of million of senior notes due in february the senior notes 
the senior notes bear interest at a rate equal to per annum and were priced at par 
the indentures governing the senior notes contain substantially the same covenants as our senior subordinated notes as well as a limitation on liens we can incur 
the proceeds from the senior notes were used to repay amounts outstanding on our previous revolving facility and to redeem our million senior subordinated notes  which were due in as a result of the redemption  we recorded a loss on early retirement of debt of approximately million in we have million  net of unamortized discount of million  of senior subordinated notes outstanding as of december   million of these notes bear interest  payable semi annually  at a rate of per year and million of these notes bear interest  payable semi annually  at a rate of per year collectively the notes 
the indentures governing the notes and senior notes the indentures contain certain customary financial and other covenants  which limit our and our subsidiaries ability to incur additional debt and to pay dividends 
at december   our consolidated coverage ratio as defined in the indentures was to 
the indentures provide that we may not incur additional indebtedness  other than specified types of indebtedness  unless the consolidated coverage ratio is at least to 
in the event our consolidated coverage ratio is below to  the covenant limits our ability to incur additional indebtedness for borrowings under the revolving facility not to exceed the greater of million or times operating cash flow as defined for the four most recent quarters  plus million 
the limitation on the incurrence of additional indebtedness and dividend restrictions in the indentures significantly restricts our ability to pay dividends on our capital stock 
the indentures also give the holders of the notes the right to require us to purchase the notes at of the principal amount of the notes plus accrued interest thereon upon a change of control and rating decline each as defined in the indentures of the company 
during  we entered into various interest rate swaps with members of our bank group to manage interest expense 
the interest rate swaps have converted a portion of our fixed rate debt to a floating rate 
as of december   we had one remaining interest rate swap agreement with a total notional amount of million in which we pay a floating rate at december  of approximately and receive a fixed rate at december  of approximately 
the interest rate swap terminates in the net effect of all of the interest rate swaps resulted in a reduction in interest expense of million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
on october   we redeemed our million senior subordinated notes 
the redemption was funded with proceeds from the revolving facility 
we recorded a charge of approximately million during the year ended december   to reflect the write off of the unamortized debt discount  unamortized loan costs and the premium to redeem our million senior subordinated notes 
this charge was partially offset by approximately million from the adjusted basis of the debt as a result of the fair value hedge termination that was tied directly to our million senior subordinated notes  as discussed below 
in addition  we recorded a loss on early retirement of debt of approximately million in to reflect the write off of the unamortized loan costs on our previous revolving facility 
in september  we terminated an interest rate swap with a notional amount of million  which was due to terminate in the interest rate swap was terminated at its market value and  as a result  we received approximately million 
this interest rate swap was tied directly to our million senior subordinated notes

the interest rate swaps that we entered into qualify for the shortcut method allowed under sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  which allows for an assumption of no ineffectiveness 
as such  there is no income statement impact from changes in the fair value of the hedging instruments 
instead  the fair value of the instrument is recorded as an asset or liability on the company s balance sheet with an offsetting adjustment to the carrying value of the related debt 
in accordance with sfas no 
 we recorded assets of million and million as of december  and  respectively  representing the fair value of the interest rate swaps and a corresponding increase in long term debt  as these interest rate swaps are considered highly effective under the criteria established by sfas no

critical accounting policies significant accounting policies and estimates we prepare our consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
certain of our accounting policies  including the determination of bad debt reserves  the estimated useful lives assigned to our assets  asset impairment  insurance reserves  purchase price allocations made in connection with our acquisitions and the calculation of our income tax liabilities  require that we apply significant judgment in defining the appropriate assumptions for calculating financial estimates 
by their nature  these judgments are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty 
our judgments are based on our historical experience  terms of existing contracts  observance of trends in the gaming industry and information available from other outside sources 
there can be no assurance that actual results will not differ from our estimates 
to provide an understanding of the methodology we apply  our significant accounting policies and basis of presentation are discussed where appropriate in this discussion and analysis and in the notes to our consolidated financial statements 
recently issued accounting standards in june  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for asset retirement obligations 
sfas no 
addresses financial accounting and reporting for obligations associated with the retirement of tangible long lived assets and the related asset retirement costs 
this sfas applies to all entities and applies to all legal obligations associated with the retirement of long lived assets that result from the acquisition  construction  development and the normal operation of a long lived asset  except for certain obligations of lessees 
sfas no 
will be effective for our financial statements 
we believe that this sfas will not have a significant impact on our financial position or results of operations 
in august  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
sfas no 
requires that one accounting model be used for long lived assets to be disposed of by sale and broadens the presentation of discontinued operations to include more disposal transactions 
sfas no

 accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities 
sfas no 
requires companies to recognize costs associated with exit or disposal activities when they are incurred rather than at the date of a commitment to an exit or disposal plan  as previously required under emerging issues task force issue a fundamental conclusion reached by the fasb in this statement is that an entity s commitment to a plan  by itself  does not create a present obligation to others that meets the definition of a liability 
sfas no 
also establishes that fair value is the objective for initial measurement of the liability 
the provisions of this statement are effective for exit or disposal activities that are initiated after december  we believe that this sfas will not have a significant impact on our results of operations or financial position 
in november  the fasb issued interpretation no 
 guarantor s accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees  including indirect guarantees of indebtedness of others  an interpretation of sfas nos 
 and and a rescission of fasb interpretation no 
this interpretation elaborates on the disclosures to be made by a guarantor in its interim and annual financial statements about its obligations under certain guarantees that it has issued 
it also clarifies that a guarantor is required to recognize  at the inception of a guarantee  a liability for the fair value of the obligation undertaken in issuing the guarantee 
this interpretation does not prescribe a specific approach for subsequently measuring the guarantor s recognized liability over the term of the related guarantee 
this interpretation also incorporates  without change  the guidance in fasb interpretation no 
 disclosure of indirect guarantees of indebtedness of others  which is being superseded 
the provisions of this interpretation are applicable on a prospective basis to guarantees issued or modified after december   and the disclosure requirements are generally effective for financial statements of interim or annual periods ending after december  we will adopt interpretation no 
in and we believe that this interpretation will not have a significant impact on our results of operations or financial position

to require prominent disclosures in both annual and interim financial statements about the method of accounting for stock based employee compensation and the effect of the method used on reported results 
we have elected to continue to account for stock based employee compensation using the intrinsic value method under apb opinion see note to the consolidated financial statements in this annual report on form k 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk is the risk of loss arising from adverse changes in market rates and prices  such as interest rates  foreign currency exchange rates and commodity prices 
our primary exposure to market risk is interest rate risk associated with our long term debt 
we attempt to limit our exposure to interest rate risk by managing the mix of our long term fixed rate borrowings and short term borrowings under the revolving facility 
borrowings under the revolving facility bear interest at a margin above the alternate base rate or the eurodollar rate each  as defined in the revolving facility as selected by us 
however  the amount of outstanding borrowings is expected to fluctuate and may be reduced from time to time 
the revolving facility matures in september the following table provides information about our long term debt at december  see also description of certain indebtedness and capital stock amounts in thousands maturity date face amount carrying value estimated fair value revolving facility at a weighted average interest rate of approximately september    senior notes february    senior subordinated notes july   senior subordinated notes december   other notes  interest at june market value of interest rate swaps    total    we are also exposed to market risk in the form of fluctuations in interest rates and their potential impact upon our debt 
this market risk is managed by utilizing derivative financial instruments in accordance with established policies and procedures 
we evaluate our exposure to market risk by monitoring interest rates in the marketplace  and do not utilize derivative financial instruments for trading purposes 
our derivative financial instruments consist exclusively of interest rate swap agreements 
interest differentials resulting from these agreements are recorded on an accrual basis as an adjustment to interest expense 
interest rate swaps related to debt are matched with specific fixed rate debt obligations
