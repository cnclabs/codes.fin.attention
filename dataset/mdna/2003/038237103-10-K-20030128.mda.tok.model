item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion contains forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
actual results could differ substantially from those anticipated in these forward looking statements as a result of many factors  including those set forth under summary of business considerations and certain factors that may affect future operating results and or stock price 
overview applied signal technology  inc provides advanced digital signal processing products  systems  and services used in reconnaissance of foreign telecommunications signals 
our primary customers are the united states government and its foreign allies 
commercial applications include spectrum monitoring equipment for commercial communication satellite systems and data intrusion detection equipment for data network protection 
signal reconnaissance systems are comprised of collection and processing equipment 
signal collection equipment consists of sophisticated receivers that scan through potentially thousands of cellular telephone  microwave  ship to shore  and military transmissions in the radio frequency rf spectrum with the goal of collecting certain specific signals 
our signal processing equipment uses advanced software and hardware to evaluate characteristics of the collected signals and selects those most likely to contain relevant information 
at inception in  we focused our efforts primarily on processing equipment 
over time  we have broadened our scope to add specialized collection equipment and complete signal processing systems 
our revenues are primarily generated from sales of our products and services to two agencies of the united states government 
the two agencies accounted for and  respectively  of revenues in fiscal year in fiscal year  the two agencies accounted for and  respectively  of revenues  and in fiscal year  the percentages of revenues derived from these two agencies were and  respectively 
our revenues are derived from either fixed price contracts  which provide that we perform a contract for a fixed price and assume the risk of any cost overruns  or cost reimbursement contracts  which provide that we are reimbursed by the customer for the direct and indirect costs of performance and earn a negotiated profit 
in fiscal years   and  approximately   and  respectively  of our revenues were derived from fixed price contracts 
in fiscal years   and  approximately   and  respectively  of our revenues were derived from cost reimbursement contracts 
historically  we have achieved greater profit margins from our fixed price contracts than from our cost reimbursement contracts 
critical accounting policies and estimates general 
our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements 
these financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states  which require management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes 
actual results could differ significantly from those estimates 
we believe that the estimates  assumptions  and judgments involved in the accounting policies described below have the greatest potential impact on our financial statements and  therefore  consider these to be critical accounting policies 
see note to consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report for more information about these critical accounting policies  as well as descriptions of other significant accounting policies 
revenue and cost recognition 
the majority of our contracts are accounted for in accordance with the american institute of certified public accountants statement of opinion  accounting for performance of construction type and production type contracts 
we account for fixed price contracts by using the percentage of completion method of accounting 
under this method  contract costs are charged to operations as incurred 
a portion of the contract revenue  based on estimated profits and the degree of completion of the contract as measured by a comparison of the actual and estimated costs  is recognized as revenue each period 
we account for cost reimbursement contracts by charging contract costs to operations as incurred and recognizing contract revenues and profits by applying an estimated fee rate to actual costs on an individual contract basis 
management reviews contract performance  costs incurred  and estimated completion costs regularly and adjusts revenues and profits on contracts in the period in which changes become determinable 
our engineering services contracts are typically performed on a level of effort basis 
revenue is calculated in accordance with our policy regarding cost reimbursement contracts  specifically  revenue is based on a fee percentage applied to the costs incurred on these contracts 
anticipated losses on cost reimbursement and fixed price contracts are also recorded in the period in which they become determinable 
unexpected increases in the cost to develop or manufacture a product  whether due to inaccurate estimates in the bidding process  unanticipated increases in material costs  inefficiencies  or other factors are borne by us on fixed price contracts  and could have a material adverse effect on results of operations and financial condition 
unexpected cost increases in cost reimbursement contracts may be borne by us for purposes of maintaining customer relationships 
historically  the effect on operating results and financial condition from cost reimbursement losses has been minimal 
award fee recognition 
our policy for recognizing interim fee on our award fee contracts is based on management s assessment as to the likelihood that the award fee or an incremental portion of the award fee will be earned on a contract by contract basis 
management s assessments are based on numerous factors including contract terms  nature of the work to be performed  our relationship and history with the customer  our history with similar types of projects  and our current and anticipated performance on the specific contract 
no award fee is recognized until management determines that it is probable that an award fee or a portion thereof will be earned 
indirect rate variance 
we record contract revenues and costs for interim reporting purposes based on annual targeted indirect rates 
at year end  the revenues and costs are adjusted for actual indirect rates 
during the interim reporting periods  variances may accumulate between the actual indirect rates and the annual targeted rates 
all timing related indirect spending variances are inventoried as part of work in process during these interim reporting periods 
these rates are reviewed regularly  and we record reserves for any permanent variances in the period they become known 
our accounting policy is based on management s belief that such interim variances  if deemed recoverable  will be absorbed by expected contract activities during the remainder of the year 
if contract activities do not reach planned levels  there are alternatives we can utilize to absorb the variance we can adjust downward some of our planned indirect spending during the year  increase our billing rates to our customers  or record charges to expense based on reduced estimates of future contract activities 
at certain points during fiscal year  we determined that a portion of the indirect expenses would not be absorbed by expected contract activities 
as a result  we recorded a charge to profit of approximately   and  during the second  third  and fourth quarters  respectively 
these additional charges reflect a total of approximately  in indirect expenses that was excluded from our indirect billing rates in fiscal year in fiscal year  the charge to profit for unabsorbed indirect expenses was approximately  operating results fiscal years comparison the following table sets forth  for the periods indicated  statements of operations data as a percentage of revenues from contracts  and  at the end of each period indicated  our backlog year ended october  revenues from contracts operating expenses contract costs research and development general and administrative restructuring costs total operating expenses operating income loss interest income expense  net income loss before provision benefit for income taxes provision benefit for income taxes net income loss backlog thousands of dollars results in fiscal year  we experienced a increase in orders compared to fiscal year this led to an increase in year over year revenues of and a increase in our ending backlog 
as a result of the growth in revenues in fiscal year  a lower operating cost structure when compared to fiscal year  and the absence of our reintegrated subsidiaries  we returned to profitability in fiscal year we experienced a significant revenue decline in fiscal year this decline was due  in part  to what we believed to be delays in the awarding of certain significant engineering development contracts and  in part  to the unanticipated contract closeout of three significant engineering development contracts for the convenience of the customer 
in order to better align infrastructure costs with anticipated revenues  we reduced our consolidated workforce by employees  or approximately of the workforce  during as a result of staff reductions  research and development spending  overhead spending  and marketing expenditures were reduced 
we amended our facilities lease and terminated the lease of two buildings and the option for a third building 
the total reduction in facilities was approximately  square feet 
in addition  during fiscal year  we reintegrated our two subsidiaries  enetsecure  inc  and transcendent technologies  inc  due to their inability to obtain adequate third party financing 
from their inception through the completion of the reintegration of enetsecure and transcendent  we invested approximately  and  respectively  plus the necessary equipment and intellectual property 
upon reintegration  we hired and employees from enetsecure and transcendent  respectively 
revenues revenues were approximately   and  for fiscal years   and  respectively 
revenues increased by during fiscal year over fiscal year  which contrasts with a decrease in revenues of during fiscal year over fiscal year the increase in revenue during fiscal year was predominantly due to an increase in the sales of our standard products 
the decline in revenues during fiscal year was primarily due to a decline in demand during fiscal year  which created a lower average backlog from which to generate revenues during fiscal year the following table identifies the source of our revenues for fiscal years   and by major market fy fy fy intelligence agencies military foreign commercial two intelligence agencies accounted for approximately and  respectively  of revenues in fiscal year  approximately and  respectively  of revenues in fiscal year  and approximately and  respectively  of revenues in fiscal year no other single intelligence agency accounted for more than of total revenues for fiscal years   and in recent years  we have increased our business with military agencies 
revenues from military agencies accounted for approximately   and of our total revenues for fiscal years   and  respectively 
no single military agency accounted for more than of total revenues for fiscal years   and backlog our backlog consists of anticipated revenues from new contracts and from the yet to be completed portions of existing contracts excluding unexercised options 
at the end of fiscal year  ending backlog was approximately  representing a increase from fiscal year ending backlog of  the increase in backlog during fiscal year was primarily due to an increase in new orders generated during the year  when compared to fiscal year during fiscal year  our backlog balance decreased by from fiscal year ending backlog of  the decrease in backlog was mostly due to reductions in contract values of those cost reimbursement contracts for which incurred costs were less than contractual limitations 
contract costs contract costs consist of direct costs incurred on contracts such as labor  materials  and manufacturing overhead costs 
contract costs were approximately  or  of revenues in fiscal year compared to approximately  or  of revenues in fiscal year and approximately  or  of revenues in fiscal year contract costs decreased in aggregate and as a percentage of revenues during fiscal year  primarily due to the lower cost structure that resulted from the fiscal year restructuring activities 
the increase in contract costs as a percentage of revenues in fiscal year compared to fiscal year is due  in part  to a decrease in revenues in fiscal year and  in part  to absorbing significant indirect contract costs in order to lower our billing rates 
research and development expenses company directed investment in research and development consists of expenditures recoverable from customers through billing rates and expenditures funded by us from operations 
research and development expenses were approximately  or  of revenues in fiscal year compared to approximately  or  of revenues in fiscal year and approximately  or  of revenues in fiscal year the decrease in spending during fiscal year compared to fiscal year was the result of management s decision to return research and development expenses to historical levels  as well as the absence of costs incurred during fiscal year by our reintegrated subsidiary corporations 
the increase in research and development spending during fiscal year  when compared to fiscal year  is due  in part  to increasing our investment in key research and development initiatives during the first two quarters of fiscal year while awaiting the award of certain engineering development contracts  and  in part  to approximately  of research and development spending incurred by our subsidiaries 
general and administrative expenses general and administrative expenses include administrative salaries  costs related to marketing and proposal activities  costs related to product warranties  and other administrative costs 
general and administrative expenses were approximately  or  of revenues in fiscal year compared to approximately  or  of revenues in fiscal year and approximately  or  of revenues in fiscal year general and administrative expenses decreased in fiscal year when compared to spending levels in fiscal year due to a lower operating cost structure 
general and administrative expenses remained constant in fiscal year when compared to fiscal year  but increased as a percentage of revenue 
this was primarily due to significantly lower revenues in fiscal year when compared to fiscal year restructuring costs there were no restructuring costs in fiscal year during fiscal year  we implemented cost reduction actions resulting in restructuring costs of  cost reduction actions included a workforce reduction of employees  which included technical employees and administrative employees 
this represented a reduction in the number of employees during fiscal year the restructuring costs included severance related benefits of approximately  the write off of leasehold improvements associated with vacated facilities of approximately  and other associated restructuring costs of  restructuring costs were partially offset by the reversal of deferred rent associated with terminated facility leases of approximately  the deferred rent balance had been recorded over several years beginning with the inception of the lease term and represented the difference between amounts paid for rent expense and the amounts re cognized in the statement of operations on a straight line basis 
interest income expense  net net interest income for fiscal year was approximately  compared to approximately  and  of net interest income in fiscal years and  respectively 
the decrease in net interest income in fiscal year compared to fiscal year is due  in part  to interest payments of approximately  related to federal and state tax liabilities  and  in part  to lower interest rates during fiscal year the decrease in net interest income during fiscal year compared to fiscal year is primarily due to lower average cash balances in fiscal year when compared to the previous periods 
income taxes the provision for income taxes is a benefit rate of for fiscal  a benefit rate of for fiscal  and a tax expense at for fiscal the benefit of approximately  is comprised of a federal benefit of  offset by a miscellaneous state income tax expense of  the effective tax rate differs from the federal statutory rate primarily due to federal and state tax credits  the usage of valuation allowance  and a benefit as result of a tax law change during fiscal year  which allowed us to recover additional taxes paid in prior years 
in fiscal year  we recorded an income tax benefit of approximately  as the result of operating losses that were carried back to recover taxes paid in prior years 
in fiscal  we recorded an income tax expense of approximately  which is lower than the federal statutory rate primarily due to federal and state tax credits 
analysis of liquidity and capital resources we have a  secured  revolving bank line of credit for short term cash requirements bearing interest at the bank s reference rate as of october   which expires march  there were no amounts outstanding on this line of credit at october  and the line of credit agreement requires compliance with certain financial covenants 
as of october  and  we were in compliance with all required covenants and restrictions under the line of credit agreement 
cash from operating activities 
net cash from operating activities has fluctuated significantly from year to year 
in fiscal year  cash provided by operating activities was approximately  for fiscal year  cash used in operating activities was approximately  compared to cash provided from operating activities of approximately  during fiscal year the year to year variances are primarily the result of changes in net income loss  accounts receivable  refundable income taxes  inventories held by us  and accounts payable and accrued liabilities 
net income for fiscal year was approximately  which contrasts to a net loss in fiscal year of approximately  the fiscal year net income was primarily due to our lower operating cost structure  which was the result of the fiscal year restructuring activities 
in addition  there were no subsidiary losses in fiscal year the fiscal year net loss when compared to the fiscal year net income of approximately  was due to a reduction in revenues  absorption of indirect contract costs incurred to lower our billing rates  an investment of approximately  in research and development  which was not reimbursed through the billing rates  the occurrence of subsidiary losses of approximately  and restructuring costs of approximately during fiscal year  accounts receivable used cash of approximately  whereas accounts receivable activities during fiscal years and provided cash of approximately  and  respectively 
the increase in accounts receivable in fiscal year was driven primarily by two factors 
first  our forward loss balance reduced  which is an element of unbilled receivables 
second  increased efficiency in our collection process led to an overall decrease of our billed receivables 
the net effect created an increase in total accounts receivable 
the decrease in accounts receivable in fiscal year is due  primarily  to a decline in sales of our products and services and  in part  to a  charge for doubtful accounts 
although we have experienced an increase in the efficiency of collecting our billed receivables  we are currently pursuing a problematic receivable item 
we expect to collect this item in fiscal year and have not recorded any reserve for doubtful accounts at this time 
however  in the event we do not collect this receivable  our fiscal year revenue and operating income could be reduced by approximately  cash provided by refundable income taxes for fiscal year was approximately  we received a federal tax refund in fiscal year  which was recorded in fiscal year there were no refundable income taxes recorded or received in fiscal year cash provided by inventories  prepaid expenses  and other current assets was approximately  and  in fiscal years and  respectively  as compared with cash used of approximately  for fiscal year in fiscal year  inventories decreased approximately  which was partially offset by an increase in prepaid expenses and other current assets of approximately  the increase in prepaid expenses and other current assets in fiscal year included an increase to deferred tax assets of approximately  and prepaid income taxes of  the increase in cash provided by inventories  prepaid expenses  and other current assets in fiscal year as compared with fiscal year was primarily due to a  decrease in pre contract costs and a  decrease in prepaid expenses  which were partially offset by a  increase in inventory 
cash provided by accounts payable and accrued liabilities in fiscal year was approximately  cash used by accounts payable and accrued liabilities in fiscal years and was approximately  and  respectively 
the improvement in cash flows in fiscal year as compared to fiscal year is primarily attributed to the changes in our cost structure during the second half of fiscal year related to the reduction in staff 
in fiscal year  accrued payroll related liabilities increased approximately  mostly due to an increased participation in the stock purchase plan by our employees 
trade accounts payable in fiscal year increased by approximately  as a result of improved contract activities 
other immaterial liabilities increased by approximately  there was no activity in income taxes payable in fiscal year in fiscal year  accrued payroll liabilities decreased by approximately  primarily due to payment of various liabilities associated with staff reductions 
trade accounts payable balances decreased in fiscal year by approximately  due to a significant decline in contract activity 
income taxes payable decreased by approximately  due to the net losses incurred in fiscal year other liabilities decreased by approximately  in fiscal year  payroll liabilities decreased by approximately  due to a reduced headcount from attrition 
trade accounts payable balances decreased in fiscal year by approximately  as a result of payments of liabilities associated with materials purchases 
incomes taxes payable decreased by approximately  due to a significant reduction in net income 
other liabilities increased by approximately  cash from investing activities 
net cash used in investing activities during fiscal year was approximately  in fiscal year  investing activities provided cash of approximately  in fiscal year  net cash used in investing activities was approximately  fiscal year investing activities included purchases of available for sale securities of approximately  and property and equipment of approximately  in contrast  in fiscal year  maturities of available for sale securities provided cash of approximately  partially offset by additions to property and equipment of approximately  during fiscal year  we used cash of approximately  to purchase available for sale securities  which was partially offset by approximately  in cash provided by the maturity of these securities 
cash used to purchase property and equipment in fiscal year was approximately  cash from financing activities 
net cash provided by financing activities was approximately   and  during fiscal years   and  respectively 
the sources of cash from financing activities during each of these three years were the issuance of common stock under our employee stock purchase plan and stock option plans 
in fiscal years and  we paid dividends to common shareholders 
in an effort to reduce future cash expenditures  the board of directors voted on may  to suspend the dividend payment until further notice 
cash is generated primarily from operating activities  employee stock activities  and investing activities 
historically  our investing activities were limited to money market accounts and united states treasuries 
in order to maximize yield while maintaining safety of the principal balance  during the fourth quarter of fiscal year  we expanded our investment portfolio to include a variety of low risk investments 
we believe the primary risk to liquidity is the potential decrease in demand for our products and services 
historically  this demand has been influenced by the needs of the united states intelligence community 
we believe that the funds generated from operations  existing working capital  and the amount available under our existing line of credit will be sufficient to meet our cash needs for the next twelve months 
contingencies product warranties 
typically  our products are sold with a one year warranty 
warranty costs were approximately   and  for fiscal years   and  respectively 
indemnification of directors and officers 
we indemnify our directors and officers through our directors and officers insurance policy 
directors and officers insurance was approximately   and  for fiscal years   and  respectively 
commitments we lease facilities under non cancelable lease agreements  which expire at various dates between fiscal years and certain leases contain escalation clauses and requirements for the payment of property taxes  insurance  and maintenance expenses 
the aggregate minimum annual lease commitments as of october  under long term operating leases are as follows in thousands fiscal year thereafter we had outstanding letters of credit at october    and totaling approximately   and  respectively 
we had long term equipment leases totaling approximately  and  at the end of fiscal years and  respectively  which expire at various dates during fiscal year in fiscal year  a purchase agreement for computer equipment created a liability of approximately  approximately  will be paid in march and is included in other accrued liabilities within the current liabilities section on the accompanying balance sheet 
approximately  will be paid in march and is included in other liabilities on the accompanying balance sheet 
recent accounting pronouncements in august  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  which addresses financial accounting and reporting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets and supersedes sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of  and the accounting and reporting provisions of apb opinion no 
 reporting the results of operations  for a disposal of a segment of a business 
sfas is effective for fiscal years beginning after december   with earlier application encouraged 
we do not anticipate that the adoption of sfas will have a material effect on our financial position or results of operations 
in july  the fasb approved sfas no 
 accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities 
sfas addresses the financial accounting and reporting for obligations associated with an exit activity  including restructuring  or with a disposal of long lived assets 
exit activities include  but are not limited to  eliminating or reducing product lines  terminating employees and contracts  and relocating plant facilities or personnel 
sfas specifies that a company will record a liability for a cost associated with an exit or disposal activity only when that liability is incurred and can be measured at fair value 
therefore  commitment to an exit plan or a plan of disposal expresses only management s intended future actions and does not meet the requirement for recognizing a liability and the related expense 
sfas is effective prospectively for exit or disposal activities initiated after december   with earlier adoption encouraged 
we do not anticipate that the adoption of sfas will have a material effect on our financial position or results of operations 
on december   the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure 
sfas amends sfas  accounting for stock based compensation  to provide alternative methods of transition to sfas s fair value method of accounting for stock based employee compensation 
sfas also amends the disclosure provisions of sfas and apb opinion no

item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk 
our interest income is sensitive to changes in the general level of us interest rates  particularly since the majority of our investments are in short term instruments 
the average days to maturity of our investment portfolio is days 
due to the short term nature of these cash investments  we do not believe that there is a material interest rate risk 
as of october   our total cash and investments balance that was sensitive to interest rate risk was approximately  the sensitivity of our portfolio is if yields were to fluctuate by basis points  the total effect to the investment portfolio balance would be approximately  the following table summarizes our cash  cash and equivalents  and short term securities  at fair value  that is sensitive to interest rate risk in thousands cash and cash equivalents short term  available for sale securities corporate securities government securities mortgage backed securities asset backed securities
