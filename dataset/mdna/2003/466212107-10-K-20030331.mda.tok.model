item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview jmar technologies  inc is a developer of collimated laser plasma lithography cpl sources and stepper systems for the making of advanced semiconductor chips 
these systems are based on the company s proprietary and patented solid state laser systems and its expertise in laser plasma generated x rays 
the development of the company s cpl source and stepper systems has been principally funded by the us defense advanced research projects agency darpa 
the strategy of the company s cpl business is to initially sell advanced lithography systems to manufacturers of gallium arsenide based semiconductors which are used in high performance electronics required for military systems and the growing commercial market for high speed communications applications 
with planned investments from strategic partners and other sources  the company s goal is to introduce higher throughput lithography systems to the multi billion dollar silicon based semiconductor manufacturing industry in a timeframe sooner than competing next generation lithography technologies  such as extreme ultraviolet technologies 
the company also provides semiconductor process integration services under contracts that support the department of defense s mission to ensure a supply of semiconductor products for military systems 
through december   the company operated in three segments as follows front end semiconductor equipment and services  precision equipment  and semiconductor products and processes 
in the first quarter of  the company decided to discontinue its standard semiconductor products business and shift more of its resources to accelerate the market entry of its cpl products 
the standard semiconductor products portion of jmar s business had been a developmental effort  involving the design  manufacture and introduction of new standard product semiconductor chips 
with the severe downturn in the worldwide semiconductor market beginning in and continuing into  the company had little success in selling its new standard product chips 
the company determined that substantial additional capital would have been required for these new chips to become established in what became an over supplied chip market  as well as to develop newer  higher value chips 
the company concluded that it would not continue to invest its resources in this business 
in furtherance of its efforts to focus its resources on its cpl business  the company concluded during the latter half of that the precision equipment segment business did not fit with the strategic direction of the company s cpl business area and that the markets for that segment s products would continue to be slow in the near term 
therefore  in december   the company decided to initiate the process of selling that business 
the standard semiconductor products business and the precision equipment segment business have been accounted for in the accompanying consolidated financial statements as discontinued operations and the statement of operations for the years ending december  and have been restated to reflect the discontinuation of these businesses 
as a result of these decisions  and to streamline the company s operations and better support the commercialization of its emerging cpl semiconductor manufacturing systems and related technologies  the company now operates in three business segments  the research division  the systems division and the microelectronics division 
results of consolidated operations total revenues for the years ended december   and were   and  respectively  of which contract revenues accounted for   and  respectively 
the net loss for the years ended december   
table of contents and was   and  respectively 
the income loss from continuing operations for those same periods was   and  respectively  while the loss from operations for those same periods was   and  respectively 
included in the net loss and loss from continuing operations before income taxes for the years ended december   and is a gain on the sale of marketable securities of   and  respectively 
included in the net loss and loss from continuing operations for the year ended december  is  for severance charges recorded related to the retirement in august  of the company s chairman and chief executive officer 
also included in the net loss and loss from continuing operations for the year ended december  is an income tax expense of  resulting from an increase in the valuation allowance against the company s deferred tax assets 
included in the net loss and loss from operations for the year ended december  are asset writedowns of  also  included in the net loss for the years ended december   and is a loss from operations of discontinued operations of   and  respectively  and a loss on disposal of discontinued operations of  for the increase in revenues for the year ended december  compared to the prior year was primarily attributable to other contract revenues from the systems division of  along with an increase in cpl revenue of  the systems division was acquired in august  in  the systems division received an approximately million contract from naval air warfare center ad the navair contract which accounted for approximately  in revenues in the increase in total revenues for the year ended december  compared to the prior year was attributable to a significant increase in x ray lithography contract revenues of  as well as other contract revenues from the systems division of  acquired in august offset in part by a decrease in semiconductor process technology services sales of approximately  gross margins for the fiscal years ended december   and were  and  respectively 
the company s margins are low because the majority of its revenues are from contracts  which inherently generate lower margins than product revenues 
the decrease in the gross margin in was primarily due to the contract with navair for sub nm x ray masks for ngl systems navair contract having lower margins due to its high subcontract component  and the company s absorption of some of the costs incurred due to limited funding on that contract 
in addition  the company recorded a  reserve in for another contract at the systems division related to estimated cost overruns on that contract 
the majority of the company s revenues in will also be derived from contracts  so gross margins will continue at similar levels 
selling  general and administrative sg a expenses for the fiscal years ended december   and were   and  respectively 
the increase in sg a expenses in is primarily due to an increase of approximately  related to the systems division  which the company acquired in august offset by lower legal costs of approximately  in  a reduction of approximately  at the research division primarily related to higher allocation of resources to research and development activities in  and an overall reduction in sg a costs at the microelectronics division of approximately  the increase in sg a expenses in compared to is primarily due to  related to the systems division and higher legal costs 
the company s research  development and engineering program rd e consists of two types customer funded rd e us government and other companies and company funded rd e 
both types of rd e are expensed when incurred 
customer funded rd e costs incurred  included in contract costs of sales  totaled   and  for the fiscal years ended december   and  respectively 
the increase in customer funded rd e expenditures for is related to an increase of approximately  in the collimated plasma lithography program contract funding provided by the defense advanced research projects agency  which is directed toward development of jmar s cpl technology for the commercial semiconductor market  and an increase in 
table of contents contract costs of  incurred by the systems division approximately  of which is related to the navair contract which was acquired in august the increase in customer funded rd e expenditures for compared to is related to an increase of approximately  in the x ray lithography program contract funding provided by the defense advanced research projects agency  most of which is directed toward development of jmar s x ray lithography source technology for the commercial semiconductor market  and contract costs of  incurred by jsal 
these increases were offset  in part  by a decrease of  related to the company s contract for the development of a unique microcircuit architecture and devices for the replacement of obsolete integrated circuits for the defense microelectronics activity 
company funded rd e costs are shown in operating expenses and totaled   and  for the fiscal years ended december   and  respectively 
hence  total rd e expenditures for those three years were   and  respectively 
total rd e expenditures as a percentage of sales were  and for the years ended december   and  respectively 
these expenditures are primarily related to the continued development of cpl systems for the semiconductor industry and the development of a high efficiency euv generation system for advanced semiconductor lithography 
the standard semiconductor products business and the precision equipment segment business have been accounted for in the accompanying consolidated financial statements as discontinued operations and the statement of operations for the years ending december  and have been restated to reflect the discontinuation of these businesses 
the loss from operations of discontinued operations of  for the year ended december  includes  related to the standard semiconductor products business and  related to the precision equipment segment business 
the loss on disposal of discontinued operations of  for the year ended december  is net of the expected proceeds from the sale of the precision equipment segment business 
the company is in discussions with a number of potential buyers  however  it has not yet received an offer from any of the potential purchasers of this business 
if the sales price of this business is different from the estimate that the company has made  the difference will be reflected in the company s statement of operations 
also  if the company is unable to find a buyer on satisfactory terms  the company will have to take alternative actions regarding this business  which may result in further charges 
the results of operations of the precision equipment segment business for through the sale date will be reported in discontinued operations in in september  jsi moved into a significantly larger facility in anticipation of realizing its growth plans 
prior to december   the company decided to attempt to sublease the facility and move jsi into a smaller facility 
accordingly  in the fourth quarter of  the company accrued  its estimated loss under the september lease 
in  the company accrued an additional  in estimated losses under this lease 
these amounts are included in the loss from operations of discontinued operations 
the lease provides for rent and related expenses of approximately  per month through august the company does not yet have a subtenant for that facility and  if it is unsuccessful in obtaining a subtenant on acceptable terms  there could be further losses related to that lease 
the gain on sale of marketable securities of   and  for  and  respectively  is related to the sale of  shares   shares and  shares  respectively  of the company s investment in bede plc in january  april and december  respectively 
interest and other income is lower for versus due to lower average cash balances and lower interest rates 
interest and other expense for the fiscal years ended december   and was   and  respectively 
interest and other expense is higher for versus due to interest on the million notes issued to the former shareholders of sal and higher average borrowings in of the company s working capital line with comerica bank 
interest expense will be significantly higher in due to financing transactions the company entered into in march see consolidated liquidity and financial condition below 
following the discontinuance of jsi s standard chip business in the first quarter of  jsi sought to negotiate debt reductions from the creditors associated with the discontinued portion of its 
table of contents business 
jsi was a party to a distributor agreement with all american semiconductor  inc all american under which all american had purchased approximately  of jsi chips for resale to its customers 
in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles  that transaction was reflected as deferred revenue a liability and not as revenue pending sale to the ultimate customer 
under the terms of the distributor agreement  if all american properly terminated the distributor agreement  it had the right to require jsi to repurchase those chips for the  paid by all american 
soon after the announcement by jmar that jsi had discontinued its standard chip business  all american gave notice of termination of the distributor agreement and returned the chips it held  creating an obligation on jsi s part to repay approximately  to all american 
the  claim of all american is included in the total of approximately million of net current discontinued liabilities that are included on jmar s consolidated balance sheet 
in september   a complaint was filed by all american against jsi and jmar in san diego superior court 
the complaint alleges that jsi owes all american approximately  the complaint also alleges that all american was induced to refrain from terminating the agreement until after the jsi business had been discontinued 
all american claims that such actions constituted fraud and that it is entitled to treble triple damages 
all american has also alleged that jmar is the alter ego of jsi and based on that theory should be held responsible for the obligations of jsi 
while recognizing that the approximately  in indebtedness may be owed by jsi to all american under the agreement  jsi asserts that the obligations are merely of a contractual nature and strongly disputes that any of the actions taken constitute fraud 
jmar also disputes that it is the alter ego of jsi in light of the facts that jsi is a separately incorporated entity that has been more than adequately capitalized over its years of operations and that jsi  and not jmar  was a party to the distributor agreement and was the sole contact with all american 
jmar believes there is insufficient evidence to support the alter ego theory and believes that it will ultimately prevail on this issue 
jmar and jsi intend to vigorously contest any claims by all american that it is owed more than  after unsuccessfully engaging in efforts to sell the standard chip portion of jsi  in the fourth quarter of  jsi transferred all of its assets to a third party fiduciary in an assignment for the benefit of creditors 
under this state law procedure  the assignee liquidates the assets and the proceeds from the sale of those assets are equitably distributed among the creditors of jsi and the claims of creditors of jsi are limited to those proceeds 
following the assignment of those assets  the fiduciary sold those assets to jsi microelectronics  inc  a wholly owned subsidiary of the company  at a price equal to a premium over an independently appraised value of those assets  with the purchase price consisting of cash  assumption of certain trade debt owed to suppliers who are critical to the ongoing operations and the credit bid of debt held by the company 
pursuant to an employment agreement dated september  with dr 
martinez  the company s former chairman and chief executive officer  if the company delivered notice of its intention not to renew or discontinued his status of chairman or ceo  or both  other than for cause  then dr 
martinez s employment was to continue for three years at the highest total compensation rate including bonuses  director fees and similar payments he had received in any previous month period 
this amount is approximately  per annum 
in such event  the company also agreed to maintain comparable medical insurance benefits for such three year period 
in may   dr 
martinez informed the board of directors of his desire to retire 
the board and dr 
martinez engaged in discussions regarding dr 
martinez s future role with the company 
in order to set a definite date for the transition to a new ceo  in july   the board of directors exercised the company s rights under the employment agreement to discontinue dr 
martinez s status as ceo effective august  following negotiations between dr 
martinez and the board  an agreement was reached to restructure this payment obligation to spread the payments over six years to reduce the impact of the original agreement on the company s cash flow 
in consideration for this modification  the company will provide comparable medical insurance benefits for six years  and modified  of the options and warrants held by dr 
martinez to vest all unvested options and warrants  options  provide that  in those options that have an expiration date within the next six years  the early termination provision that would otherwise have resulted in the termination of the options and warrants days after termination 
table of contents of his employment was waived  and provide that all remaining options and warrants will expire on the later of august  or days after dr 
martinez ceases to be a director 
the company recorded a charge in in the amount of  resulting from this event 
the charge includes  for the discounted post employment payments over six years and  for the intrinsic value of dr 
martinez s options and warrants resulting from the modification of those options and warrants 
results of segment operations the results of segment operations excluding corporate for the years ending december  and are as follows revenues operating income loss research division systems division microelectronics division the  decrease in revenues for the research division for the year ended december  as compared to the year ended december  is due to more work under the darpa contract being performed by the systems division in during  the company received million in cpl contract funding 
as of december   the company had approximately million of this funding in backlog and expects another approximately million in cpl contract funding in the  increase in revenues for the systems division for the year ended december  as compared to the year ended december  is due to the receipt of million in funding for the navair contract  more work under the darpa contract being performed by the systems division in  the receipt of a million contract with a major aerospace firm in november for semiconductor x ray lithography system support  and the receipt of a million order from the university of wisconsin on october  to upgrade an x ray lithography stepper to produce sub nanometer microcircuits 
the systems division was acquired in august  as of december   the company had approximately million in backlog and expects another approximately million in funding under the navair contract in the  increase in revenues for the microelectronics division for the year ended december  as compared to the year ended december  is due to the receipt in of approximately million in contracts from general dynamics advanced information systems general dynamics for the development  construction and operation of a semiconductor wafer fabrication facility at mcclellan air force base in sacramento for the defense microelectronics activity 
as of december   the company had approximately  in backlog from these contracts and received approximately million in additional contracts from general dynamics in february the  increase in the operating loss of the systems division for the year ended december  as compared to the year ended december  is due to the navair contract having lower margins due to its high subcontract component  and the company s absorption of some of the costs incurred due to the limited funding on the contract  the recording of a  reserve in for the contract with the university of wisconsin related to estimated cost overruns on that contract  and costs associated with the company s cpl commercialization efforts 
the  increase in the operating income of the microelectronics division is due to higher revenues and higher gross margins 

table of contents consolidated liquidity and financial condition unrestricted cash and cash equivalents at december  was  the decrease in unrestricted cash and cash equivalents from to of  resulted primarily from cash used in continuing operations of  primarily related to operating losses exclusive of the gain on the sale of the bede stock  cash used in discontinued operations of  and payments under the company s working capital bank lines of  offset in part by net proceeds from the issuance of common stock of  proceeds for the sale of marketable securities of  and a decrease in restricted cash of  at december   the company had a working capital deficit of  jmar s operations will continue to require the use of working capital in for  among other requirements  certain cpl commercialization costs not covered by existing contracts  cash requirements of jpsi until its sale  temporary funding delays related to government contracts  and corporate costs  primarily related to the cost of being a public company 
working capital deficit as of december  and december  was  and  respectively 
the decrease in working capital is primarily due to the company s losses  decrease in receivables  increase in net current liabilities of assets held for sale  and accrued severance costs 
the working capital of the company had generally been funded through its working capital line the comerica debt with comerica bank the bank with interest at prime rate and through third party contracts 
due to the company s continued losses  in november  the bank reduced the amount of the comerica debt to million and required up to a million compensating balance 
pursuant to this debt  there were no financial covenants or ratios 
in march  the company entered into a million revolving fixed price convertible year note the working capital line with laurus master fund laurus 
advances under the working capital line are at an advance rate up to of eligible accounts receivable of the company 
the company can convert any portion of the principal outstanding to common stock at 
per share the conversion price if the market price of the company s common stock averages of the conversion price or higher for consecutive trading days 
laurus can convert any portion of the principal outstanding to common stock at the conversion price any time the company s common stock is in excess of the conversion price 
after the first million of conversions into equity  the conversion price will be adjusted upward 
the interest rate on the working capital line is prime plus 
percent  subject to a floor of percent 
accrued interest is payable monthly 
this working capital line replaced the comerica debt 
in addition  in march  the company issued million in percent series a convertible preferred the series a preferred to laurus at a fixed conversion price of 
per share 
accrued interest is payable monthly 
the series a preferred must be redeemed in two years  if not previously converted 
the conversion terms of the series a preferred are the same as those pursuant to the working capital line 
the proceeds received under the series a preferred are initially restricted  however  the funds are released as the preferred stock is converted to common stock 
the company also issued million in shares of percent series b convertible preferred stock the series b preferred to laurus at a fixed conversion price of 
per share 
accrued interest is payable monthly 
principal is payable in cash or stock in twelve equal monthly installments starting october  the conversion terms of the series b preferred stock are the same as those pursuant to the working capital line 
any conversions to equity will offset the requirements to make principal repayments 
in connection with all of the above financing transactions with laurus  the company issued to laurus warrants to purchase  shares of common stock at prices ranging from to 
in addition  laurus was granted the right to receive a warrant to purchase one share of common stock for every of principal of the working capital line converted to equity  up to a total of  shares  at an exercise price of 
in february   under the universal blank shelf registration statement  the company sold  shares of its common stock and a warrant for  shares  exercisable at per share  for gross proceeds of  the series a and b convertible preferred stock and  of the warrants described above were also sold under the universal blank shelf registration statement 

table of contents management believes that  including the above financing  the company has adequate resources to fund operations and working capital requirements at least through december  however  the company has determined that it will require additional financing to complete or accelerate the development of some of its high value emerging new products  including its patented cpl systems for the manufacture of high performance semiconductors 
however  there can be no assurance that additional financings will be available when needed  on favorable terms  or at all 
the company s stockholders equity was  as of december  the continued listing requirement of the nasdaq national market system requires the maintenance of no less than million of stockholders equity 
the company intends to transfer to the nasdaq small cap market in the second quarter of  where the continued listing requirement is the maintenance of no less than million of stockholders equity 
continued losses without increases in equity would cause the company to fall below this nasdaq requirement which would require it to come into compliance or face delisting 
the delisting of the company s stock could adversely affect its ability to raise funds in the future 
the company believes that it has available to it several potential sources of capital to meet nasdaq listing standards  particularly the above described financings 
the company is also pursuing opportunities for strategic relationships with semiconductor industry partners  one of the goals of which would involve receipt of additional funding  in order to accelerate the commercialization of its emerging cpl products 
in october   the company s universal blank shelf registration statement with respect to million of company securities was declared effective by the securities and exchange commission 
the securities that may be sold under this registration statement included common stock  preferred stock  debt  warrants or rights 
this form s registration statement will no longer be available for the sale of securities after march  because the company s market capitalization does not exceed million 
the company is considering whether to amend this form s to a form s registration statement to allow for the future sale of securities from time to time on a registered basis 
on august   the company s wholly owned subsidiary  jmar sal nanolithography  inc subsidiary acquired the acquisition all of the outstanding equity of semiconductor advanced lithography  inc sal  in a merger of sal with and into subsidiary merger 
consideration for the merger consisted of an aggregate of  shares of the company s common stock  million in cash and million in notes the notes 
the notes are convertible into shares of the company s common stock at a price of 
the notes are convertible by the holders at any time and the company can force conversion if the average price  as defined  of the company s common stock during any ten day trading period exceeds 
interest on the notes is payable quarterly  with the entire principal amount due  if not converted  on february  the resale by the holders of the conversion shares is registered  however  the holders have agreed to restrictions on their sale of those jmar shares to no more than of their jmar holdings in any quarter and to refrain from selling any shares for days upon notice from jmar of its intention to negotiate an underwritten public offering 
under the merger agreement  sal s former shareholders and creditors could earn up to three contingent earnout payments upon the satisfaction of three earnout conditions 
for the first earnout  the sal creditors were eligible to receive  in convertible notes upon the satisfaction of a stepper limited throughput test without the cpl light source by june  this requirement was not met by the june  deadline  and  therefore  the company did not have to issue the  in convertible notes 
for the second earnout  the sal shareholders can earn  in convertible notes upon the satisfaction of a lithography demonstration milestone 
this milestone must be met days after the cpl light source is integrated with the stepper at the systems division in vermont and satisfies certain source performance criteria 
the third earnout condition can result in payment of up to  jmar shares and up to million in convertible notes upon receipt by the company of a qualifying order for a cpl system from a commercial customer and delivery to the customer 
under the merger agreement  the deadline for receipt of this order is days after the cpl source is integrated with the stepper at the systems division in vermont and satisfies certain source performance criteria 

table of contents in february the company received approximately million in additional contracts from general dynamics 
in addition  jmar expects to receive another approximately million in cpl contract funding from darpa by june  and another million in funds from navair by june  commitments future minimum annual commitments under bank and other debt agreements  non cancellable operating leases and post employment benefits as of december  are as follows unaudited thereafter total bank and other debt operating leases post employment benefits pursuant to the acquisition of sal  its former shareholders and creditors can earn up to two earnout payments upon the satisfaction of certain earnout conditions see page 
at december   the company had approximately million of federal net operating loss carryforwards subject to certain annual limitations  which expire from through to the extent the company has taxable income in the future  these carryforwards may be used by the company to reduce its cash outlay for taxes 
critical accounting policies and estimates management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations discusses jmar s consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
on an ongoing basis  management evaluates its estimates and judgments  including those related to revenues  allowances for doubtful accounts  inventory reserves  goodwill and intangible assets  deferred taxes  litigation accrual  warranty reserve and stock based compensation 
management bases its estimates and judgments on historical experience and on various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
management believes the following critical accounting policies  among others  affect its more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements 
revenues product revenues are recognized when the product is shipped fob shipping point  all risks of ownership have passed to the customer and the company has performed all obligations in accordance 
table of contents with staff accounting bulletin no  revenue recognition in financial statements sab no 

contract revenues are recognized based on the percentage of completion method wherein income is recognized pro rata over the life of the contract based on the ratio of total incurred costs to anticipated total costs of the contract 
the program manager prepares a statement of work  schedule and budget for each contract 
at least monthly  actual costs are compared to budget and technical progress is compared to the planned schedule 
the company prepares an estimate of costs to complete for each contract at least quarterly 
estimated losses based on this review are fully charged to operations when identified 
actual costs could differ from these estimated costs 
allowances for doubtful accounts jmar maintains allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of its customers to make required payments 
if the financial condition of jmar s customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
management reviews delinquent accounts at least quarterly to identify potential doubtful accounts  and together with customer follow up estimates the amount of potential losses 
historically  the company s losses from bad debts has been minimal 
inventory reserves at each year end  the company prepares a report which indicates the date that each inventory part was last used 
any inventory parts that have not been used in the past two years are isolated and reviewed for possible excess and or obsolescence based on current and future requirements 
the inventory reserve is adjusted based upon that review 
in addition  any known excess and or obsolete inventory not meeting the above requirement is evaluated for inclusion in the reserve 
obsolete inventory is disposed of after a thorough investigation 
quarterly  any known excess and or obsolete inventory based on changes in the business or other factors are evaluated and the reserve adjusted accordingly 
goodwill and intangible assets in accordance with sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  effective january   the company has established reporting units and applies a two step fair value approach to evaluating goodwill impairment  using at least an annual assessment 
the company compares the fair value of the business unit with the carrying amount of the assets associated with the business unit 
the fair value of each business unit is determined using a risk adjusted discount rate to compute a net present value of estimated future cash flows and a consideration of market capitalization of the company 
the second step measures the amount of the impairment  if any 
deferred taxes jmar records a valuation allowance to reduce its deferred tax assets to the amount that management believes is more likely than not to be realized in the foreseeable future  based on estimates of foreseeable future taxable income and taking into consideration historical operating information 
in the event management estimates that it will not be able to realize all or part of its net deferred tax assets in the foreseeable future  a valuation allowance is recorded through a charge to income in the period such determination is made 
likewise  should management estimate that it will be able to realize its deferred tax assets in the future in excess of its net recorded asset  an adjustment to reduce the valuation allowance would increase income in the period such determination is made 
litigation accrual estimated amounts for litigation reserves that are probable and can be reasonably estimated are recorded as liabilities 
estimates are based upon the facts and circumstances of each case and  in part  on advice from legal counsel regarding probable outcomes  if determinable 
management reviews its estimates on a quarterly basis 

table of contents warranty reserve the company records a warranty reserve based on of product sales 
warranty costs are offset against the reserve 
each quarter the reserve is analyzed based on actual warranty costs incurred to ensure that the reserve is adequate for estimated future warranty activity 
stock based compensation plans the company accounts for its stock option and warrant plans under apb opinion no 
 using the intrinsic value method  under which no compensation cost has been recognized for issuances to employees 
options issued to non employees other than directors are accounted for based on the fair value of the equity instrument issued 
the fair value is determined based on the black scholes method 
the resulting value is amortized over the service period 
factors that may affect future results certain statements contained in this form k which are not related to historical results  including statements regarding jmar s future sales or profit growth  competitive position or products  projects or processes currently under development  the ability of the company to successfully introduce those products into the commercial marketplace or to apply those products  projects or processes to alternative applications and the availability of future bank or equity investor financing are forward looking statements that necessarily are based on certain assumptions and are subject to certain risks and uncertainties that could cause actual future performance and results to differ materially from those stated or implied in the forward looking statements 
these risks and uncertainties include the lack of funds to continue development and commercialization of our cpl products in accordance with our proposed schedule of product introductions  due to delays in funding of government contracts and delays in securing  or inability to secure other financing  whether from the public or private debt or equity markets or from commercial lenders or otherwise 
other risks include concentration of sales to certain markets and customers  such as the semiconductor industry  delays in shipments or cancellations of orders  failure of expected orders to materialize  fluctuations in margins  timing of future orders  lack of availability of critical components  customer reorganizations  failure of advanced technology and new intellectual property to perform as predicted  the failure of pending patents to be issued  delays in development  introduction and acceptance of new products  changing business and economic conditions in various geographic regions  technical obsolescence of existing products  technical problems in the development or modification of current products or manufacturing processes  the impact of competitive products and pricing  including the risk that current lithography technologies can continue to economically produce smaller feature sizes or that the euv llc is successful in developing an acceptable next generation lithography process that becomes the process of choice for the semiconductor industry or that the semiconductor industry fails to adopt cpl as the lithography alternative  the degree of success of technology transfer eg  advanced lithography sources  etc 
to commercial products  availability of working capital to support growth  continued government funding of advanced lithography  successful integration of acquisitions  declining credit markets  the adverse effect of selling jpsi on its operating results  less than expected sales proceeds realized for the sale of jpsi  other competitive factors and temporary cessation of operations at one or more of its division facilities due to natural events such as floods  earthquakes and fires 
jmar s future operating results are dependent on its ability to develop  manufacture and market  in a timely manner  innovative products that meet customers needs and the continued growth of the semiconductor and microelectronics industries 
inherent in this process are a number of risks that the company must successfully manage in order to achieve favorable operating results 
the process of developing new high technology products is complex and uncertain and requires innovations that anticipate customer needs and technological trends 
after the products are developed  the company must quickly manufacture them in sufficient volumes at acceptable costs to meet demand and establish the necessary sales and marketing capabilities to assure adequate and timely sales volume 

table of contents achieving market acceptance for our new and proposed collimated plasma lithography cpl products requires a significant effort to convince semiconductor manufacturers to adopt the company s cpl technology over other alternative next generation lithography technologies 
this will require substantial technical  marketing and sales efforts and the expenditure of significant funds to create customer awareness of and demand for our products 
we cannot assure you that our cpl product lines will achieve significant market acceptance or result in significantly increased levels of revenues 
the development of sophisticated laser systems and microelectronics manufacturing products is a lengthy and capital intensive process and is subject to unforeseen risks  delays  problems and costs 
we were unsuccessful in establishing the semiconductor products portion of jsi s business and have been unsuccessful in profitably operating the jpsi business 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to successfully develop our cpl products or any additional products  or that unanticipated technical or other problems will not occur which would result in delays in our development program 
our cpl source development program  intended to produce cpl sources for semiconductor lithography and for semiconductor inspection and related processes  has been a technologically challenging effort that has taken several years to achieve its current results 
we have integrated our cpl source into a jsal stepper and anticipate conducting wafer exposures using this integrated system in additional efforts are ongoing to increase the x ray power output of our cpl sources to meet commercially viable requirements for the gallium arsenide chip manufacturing industry  with a goal of receiving an order for a commercial system by the end of although we believe we will resolve these challenges  the failure to do so within the time demanded by potential customers could have a material adverse impact on the success of our efforts to manufacture and sell our cpl equipment 
the failure to sell significant amounts of our newly developed cpl equipment within our announced timeframes could have a material adverse impact on our stock price 
our research division and systems division are dependent on third party suppliers for components used in the development and manufacture of our products 
if certain key components are delayed or unavailable  we might have to reengineer our products  resulting in delays and increased costs  or we may have to pay other suppliers more to obtain those components  which could adversely affect our business 
in the case of our cpl development program  we have subcontracted portions of the development effort to third party suppliers  who may initially be sole suppliers for the prototype unit  but we anticipate having multiple sources of supply for the components used in our future production systems 
in particular  our cpl light source requires a component called a collimator  which collects the x ray output from our cpl source and directs the x rays to the wafer 
we have received collimators in the past from a single supplier and are using one of their current collimators on the cpl system currently integrated with a jsal stepper 
we have engaged that supplier to develop a higher efficiency collimator in to be used with our first commercial systems 
this higher efficiency collimator and future improvements are needed to increase the x ray power of our lithography equipment in order to achieve our goal of entering the high volume silicon lithography market by if we cannot obtain these high efficiency collimators when needed then we will need to rely on other alternatives to increase the x ray power of our systems  which would involve additional re engineering and related delays and additional costs which could adversely affect our business 
the markets for our products are highly competitive and are characterized by rapid technological change and evolving industry standards 
development by others of new or improved products  processes or technologies may make our products obsolete or less competitive 
our ability to compete is dependent on our ability to continually enhance and improve our products and to successfully develop and market new products 
many of our competitors have greater financial  managerial and technical resources than we have 
we cannot assure you that we will successfully differentiate ourselves from our competitors  that the market will consider our products to be superior to our competitors products or that we will be able to adapt to evolving markets and technologies  develop new products or achieve and maintain technological advantages 

table of contents our success is substantially dependent on the efforts of certain key personnel 
in particular  our cpl business area relies on the skill of several key laser and laser plasma scientists and engineers 
the loss of such key personnel would adversely affect our business and prospects 
in such event  we cannot assure you that we would be able to employ qualified persons on terms favorable to us 
in seeking and retaining qualified personnel  we are required to compete with companies having greater financial and other resources than we have 
since our future success is dependent upon our ability to retain or attract qualified personnel  our failure to do so could have an adverse impact on our business 
our cpl program conducted by our research and systems divisions has been funded primarily by government contracts from the defense advanced research projects agency and our microelectronics division s business has received other government funding in the past and may receive similar funding in the future 
these businesses are subject to various government regulations in connection with their government r d contract work 
in addition  these portions of our business are subject to audit by the us government of the costs incurred under us government contracts and to safety audits by various us government agencies 
our failure to comply with these government regulations could jeopardize existing and future funding 
we rely  to a significant extent  on patents  trade secrets and confidentiality agreements to protect our proprietary technology 
we cannot assure you as to the breadth or degree of protection which existing or future patents  if any  may afford us  or that patents will not be circumvented or invalidated  or that our products do not and will not infringe on patents or violate proprietary rights of others 
in the event a patent infringement claim is asserted against us  or we are required to enforce our rights under an issued patent  the cost of such actions may be very high  whether or not we are successful 
while we are unable to predict what such costs  if any  will be if we are obligated to pursue patent litigation  our ability to fund our operations and to pursue our business goals may be substantially impaired 
along with some of the risks discussed in the preceding paragraph  there is no assurance that the company will market its britelight lasers as stand alone products or that  if the company should do so  they will be accepted in the marketplace 
as is the case for a large number of california based companies  a significant portion of the company s operations are located near major earthquake faults 
the ultimate impact on the company  significant suppliers and the general infrastructure is unknown  but operating results could be materially affected in the event of a major earthquake in close proximity to the company s facilities 
the company is predominantly self insured for losses and interruptions caused by earthquakes 
the operations of the company involve the use of substances regulated under various federal  state and international laws governing the environment 
it is the company s policy to apply strict standards for environmental protection even if not subject to regulations imposed by local governments 
the liability for environmental remediation and related costs is accrued when it is considered probable and the costs can be estimated 
environmental costs are presently not material to jmar s operations or financial position 
although jmar believes that it has the necessary product offerings and resources for continuing success  future revenue and margin trends cannot be reliably predicted and may cause the company to adjust its operations 
factors external to the company can result in volatility of the company s common stock price 
because of the foregoing factors  recent trends should not be considered reliable indicators of future stock prices or financial results 
the company denominates its foreign sales in us dollars and the company does not believe that foreign currency fluctuations will have a material adverse impact on its ability to compete with its domestic based competitors 
foreign currency fluctuations  however  could make the company s products less affordable in foreign markets and thus  reduce the demand for such products 

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company s exposure to interest rate risk is minimal due to the relatively small amount of investments and variable rate debt 
the company has no investments in derivative financial instruments
