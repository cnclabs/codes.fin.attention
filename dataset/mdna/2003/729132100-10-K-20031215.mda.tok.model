item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview we provide product realization services to original equipment manufacturers  or oems  in the networking datacommunications telecom  medical  industrial commercial  computer and transportation other industries 
we provide advanced electronics design  manufacturing and testing services to our customers with a focus on complex  high end products 
we offer our customers the ability to outsource all stages of product realization  including development and design  materials procurement and management  prototyping and new product introduction  testing  manufacturing configuration  logistics and test repair 
the following information should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements included herein and the risk factors section beginning on page we provide contract manufacturing services on either a turnkey basis  which means we procure some or all of the materials required for product assembly  or on a consignment basis  which means the customer supplies some  or occasionally all  of the materials necessary for product assembly 
turnkey services include materials procurement and warehousing in addition to manufacturing and involve greater resource investment and inventory risk management than consignment services 
turnkey manufacturing currently represents substantially all of our manufacturing services 
turnkey sales typically generate higher sales and higher gross profit dollars with lower gross margin percentages than consignment sales due to the inclusion of component costs  and related markup  in our net sales 
however  turnkey manufacturing involves the risk of inventory management  and a change in component costs can directly impact average selling prices  gross margins and net sales 
our quarterly and annual results are affected by the level and timing of customer orders  fluctuations in materials costs and the degree of automation used in the assembly process 
mergers and acquisitions dispositions in january  we acquired certain assets of mcms  inc mcms  an electronics manufacturing services provider  for approximately million in cash 
the assets purchased from mcms include manufacturing operations in penang  malaysia  xiamen  china  and nampa  idaho 
the acquisition did not include any interest bearing debt  but included the assumption of total liabilities of approximately million 
the results from mcms s operations are reflected in our financial statements from the date of acquisition 
no goodwill resulted from this acquisition 
we incurred approximately million of acquisition costs in the second quarter of fiscal associated with the acquisition of mcms 
on may   we acquired qtron  inc qtron  a privately held ems provider with a facility located in san diego  california san diego 
we purchased all of the outstanding shares of qtron for approximately million in cash  paid outstanding qtron notes payable of million to qtron shareholders and assumed liabilities of million  including capital lease obligations of million for a manufacturing facility 
the results of qtron s operations have been reflected in our financial statements from the date of acquisition 
the excess of the cost over the fair value of the net assets acquired of approximately million was recorded as goodwill 
through september   we were amortizing goodwill over years 
effective the first quarter of fiscal  in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 goodwill was no longer amortized 
goodwill was also partially impaired as a result of a transitional impairment evaluation upon adoption of sfas no 
in december  the primary customer of san diego provided notice of its intent to transition most of its programs to non plexus facilities 
as a consequence  we closed san diego during fiscal and wrote off the remaining goodwill 
in fiscal  we also closed our facility in richmond  kentucky richmond  and ceased production in our oldest plant in neenah  wisconsin 
these actions and related charges are further discussed below 
in addition  we sold our pcb design operations in nashua  new hampshire to a group of former employees  however  this transaction did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
results of operations net sales 
net sales for the year ended september  decreased percent to million from million for the year ended september  our reduced sales levels reflected the slowdown in technology markets  primarily in the network datacommunications telecom  industrial commercial and computer industries  which have been further impacted by reduced capital spending by companies in these industries 
net sales in fiscal compared to net sales in fiscal were also adversely affected by the loss of the programs of the primary customer in our san diego facility 
the slowdown in the technology markets in fiscal was offset  in part  by increased sales to the medical industry 
we currently expect first quarter of fiscal sales to be in the range of million to million as a result of strengthened demand from a number of existing customers  as well as the start of production for several new customers 
however  our results will ultimately depend on actual customer order levels 
net sales for the year ended september   decreased percent to million from billion for the year ended september  net sales for fiscal included approximately million  or percent of sales  related to the acquired mcms operations 
our sales decline reflected the continued slowdown in technology markets in most end markets but primarily due to the networking datacommunications telecom and industrial commercial end markets 
we were also affected by a relatively sharp downturn of orders and forecasts  particularly in engineering  subsequent to the september  attacks  as a consequence of the economic uncertainties resulting from the attacks and their aftermath 
these factors resulted in customers becoming more cautious in placing new orders 
siemens medical systems  inc siemens represented percent of our net sales in fiscal we had no other customers that represented percent or more of our net sales in fiscal we had no customers that represented percent or more of net sales for the years ended september  and sales to our ten largest customers accounted for percent of sales for the year ended september   compared to percent and percent for the years ended september  and  respectively 
as with sales to most of our customers  sales to our largest customers may vary from time to time depending on the size and timing of program commencement  termination  delays  modifications and transitions 
we remain dependent on continued sales to our significant customers  and we generally do not obtain firm  long term purchase commitments from our customers 
customer forecasts can and do change as a result of their end market demand and other factors 
although any change in orders from these or other customers could materially affect our results of operations  we are dedicated to diversifying our customer base and decreasing our dependence on any particular customer or customers 
our sales for the years ended september   and  respectively  by industry were as follows industry networking datacommunications telecom medical industrial commercial computer transportation other gross profit 
gross profit for the year ended september   decreased percent to million from million for the year ended september  the gross margin percentage for the year ended september   was percent  compared to percent for the year ended september  the decline in gross margin was due primarily to reduced utilization of manufacturing capacity  lower product pricing and higher costs incurred to transfer customer programs to other plexus operating sites as a result of closing san diego and richmond 
overall gross margins were affected by lower sales levels as a result of a slowdown in end market demand  particularly in the networking datacommunications telecom and industrial commercial industries  and the concomitant impact on capacity utilization 
gross margins reflect a number of factors that can vary from period to period  including product mix  the level of start up costs and efficiencies associated with new programs  product life cycles  sales volumes  price erosion within the electronics industry  capacity utilization of surface mount and other equipment  labor costs and efficiencies  the management of inventories  component pricing and shortages  average sales prices  the mix of turnkey and consignment business  fluctuations and timing of customer orders  changing demand for our customers products and competition within the electronics industry 
these  and other factors  can cause variations in our operating results 
there can be no assurance that gross margins will not decrease in future periods 
gross profit for the year ended september   decreased percent to million from million for the year ended september  the gross margin percentage for the year ended september   was percent  compared to percent for the year ended september  the decline in gross margin in fiscal compared to fiscal was due primarily to our reduced utilization of manufacturing and engineering capacity 
most of the research and development we conduct is paid for by our customers and is therefore included in both sales and cost of sales 
we conduct our own research and development  but that research and development is not specifically identified  and we believe such expenses are less than one percent of our sales 
operating expenses 
selling and administrative s a expenses for the year ended september   were million as compared to million and million for the years ended september  and  respectively 
as a percentage of net sales  s a expenses were percent for the year ended september   compared to percent and percent for the years ended september  and  respectively 
the decrease of s a expenses in dollar terms in fiscal as compared to fiscal was due primarily to fiscal restructuring actions and reductions in corporate spending 
these reductions were offset  in part  by approximately million of additional expenses for information technology systems support related to the implementation of a new enterprise resource planning erp platform 
this erp platform is intended to augment our management information systems and includes various software systems to enhance and standardize our ability to globally translate information from production facilities into operational and financial information and create a consistent set of core business applications at our worldwide facilities 
during fiscal  two manufacturing facilities were converted to the new erp platform  which resulted in additional training and implementation costs 
over the next two quarters  we intend to develop enhancements for the new erp platform 
we anticipate converting at least one more facility to the new erp platform 
training and implementation costs are expected to continue over the next several quarters as we make system enhancements and convert an additional facility to the new erp platform 
the conversion timetable and project scope remain subject to change based upon our evolving needs and sales levels 
in addition to s a expenses associated with the new erp system  we continue to incur capital expenditures for hardware  software and certain other costs for testing and installation 
as of september   property  plant and equipment includes million of capital expenditures related to the new erp platform  including million capitalized in fiscal amortization of the capitalized costs associated with the erp platform commenced in fiscal and totaled million 
we anticipate incurring at least an additional million of capital expenditures for the erp platform over the next fiscal year 
effective the first quarter of fiscal  in accordance with sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  we no longer amortized goodwill 
however  goodwill was impaired as a result of a transitional impairment evaluation upon adoption of sfas no 
see discussion below under cumulative effect of a change in accounting for goodwill 
subsequent to the initial adoption of sfas no 
 we are required to perform an annual impairment test  or more frequently if an event or changes in circumstance indicates that an impairment loss has occurred  which could materially affect our results of operations in any given period 
in early fiscal  million of goodwill was impaired as a result of the loss of a major customer in san diego see discussion below 
we completed the annual impairment test during our third quarter of fiscal and determined that no further impairment existed 
during fiscal  we recorded pre tax restructuring and impairment costs totaling million 
these costs resulted from actions taken in response to reductions in our end market demand 
these actions included closing san diego and richmond  the consolidation of several leased facilities  re focusing the pcb design group  a write off of remaining goodwill associated with the acquisition of qtron  the write down of underutilized assets to fair value at several locations  and the costs associated with reductions in work force in several manufacturing  engineering and corporate groups 
these measures were intended to align our capabilities and resources with lower industry demand 
the richmond facility was phased out of operations and sold in september production was shifted to other plexus operating sites in the united states and mexico 
the closure of richmond resulted in a write down of the building  a write down of underutilized assets to fair value  and costs relating to the elimination of the facility s work force 
building impairment charges related to richmond totaled million 
san diego was closed in may the closure of san diego resulted in a write off of remaining goodwill  the write down of underutilized assets to fair value  and costs relating to the elimination of the facility s work force 
building impairment charges totaled million 
during fiscal  goodwill impairment for san diego totaled approximately million  of which million was impaired as a result of a transitional impairment evaluation under sfas no 
see discussion below under cumulative effect of a change in accounting for goodwill and million was impaired as a result of our decision to close the facility 
other fiscal year restructuring actions included the consolidation of several leased facilities  the write down of underutilized assets to fair value and work force reductions  which primarily affected operating sites in juarez  mexico juarez  seattle  washington seattle  neenah  wisconsin neenah and the united kingdom uk 
restructuring actions also impacted our engineering and corporate organizations 
employee termination and severance costs for fiscal related to the termination of approximately  employees 
for the year ended september   we recorded restructuring and impairment costs totaling million 
these charges resulted from actions taken in response to reductions in sales levels and capacity utilization and included the reduction of our work force and the write off of certain underutilized assets to fair value at several locations 
the employee termination and severance costs for fiscal affected approximately employees 
the operating site closures included two owned facilities one located in neenah the oldest of our four facilities in neenah and the other located in minneapolis  minnesota 
these facilities were no longer adequate to service the needs of our customers and would have required significant investment to upgrade 
the neenah facility was phased out of operation in february and is currently used for warehousing and administrative purposes 
the minneapolis facility was phased out of operation in july and sold in october there was no building impairment charge associated with the closure of these two facilities 
the lease termination costs were primarily related to our facilities in seattle and san diego 
for the year ended september   we recorded pre tax restructuring charges of million 
we reduced our cost structure through the reduction of our work force and by writing off certain underutilized assets in response to the reduction in our sales levels 
the employee termination and severance costs provided for the elimination of approximately employees 
the following table summarizes our restructuring and impairment costs for fiscal  and years ended september  non cash impairment costs fixed asset impairment    write off of goodwill  cash restructuring costs severance costs   lease termination costs   total restructuring and impairment costs    as of september   we have a remaining restructuring liability of approximately million  of which million is expected to be paid in fiscal the remaining million of accrued liabilities is expected to be paid through june we currently expect that our restructuring actions will result  when fully implemented  in annualized cost savings of approximately million  although these savings may be offset in part by reduced revenues and other changes in our cost structure 
these savings will primarily benefit cost of sales through lower depreciation  lower lease expense and reduced employee expenses 
for the year ended september   we incurred approximately million of acquisition costs related to the mcms acquisition 
acquisition and merger costs of approximately million for the year ended september  were related to the qtron and ee acquisitions 
cumulative effect of a change in accounting for goodwill 
we adopted sfas no 
for the accounting for goodwill and other intangible assets as of october  under the transitional provisions of sfas no 
 we identified locations with goodwill  performed impairment tests on the net goodwill and other intangible assets associated with each location using a valuation date as of october   and determined that a pre tax transitional impairment charge of million was required related to the san diego and juarez locations 
the impairment charge was recorded as a cumulative effect of a change in accounting for goodwill in our consolidated statements of operations 
income taxes 
income taxes decreased to a million income tax benefit for the year ended september   from a million income tax benefit and million of income tax expense for the years ended september  and  respectively 
our effective income tax rate increased to approximately percent in fiscal as compared to percent in fiscal the increase in the effective tax rate is due primarily to the absence in fiscal of non deductible goodwill amortization expenses that were present in fiscal as of september   we had net deferred income tax assets of million  which have arisen from available income tax losses and future income tax deductions 
our ability to use these income tax losses and future income tax deductions is dependent upon our future operations in the tax jurisdictions in which such losses or deductions arose 
we would record a valuation allowance against deferred income tax assets when management believes it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred income tax assets will not be realized 
although realization is not assured  based on the reversal of deferred income tax liabilities  projected future taxable income  the character of the income tax asset and tax planning strategies  we determined that as of september   no tax valuation allowance is required 
however  should we experience a pre tax loss in fiscal resulting from revenue declines and or the inability to improve operating margins  a tax valuation reserve may be required in fiscal liquidity and capital resources cash flows used in operating activities were million for the year ended september   compared to cash flows provided by operating activities of million and million for the years ended september  and  respectively 
during fiscal  cash used in operating activities was primarily related to fund losses  increased inventory  deferred income tax assets and payments to terminate our former asset securitization facility 
these uses of cash were partially offset by an increase in our accounts payable 
our days sales outstanding in accounts receivable as of september  remained constant at days compared to september  included in these calculations are the addback of amounts sold under the asset securitization facility  which were and million as of september  and  respectively 
our inventory turns decreased to turns for the year ended september  from turns for the year ended september  inventory turns were negatively impacted due to a build up of raw materials and work in process inventory for existing and new customers in anticipation of increased customer demand in the first quarter of fiscal cash flows provided by investing activities totaled million for the year ended september  the primary sources were sales and maturities of short term investments offset by purchases of property  plant and equipment 
we utilize available cash  debt and operating leases to fund our operating requirements 
we utilize operating leases primarily in situations where concerns about technical obsolescence outweigh the benefits of owning the equipment 
we currently estimate capital expenditures for fiscal will be approximately million to million 
this estimate does not include any acquisitions which we may undertake 
our level of capital expenditures for fiscal will be heavily dependent on anticipated sales levels 
cash flows provided by financing activities  totaling million for the year ended september   primarily represent proceeds from stock issuances and the exercise of stock options offset by payments on capital lease obligations 
on october   we entered into a secured revolving credit facility the secured credit facility with a group of banks that allows us to borrow up to million 
borrowing under the secured credit facility will be either through revolving or swing loans or letters of credit 
the secured credit facility is secured by substantially all of our domestic working capital assets and a pledge of percent of the stock of each of our foreign subsidiaries 
interest on borrowings varies with usage and begins at the prime rate as defined or the libor rate plus percent 
we also are required to pay an annual commitment fee of percent of the unused credit commitment  a maximum of million per year 
the secured credit facility matures on october  and includes certain financial covenants customary in agreements of this type 
these covenants include a maximum total leverage ratio  a minimum domestic cash or marketable securities balance  a minimum tangible net worth and a minimum adjusted ebitda  as defined in the agreement 
we terminated our previous credit facility old credit facility effective december  at which time no amounts were outstanding 
termination of the old credit facility was occasioned by anticipated noncompliance with a minimum interest expense coverage ratio covenant as of december   which was a result of the restructuring and impairment costs incurred in the first quarter of fiscal at the date of termination of the old credit facility  we wrote off unamortized deferred financing costs of approximately million 
in fiscal  we entered into an agreement to sell up to million of trade accounts receivable without recourse to plexus abs inc abs  a wholly owned  limited purpose subsidiary of plexus 
abs is a separate entity that sold  under a separate agreement  participating interests in a pool of our accounts receivable to financial institutions 
the financial institutions then received an ownership and security interest in the pool of receivables 
the agreement also included standards for determining which receivables may be sold  and included customary indemnification obligations that are more specifically described in note of notes to the consolidated financial statements 
the agreement expired in september we did not renew the agreement upon its expiration  which resulted in our use of approximately million of cash in the fourth quarter of fiscal to reacquire accounts receivable previously sold under the asset securitization facility 
we believe that our secured credit facility  leasing capabilities  cash and short term investments and projected cash from operations should be sufficient to meet our working and fixed capital requirements through fiscal and the foreseeable future 
we have not paid cash dividends in the past and do not anticipate paying them in the foreseeable future 
we anticipate using any earnings to support our business 
contractual obligations and commitments our disclosures regarding contractual obligations and commercial commitments are located in various parts of our regulatory filings 
information in the following table provides a summary of our contractual obligations and commercial commitments as of september  in thousands payments due by fiscal period and contractual obligations total thereafter capital lease obligations      operating leases      unconditional purchase obligations other long term obligations   total contractual cash obligations      there are no unconditional purchase obligations other than purchases of inventory and equipment in the ordinary course of business 
all such unconditional purchase obligations of inventory and equipment have a term of less than one year 
as of september   other long term obligations consist of salary commitments under employment agreements 
we did not have  and were not subject to  any lines of credit  standby letters of credit  guarantees  standby repurchase obligations  or other commercial commitments 
our off balance sheet asset securitization facility expired in september disclosure about critical accounting policies our accounting policies are disclosed in note to the consolidated financial statements 
during the year ended september   the only material change to these policies related to our accounting for intangible assets 
modifications were also made in our policies for accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and restructuring costs  however  such changes did not have a material effect on our financial position or results of operations 
the significant accounting policies are as follows impairment of long lived assets we adopted sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets effective october  sfas no 
modifies and expands the financial accounting and reporting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets other than goodwill  which is specifically addressed in sfas no 
as described below 
sfas no 
maintains the requirement that an impairment loss be recognized for a long lived asset to be held and used if its carrying value is not recoverable from its undiscounted cash flows with the recognized impairment being the difference between the carrying amount and fair value of the asset 
with respect to long lived assets to be disposed of other than by sale  sfas no 
requires that the asset be considered held and used until it is actually disposed of  but requires that its depreciable life be revised in accordance with apb opinion no 
accounting changes 
we review property  plant and equipment for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
recoverability of property  plant and equipment is measured by comparing its carrying value to the projected cash flows the property  plant and equipment are expected to generate 
if such assets are considered to be impaired  the impairment to be recognized is measured as the amount by which the carrying value of the property exceeds its fair market value 
the impairment analysis is based on significant assumptions of future results made by management  including revenue and cash flow projections 
circumstances that may lead to impairment of property  plant and equipment include decreases in future performance or industry demand and the restructuring of our operations 
intangible assets we adopted sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets effective october  under sfas no 
 beginning october   we no longer amortize goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite useful lives  but  instead  test those assets for impairment at least annually with any related losses recognized in earnings when incurred 
we will perform goodwill impairment tests annually during the third quarter of each fiscal year and more frequently if an event or circumstance indicates that an impairment loss has occurred 
under the transitional provisions of sfas no 
 we identified locations with goodwill  performed impairment tests on the net goodwill and other intangible assets associated with each location using a valuation date as of october   and determined that a pre tax transitional impairment charge of million was required 
the impairment charge was recorded as a cumulative effect of a change in accounting for goodwill in our consolidated statements of operations 
see note to the notes to consolidated financial statements 
in early fiscal  we incurred additional goodwill impairment of million as a result of the company s decision to close the san diego facility see note to the notes to consolidated financial statements 
we measure the recoverability of goodwill under the annual impairment test by comparing a reporting unit s carrying amount  including goodwill  to the fair market value of the reporting unit based on projected discounted future cash flows 
if the carrying amount of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value  goodwill is considered impaired and a second test is performed to measure the amount of impairment loss  if any 
revenue revenue from manufacturing services is generally recognized upon shipment of the manufactured product to our customers  under contractual terms  which are generally fob shipping point 
upon shipment  title transfers and the customer assumes risks and rewards of ownership of the product 
generally  there are no formal customer acceptance requirements or further obligations related to manufacturing services  if such requirements or obligations exist  then revenue is recognized at the time when such requirements are completed and such obligations fulfilled 
revenue from engineering design and development services  which are generally performed under contracts of twelve months or less duration  is recognized as costs are incurred utilizing the percentage of completion method  any losses are recognized when anticipated 
revenue from engineering design and development services is less than ten percent of total revenue 
revenue is recorded net of estimated returns of manufactured product based on management s analysis of historical returns  current economic trends and changes in customer demand 
revenue also includes amounts billed to customers for shipping and handling 
the corresponding shipping and handling costs are included in cost of sales 
restructuring costs from fiscal through fiscal  we recorded restructuring costs in response to reductions in sales and reduced capacity utilization 
these restructuring costs included employee severance and benefit costs  and costs related to plant closings  including leased facilities that will be abandoned and subleased  as applicable 
prior to january   severance and benefit costs were recorded in accordance with emerging issues task force eitf and for leased facilities that were abandoned and subleased  the estimated lease loss was accrued for future remaining lease payments subsequent to abandonment  less any estimated sublease income 
as of september   the significant facilities which we plan to sublease have not yet been subleased  and  accordingly  our estimates of expected sublease income could change based on factors that affect our ability to sublease those facilities such as general economic conditions and the real estate market  among others 
for equipment  the impairment losses recognized are based on the fair value estimated using existing market prices for similar assets  less estimated costs to sell 
see note in the notes to consolidated financial statements 
subsequent to december   costs associated with a restructuring activity are recorded in compliance with sfas no 
 accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities 
the timing and related recognition of recording severance and benefit costs that are not presumed to be an ongoing benefit as defined in sfas no 
 depends on whether employees are required to render service until they are terminated in order to receive the termination benefits and  if so  whether employees will be retained to render service beyond a minimum retention period 
during fiscal  we concluded that we had a substantive severance plan based upon our past severance practices  therefore  we recorded certain severance and benefit costs in accordance with sfas no 
 employer s accounting for post employment benefits  which resulted in the recognition of a liability as the severance and benefit costs arose from an existing condition or situation and the payment was both probable and reasonably estimated 
for leased facilities that will be abandoned and subleased  a liability is recognized and measured at fair value for the future remaining lease payments subsequent to abandonment  less any estimated sublease income that could be reasonably obtained for the property 
for contract termination costs  including costs that will continue to be incurred under a contract for its remaining term without economic benefit to the entity  a liability for future remaining payments under the contract is recognized and measured at its fair value 
see note in the notes to consolidated financial statements 
the recognition of restructuring costs requires that we make certain judgments and estimates regarding the nature  timing and amount of costs associated with the planned exit activity 
if our actual results in exiting these facilities differ from our estimates and assumptions  we may be required to revise the estimates of future liabilities  requiring the recording of additional restructuring costs or the reduction of liabilities already recorded 
at the end of each reporting period  we evaluate the remaining accrued balances to ensure that no excess accruals are retained and the utilization of the provisions are for their intended purpose in accordance with developed exit plans

sfas deferred the effective date of sfas no 
indefinitely for applying the provisions of the statement for certain mandatorily redeemable non controlling interests

the issuance of sfas no  is not expected to have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations 
risk factors our customer requirements and operating results vary significantly from quarter to quarter  which could negatively impact the price of our common stock 
our quarterly and annual results may vary significantly depending on various factors  many of which are beyond our control 
these factors include the volume of customer orders relative to our capacity  the level and timing of customer orders  particularly in light of the fact that some of our customers release a significant percentage of their orders during the last few weeks of a quarter  the typical short life cycle of our customers products  market acceptance of and demand for our customers products  customer announcements of operating results and business conditions  changes in our sales mix to our customers  the timing of our expenditures in anticipation of future orders  our effectiveness in managing manufacturing processes  changes in cost and availability of labor and components  local events that may affect our production volume  such as local holidays  credit ratings and stock analyst reports and changes in economic conditions and world events 
the ems industry is impacted by the state of the us and global economies and world events 
a continued slowdown or flat performance in the us or global economies  or in particular in the industries served by us  may result in our customers further reducing their forecasts 
our sales have been  and we expect them to continue to be  adversely affected by the slowdown in the networking datacommunications telecom and industrial commercial markets  as a result of reduced end market demand and reduced availability of venture capital to fund existing and emerging technologies 
these factors have and continue to substantially influence our levels of net sales 
as a result  the demand for our services could continue to be weak or decrease  which in turn would impact our sales  capacity utilization  margins and results 
our quarterly and annual results are affected by the level and timing of customer orders  fluctuations in material costs and availabilities  and the degree of capacity utilization in the manufacturing process 
the majority of our sales come from a small number of customers and if we lose any of these customers  our sales and operating results could decline significantly 
sales to our largest customer represented percent of our net sales in fiscal we had no customers that represented percent or more in fiscal and sales to our ten largest customers have represented a majority  or near majority  of our net sales in recent periods 
our ten largest customers accounted for approximately percent  percent and percent of our net sales for the years ended september   and  respectively 
our principal customers have varied from year to year  and our principal customers may not continue to purchase services from us at current levels  if at all 
significant reductions in sales to any of these customers  or the loss of major customers  could seriously harm our business 
if we are not able to replace expired  canceled or reduced contracts with new business on a timely basis  our sales will decrease 
our customers may cancel their orders  change production quantities or delay production 
electronics manufacturing service providers must provide increasingly rapid product turnaround for their customers 
we generally do not obtain firm  long term purchase commitments from our customers and we continue to experience reduced lead times in customer orders 
customers may cancel their orders  change production quantities or delay production for a number of reasons that are beyond our control 
the success of our customers products in the market and the strength of the markets themselves affect our business 
cancellations  reductions or delays by a significant customer or by a group of customers could seriously harm our operating results 
such cancellations  reductions or delays have occurred and may continue to occur in response to a slowdown in the overall economy 
in addition  we make significant decisions  including determining the levels of business that we will seek and accept  production schedules  component procurement commitments  facility requirements  personnel needs and other resource requirements  based on our estimates of customer requirements 
the short term nature of our customers commitments and the possibility of rapid changes in demand for their products reduce our ability to accurately estimate the future requirements of those customers 
because many of our costs and operating expenses are relatively fixed  a reduction in customer demand can harm our gross margins and operating results 
on occasion  customers may require rapid increases in production  which can stress our resources and reduce operating margins 
although we have had a net increase in our manufacturing capacity over the past few fiscal years  we have significantly reduced our capacity from its peak  and we may not have sufficient capacity at any given time to meet all of our customers demands or to meet the requirements of a specific project 
failure to manage our contraction  and our future growth  if any  may seriously harm our business 
periods of contraction or reduced sales  such as the period that continued in fiscal  create tensions and challenges 
we must determine whether all facilities remain productive  determine whether staffing levels need to be reduced  and determine how to respond to changing levels of customer demand 
while maintaining multiple facilities or higher levels of employment increases short term costs  reductions in employment could impair our ability to respond to later market improvements or to maintain customer relationships 
our decisions as to how to reduce costs and capacity  such as the recent closure of our san diego facility and our kentucky facility and the reduction in the number of employees  can affect our expenses  and therefore our short term and long term results 
we are involved in a multi year project to install a common erp platform and associated information systems 
the project was begun at a time when anticipated sales growth and profitability were expected to be much higher than has actually occurred in recent financial performance 
we continue to review a number of alternatives to this project  including curtailment or slow down in the rate of implementation 
as of september   erp implementation costs included in property  plant and equipment totaled million and we anticipate incurring at least an additional million in capital expenditures for the erp platform  changes in the scope of this project could result in impairment of these capitalized costs 
the resumption of sales growth would require us to improve and expand our financial  operational and management information systems  continue to develop the management skills of our managers and supervisors  and continue to train  manage and motivate our employees 
we may also experience a need for additional facilities 
if we are unable to manage future growth effectively  our operating results could be harmed 
operating in foreign countries exposes us to increased risks 
we have operations in china  malaysia  mexico and the united kingdom 
we may in the future expand into other international regions 
we have limited experience in managing geographically dispersed operations in these countries 
we also purchase a significant number of components manufactured in foreign countries 
because of these international aspects of our operations  we are subject to the following risks that could materially impact our operating results economic or political instability transportation delays or interruptions and other effects of less developed infrastructure in many countries foreign exchange rate fluctuations utilization of different systems and equipment difficulties in staffing and managing foreign personnel and diverse cultures and the effects of international political developments 
in addition  changes in policies by the us or foreign governments could negatively affect our operating results due to changes in duties  tariffs  taxes or limitations on currency or fund transfers 
for example  our mexico based operation utilizes the maquiladora program  which provides reduced tariffs and eases import regulations  and we could be adversely affected by changes in that program 
also  the chinese and malaysian subsidiaries currently receive favorable tax treatment from the governments in those countries for approximately to years  which may or may not be renewed 
we may not be able to maintain our engineering  technological and manufacturing process expertise 
the markets for our manufacturing and engineering services are characterized by rapidly changing technology and evolving process development 
the continued success of our business will depend upon our ability to retain our qualified engineering and technical personnel maintain and enhance our technological capabilities develop and market manufacturing services which meet changing customer needs successfully anticipate or respond to technological changes in manufacturing processes on a cost effective and timely basis 
although we believe that our operations utilize the assembly and testing technologies  equipment and processes that are currently required by our customers  we cannot be certain that we will develop the capabilities required by our customers in the future 
the emergence of new technology industry standards or customer requirements may render our equipment  inventory or processes obsolete or noncompetitive 
in addition  we may have to acquire new assembly and testing technologies and equipment to remain competitive 
the acquisition and implementation of new technologies and equipment may require significant expense or capital investment that could reduce our operating margins and our operating results 
our failure to anticipate and adapt to our customers changing technological needs and requirements could have an adverse effect on our business 
our manufacturing services involve inventory risk 
most of our contract manufacturing services are provided on a turnkey basis  where we purchase some or all of the materials required for designing  product assembling and manufacturing 
these services involve greater resource investment and inventory risk management than consignment services  where the customer provides these materials 
accordingly  various component price increases and inventory obsolescence could adversely affect our selling price  gross margins and operating results 
in our turnkey operations  we need to order parts and supplies based on customer forecasts  which may be for a larger quantity of product than is included in the firm orders ultimately received from those customers 
customers cancellation or reduction of orders can result in expenses to us 
while most of our customer agreements include provisions which require customers to reimburse us for excess inventory specifically ordered to meet their forecasts  we may not actually be reimbursed or be able to collect on these obligations 
in that case  we could have excess inventory and or cancellation or return charges from our suppliers 
in addition  we provide a managed inventory program under which we hold and manage finished goods inventory for two of our key customers 
the managed inventory program may result in higher finished goods inventory levels  further reduce our inventory turns and increase our financial risk with such customers  although our customers will have contractual obligations to purchase the inventory from us 
we may not be able to obtain raw materials or components for our assemblies on a timely basis or at all 
we rely on a limited number of suppliers for many components used in the assembly process 
we do not have any long term supply agreements 
at various times  there have been shortages of some of the electronic components that we use  and suppliers of some components have lacked sufficient capacity to meet the demand for these components 
at times  component shortages have been prevalent in our industry  and in certain areas recur from time to time 
in some cases  supply shortages and delays in deliveries of particular components have resulted in curtailed production  or delays in production  of assemblies using that component  which contributed to an increase in our inventory levels 
we expect that shortages and delays in deliveries of some components will continue from time to time 
an increase in economic activity could also result in shortages  if manufacturers of components do not adequately anticipate the increased orders 
world events  such as terrorism  armed conflict and epidemics  also could affect supply chains 
if we are unable to obtain sufficient components on a timely basis  we may experience manufacturing and shipping delays  which could harm our relationships with customers and reduce our sales 
a significant portion of our sales is derived from turnkey manufacturing in which we provide materials procurement 
while most of our customer contracts permit quarterly or other periodic adjustments to pricing based on decreases and increases in component prices and other factors  we typically bear the risk of component price increases that occur between any such repricings or  if such repricing is not permitted  during the balance of the term of the particular customer contract 
accordingly  component price increases could adversely affect our operating results 
start up costs and inefficiencies related to new or transferred programs can adversely affect our operating results 
start up costs  the management of labor and equipment resources in connection with the establishment of new programs and new customer relationships  and the need to estimate required resources in advance can adversely affect our gross margins and operating results 
these factors are particularly evident in the early stages of the life cycle of new products and new programs or program transfers 
these factors also affect our ability to efficiently use labor and equipment 
in addition  if any of these new programs or new customer relationships were terminated  our operating results could be harmed  particularly in the short term 
we may have new customer relationships with emerging companies  which may present more risks than with established companies 
we currently anticipate that less than percent of our fiscal sales will be to emerging companies  including start ups  particularly in the networking datacommunications market 
however  similar to our other customer relationships  there are no volume purchase commitments under these new programs  and the revenues we actually achieve from these programs may not meet our expectations 
in anticipation of future activities under these programs  we incur substantial expenses as we add personnel and manufacturing capacity and procure materials 
because emerging companies do not have a history of operations  it will be harder for us to anticipate needs and requirements than with established customers 
our operating results will be harmed if sales do not develop to the extent and within the time frame we anticipate 
customer relationships with emerging companies also present special risks 
for example  because they do not have an extensive product history  there is less demonstration of market acceptance of their products 
also  due to the current economic environment  additional funding for such companies may be more difficult to obtain and these customer relationships may not continue or materialize to the extent we plan or we previously experienced 
this tightening of financing for start up customers  together with many start up customers lack of prior earnings and unproven product markets increase our credit risk  especially in accounts receivable and inventories 
although we adjust our reserves for accounts receivable and inventories for all customers  including start up customers  based on the information available  these reserves may not be adequate 
we are subject to extensive government regulations 
we are also subject to environmental regulations relating to the use  storage  discharge  recycling and disposal of hazardous chemicals used in our manufacturing process 
if we fail to comply with present and future regulations  we could be subject to future liabilities or the suspension of business 
these regulations could restrict our ability to expand our facilities or require us to acquire costly equipment or incur significant expense 
while we are not currently aware of any material violations  we may have to spend funds to comply with present and future regulations or be required to perform site remediation 
in addition  our medical device business  which represented approximately percent of our net sales in fiscal  is subject to substantial government regulation  primarily from the fda and similar regulatory bodies in other countries 
we must comply with statutes and regulations covering the design  development  testing  manufacturing and labeling of medical devices and the reporting of certain information regarding their safety 
failure to comply with these rules can result in  among other things  our and our customers being subject to fines  injunctions  civil penalties  criminal prosecution  recall or seizure of devices  or total or partial suspension of production 
the fda also has the authority to require repair or replacement of equipment  or refund of the cost of a device manufactured or distributed by our customers 
violations may lead to penalties or shutdowns of a program or a facility 
in addition  failure or noncompliance could have an adverse effect on our reputation 
products we manufacture may contain design or manufacturing defects which could result in reduced demand for our services and liability claims against us 
we manufacture products to our customers specifications which are highly complex and may at times contain design or manufacturing defects 
defects have been discovered in products we manufactured in the past and  despite our quality control and quality assurance efforts  defects may occur in the future 
defects in the products we manufacture  whether caused by a design  manufacturing or component failure or error  may result in delayed shipments to customers or reduced or cancelled customer orders 
if these defects occur in large quantities or too frequently  our business reputation may also be tarnished 
in addition  these defects may result in liability claims against us 
even if customers are responsible for the defects  they may or may not be able to assume responsibility for any costs or payments 
our products are for the electronics industry which produces technologically advanced products with short life cycles 
factors affecting the electronics industry  in particular the short life cycle of products  could seriously harm our customers and  as a result  us 
these factors include the inability of our customers to adapt to rapidly changing technology and evolving industry standards which result in short product life cycles the inability of our customers to develop and market their products  some of which are new and untested the potential that our customers products may become obsolete or the failure of our customers products to gain widespread commercial acceptance 
increased competition may result in decreased demand or prices for our services 
the electronics manufacturing services industry is highly competitive and has become more so as a result of excess capacity in the industry 
we compete against numerous us and foreign electronics manufacturing services providers with global operations  as well as those who operate on a local or regional basis 
in addition  current and prospective customers continually evaluate the merits of manufacturing products internally 
consolidations and other changes in the electronics manufacturing services industry result in a continually changing competitive landscape 
the consolidation trend in the industry also results in larger and more geographically diverse competitors which may have significant combined resources with which to compete against us 
some of our competitors have substantially greater managerial  manufacturing  engineering  technical  financial  systems  sales and marketing resources than we do 
these competitors may respond more quickly to new or emerging technologies have greater name recognition  critical mass and geographic and market presence be better able to take advantage of acquisition opportunities adapt more quickly to changes in customer requirements devote greater resources to the development  promotion and sale of their services be better positioned to compete on price for their services 
we may be operating at a cost disadvantage compared to manufacturers who have greater direct buying power from component suppliers  distributors and raw material suppliers or who have lower cost structures 
as a result  competitors may have a competitive advantage and obtain business from our customers 
our manufacturing processes are generally not subject to significant proprietary protection  and companies with greater resources or a greater market presence may enter our market or increase their competition with us 
increased competition could result in price reductions  reduced sales and margins or loss of market share 
we depend on certain key personnel  and the loss of key personnel may harm our business 
our future success depends in large part on the continued service of our key technical and management personnel  and on our ability to attract and retain qualified employees  particularly those highly skilled design  process and test engineers involved in the development of new products and processes and the manufacture of existing products 
the competition for these individuals is significant  and the loss of key employees could harm our business 
our operations  including china  could be negatively affected by the sars epidemic 
we have a production facility in xiamen  china  which is one of the countries that was hardest hit by the epidemic of sars 
to the best of our knowledge  the sars epidemic did not affect any of our employees in china  or any employees at our other facilities 
in addition  we did not experience any disruption in our supply chain as a result of the sars epidemic 
we have taken a number of initiatives to protect our employees from contracting the sars virus  however  our production could be severely impacted  if our employees  or the region in which the facility in china is located  experience a renewed outbreak of sars 
for example  the facility in china could be closed by government authorities  some or all of our workforce could be unavailable due to quarantine  fear of catching the disease or other factors  and local  national or international transportation or other infrastructure could be affected  leading to delays or loss of production 
the sars epidemic was not limited to china  and sars or other disease outbreaks could also affect our other foreign or domestic facilities in similar ways 
in addition  these other factors also could affect our suppliers  leading to a shortage of components  or our customers  leading to a reduction in their demand for our services 
we may fail to successfully complete future acquisitions and may not successfully integrate acquired businesses  which could adversely affect our operating results 
although we have previously grown through acquisitions  our current focus is on pursuing organic growth opportunities 
if we were to pursue future growth through acquisitions  however  this would involve significant risks that could have a material adverse effect on us 
these risks include operating risks  such as the inability to integrate successfully our acquired operations businesses and personnel inability to realize anticipated synergies  economies of scale or other value difficulties in scaling up production and coordinating management of operations at new sites strain placed on our personnel  systems and resources possible modification or termination of an acquired business customer programs  including cancellation of current or anticipated programs loss of key employees of acquired businesses 
financial risks  such as the use of cash resources  or incurrence of additional debt and related interest costs dilutive effect of the issuance of additional equity securities inability to achieve expected operating margins to offset the increased fixed costs associated with acquisitions  and or inability to increase margins at acquired entities to plexus desired levels incurrence of large write offs or write downs and impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets unforeseen liabilities of the acquired businesses 
expansion of our business and operations may negatively impact our business 
at some future point  we again may expand our operations by establishing or acquiring new facilities or by expanding capacity in our current facilities 
we may expand both in geographical areas in which we currently operate and in new geographical areas within the united states and internationally 
we may not be able to find suitable facilities on a timely basis or on terms satisfactory to us 
expansion of our business and operations involves numerous business risks  including the inability to successfully integrate additional facilities or capacity and to realize anticipated synergies  economies of scale or other value additional fixed costs which may not be fully absorbed by the new business difficulties in the timing of expansions  including delays in the implementation of construction and manufacturing plans creation of excess capacity  and the need to reduce capacity elsewhere if anticipated sales or opportunities do not materialize diversion of management s attention from other business areas during the planning and implementation of expansions strain placed on our operational  financial  management  technical and information systems and resources disruption in manufacturing operations incurrence of significant costs and expenses inability to locate enough customers or employees to support the expansion 
we may fail to secure necessary financing 
on october   we entered into a secured revolving credit facility the secured credit facility with a group of banks 
the secured credit facility allows us to borrow up to million 
however  we cannot assure that the secured credit facility will provide all of the financing capacity that we will need in the future 
our future success may depend on our ability to obtain additional financing and capital to support our possible future growth 
we may seek to raise capital by issuing additional common stock or other equity securities issuing debt securities obtaining new credit facilities 
we may not be able to obtain capital when we want or need it  and capital may not be available on satisfactory terms 
if we issue additional equity securities or convertible debt to raise capital  it may be dilutive to shareholders ownership interests 
furthermore  any additional financing and capital may have terms and conditions that adversely affect our business  such as restrictive financial or operating covenants  and our ability to meet any financing covenants will largely depend on our financial performance  which in turn will be subject to general economic conditions and financial  business and other factors 
the price of our common stock has been and may continue to be volatile 
our stock price has fluctuated significantly in recent periods 
the price of our common stock may fluctuate significantly in response to a number of events and factors relating to us  our competitors and the market for our services  many of which are beyond our control 
in addition  the stock market in general  and especially the nasdaq stock market  along with market prices for technology companies in particular  have experienced extreme volatility and weakness that sometimes has been unrelated to the operating performance of these companies 
these broad market and industry fluctuations may adversely affect the market price of our common stock  regardless of our operating results 
our stock price and the stock price of many other technology companies remain below their peaks 
among other things  volatility and weakness in plexus stock price could mean that investors will not be able to sell their shares at or above the prices which they paid 
the volatility and weakness could also impair plexus ability in the future to offer common stock or convertible securities as a source of additional capital and or as consideration in the acquisition of other businesses 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to market risk from changes in foreign exchange and interest rates 
to reduce such risks  we selectively use financial instruments 
a discussion of our accounting policy for derivative financial instruments is incorporated by reference from our consolidated financial statements and notes thereto  in this form k  within note description of business and significant accounting policies 
foreign currency risk we do not use derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes 
our policy is to selectively hedge our foreign currency denominated transactions in a manner that substantially offsets the effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
presently  we use foreign currency contracts to hedge only those currency exposures associated with certain assets and liabilities denominated in non functional currencies 
corresponding gains and losses on the underlying transaction generally offset the gains and losses on these foreign currency hedges 
our international operations create potential foreign exchange risk 
as of september   our foreign currency contracts were scheduled to mature in less than three months and were not material 
in fiscal  and  we had net sales of approximately percent  percent and percent  respectively  denominated in currencies other than the us dollar 
in fiscal  and  we had total costs of approximately percent for each fiscal year  denominated in currencies other than the us dollar 
interest rate risk we have financial instruments  including cash equivalents and short term investments  which are sensitive to changes in interest rates 
we consider the use of interest rate swaps based on existing market conditions 
we currently do not use any interest rate swaps or other types of derivative financial instruments to hedge interest rate risk 
the primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve principal  while maximizing yields without significantly increasing market risk 
to achieve this  we maintain our portfolio of cash equivalents and short term investments in a variety of highly rated securities  money market funds and certificates of deposit and limit the amount of principal exposure to any one issuer 
our only material interest rate risk is associated with our secured credit facility 
interest on borrowings is computed at the applicable eurocurrency rate on the agreed currency 
a percent change in our weighted average interest rate on our average long term borrowings would have had a nominal impact on net interest expense in fiscal and  compared to an impact of approximately million for fiscal
