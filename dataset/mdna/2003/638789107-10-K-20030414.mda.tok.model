item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion of the results of operations and financial condition of the company should be read in conjunction with the selected consolidated financial data and the audited consolidated financial statements of the company and the notes thereto included elsewhere in this document 
overview natrol  inc and subsidiaries collectively  the company manufactures and markets branded  high quality dietary supplement products  including vitamins  minerals  hormonal supplements  herbal products  specialty combination formulations and sports nutrition supplements  through its three operating segments 
the segments include the natrol operating segment  which manufactures and markets natrol and laci le beau branded products  and which  under the epi name  contract manufactures products and sells raw material ingredients  prolab nutrition  inc prolab  which develops  manufactures and markets sports nutrition products  and annasa  inc annasa  which was established in  to develop a direct to consumer multi level marketing business 
the company sells its core products under the natrol brand name through multiple distribution channels throughout the united states  including domestic health food stores and mass market drug  retail and grocery store chains 
in addition to the core brand  natrol sells herbal teas under the laci le beau brand name within the same channels of trade as the natrol core brand 
the company markets sports nutrition products under the prolab brand name 
prolab products are sold primarily in health clubs and gyms as well as the health food store channel of trade and internationally in select countries through international distributors 
during  the company launched a multi level marketing company using the annasa brand name 
annasa  was in the development stage during  with approximately  in revenue 
the full launch of annasa commenced in january the company expects to continue to invest in annasa during and does not expect annasa to reach cash flow break even until the company expects to incur an additional to million in expenses before annasa reaches cash flow break even 
natrol products are sold in most mass market chain drug retail outlets such as walgreens  rite aid  walmart  eckerd  cvs  most health food stores including whole foods markets  vitamin cottage  hi health and wild oats and  to a more limited degree  grocery stores such as kroger and ralphs 
the company was not able to grow its business during in past years  natrol s growth was supported by increased penetration into its core mass market and health food channels of trade as well as by new product introduction 
during  the company was not able to increase its overall presence within these channels of trade 
faced with increased competition from other vendors and private label house brands which have been strongly supported by the company s largest mass market customers  the company  in a number of instances  intentionally reduced the number of items on the shelves of its customers  deleting slow moving and unprofitable items 
the company did so to improve the overall profitability of the natrol brand 
after careful analysis  the company determined that within the mass market channel of trade  it is often unprofitable to sell secondary and tertiary items ie  items without a large following as the mass market retailers often promote their own private label products to meet the needs of consumers for these types of products 
profitability in the mass market channel is also affected because of the large amount of returns of slow moving items 
when such products are returned the products generally have limited  if any  value because such products generally have little remaining shelf life 
product returns are a recurring part of the company s business 
products may be returned for various reasons including expiration dates or lack of sufficient sales velocity 
during  returns and reimbursements for damages and outdated products amounted to of gross sales  a significant decrease from  when returns represented approximately of gross sales 
the company is continuing to work to reduce the volume of returns through better management of its sku count at retail establishments and through more effective use of sales and marketing programs 
even so  there is no guarantee that future returns will not increase to  or exceed  the levels experienced in furthermore  the possibility exists that should the company lose a major account  the company may be forced to accept a substantial amount of returns 
information resources  inc iri tracks sales data within the food  drug  and mass market channels of distribution 
for the weeks ending march   vitamin  mineral and supplement sales in these channels of distribution rose when compared to the same period a year earlier 
however unit sales were down 
these trends have adversely affected natrol s business and results of operations in and private label business has been a significant growth element within the vmhs industry 
the growth of private label sales impacts the sales of branded products such as those distributed by natrol 
as noted above  private label sales are  to an ever greater degree  being emphasized by large mass market retailers 
as such  the growth of brands such as natrol  laci le beau  and prolab within food  drug  and general mass market merchants remains both highly competitive and uncertain 
critical accounting policies the consolidated financial statements of the company are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america  which requires the company to make certain estimates and assumptions affecting the reported amounts in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes 
the company bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
management believes the following critical accounting policies  among others  affect its more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition 
the company sells its products to retail outlets through a direct sales force and a national distributor network 
the company recognizes revenue from sales only after product is shipped 
net sales represent product shipped less returns  estimates for future returns  spoilage allowances  allowances for product deemed to be unsaleable by customers  free goods shipped to customers for promotional or other purposes and slotting fees 
estimates and allowances are based upon known claims and an estimate of additional returns 
our recognition of revenue from sales to distributors and retailers is impacted by agreements we have giving them rights to return damaged and outdated products as well as the fact that as a practical business matter  the company and its customers are constantly working to ensure the profitability of its sets within retailers by rotating slow moving items out of stores and replacing these products with what the company and the retailer expect will be more profitable  faster selling items 
the company s obligation to accept returns of slow moving items may or may not be contractually bound 
the company constantly monitors its historical patterns of returns from customers as well as current and ongoing sales to customers and  when information is available  consumer purchases of the company s products from the company s customers 
when historical trends with respect to customer returns are quantifiable  the company will create an allowance for future returns at the time sales are made 
should the company determine that a particular product is slow moving and will eventually result in significant returns  it will provide for those returns at the time such an assessment is made 
in recent years  as a result of a combination of the factors described above  we have materially reduced our gross sales to reflect our estimated returns 
it is also possible that returns could increase rapidly and significantly in the future 
accordingly  estimating product returns requires significant management judgment 
in addition  different return estimates that we reasonably could have used would have had a material impact on our reported sales and thus have had a material impact on the presentation of our results of operations 
for those reasons  we believe that the accounting estimate related to product returns is a critical accounting estimate 
our estimate of product returns is a critical accounting estimate for both of our current operating segments 
in preparing our financial statements  the total amount from returns and damages and outdates in   and  respectively was million  million  and million 
our estimate for returns at december  was  greater than our estimate at december  and  greater than our estimate at december  impairment of goodwill 
the determination as to whether goodwill is impaired requires a great deal of judgment 
prior to january   the company evaluated goodwill for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicated that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
in  the company determined that it was appropriate to write down million of goodwill associated with its prolab reporting unit 
the company focused on prolab s declining sales volume  issues surrounding prolab s ephedrine based products  the sports nutrition market as a whole  and undiscounted cash flows 
based on all of these considerations  the company deemed that in accordance with the then current accounting rules  a million write down of goodwill was appropriate 
on january   the company adopted sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
sfas no 
requires that goodwill not be amortized 
in accordance with such adoption  the company identified all reporting units in conjunction with the provisions of sfas no 
and allocated all goodwill accordingly 
beginning in  goodwill is evaluated for impairment annually  or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of goodwill may not be recoverable 
the company tested goodwill for impairment using the two step process prescribed in sfas no 
the first step is a screen for potential impairment  while the second step measures the amount of the impairment  if any 
the company performed the first step of the impairment test  and determined that the there was no impairment of the prolab segment  but that there was potential impairment of the natrol segment 
the company performed the second step as of january  for the natrol segment and determined that its goodwill balance of  was impaired 
the impairment loss was recorded as a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle in the accompanying consolidated statement of operations for the year ended december  the remaining goodwill balance at december  was  and related entirely to prolab 
in accordance with the provisions of sfas no 
 the company will  at a minimum  perform an annual impairment review of the goodwill of the prolab reporting unit 
income taxes 
deferred income tax assets have been established for future tax benefits related to deductible goodwill for which the company has recorded an impairment charge 
the benefit of which  was approximately million 
realization of this benefit is dependent on generating sufficient taxable income in future periods 
although it is not assured  management believes it is more likely than not that the carrying value of this benefit will be realized 
the amount of the benefit that is considered realizable  however  could change if estimates of future taxable income are adjusted in future periods 
results of operations year ended december  compared to year ended december  net sales 
net sales in decreased  or million  to million from million in net sales in both years were adversely affected by a high level of product returns 
the level of returns was approximately of gross sales in and of gross sales in during  the company worked to rationalize its product offerings in the mass market channel of trade where returns are most likely to occur 
during it became apparent to the company that sales of secondary and tertiary items were not sufficient to prevent significant product returns 
this rationalization process directly resulted in lower net revenue since the company stopped selling many secondary and tertiary items within mass market accounts  instead limiting the sale of these items to specialty stores where the volume of sales was sufficient to prevent a large volume of returns 
as a result of this rationalization process  the level of returns was reduced substantially from that experienced in the company had no products greater than of gross sales in the company s gross sales of the msm line of joint care products comprised in one customer  walmart  accounted for of the company s net sales in no one customer accounted for more than of net sales in the company s top customers accounted for approximately of the company s net sales in gross profit

in  there were approximately  of g a expenses attributable to the launch of annasa 
no such expenses were incurred in taking these factors into consideration  g a expenses rose million when compared to a majority  or  of the increase was due to legal expenses which increased largely due to the successful defense of label claims and a california proposition matter which the company is resolving 
depreciation increased approximately  when compared to during  the company invested approximately million in a new sap software system as well as new servers and other peripheral equipment to run the software

the price of certain types of insurance rose nearly five fold while the amount of coverage offered within the policies was reduced sharply 
it is estimated that the cost of general business  directors officers liability  property and product liability insurance will increase approximately million in from the expense incurred in the remaining increase in g a expenses in over was due to general increases in payroll and the other expenses of maintaining the company s business

year ended december  compared to year ended december  net sales 
net sales in decreased  or million  to million from million in net sales in both years were adversely affected by a high level of product returns 
the level of returns was approximately of gross sales in and of gross sales in the company believes these high rates of returns were caused by negative industry trends which caused retailers to decrease warehouse stocking levels and in some cases to reduce the amount of shelf space devoted to vitamins as well as to the failure of certain products introduced during and to gain popularity with consumers 
in addition  the company believes that  within the mass market channel of distribution  there was not enough demand for many of the company s secondary and tertiary products 
this lack of demand when combined with the company s expanded number of products carried by its mass market customers in and  caused the level of returns to increase substantially in and only one line of products  the msm line of joint care products  accounted for more than of the company s gross sales in and and no customer accounted for more than of sales  although the company s top ten customers accounted for approximately of gross revenue 
gross profit

selling and marketing expenses decreased  or million  to million in from million in as a percentage of net sales  selling and marketing expenses decreased to in from in  which was the highest in the company s history 
after experiencing the highest selling and marketing expenses in its history in  the company focused on reducing these expenditures in advertising expenditures were reduced sharply

general and administrative expenses 
general and administrative expenses decreased or  to million in from million in as a percentage of net sales  general and administrative expenses were in and in impairment of goodwill 
in  the company determined that it was appropriate to write down million of goodwill associated with its prolab reporting unit 
the company focused on prolab s declining sales volume  issues surrounding prolab s ephedrine based products  the sports nutrition market as a whole  and undiscounted cash flows 
based on all of these considerations  the company deemed that in accordance with the then current accounting rules  a million write down of goodwill was appropriate 
interest income expense  net 
net interest expense for was  versus million in interest expense decreased in as the company repaid its line of credit early in the year 
a substantial portion of the interest expense during stemmed from the company s borrowings under its line of credit  which had an average outstanding balance of million for the year ended december  income tax provision benefit

liquidity and capital resources at december   the company had working capital of million  as compared to million in working capital at december  the increase was primarily due to a net increase in trade payables and other short term liabilities offset by a decrease in receivables  inventory and prepaid expenses 
net cash provided in operating activities was million for the year ended december  versus net cash provided of million in and net cash used of  in the increase in net cash provided by operating activities in was due to income before cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle of  depreciation and amortization and other non cash items of million  the reduction of inventory of  a reduction of income tax receivable and the buildup of income taxes payable of million and a net increase in other operating assets and liabilities excluding income taxes of  in  cash flows from operations was million

in total  cash flows from the net loss adjusted for depreciation and amortization  impairment charges and other non cash items was million 
in addition  changes in operating assets and liabilities provided million 
the significant elements in net cash used in changes in operating assets and liabilities included a decrease in inventory  a million decrease in accounts receivable and a million decrease in income tax receivables 
offsetting these items  was a net increase in prepaid expenses of million and a decrease of payables and accrued liabilities of  at december   the company s days sales outstanding in its trade receivable was approximately days versus days in and days in net cash used in investing activities was million in versus  in and  in all of the cash used for investing activities in  and was for the acquisition of property  plant and equipment 
substantially all of the investment in related to the installation of a new integrated sap software system and related computer equipment to manage the company s business

the company s cash balance at the close of was approximately million 
the company believes that its year end cash balance together with cash generated from operations will be sufficient to fund its anticipated working capital needs and planned capital expenditures for at least the next months 
the company currently has no outstanding debt on its books other than the mortgage debt on its properties 
there is no guarantee that  should the company need additional capital  that financial institutions will be willing to provide capital to the company 
however  given the strength of the company s balance sheet  the company s historical cash flows  and the large number of unencumbered assets in its possession  the company believes that it can obtain sufficient financing to maintain its operations from either traditional or alternative financial institutions should that be necessary 
in providing the company with additional funds  potential lenders may seek to institute covenants restricting the company from certain activities and if the company deems it necessary to borrow funds with these restrictions in place  it may find that its ability to compete effectively in its market sector is hindered 
in order to meet its long term liquidity needs or consummate future acquisitions or to continue funding its launch of annasa  the company may be required to incur additional indebtedness or issue additional equity and debt securities  subject to market and other conditions 
there can be no assurance that such additional financing will be available on terms acceptable to the company or at all 
the failure to raise the funds necessary to finance its future cash requirements or consummate future acquisitions could adversely affect the company s ability to pursue new acquisitions and could negatively affect its operations in future periods
