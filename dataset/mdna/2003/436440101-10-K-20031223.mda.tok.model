item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the selected consolidated financial data and the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report and the information described under the caption risk factors below 
critical accounting policies the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the us the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to customer programs and incentives  product returns  bad debts  inventories  investments  intangible assets  income taxes  warranty obligations  restructuring and contingencies and litigation 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
inventory our inventories include material  labor and overhead  and are stated at the lower of cost first in  first out or market 
as a designer and manufacturer of high technology medical equipment  we may be exposed to a number of economic and industry factors that could result in portions of our inventory becoming either obsolete or in excess of anticipated usage 
these factors include  but are not limited to  technological changes in our markets  our ability to meet changing customer requirements  competitive pressures in products and prices  reliability and replacement of and the availability of key components from our suppliers 
our policy is to establish inventory reserves when conditions exist that suggest that our inventory may be in excess of anticipated demand or is obsolete based upon our assumptions about future demand for our products and 
table of contents market conditions 
we regularly evaluate our ability to realize the value of our inventory based on a combination of factors including the following historical usage rates  forecasted sales or usage  product end of life dates  estimated current and future market values and new product introductions 
assumptions used in determining our estimates of future product demand may prove to be incorrect  in which case the provision required for excess and obsolete inventory would have to be adjusted in the future 
if inventory is determined to be overvalued  we would be required to recognize such costs as cost of goods sold at the time of such determination 
although every effort is made to ensure the accuracy of our forecasts of future product demand  any significant unanticipated changes in demand could have a significant negative impact on the value of the our inventory and our reported operating results 
additionally  purchasing requirements and alternative usage avenues are explored within these processes to mitigate inventory exposure 
when recorded  our reserves are intended to reduce the carrying value of our inventory to its net realizable value 
allowance for doubtful accounts we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
we regularly evaluate the collectibility of our trade receivables based on a combination of factors  which may include dialogue with the customer to determine the cause of non payment  the use of collection agencies  and or the use of litigation 
in the event it is determined that the customer may not be able to meet its full obligation to us  we record a specific allowance to reduce the related receivable to the amount that we expect to recover given all information present 
we perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers and adjust credit limits based upon payment history and our assessment of the customer s current credit worthiness 
we continuously monitor collections from our customers and maintain a provision for estimated credit losses based upon our historical experience and any specific customer collection issues that we have identified 
while such credit losses have historically been within our expectations and the provisions established  we cannot guarantee that we will continue to experience the same credit loss rates in the future 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
our allowance for doubtful accounts was million  million and million in fiscal  and  respectively 
the decrease in the reserve in fiscal was primarily attributable to our write off of reserves and accounts receivable related to financed sales in latin america 
revenue recognition revenue 
we recognize product revenue upon shipment  provided that there is persuasive evidence of an arrangement  there are no uncertainties regarding acceptance  the sales price is fixed or determinable and collection of the resulting receivable is probable 
generally  our product arrangements are multiple element arrangements  including services such as installation and training 
beginning in the fourth quarter of fiscal  we must account for these arrangements in accordance with eitf  accounting for revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables 
based on the terms and conditions of the product arrangements  we have concluded that these services can be accounted for separately from the product element as our product has value to our customers on a stand alone basis and we have objective and reliable evidence of the fair value of such services 
accordingly  service revenue representing the fair value of services not yet performed at the time of product shipment will be deferred and recognized as such services are performed 
the residual revenue under the product arrangement will be recognized as product revenue upon shipment 
we adopted eitf as a cumulative effective of a change in accounting principle in accordance with apb  accounting changes 
in connection with the adoption of etif  we reclassified million and million of product revenue to service revenue for the years ended september  and september   respectively 
we recognize product revenue upon the completion of installation for shipments that require more than perfunctory obligations at the time of shipment  specifically for our digital imaging systems 
a provision is made at that time for estimated warranty costs to be incurred 

table of contents service and other revenues  which primarily includes maintenance contracts  replacement parts  non warranty repair services  installation and training services  and fee per scan revenue are recognized ratably over the contract period for maintenance contracts  at the time of shipment for replacement parts  as the service is rendered for repair  installation and training services and as the fees are collected for fee per scan revenue 
product warranties 
products sold are generally covered by a warranty for a period of one year 
we accrue a warranty reserve at the time of revenue recognition for estimated costs to provide warranty services 
our estimate of costs to service our warranty obligations is based on historical experience and expectation of future conditions 
to the extent we experience increased or decreased warranty claim activity or increased or decreased costs associated with servicing those claims  our warranty accrual will increase or decrease  respectively  resulting in decreased or increased gross profit 
our warranty accrual was approximately million  million and million in fiscal  and  respectively 
the decrease in this accrual over the past three fiscal years is directly attributable to our decision to eliminate the unprofitable conventional general radiography product lines which had warranty periods of up to five years 
partially offsetting this decrease in fiscal is an increase in our warranty accrual for our increase in our digital systems revenues 
income taxes we account for income taxes under sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes 
this statement requires that we recognize a current tax liability or asset for current taxes payable or refundable and a deferred tax liability or asset for the estimated future tax effects of temporary differences and carryforwards to the extent they are realizable 
we record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
while we have considered future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for the valuation allowance  in the event we were to determine that we would be able to realize our deferred tax assets in the future in excess of the net recorded amount  an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would increase income in the period such determination was made 
likewise  should we determine that we would not be able to realize all or part of our net deferred tax asset in the future  an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would be charged to income in the period such determination was made 
during fiscal we recorded an increase in our valuation allowance against a portion of our remaining net deferred tax asset 
the valuation allowance primarily relates to net operating losses generated in fiscal and for which we can only realize a benefit through the generation of future taxable income and to certain deferred tax assets in foreign jurisdictions  for which realization is uncertain 
our net deferred tax asset is currently million and we believe it will be fully realized in the next months 
we do not provide for us income taxes on earnings of our subsidiaries outside of the us our intention is to reinvest these earnings permanently or to repatriate the earnings only when tax effective to do so 
it is not practical to estimate the amount of additional taxes that might be payable upon repatriation of foreign earnings  however  we believe that us foreign tax credits would largely eliminate any us taxes or offset any foreign withholding taxes 
legal contingencies we are currently involved in certain legal proceedings 
in connection with these legal proceedings  which we discuss in note to our consolidated financial statements  management periodically reviews estimates of potential costs to be incurred by us in connection with the adjudication or settlement  if any  of these proceedings 
these estimates are developed in consultation with outside counsel and are based on an analysis of potential litigation outcomes and settlement strategies 
in accordance with fasb statement no 
 accounting for contingencies  loss contingencies are accrued if  in the opinion of management  an adverse outcome is probable and such outcome can be reasonably estimated 
we do not believe that these 
table of contents proceedings will have a material adverse effect on our financial position  however  it is possible that future results for any particular quarter or annual period may be materially affected by changes in our assumptions or the effectiveness of our strategies relating to these proceedings 
lease accounting in september  we completed a sale leaseback of our bedford  massachusetts and danbury  connecticut facilities  resulting in a loss of  which is included in interest other expense in our consolidated financial statements 
under the terms of the sale leaseback  we entered into a year operating lease for two facilities requiring annual rent payments of million 
in applying the provisions of sfas no 
 lease accounting  certain judgments in estimates must be made to determine if the agreement should be accounted for as a capital or operating lease 
most significant is the determination of our incremental borrowing rate in calculating the present value of minimum lease payments in the event the rate implicit in the lease is unknown 
in order for a lease agreement to be accounted as an operating lease the present value of the minimum lease payments may not be greater than of the fair value of the leased asset 
in determining our incremental borrowing rate we considered  among other things  quotes obtained from several lenders assuming we were financing a purchase of the facility 
we used an incremental borrowing rate of which we believe to be conservative compared to the range of rates quoted by several lenders 
overview we are engaged in the development  manufacture and distribution of proprietary x ray  digital x ray and other medical imaging systems 
our businesses are reported as five segments osteoporosis assessment  mammography  digital imaging  mini c arm imaging  and conventional general radiography 
our osteoporosis assessment products primarily consist of dual energy x ray bone densitometry systems and  to a lesser extent  an ultrasound based osteoporosis assessment product 
bone densitometry is the precise measurement of bone density to assist in the diagnosis and monitoring of osteoporosis and other metabolic bone diseases that can lead to debilitating bone fractures 
our mammography products include a broad product line of breast imaging products  including film based and digital mammography systems and breast biopsy systems 
our digital imaging products include general radiographic systems and a digital component for original equipment manufacturers to incorporate into their own equipment 
our mini c arm products are low intensity  real time mini c arm x ray systems used primarily for minimally invasive surgery on a patient s extremities 
in january  we closed the manufacturing facility for the conventional general radiography products  however  we continue to service and support most of these product lines 
acquisitions  recent developments and restructuring and relocation charges trex medical acquisition 
on september   we acquired the us business assets of trex medical in exchange for approximately million in cash and a note in the amount of million 
the cash portion of the purchase price was subject to adjustment based upon the working capital of trex medical as of the closing 
following the acquisition  we disagreed with trex medical s calculation of its working capital as reflected on its closing balance sheet 
in accordance with the dispute resolution procedures set forth in the purchase agreement  we and thermo electron corporation  sole shareholder of trex medical  jointly sought the assistance of an independent arbitrator to determine the closing working capital 
in june  the independent arbitrator determined that adjustments of approximately million  in addition to  of adjustments agreed to by thermo electron corporation before submission to arbitration  were required to the closing balance sheet submitted by trex medical 
this resulted in a payment of approximately  to us as an adjustment to the cash portion of the purchase price 
in addition  in november  we finalized the plan to close the conventional general radiography manufacturing facility located in littleton  massachusetts that we had acquired as part of the trex medical 
table of contents acquisition 
in connection with the closure of the littleton facility  we eliminated approximately employment positions and incurred a restructuring charge  primarily related to severance costs  of approximately million  in fiscal also  as a result of the arbitration settlement  we evaluated the components of the million of adjustments and determined that approximately million of reserves and accruals provided for through charges to earnings in the fourth quarter of fiscal should be recorded in our allocation of the purchase price for this acquisition 
included in our results for the twelve month period ended september  are expense reductions totaling million related to the purchase price reallocation as follows million cost of product sales reduction for warranty accrual and for performance upgrades on prior sales   selling expense reduction for accrued sales commissions  and  general and administrative expense reduction for various expense accruals and bad debt expense 
fleet business credit  llc litigation settlement 
in august  we settled our dispute with fleet business credit  llc fleet relating to our strategic alliance program under which fleet  formerly sanwa business credit corp  acquired our bone densitometry systems to lease to physicians on a fee per scan basis throughout the united states 
under the settlement agreement  the parties dismissed their claims and entered mutual releases 
in addition  we paid fleet million in cash and executed a million unsecured note payable 
the note bears interest at fleet s prime rate plus with the full amount of principal to be paid on august  we further agreed to continue to assist fleet in remarketing returned systems  as requested by fleet  based on separately negotiated market rate terms on a prepaid basis 
we also continue to be entitled to benefit from excess lease and other payments made to fleet under the program  which will offset amounts due under the note payable 
under the terms of the original agreement with fleet s predecessor  sanwa  we were contingently liable for a certain amount per system sold under the agreement 
we recorded the amount for which we were contingently liable as deferred revenue 
based on the settlement  we reduced deferred revenue for the million cash payment and reflected million as a long term note payable in our consolidated balance sheet as of september  we have also recognized as revenue the remaining deferred revenue amounts of million 
in addition  we reversed  of related warranty reserves  which were no longer necessary as a result of the settlement  through a reduction of cost of product sales  for a total positive impact on earnings relating to the fleet settlement of approximately million 
restructuring and relocation charges 
in addition to the adjustments and charges described above  our results for the year ended september  include the following restructuring and relocation charges on august  we announced a restructuring plan focusing primarily on a company wide cost savings initiative which includes a planned reduction of the workforce by  or approximately eighty employees  and otherwise trimming operating expenses in each of our business units 
as a result of the plan  we incurred a restructuring charge  primarily related to severance costs  of approximately million in fiscal we incurred approximately  of expenses related to the move of the fluoroscan mini c arm product line to the corporate headquarters in bedford  massachusetts including approximately  of moving costs   of severance costs   to vacate the facility and  of other costs 

table of contents for the year ended september  we incurred approximately million of severance costs related to the closing of the conventional general radiography manufacturing facility  closure of our direct sales and service office in paris  france and our continuing efforts to streamline operations 
public offering of common stock 
in december  we sold  shares of our common stock to the public at a price of per share 
we received net proceeds from this offering of approximately million 
sale leaseback transaction 
in september  we completed a sale leaseback transaction for our headquarters and manufacturing facility located in bedford  massachusetts and our lorad manufacturing facility in danbury  connecticut 
the transaction resulted in net proceeds to us of million 
the new lease for these facilities  including the associated land  has a term of years  with four five year renewal terms  which we may exercise at our option 
the basic rent for the facilities is million per year  which is subject to adjustment for increases in the consumer price index 
in addition  we are required to maintain the facilities during the term of the lease and to pay all taxes  insurance  utilities and other costs associated with those facilities  as well as comply with financial covenants 
of the million in net proceeds we received from this transaction  we used million to immediately repay the trex medical million note payable plus accrued interest of million 
the effect of the sale leaseback transaction was to eliminate interest expense with respect to the trex medical note and the related depreciation expense on the buildings  but on a going forward basis to increase operating expenses as a result of the lease payments 
under the lease  we make customary representations and warranties and agree to certain financial covenants and indemnities 
in the event we default on the lease  the landlord may terminate the lease  accelerate payments and collect liquidated damages 
at september  we were in compliance with the covenants contained in the lease 

table of contents results of operations the following table sets forth  for the periods indicated  the percentage of total revenues represented by items as shown in our consolidated statements of operations 
fiscal years ended september  september  september  revenues product sales service and other revenue cost and expenses cost of product sales cost of service and other revenue research and development selling and marketing general and administrative restructuring income loss from operations interest income interest other expense income loss before income taxes and cumulative effect of accounting change provision benefit for income taxes income loss before cumulative effect of accounting change cumulative effect of accounting change net income loss fiscal year ended september  compared to fiscal year ended september total revenues 
total revenues increased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal this increase was primarily due to increased mammography and osteoporosis assessment product sales and  to a lesser extent  increased service revenues 
partially offsetting these increases was a decrease in our conventional general radiography product revenues due to our phase out of this unprofitable product line during fiscal  and slightly lower mini c arm sales 
product sales 
product sales increased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal product sales in our mammography business increased approximately to million in fiscal from million in fiscal this increase was primarily due to increasing sales of selenia  our full field digital mammography system introduced in the fourth quarter of fiscal  an increase in the number of multicare stereotactic tables sold and  to a lesser extent  higher average selling prices of the miv analog mammography product line 
these increases were partially offset by fewer analog systems sold primarily in the united states 
osteoporosis assessment product sales increased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal this increase was primarily due to an increase in the number of systems sold internationally and  to a lesser extent  to the initial shipments of our new discovery line of bone densitometers at higher average selling prices 

table of contents digital imaging product sales increased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal this increase was primarily due to an increase in the average selling prices of digital plates sold resulting in higher revenues on fewer plates sold and an increase in the number of general radiography digital systems 
for both digital plates and digital systems there was a sharp increase in international sales offset by a decline in sales in the united states 
at the beginning of fiscal we started to move away from selling our own general radiography digital x ray systems in competition with our oem partners in general digital radiography  and began to shift these resources to our core women s health products mammography and osteoporosis assessment systems while selling our directray detectors to oem s for incorporation in their own line of digital radiography systems 
mini c arm product sales decreased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal this decrease was primarily due to lower average selling prices in the united states and a decrease in the number of systems sold internationally 
conventional general radiography product sales decreased to  in fiscal from million in fiscal this decreases was due to our decision to phase out our unprofitable conventional general radiography product line  which was completed in fiscal in fiscal  approximately of product sales were generated in the united states  in europe and in other international markets 
in fiscal  approximately of product sales were generated in the united states  in europe and in other international markets 
service and other revenue 
service and other revenue increased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal this increase was primarily due to increased service revenues primarily in our mammography business as a result of our assuming service responsibilities previously performed by a former distributor and increased service contract revenues in our osteoporosis assessment and digital imaging businesses 
partially offsetting these increases was a decrease in other revenue from the licensing of certain mammography patented technology and additional fee per scan revenues as compared to fiscal in the second quarter of fiscal  we terminated an independent dealer who represented almost one half of the us market for our mammography products in fiscal and assumed full sales and service responsibility in these geographic locations on a direct basis 
to provide the necessary sales coverage and service support we hired sales and service personnel 
we expect the added costs of the new service personnel to be offset by higher margins for direct sales  as compared to sales generated from a distributor 
these higher personnel costs will also be offset by future service revenues from service contracts and billings on new sales and also from existing users of lorad mammography equipment over time if we are successful in capturing that business 
cost of product sales 
the cost of product sales decreased as a percentage of product sales to in fiscal from in fiscal these costs decreased as a percentage of product sales primarily due to improved gross margins recognized on the mammography and osteoporosis assessment products as a result of the increase in revenues  as well as lower manufacturing costs on the mini c arm products and the elimination of our unprofitable conventional general radiography product line in the third quarter of fiscal the increased volume has improved the absorption of manufacturing overhead at our manufacturing facilities for those products 
our drc subsidiary continues to have significant fixed manufacturing costs and is operating significantly below manufacturing capacity 
costs of service and other revenue 
cost of service and other revenue increased as a percentage of service and other revenue to in fiscal from in fiscal these costs increased as a percentage of service and other revenue primarily due to additional personnel and other costs in our field service area to expand our united states service capabilities for our digital mammography and general radiography systems and to assume direct coverage of territories previously assigned to distributors  as well as to lower levels of other revenue 
we expect our costs of service and other revenue to remain relatively high as a percentage of service and other revenue  reflecting our need to hire the required personnel for warranty 
table of contents and installation service in advance of entering into service agreements in connection with our transition to digital mammography and direct service coverage 
research and development expenses 
research and development expenses decreased to million  of total revenues  in fiscal from million  of total revenues  in fiscal the decrease was primarily due to a decrease in research and development spending and personnel primarily related to reduced spending on digital detectors at drc  our phase out of the conventional general radiography product line in fiscal and reduced spending related to our mammography business 
these decreases were partially offset by increased spending related to our general radiography digital imaging systems 
approximately million and million of the total of these expenses related to the development of digital mammography and digital general radiography systems and detectors at drc in fiscal and  respectively 
selling and marketing expenses 
selling and marketing expenses increased to million  of total revenues  in fiscal from million  of total revenues  in fiscal the increase was primarily due to additional personnel and other costs incurred to expand our united statues coverage of territories previously assigned to distributors  and to a lesser extent  higher trade show expenses in fiscal compared to general and administrative expenses 
general and administrative expenses increased to million  of total revenues  in fiscal from million  of total revenues  in fiscal the increase was primarily due to additional personnel  increased employee benefit expenses and expenses related to the implementation of our integrated enterprise wide software application 
restructuring costs 
restructuring costs in the first and second quarters of fiscal were primarily the result of our continuing efforts to streamline operations and eliminate unprofitable product lines 
in the second quarter of fiscal  we incurred severance costs of approximately  in connection with the reduction of our workforce in the united states and europe by persons across all functional areas 
in the first quarter of fiscal  we incurred a restructuring charge of approximately  primarily comprised of severance costs related to the termination of employees at the littleton facility 
in addition  we incurred severance cost of approximately  and  in connection with the closure of our direct sales and service office in paris  france and the continued reduction of lorad s workforce  respectively 
the severance charges related to the workforce reductions of persons in france and persons at lorad and were across all functional areas 
interest income 
interest income increased to  in fiscal from  in fiscal primarily due to interest income related to the note receivable from an officer and  to a lesser extent  additional interest collected from latin american financed sales 
interest other expense 
in fiscal and  we incurred interest and other expense of approximately  and million  respectively 
in fiscal  these expenses were primarily due to the interest costs on the wells fargo foothill  inc note payable 
in fiscal  these expenses included interest costs of approximately  per quarter on the million note payable issued in connection with the trex medical acquisition  and to a lesser extent  interest costs on the wells fargo foothill  inc note payable  foreign currency transaction losses and interest costs on a bank line of credit used by our european subsidiaries to borrow funds in their local currencies to pay for intercompany sales  thereby reducing the foreign currency exposure on those transactions 
in september  we paid off the note payable to trex medical with the proceeds from the sale leaseback transaction of two of our facilities 
to the extent that foreign currency exchange rates fluctuate in the future  we may be exposed to continued financial risk 
although we have established a borrowing line of credit denominated in the foreign currency  the euro  in which our subsidiaries currently conduct business to minimize this risk  we cannot assure that we will be successful or can fully hedge our outstanding exposure 

table of contents provision benefit for income taxes 
we have provided for certain minimum taxes where net operating losses cannot be used in the current fiscal year 
in fiscal we had a benefit for income taxes of  as a result of a million tax benefit recorded in the second quarter of fiscal  partially offset by a million tax provision recorded in the fourth quarter of fiscal to reduce our deferred tax asset to million that we believe will be fully realizable in the next to months 
during fiscal  as a result of the economic stimulus bill signed into law in march  we filed carryback claims of approximately million 
of this amount  we have received million in cash  and million which we expect to receive in fiscal is included in other current assets in the accompanying balance sheet at september  fiscal year ended september  compared to fiscal year ended september total revenues 
total revenues increased to million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal the increase in revenues was primarily due to an increase in unit sales of our mammography products  digital imaging products and to a lesser extent  mini c arm products 
partially offsetting these increases was a decrease in revenues from our conventional general radiography business  and to a lesser extent  a decrease in the number of sahara ultrasound units sold primarily in the united states 
we completed the phase out of the unprofitable conventional general radiography product line during the third quarter of fiscal product sales 
product sales in our mammography business increased approximately to million in fiscal from million in fiscal this increase was primarily due to an increase in the number of mammography systems sold in the united states partially offset by fewer mammography systems sold internationally 
digital imaging product sales increased to million in fiscal compared to revenues of million in fiscal this increase was primarily due to an increase in the number of digital systems sold and  to a lesser extent  an increase in the number of digital plates sold 
mini c arm product sales increased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal this increase was primarily due to an increase in the number of premier systems sold in the united states 
osteoporosis assessment product sales decreased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal these revenues decreased primarily due to a decrease in the number of sahara ultrasound systems sold in the united states 
conventional general radiography product sales decreased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal this decrease was primarily due to our decision to phase out our unprofitable conventional general radiography product line during fiscal in fiscal  approximately of product sales were generated in the united states  in europe and in other international markets 
in fiscal  approximately of product sales were generated in the united states  in europe and in other international markets 
service and other revenue 
service and other revenue increased slightly to million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal the increase in service and other revenue in fiscal was primarily the result of increased installation and training revenues due to an increase in the number of systems sold that require these services and revenue from the licensing of certain digital imaging software and mammography patented technology in fiscal partially offsetting these increases was the million recognized in fiscal in connection with the settlement of the fleet litigation and from a reduction in sales of mammography product options in fiscal 
table of contents costs of product sales 
the cost of product sales decreased as a percentage of product sales to in fiscal from in fiscal fiscal cost of product sales includes a million reduction of expenses  approximately of product sales  related to the final purchase price adjustment of the trex medical acquisition 
our costs of product sales decreased as a percentage of product sales primarily due to improved gross margins recognized on the mammography and digital imaging products as a result of a significant increase in revenues and cost savings initiatives enacted in the summer of the increased volume has improved the absorption of manufacturing overhead at both facilities 
drc continues to have significant fixed manufacturing costs and is operating significantly below manufacturing capacity 
however  margins on these products were positive for the last three quarters of fiscal compared to negative margins for prior periods 
our gross margins also improved as a result of the decrease in sales of conventional general radiography products which have had significantly lower margins 
costs of service and other revenue 
cost of service and other revenue  as a percentage of service and other revenue  was in fiscal and fiscal in fiscal improved margins resulting from our closure of the conventional general radiography facility were offset by a  reduction in expenses in related to the fleet litigation settlement and additional personnel and other costs in in our field service area for our other business segments due to the increase in the number of systems in our installed base 
research and development expenses 
research and development expenses decreased to million  of total revenues  in fiscal from million  of total revenues  in fiscal this decrease was primarily due to a decrease in research and development spending and personnel primarily related to our cost saving initiatives enacted in the summer of in addition  approximately million and million of these expenses in fiscal and  respectively  related to the development of new digital mammography and general radiography systems detectors at drc

restructuring costs in fiscal of approximately million were primarily the result of our continuing efforts to streamline operations and eliminate unprofitable product lines 
we incurred a restructuring charge of approximately  in the first quarter of fiscal primarily comprised of severance costs related to the termination of employees at the littleton facility 
in addition  we incurred severance cost of approximately  and  in connection with the closure of our direct sales and service office in paris  france and the continued reduction of lorad s workforce  respectively 
the severance charges related to the workforce reductions of persons in france and persons at lorad and were across all functional areas 
in the second quarter of fiscal  we incurred additional severance costs of approximately  primarily comprised of severance costs in connection with the reduction of our workforce in the united states and europe by persons across all functional areas 
restructuring and relocation costs of approximately million in fiscal were primarily the result of our ongoing efforts to streamline operations 
specifically in fiscal  as a result of a reduction in our workforce  we incurred restructuring charges of approximately million  primarily related to severance related expenses 
also in fiscal  we moved our fluoroscan operations from a facility in 
table of contents northbrook  illinois to our corporate headquarters in bedford  massachusetts 
we incurred approximately  of expenses in connection with this move 
interest income

although we have established a borrowing line of credit denominated in the foreign currency  the euro  in which our subsidiaries currently conduct business to minimize this risk  we cannot assure that we will be successful or can fully hedge our outstanding exposure 
provision benefit for income taxes 
in fiscal we had a benefit for income taxes of  as a result of the economic stimulus bill signed into law in that year 
in fiscal  we recorded a tax provision for minimum state taxes as we believed that it was prudent at the time not to benefit net operating losses that would only be realized by generating sufficient future taxable income 
segment results of operations our businesses are reported as five segments osteoporosis assessment  mammography  digital imaging  mini c arm imaging  and general radiography 
the accounting policies of the segments are the same as those described in the footnotes to the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
we measure segment performance based on total revenues and operating income or loss 
revenues from each of these segments are described above 
the discussion that follows is a summary analysis of the primary changes in operating income or loss by segment 
osteoporosis assessment 
reported operating income for the osteoporosis assessment business segment was million for fiscal compared to million in fiscal the improvement in operating income for this business segment for fiscal was primarily due to an increase in service and other revenue gross profits as a result of higher service revenues together with lower costs and to a lesser extent  improved gross profits from an increase in product sales 
these increased gross profits were partially offset by increased general and administrative costs 
mammography 
reported operating income for the mammography segment was million in fiscal and was million in fiscal improvements in operating income in the current year were primarily due to increased product revenues and improved product gross margin and  to a lesser extent  a decrease in restructuring costs incurred in fiscal these improvements were offset by additional personnel and other costs in the field service and sales areas to expand our united states service capabilities for our digital mammography products and to assume direct coverage of territories previously assigned to distributors and  to a lesser extent  increased marketing costs related to our major trade show 
digital imaging 
the digital imaging business operating loss increased to million in fiscal from million for fiscal this increase was primarily due to a reduction in both gross profit and gross margins related to an increase in manufacturing costs of the digital detectors due to vendor quality problems  increased personnel and other costs in cost of service and selling expenses to provide direct service and sales coverage for our digital radiography products  increased tradeshow expenses and an increase in 
table of contents general and administrative expenses 
at the beginning of fiscal we started to move away from selling our own general digital x ray systems in competition with our oem partners in general digital radiography  and to focus on selling our directray detectors to oem s for incorporation in their own line of digital radiography systems 
mini c arm imaging 
the mini c arm business segment reported operating income of million for fiscal compared to operating income of million for fiscal this decrease was primarily attributable to higher field service personnel costs and  to a lesser extent  higher operating expenses partially offset by improved gross profits from reduced manufacturing costs 
general radiography 
as previously discussed  we have closed the manufacturing facility of the hologic systems division and relocated certain of its product lines and sales and service support personnel to our corporate headquarters 
our revenue in this business segment in the current fiscal year is primarily from our ongoing service business 
this business segment reported operating income of  for fiscal compared to an operating loss of million for the same period last year 
these improvements are primarily due to our phasing out the unprofitable product sales and related operating expenses from this business during fiscal liquidity and capital resources at september  we had approximately million of working capital 
at that date our cash and cash equivalents totaled million 
our cash and cash equivalents balance decreased slightly during fiscal primarily due to the use of cash for purchases of property and equipment substantially offset by cash provided by operating and financing activities 
our cash provided by operating activities was million which included net income of million for fiscal increased by non cash charges for depreciation and amortization of an aggregate of million 
cash used in operations due to changes in our current assets and liabilities included an increase in inventory of million  an increase in accounts receivable of million and a decrease in accrued expenses of million 
these uses of cash were partially offset by a decrease in prepaid expenses and other current assets of million 
the increase in inventory was primarily due to the build up of digital mammography systems 
the increase in accounts receivable was primarily due to the increased european revenue in the last six months of fiscal compared to the same period of fiscal the european sales generally have longer payment terms than domestic sales 
the decrease in accrued expenses was primarily due to the timing of payments 
the decrease in prepaid expenses was primarily due to the receipt of income tax refunds 
in fiscal  we used approximately million of cash in investing activities 
this use of cash was primarily attributable to purchases of property and equipment of million  which consisted primarily of corporate wide computer information software and hardware systems and other equipment and building improvements 
in fiscal  financing activities provided us with million of cash 
these cash flows included approximately million from the exercise of stock options partially offset by  of repayments of our term loan with wells fargo foothill  inc as of september  we had short term borrowings  including the current portion of our long term obligations  of  and long term notes payable totaling million 
the short term borrowings represent the current portion of our long term notes payable 
the long term notes payable consisted primarily of the  borrowed from wells fargo foothill  inc as the long term portion of our term loan under our credit facility  and the  balance due on the note to fleet in connection with the settlement of the fleet litigation 

table of contents we maintain an unsecured line of credit with a european bank for the equivalent of million  which bears interest at the europe interbank offered rate at september  plus 
the borrowings under this line are primarily used by our european subsidiaries to settle intercompany sales and are denominated in the respective local currencies of its european subsidiaries 
the line of credit may be canceled by the bank with days notice 
at september   there were no outstanding borrowings under this line 
in september we obtained a secured loan from wells fargo foothill  inc the loan agreement with wells fargo foothill  inc provides for a term loan of approximately million  which we borrowed at signing  and a revolving line of credit facility 
the maximum amount we can borrow under the loan agreement and amendments is million 
the loan agreement and amendments contain financial and other covenants and the actual amount which we can borrow under the line of credit at any time is based upon a formula tied to the amount of our qualifying accounts receivable 
in july we amended this loan agreement primarily to simplify financial covenants and to reduce the fees related to this facility 
the term loan accrues interest at prime plus for five years 
the line of credit advances accrue interest at prime plus 
the line of credit expires in september we were in compliance with all covenants as of september  in april  we began an implementation project for an integrated enterprise wide software application 
we began operational use of this software application at the bedford  ma and newark  de facilities on november   at the danbury  ct facility on february  and at the brussels  belgium location on october  through september  we have made payments totaling million for hardware  software and consulting services representing substantially all of our capital commitments related to this implementation project 
most of the cost has been capitalized and we began to amortize these costs over their expected useful lives in december in september  we completed a sale leaseback transaction for our headquarters and manufacturing facility located in bedford  massachusetts and our lorad manufacturing facility in danbury  connecticut 
the transaction resulted in net proceeds to us of million 
the new lease for these facilities  including the associated land  has a term of years  with four five year year renewal terms  which we may exercise at our option 
the basic rent for the facilities is million per year  which is subject to adjustment for increases in the consumer price index 
the aggregate total minimum lease payments during the initial year term are million 
in addition  we are required to maintain the facilities during the term of the lease and to pay all taxes  insurance  utilities and other costs associated with those facilities 
under the lease  we make customary representations and warranties and agree to certain financial covenants and indemnities 
in the event we default on the lease  the landlord may terminate the lease  accelerate payments and collect liquidated damages 
the following table summarizes our contractual obligations and commitments as of september  payments due by period in thousands contractual obligations total less than year years years thereafter long term debt operating leases total contractual cash obligations 
table of contents except as set forth above  we do not have any other significant capital commitments 
we are working on several projects  with an emphasis on direct radiography plates 
we believe that we have sufficient funds in order to fund our expected operations over the next twelve months

fin  consolidation of variable interest entities  to expand upon and strengthen accounting guidance that addresses when a company should include in its financial statements the assets  liabilities  and activities of another entity 
until now  a company generally has included another entity in its consolidated financial statements only if it controlled the entity through voting interests 
fin changes that guidance by requiring a variable interest entity  as defined  to be consolidated by a company if that company bears the majority of the risk of loss from the variable interest entity s activities  is entitled to receive a majority of the variable interest entity s residual returns or both 
fin also requires disclosure about the variable interest entities that a company is not required to consolidate but in which it has a significant variable interest 
the consolidation requirements of fin apply immediately to variable interest entities created after january  and to older entities in the first fiscal year or interim period beginning after june  certain of the disclosure requirements apply in all financial statements issued after january   regardless of when the variable interest entity was established 
we do not believe that we are the primary beneficiary of any variable interest entities

the cautionary statements made in this report should be read as applicable to all forward looking statements wherever they appear in this report 
our actual results could differ materially from those discussed herein 
factors that could cause or contribute to such differences include those discussed below  as well as those discussed elsewhere in this report 
we continue to incur significant losses in our digital imaging business segment and cannot assure that the segment will become profitable 
our digital imaging business segment incurred net losses of million in fiscal  million in fiscal and million in fiscal at the beginning of fiscal we started to move away from selling our own general digital x ray systems in competition with our oem partners in general digital radiography  and to focus on selling our directray detectors to oem s for incorporation in their own line of digital radiography systems 
notwithstanding this shift in focus  we cannot assure that the operating results of our digital imaging segment will improve 
the markets for our direct radiography products are in the early stage of development 
in  our subsidiary  direct radiography corp  was the first company to introduce direct to digital x ray imaging products in the united states 
the markets for these products are relatively new 
there is a significant installed base of conventional x ray imaging products in hospitals and radiological practices 
the use of our direct to digital x ray imaging products  including digital mammography products  in many cases would require these potential customers to either modify or replace their existing x ray imaging equipment 
moreover  we believe that a major factor in the market s acceptance of direct to digital x ray technology is the trend toward transition by the healthcare industry from conventional film archiving systems to hospital picture  archive and communication systems  known as pacs  to store x ray images electronically 
because the benefits of our direct to digital technology may not be fully realized by customers until they install a pacs platform  a large potential market for these products may not develop until pacs environments are more widely used 
because of the early stage of the markets for these products  it is likely that our evaluation of the potential markets for these products will materially vary with time 
we cannot assure that the markets for our direct radiography products will continue to develop 
if we fail to achieve and maintain the high manufacturing standards that our direct radiography products require  we will not be successful in developing and marketing those products 
the manufacture of our direct radiography detectors is highly complex and requires precise high quality manufacturing that is difficult to achieve 
we have in the past and may in the future experience difficulties in manufacturing these detectors in commercial quantities  primarily related to delays and difficulties in obtaining critical components for these detectors that meet our high manufacturing standards 
our initial difficulties have led to increased delivery lead times and increased costs of manufacturing these products 
our failure  including the failure of our contract manufacturers  to achieve and maintain the required high manufacturing standards could result in further delays or failures in product testing or delivery  cost overruns  product recalls or withdrawals  or other problems that could harm our business and prospects 
our success depends on new product development 
we have a continuing research and development program designed to develop new products and to enhance and improve our products 
we are expending significant resources on the development of digital x ray 
table of contents imaging products  including a digital mammography product 
the successful development of our products and product enhancements are subject to numerous risks  both known and unknown  including unanticipated delays  access to capital  budget overruns  technical problems  and other difficulties that could result in the abandonment or substantial change in the design  development and commercialization of these new products  including  for example  changes requested by the fda in connection with pre market approval applications for our products or k notification 
given the uncertainties inherent with product development and introduction  we cannot assure that any of our product development efforts will be successful on a timely basis or within budget  if at all 
our failure to develop new products and product enhancements on a timely basis or within budget could harm our business and prospects 
our business could be harmed if our products contain undetected errors or defects or do not meet customer specifications 
we are continuously developing new products and improving our existing products 
newly introduced products can contain undetected errors or defects 
in addition  these products may not meet their performance specifications under all conditions or for all applications 
if  despite our internal testing and testing by our customers  any of our products contains errors or defects or any of our products fails to meet customer specifications  then we may be required to enhance or improve those products or technologies 
we may not be able to do so on a timely basis  if at all  and may only be able to do so at considerable expense 
in addition  any significant reliability problems could result in adverse customer reaction  negative publicity or legal claims and could harm our business and prospects 
our reliance on one or only a limited number of suppliers for some key components or subassemblies for our products could harm our business and prospects 
we rely on one or only a limited number of suppliers for some key components or subassemblies for our products 
in particular we have only one source of supply for each of the panel and the coating of that panel for our direct radiography products 
we are seeking to qualify a second supplier for the panel coating to increase our manufacturing capacity and flexibility  but cannot assure that we will be successful 
in addition  we have only limited sources of supply for some key components used in our mini c arm systems 
obtaining alternative sources of supply of these components could involve significant delays and other costs  and may not be available to us on reasonable terms  if at all 
the failure of a component supplier or contract assembler to provide acceptable quality and timely components or assembly service at an acceptable price  or an interruption of supplies from such a supplier could harm our business and prospects 
any disruption of supplies of key components could delay or reduce shipments  which could result in lost or deferred sales 
we have recently expanded our direct sales and service efforts of our products into territories that were previously covered by independent distributors  are considering further expanding our direct sales and service coverage in the united states  and cannot assure that we can effect any such transition effectively 
sales of our products may fluctuate if our sales force is unable to successfully market and sell a broader product offering 
we have sold and serviced a majority of our mammography systems in the united states primarily through a network of independent distributors and to a lesser extent  through our direct sales force 
during 
table of contents fiscal  we expanded our direct sales and service efforts for mammography into territories that were previously covered by independent distributors  and are considering further expanding our direct sales and service coverage in the united states 
we have also expanded the product offerings sold by our direct sales force to include our entire product line 
the transition to a direct sales and service force with a more diversified product offering could adversely affect our relationships with our end user customers and sales of our products  if we are unable to manage the transition effectively or our direct sales force is otherwise unable to successfully market and sell a broader product offering 
our reliance on a customer for a significant portion of our revenues could harm our business and prospects 
our largest independent distributor  pss world medical  owed us a total of approximately million as of september  and accounted for approximately of our product sales for fiscal we do not have a long term agreement with pss world medical obligating them to purchase products from us  or restricting them from purchasing products from our competitors 
a reduction or delay in orders from pss world medical  or a delay or default in the payment of their accounts receivable  including in connection with the expansion of our direct sales and service force  could harm our business and prospects 
if we are unable to satisfy our financial covenants under our loan agreement and our long term leases for our headquarters and lorad facilities  our loan availability may be limited or the rent due under those leases may be accelerated and we could be required to pay liquidated damages 
our loan agreement with wells fargo foothill  inc formerly foothill capital corporation and our long term leases contain financial and other covenants 
if we do not comply with our covenants under our loan agreement  our availability under our loan agreement could be reduced or our lender could declare a default 
if we do not comply with our covenants under our long term leases  the remaining rent payable under those leases could be accelerated and we could be required to pay liquidated damages 
our failure to meet any of our covenants under our loan agreement or long term leases could significantly harm our liquidity and financial position 
we may not be able to compete successfully 
a number of companies have developed  or are expected to develop  products that compete or will compete with our products 
many of these competitors offer a range of products in areas other than those in which we compete  which may make such competitors more attractive to hospitals  radiology clients  general purchasing organizations and other potential customers 
in addition  many of our competitors and potential competitors are larger and have greater financial resources than we do and offer a range of products broader than our products 
some of the companies with which we now compete or may compete in the future have or may have more extensive research  marketing and manufacturing capabilities and significantly greater technical and personnel resources than we do  and may be better positioned to continue to improve their technology in order to compete in an evolving industry 
our failure to compete successfully could harm our business and prospects 
the primary competitor for our osteoporosis assessment products is general electric medical systems ge 
our direct to digital imaging products compete with traditional x ray systems as well as indirect conversion systems  such as computed radiography systems  which are less expensive than our products  and other direct to digital systems 
the larger competitors in these markets include ge  siemens  kodak  canon  philips  swissray  fischer imaging and varian 
at the beginning of fiscal  we started to move away from selling our own general digital x ray systems in competition with our oem partners in general digital radiography and focus more on expanding our oem sales for our directray panel 
our mammography systems compete with products offered by ge  siemens  planmed  instrumentarium  fischer imaging and agfa 
our minimally invasive breast biopsy systems compete with products offered by fischer imaging and with conventional surgical biopsy procedures 
our mini c arm products compete 
table of contents directly with mini c arms manufactured and sold by a limited number of companies including ge 
we also compete indirectly with manufacturers of conventional c arm image intensifiers including philips  siemens and ge 
our success depends upon our ability to adapt to rapid changes in technology and customer requirements 
the market for our products has been characterized by rapid technological change  frequent product introductions and evolving customer requirements 
we believe that these trends will continue into the foreseeable future 
our success will depend  in part  upon our ability to enhance our existing products  successfully develop new products that meet increasing customer requirements and gain market acceptance 
if we fail to do so our products may be rendered obsolete or uncompetitive by new industry standards or changing technology 
our failure to manage current or future alliances or joint ventures effectively may harm our business and prospects 
we have entered into strategic alliances with agfa  siemens and r technologies 
we are also exploring other potential alliances  joint ventures or other business relationships 
agfa and siemens compete with us in some of our business segments  and are competitors or potential competitors to some of our customers or potential customers 
our alliance with agfa  siemens or any other person could enhance their business to our detriment or make it more difficult for us to enter into advantageous business transactions or relationships with others 
moreover  we may not be able to identify appropriate candidates for alliances or joint ventures  assure that any alliance or joint venture candidate will provide us with the support anticipated  successfully negotiate an alliance or joint venture on terms that are advantageous to us  or successfully manage any alliance or joint venture 
furthermore  any alliance or joint venture may divert management time and resources 
our entering into a disadvantageous alliance or joint venture or failure to manage an alliance or joint venture effectively could harm our business and prospects 
the uncertainty of healthcare reform could harm our business and prospects 
in recent years  the healthcare industry has undergone significant change driven by various efforts to reduce costs  including efforts at national healthcare reform  trends toward managed care  cuts in medicare  consolidation of healthcare distribution companies and collective purchasing arrangements by office based healthcare practitioners 
healthcare reform proposals and medical cost containment measures in the united states and in many foreign countries could limit the use of our products  reduce reimbursement available for such use  or adversely affect the use of new therapies for which our products may be targeted 
these reforms or cost containment measures  including the uncertainty in the medical community regarding their nature and effect  could harm our business and prospects and make it difficult for us to raise additional capital on advantageous terms  if at all 

table of contents we depend on third party reimbursement to our customers for market acceptance of our products 
failure of third party payors to provide appropriate levels of reimbursement for use of our products could harm our business and prospects 
sales of medical products largely depend on the reimbursement of patients medical expenses by government healthcare programs and private health insurers 
the costs of our products are substantial  and market acceptance of our products depends upon our customers ability to obtain appropriate levels of reimbursement from third party payors for use of our products 
in the united states  the centers for medicare medicaid services  known as cms  establishes guidelines for the reimbursement of healthcare providers treating medicare and medicaid patients 
under current cms guidelines  varying reimbursement levels have been established for bone density assessment  mammography and other imaging and diagnostic procedures performed by our products 
the actual reimbursement amounts are determined by individual state medicare carriers and  for non medicare and medicaid patients  private insurance carriers 
there are often delays between the reimbursement approvals by cms and by a state medicare carrier and private insurance carriers 
moreover  states as well as private insurance carriers may choose not to follow the cms reimbursement guidelines 
the use of our products outside the united states is similarly affected by reimbursement policies adopted by foreign regulatory and insurance carriers 
a reduction or other adverse change in reimbursement policies for the use of our products could harm our business and prospects 
the future growth of our bone densitometry business depends in large part on the continued development and more widespread acceptance of complementary therapies as well as our ability to expand into the primary care market 
our bone densitometers and related products are used to assist physicians in diagnosing patients at risk for osteoporosis and other bone disorders  and to monitor the effectiveness of therapies to treat these disorders 
as a result  the future growth of the market for these products and of this business will in large part be dependent upon the development and more widespread acceptance of drug therapies to prevent and to treat osteoporosis  and in addition  our ability to expand into the primary care market 
over the last several years  the fda has approved a number of drug therapies to treat osteoporosis 
we also understand that a number of other drug therapies are under development 
while sales of our bone densitometry products have benefited from the increased availability and use of these therapies  most patients who are at risk for osteoporosis continue to go untreated 
we cannot assure that any therapies under development or in clinical trials will prove to be effective  obtain regulatory approval  or that any approved therapy will gain wide acceptance 
even if these therapies gain widespread acceptance  we cannot assure that this acceptance will increase the sales of our products 
reductions in revenues could harm our operating results because a high percentage of our operating expenses is relatively fixed 
a high percentage of our operating expenses is relatively fixed 
we likely will not be able to reduce spending to compensate for adverse fluctuations in revenues 
as a result  shortfalls in revenues are likely to harm our operating results 
our results of operations are subject to significant quarterly variation and seasonal fluctuation 
our results of operations have been and may continue to be subject to significant quarterly variation 
the results for a particular quarter may vary due to a number of factors  including the overall state of healthcare and cost containment efforts  the development status and demand for drug therapies to treat osteoporosis  the development status and demand for our direct to digital imaging products  
table of contents economic conditions in our markets  foreign exchange rates  the timing of orders  the timing of expenditures in anticipation of future sales  the mix of products sold by us  the introduction of new products and product enhancements by us or our competitors  and pricing and other competitive conditions 
customers may also cancel or reschedule shipments 
production difficulties could also delay shipments 
any of these factors also could harm our business and prospects 
our delay or inability to obtain any necessary united states or foreign regulatory clearances or approvals for our products could harm our business and prospects 
our products are medical devices that are the subject of a high level of regulatory oversight 
our delay or inability to obtain any necessary united states or foreign regulatory clearances or approvals for our products could harm our business and prospects 
the process of obtaining clearances and approvals can be costly and time consuming 
there is a risk that any approvals or clearances  once obtained  may be withdrawn or modified 
medical devices cannot be marketed in the united states without clearance or approval by the fda 
medical devices sold in the united states must also be manufactured in compliance with fda good manufacturing practices  which regulate the design  manufacture  packing  storage and installation of medical devices 
moreover  medical devices are required to comply with fda regulations relating to investigational research and labeling 
states may also regulate the manufacture  sale and use of medical devices  particularly those that employ x ray technology 
our products are also subject to approval and regulation by foreign regulatory and safety agencies 
fluctuations in the exchange rates of european currencies and the other foreign currencies in which we conduct our business  in relation to the us dollar  have harmed and could continue to harm our business and prospects 
foreign sales accounted for approximately of our product sales in fiscal  of product sales in fiscal and of our product sales in fiscal we maintain a sales and service office in belgium and a support office in france 
the expenses and sales of these offices are denominated in local currencies 
we anticipate that foreign sales and sales denominated in foreign currencies will continue to account for a significant portion of our total sales 
fluctuations in the value of local currencies have caused  and are likely to continue to cause  amounts translated into us dollars to fluctuate in comparison with previous periods 
we have hedged our foreign currency exposure by borrowing funds in local european currencies to pay the expenses of our foreign offices 
there is a risk that these hedging activities will not be successful in mitigating our foreign exchange risk exposure 
we conduct our business worldwide  which exposes us to a number of difficulties in coordinating our international activities and dealing with multiple regulatory environments 
we sell our products to customers throughout the world 
our worldwide business may be harmed by difficulties in staffing and managing operations in multiple locations  
table of contents greater difficulties in trade accounts receivable collection  possible adverse tax consequences  governmental currency controls  changes in various regulatory requirements  political and economic changes and disruptions  export import controls  and tariff regulations 
our business could be harmed if we are unable to protect our proprietary technology 
we rely primarily on a combination of trade secrets  patents  copyright and trademark laws and confidentiality procedures to protect our technology 
despite these precautions  unauthorized third parties may infringe  copy or reverse engineer portions of our technology 
we do not know if current or future patent applications will be issued with the scope of the claims sought  if at all  or whether any patents issued will be challenged or invalidated 
in addition  we have obtained or applied for corresponding patents and patent applications in several foreign countries for some of our patents and patent applications 
there is a risk that these patent applications will not be granted or that the patent or patent application will not provide significant protection for our products and technology 
our competitors may independently develop similar technology that our patents do not cover 
in addition  because patent applications in the united states are not publicly disclosed until the patent is issued  applications may have been filed which relate to our technology 
moreover  there is a risk that foreign intellectual property laws will not protect our intellectual property rights to the same extent as united states intellectual property laws 
in the absence of significant patent protection  we may be vulnerable to competitors who attempt to copy our products  processes or technology 
our business could be harmed if we infringe upon the intellectual property rights of others 
there has been substantial litigation regarding patent and other intellectual property rights in the medical device and related industries 
we have been  and may be in the future  notified that we may be infringing intellectual property rights possessed by third parties 
if any such claims are asserted against our intellectual property rights  we may seek to enter into royalty or licensing arrangements 
there is a risk in these situations that no license will be available or that a license will not be available on reasonable terms 
alternatively  we may decide to litigate such claims or to design around the patented technology 
these actions could be costly and would divert the efforts and attention of our management and technical personnel 
as a result  any infringement claims by third parties or claims for indemnification by customers resulting from infringement claims  whether or not proven to be true  may harm our business and prospects 
our future success will depend on the continued services of our key personnel 
the loss of any of our key personnel  particularly our key research and development personnel  could harm our business and prospects 
our success will also depend upon our ability to attract and retain other qualified managerial and technical personnel 
competition for such personnel  particularly software engineers and other technical personnel  is intense 
we may not be able to attract and retain personnel necessary for the development of our business 
we do not have any key man life insurance for any of our officers or other key personnel 

table of contents there is a risk that our insurance will not be sufficient to protect us from product liability or other claims  or that in the future liability insurance will not be available to us at a reasonable cost  if at all 
our business involves the risk of product liability and other claims inherent to the medical device business 
we maintain product liability insurance subject to deductibles and exclusions 
there is a risk that our insurance will not be sufficient to protect us from product and other liability claims  or that product liability insurance will not be available to us at a reasonable cost  if at all 
an under insured or uninsured claim could harm our operating results or financial condition 
we use hazardous materials and products 
our research and development involves the controlled use of hazardous materials  such as toxic and carcinogenic chemicals and various radioactive compounds 
although we believe that our safety procedures for handling and disposing of such materials comply with the standards prescribed by federal  state and local regulations  we cannot completely eliminate the risk of accidental contamination or injury from these materials 
in the event of this type of accident  we could be held liable for any resulting damages  and any such liability could be extensive 
we are also subject to substantial regulation relating to occupational health and safety  environmental protection  hazardous substance control  and waste management and disposal 
the failure to comply with such regulations could subject us to  among other things  fines and criminal liability 
provisions in our certificate of incorporation and by laws and our stockholder rights plan may have the effect of discouraging advantageous offers for our business or common stock and limit the price that investors might be willing to pay in the future for shares of our common stock 
our certificate of incorporation  by laws and the provisions of delaware corporate law include provisions that may have the effect of discouraging or preventing a change in control 
in addition  we have a stockholder rights plan that may have the effect of discouraging or preventing a change in control 
these provisions could limit the price that our stockholders might receive in the future for shares of our common stock 
our stock price is volatile 
the market price of our common stock has been  and may continue to be  highly volatile 
we believe that a variety of factors could cause the price of our common stock to fluctuate  perhaps substantially  including announcements and rumors of developments related to our business  or the industry in which we compete  quarterly fluctuations in our actual or anticipated operating results and order levels  general conditions in the worldwide economy  announcements of technological innovations  new products or product enhancements by us or our competitors  developments in patents or other intellectual property rights and litigation  and developments in our relationships with our customers and suppliers 
in addition  in recent years the stock market in general and the markets for shares of small capitalization and high tech companies in particular  have experienced extreme price fluctuations which have often been unrelated to the operating performance of affected companies
