we adopted sfas no

critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes 
although these estimates are based on management s knowledge of current events and actions it may undertake in the future  they may ultimately differ from actual results 
we believe that the critical accounting policies described in the following paragraphs affect the most significant estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
for these policies  we caution that future events rarely develop exactly as estimated  and the best estimates routinely require adjustment 
credit risk we sell products to a variety of customers and extend credit based on an evaluation of the customer s financial condition  generally without requiring collateral 
exposure to losses on receivables varies by customer principally due to the financial condition of each customer 
we monitor our exposure to credit losses and maintain allowances for anticipated losses 
impairment of long lived assets all long lived assets  excluding goodwill and intangible assets not subject to amortization  are evaluated for impairment on the basis of undiscounted cash flows whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
an impaired asset is written down to its estimated fair market value based on the best information available 
estimated fair market value is generally measured by discounting future cash flows 
goodwill and intangible assets not subject to amortization are evaluated for impairment annually or sooner in accordance with sfas no 
and an impairment loss is recognized if the carrying amount is greater than its fair value 
income taxes our effective income tax rate and the tax bases of assets and liabilities are based on estimates of taxes which will ultimately be payable 
deferred taxes are recorded to give recognition to temporary differences between the tax bases of assets or liabilities and their reported amounts in the 
table of contents financial statements 
valuation allowances are established when it is deemed  more likely than not  that the benefit of deferred tax assets will not be realized 
insurance programs we maintain self insured and deductible programs for certain liability  medical and workers compensation exposures 
accordingly  we accrue for known claims and estimated incurred but not reported claims not otherwise covered by insurance  based on actuarial assumptions and historical claims experience

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk commodities we purchase various raw materials  including aluminum cans  plastic bottles  high fructose corn syrup  and various juice concentrates  prices of which fluctuate based on commodity market conditions
