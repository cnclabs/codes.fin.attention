recent significant acquisitions divestitures on october   our board of directors approved a plan to integrate the activities of our pgp product group into our other product groups 
in addition to the integration plan  we began to look for a buyer for the pgp desktop encryption and gauntlet firewall product

critical accounting policies in preparing our consolidated financial statements  we make estimates  assumptions and judgments that can have a significant impact on our net revenue  operating income loss and net income loss  as well as on 
table of contents the value of certain assets on our consolidated balance sheet 
the application of our critical accounting policies requires an evaluation of a number of complex criteria and significant accounting judgments by us 
see summary of significant accounting policies beginning on page in the consolidated financial statements for more information about these critical accounting policies  as well as descriptions of other significant accounting policies 
our critical accounting policies are as follows revenue recognition  estimating valuation allowances and accrued liabilities  specifically sales returns and other allowances  the allowance for doubtful accounts  and assessment of the probability of the outcome of our current litigation  accounting for income taxes  valuation of goodwill  valuation of finite lived intangibles and long lived assets  and determining functional currencies for the purposes of consolidating our international operations 
revenue recognition 
we derive our revenue from primarily two sources i product revenue  which includes software license  hardware and royalty revenue  and ii services and support revenue  which includes software license maintenance  training  consulting and on line subscription arrangements revenue 
as described below  significant management judgments and estimates must be made and used in connection with the revenue recognized in any accounting period 
material differences may result in the amount and timing of our revenue for any period if our management made different judgments or utilized different estimates 
we license our software products on a one and two year time basis or on a perpetual basis 
our two year time based licenses include the first year of maintenance and support 
our on line subscription arrangements require customers to pay a fixed fee and receive service over a period of time  generally one or two years 
customers do not pay setup fees 
we apply the provisions of statement of position  software revenue recognition  sop as amended by statement of position modification of sop  software revenue recognition  with respect to certain transactions to all transactions involving the sale of software products and hardware transactions where the software is not incidental 
for hardware transactions where software is not incidental  we do not bifurcate the fee and we do not apply separate accounting guidance to the hardware and software elements 
for hardware transactions where no software is involved  we apply the provisions of staff accounting bulletin revenue recognition sab 
in addition  we apply the provisions of emerging issues task force issue no 
application of aicpa statement of position to arrangements that include the right to use software stored on another entity s hardware to our on line software subscription services 
we recognize revenue from the sale of software licenses when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  the product has been delivered  the fee is fixed or determinable and collection of the resulting receivable is reasonably assured 
delivery generally occurs when product is delivered to a common carrier 
at the time of the transaction  we assess whether the fee associated with our revenue transactions is fixed or determinable and whether or not collection is reasonably assured 
we assess whether the fee is fixed or determinable based on the payment terms associated with the transaction 
if a significant portion of a fee is due after our normal payment terms  which are to days from invoice date  we account for the fee as not being fixed or determinable 
in these cases  we recognize revenue as the fees become due 
we assess collection based on a number of factors  including past transaction history with the customer and the credit worthiness of the customer 
we do not request collateral from our customers 
if we determine that collection of a fee is not reasonably assured  we defer the fee and recognize revenue at the time collection becomes reasonably assured  which is generally upon receipt of cash 

table of contents for all sales  except those completed over the internet  we use either a binding purchase order or signed license agreement as evidence of an arrangement 
for sales over the internet  we use a credit card authorization as evidence of an arrangement 
sales through our distributors are evidenced by a master agreement governing the relationship together with binding purchase orders on a transaction by transaction basis 
for arrangements with multiple obligations for example  undelivered maintenance and support  we allocate revenue to each component of the arrangement using the residual value method based on the fair value of the undelivered elements  which is specific to networks associates 
this means that we defer revenue from the arrangement fee equivalent to the fair value of the undelivered elements 
fair values for the ongoing maintenance and support obligations for both our two year time based licenses and perpetual licenses are based upon separate sales of renewals to other customers or upon renewal rates quoted in the contracts 
this assessment generally includes analyses of the variability of renewal rates by product and region and determination of whether a majority of renewals supports our estimated fair value of the maintenance and support obligations 
in cases where renewal rates are not quoted in the initial sales contracts  our assessment is critical because if an estimated fair value cannot be established through separate sales then the fee for the entire arrangement eg delivered software and undelivered maintenance and support obligations is deferred until delivery occurs which for maintenance would be ratably over the service period 
fair value of services  such as training or consulting  is based upon separate sales by us of these services to other customers 
our arrangements do not generally include acceptance clauses 
however  if an arrangement includes an acceptance provision  recognition occurs upon the earlier of receipt of a written customer acceptance or expiration of the acceptance period 
we recognize revenue for maintenance services ratably over the contract term 
our training and consulting services are billed based on hourly rates  and we generally recognize revenue as these services are performed 
however  at the time of entering into a transaction  we assess whether or not any services included within the arrangement require us to perform significant work either to alter the underlying software or to build additional complex interfaces so that the software performs as the customer requests 
if these services are included as part of an arrangement  we recognize the entire fee using the percentage of completion method 
we estimate the percentage of completion based on our estimate of the total costs estimated to complete the project as a percentage of the costs incurred to date and the estimated costs to complete 
sales returns and other allowances  allowance for doubtful accounts and litigation 
the preparation of financial statements requires our management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amount of assets and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reported period 
specifically  our management must make estimates of potential future product returns related to current period product revenue 
management analyzes historical returns  current economic trends  and changes in customer demand and acceptance of our products when evaluating the adequacy of the sales returns and other allowances 
significant management judgments and estimates must be made and used in connection with establishing the sales returns and other allowances in any accounting period 
material differences may result in the amount and timing of our revenue for any period if management made different judgments or utilized different estimates 
we monitor sales returns and record specific allowances for all identified returns and we assess the historical trend of sales returns that occur after the period end to develop an estimate of additional allowances 
the provision for sales returns and other sales incentive allowances amounted to million and million in and  respectively 
at december   million total allowance includes the estimate of potential future product returns amounting to million and specific allowances for distributor  reseller and retailer sales incentives amounting to million 
at december   million total allowance includes the estimate of potential future product returns amounting to million and specific allowances for distributor  reseller  and retailer sales incentives amounting to million 
if our sales returns experience rating were to increase by an additional of license revenues  our allowance for sales returns at december  would increase by approximately million 
similarly  our management must make estimates of the uncollectibility of our accounts receivables 
management specifically analyzes accounts receivable and analyzes historical bad debts  customer concentrations  customer credit worthiness  current economic trends and changes in our 
table of contents customer payment terms when evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts 
we specifically reserve for any account receivable for which there are identified collection issues and analyze historical write offs to estimate additional allowances  which historically has averaged to of accounts receivable 
our accounts receivable balance was million  net of allowance for doubtful accounts of million and provision for sales returns and other allowances of million as of december  at december   our accounts receivable balance was million  net of allowance for doubtful accounts of million and provision for sales returns and other allowances of million 
management s current estimated range of liability related to some of the pending litigation is based on claims for which our management can estimate the amount and range of loss 
we have recorded the minimum estimated liability related to those claims  where there is a range of loss as there is no better point of estimate 
because of the uncertainties related to both the amount and range of loss on the remaining pending litigation  management is unable to make a reasonable estimate of the liability that could result from an unfavorable outcome 
as additional information becomes available  we will assess the potential liability related to our pending litigation and revise our estimates 
such revisions in our estimates of the potential liability could materially impact our results of operation and financial position 
accounting for income taxes 
as part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements we are required to estimate our income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate 
this process involves us estimating our actual current tax exposure together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items  such as deferred revenue  for tax and accounting purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included within our consolidated balance sheet 
we must then assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income and to the extent we believe that recovery is not likely  we must establish a valuation allowance 
to the extent we establish a valuation allowance or increase this allowance in a period  we must include an expense within the tax provision in the statement of operations 
significant management judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes  our deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowance recorded against our net deferred tax assets 
we have recorded a valuation allowance of million as of december   due to uncertainties related to our ability to utilize some of our deferred tax assets  primarily consisting of certain net operating losses carried forward and foreign tax credits  before they expire 
the valuation allowance is based on our estimates of taxable income by jurisdiction in which we operate and the period over which our deferred tax assets will be recoverable 
in the event that actual results differ from these estimates or we adjust these estimates in future periods we may need to establish an additional valuation allowance which could materially impact our financial position and results of operations 
the net deferred tax asset as of december  was million  net of a valuation allowance of million 
valuation of goodwill  intangibles  and long lived assets 
we account for goodwill and other indefinite lived intangible assets in accordance with sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
sfas no 
requires  among other things  the discontinuance of amortization for goodwill and indefinite lived intangibles and at least an annual test for impairment 
an impairment review may be performed more frequently in the event circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
the goodwill impairment review involves a two step process as described in note to the consolidated financial statements 
we account for finite lived intangibles and long lived assets in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
under this standard we will record an impairment charge on finite lived intangibles or long lived assets to be held and used when we determine that the carrying value of intangibles and long lived assets may not be recoverable 
based upon the existence of one or more indicators of impairment  we measure any impairment of intangibles or long lived assets based on a projected discounted cash flow method using a discount rate determined by our management to be commensurate with the risk inherent in our current business model 
our 
table of contents estimates of cash flows require significant judgment based on our historical results and anticipated results and are subject to many of the factors  noted below as triggering factors  which may change in the near term 
factors considered important which could trigger an impairment review include  but are not limited to significant under performance relative to expected historical or projected future operating results  significant changes in the manner of our use of the acquired assets or the strategy for our overall business  significant negative industry or economic trends  significant declines in our stock price for a sustained period  and our market capitalization relative to net book value 
goodwill amounted to million and million as of december  and  respectively 
we did not hold any indefinite lived intangibles as of december  or net finite lived intangible assets and long lived assets amounted to million and million as of december  and  respectively 
determining functional currencies for the purpose of consolidation 
we have several foreign subsidiaries which together account for approximately of our net revenues  of our assets and of our total liabilities as of december  in preparing our consolidated financial statements  we are required to translate the financial statements of the foreign subsidiaries from the currency in which they keep their accounting records  generally the local currency  into united states dollars 
this process results in exchange gains and losses which  under the relevant accounting guidance are either included within the statement of operations or as a separate part of our net equity under the caption cumulative translation adjustment 
under the relevant accounting guidance the treatment of these translation gains or losses is dependent upon our management s determination of the functional currency of each subsidiary 
the functional currency is determined based on management judgment and involves consideration of all relevant economic facts and circumstances affecting the subsidiary 
generally  the currency in which the subsidiary transacts a majority of its transactions  including billings  financing  payroll and other expenditures would be considered the functional currency but any dependency upon the parent and the nature of the subsidiary s operations must also be considered 
if any subsidiary s functional currency is deemed to be the local currency  then any gain or loss associated with the translation of that subsidiary s financial statements is included in cumulative translation adjustments 
however  if the functional currency is deemed to be the united states dollar then any gain or loss associated with the translation of these financial statements would be included within our statement of operations 
if we dispose of any of our subsidiaries  any cumulative translation gains or losses would be realized into our statement of operations 
if we determine that there has been a change in the functional currency of a subsidiary to the united states dollar  any translation gains or losses arising after the date of change would be included within our statement of operations 
based on our assessment of the factors discussed above  we consider the relevant subsidiary s local currency to be the functional currency for each of our international subsidiaries 
accordingly  we had cumulative translation losses of approximately million and million which were included as part of accumulated other comprehensive income loss within our consolidated balance sheet at december  and  respectively 
during   and  translation gains losses of million  million  and million  respectively  were included under accumulated other comprehensive income loss 
had we determined that the functional currency of our subsidiaries was the united states dollar  these translation adjustments would have increased decreased our results from operations for each of the years presented 
the magnitude of these gains or losses is dependent upon movements in the exchange rates of the foreign currencies in which we transact business against the united states dollar 
these currencies typically include 
table of contents the japanese yen  the euro  the united kingdom pound sterling and australian  singapore and canadian dollars 
any future translation gains or losses could be significantly higher than those noted in each of these years 
in addition  if we determine that a change in the functional currency of one of our subsidiaries has occurred at any point in time we would be required to include any translation gains or losses from the date of change in our statement of operations

table of contents impact of restatement on consolidated financial statements this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations gives effect to the restatement of our financial statements for through and should be read in conjunction with i the consolidated financial statements and related notes contained in this form k and ii the consolidated financial statements for through and related notes contained in amendment no 
to our form k a  including in each case  note to the respective consolidated financial statements describing the restatement 
certain restatement adjustments made in through related to our recognition of revenue under sop impact favorably previously reported operating results in and and previously announced unaudited operating results in and subsequent interim periods 
among others  the more significant categories of restatement adjustments were recorded to properly reflect sales to our distributors and resellers on the sell through basis for through  which is how we have accounted for these sales since  and to correct certain errors previously made in the application of the revenue recognition principles under sop to multi element revenue transactions in through we sell certain of our products through retail distribution channels and other resellers 
through december  revenue transactions with our distributors and resellers were believed to require payment within a customary collection period and include limited return rights under specific circumstances with revenue being recognized on a sell in basis  net of allowances for estimated returns 
under the provisions of sfas no 
 revenue recognition when right of return exists  or sfas no 
 specific criteria must be met for revenue to be recognized upon shipment when the buyer has the explicit or implicit right to return the product 
in error  we previously concluded that these criteria had been satisfied 
we subsequently determined that in  and we did not meet the criteria requiring that the vendor s obligation to the buyer be complete and the fees be fixed or determinable at the time of product shipment 
we provided concessions  including return rights and stock rotation rights  outside the contractual terms  and in some instances facilitated the resale of our products by our distributors 
in addition  in some cases  distributors and resellers were not obligated to pay for delivered inventory until they had sold the inventory 
excluding the effect of foreign currency adjustments  we have concluded no revenue was lost as a result of this change 
the total restatement adjustments required in connection with the recognition of revenue on the sell through basis resulted in previously reported or previously announced net revenue increasing in  and by million  million and million  respectively 
the accounting treatment with respect to certain revenue arrangements in through with multiple elements was adjusted to correct certain errors 
for our multi element products  we unbundle and defer revenue from the undelivered pcs element and recognize revenue with respect to the delivered license element 
for one year and two year term software licenses  amounts were allocated based on the list price of the license and the pcs element in through in other instances  we allocated revenue to the pcs element based on the amount invoiced to the customer in through further  when we offered our customers a discount on the list price of bundled licenses and pcs  the discount was allocated proportionately based on list price to the license and pcs in through we have determined that these discounts should have been allocated entirely to the delivered license elements 
in addition  we reevaluated whether our methods for allocating revenues to the pcs element was supported by sufficient evidence of the fair value of the pcs based on prices for which pcs was sold separately in through for some products  we determined that sufficient evidence of fair value did not exist in through for other products in through  evidence of fair value existed  but the amount of deferred revenue should have been greater 
these correcting adjustments cumulatively resulted in or will result in the recognition of service and support revenue of million  million  and none in  and  respectively  which was deferred from through upon review of maintenance and support agreements included with the sale of retail licenses in through  we also determined we had inappropriately established the fair value for the pcs element updates to virus definition files of these arrangements 
as we did not sell the pcs separately until late  
table of contents all license and pcs revenue under the arrangement should have been deferred and recognized over the three year estimated life of the retail license or until evidence of fair value of the pcs was established 
in the fourth quarter of  we established the vsoe of fair value for pcs based on an annual renewal rate for the pcs element included with our retail licenses 
excluding the effects of foreign currency related adjustments  overall adjustments to multi element revenue arrangements in through  including those described above  resulted in the same amount of revenue recognized in total 
however  there was a significant increase in deferred revenue for pcs offset by a commensurate decrease in product revenue in through this deferred pcs revenue is generally recognized in later periods as service and support revenue 
the total restatement adjustments required regarding allocation of revenue in multiple element arrangements resulted in net revenue decreasing by million  million and million in  and  respectively and net revenue increasing in and by million and million  respectively 
in addition  net revenue in and is expected to be increased by approximately million and million in connection with the multi element revenue related adjustments

our primary source of operating cash flows is the collection of accounts receivable from our customers and the timing of payments to our vendors and service providers 
our accounts receivable balance as a percentage of sales may increase due to our increased emphasis on large accounts and expanding international sales  both of which typically have longer payment terms 
additionally  our receivable collection has become more dependent on the longer payment cycle for value added resellers  distributors and system integrators

financial risk management the following discussion about our risk management activities includes forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
actual results could differ materially from those projected in the forward looking statements 
foreign currency risk as a global concern  we face exposure to movements in foreign currency exchange rates 
these exposures may change over time as business practices evolve and could have a material adverse impact on our financial results 
our primary exposures related to non us dollar denominated sales and operating expenses in japan  canada  australia  europe  latin america  and asia 
at the present time  we hedge only those currency exposures associated with certain assets and liabilities denominated in nonfunctional currencies and do not generally hedge anticipated foreign currency cash flows 
our hedging activity is intended to offset the impact of currency fluctuations on certain nonfunctional currency assets and liabilities 
the success of this activity depends upon estimates of transaction activity denominated in various currencies  primarily the japanese yen  
table of contents canadian dollar  australian dollar  the euro  the british pound  and certain other european currencies 
to the extent that these estimates are overstated or understated during periods of currency volatility  we could experience unanticipated currency gains or losses 
to reduce exposures associated with nonfunctional net monetary asset positions in various currencies  we enter into spot  forward and swap foreign exchange contracts 
our foreign exchange contracts range from one to three months in original maturity 
in general  we have not hedged anticipated foreign currency cash flows nor do we enter into forward contracts for trading purposes 
we do not use any derivatives for speculative purposes 
our existing forward contracts do not qualify for hedge accounting and accordingly are marked to market at the end of each reporting period with any unrealized gain or loss being recognized in the consolidated statement of operations 
the unrealized gain loss of forward foreign currency contracts outstanding are presented below as of december in thousands euro british pound sterling singapore dollar australian dollar canadian dollar the carrying value is based on the fair value of the underlying contracts based on quoted market rates 
net realized gains and losses arising from settlement of our forward foreign exchange contracts were not significant in   and interest rate risk in july  we entered into interest rate swap transactions the transactions with two investment banks the banks  to hedge the interest rate risk of its outstanding convertible subordinated note due the notes see note to the consolidated financial statements 
the notional amount of the transactions was million to match the entire principal amount of the notes 
we will receive from the banks fixed payments equal to percent of the notional amount  payable on february and august starting on august  in exchange  we will pay to the banks floating rate payments based upon the london interbank offered rate libor plus multiplied by the notional amount of the transactions with the libor resetting every three months beginning august  the transactions will terminate on august  termination date  subject to certain early termination provisions if on or after august  and prior to august  the twenty day average closing price of our common stock equals or exceeds 
the transactions qualified and were designated as a fair value hedge under sfas  accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities to hedge against movements in the fair value of the notes due to changes in the benchmark interest rate 
under the fair value hedge model  the derivative is recognized at fair value on the balance sheet with an offsetting entry to the income statement 
in addition  changes in fair value of the notes due to changes in the benchmark interest rate are recognized as a basis adjustment to the carrying amount of the notes with an offsetting entry to the income statement 
the gain or loss from the change in fair value of the transaction and the offsetting change in the fair value of the notes are recognized as interest and other expense 
the net gain recorded as of december  was approximately million 
to test effectiveness of the hedges  regression analysis has and will be performed at least quarterly comparing the change in fair value of the transactions and the notes 
the fair values of the transactions and the notes are calculated at least quarterly as the present value of the contractual cash flows to the expected 
table of contents maturity date  where the expected maturity date is based on probability weighted analysis of interest rates relating to the five year libor curve and our stock prices 
for the year ended december   the hedge was highly effective and therefore  the ineffective portion did not have a material impact on earnings 
in support of our obligation under the transactions  we are required to maintain with the banks a minimum level of cash and investment collateral of million and periodically adjust the overall level of collateral depending on the fair market value of the transactions 
this minimum amount of collateral is presented as restricted cash in our financial statements
