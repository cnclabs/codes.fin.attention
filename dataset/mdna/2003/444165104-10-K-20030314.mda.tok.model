allowance for loan and lease losses the company considers its allowance for loan and lease loss policy to be a critical accounting policy 
the methodology for assessing the adequacy of the allowance as well as the components of the allowance includes management s subjective judgements on such factors as economic data  peer comparisons  trends in criticized loans and the designation of individual loans as requiring attention 
the company s policy regarding the allowance for loan and lease losses is further discussed in note summary of significant accounting policies 
the provision for loan and lease losses was million for compared with million in and million in the increase in the provision in compared to resulted mainly from a provision of established in the first quarter of in conjunction with the planed accelerated disposition of certain nonperforming commercial mortgage loans and residential mortgage loans  which were also charged off in the first quarter of the higher provision was established as part of a strategy to accelerate the resolution of such assets in  to enable the company to allocate more resources to new business activities 
the million increase in the provision for portfolio loans in over was due to a more conservative provision by the company given the current economic conditions 
the increase in provision in compared to included a million provision in the fourth quarter of for the planned sale of non performing loans  which were sold in management formally reviews the loan portfolio  the allowance for loan and lease losses and the components of the allowance for loan and lease loss for credit risk on a monthly basis throughout the year 
such review takes into consideration the company s assessment of the financial condition of the borrowers  and the company s internal risk grading of the borrowers  fair value of the collateral  level of delinquencies  historical loss experience by loan category  industrial trends and the impact of local and national economic conditions 
management also evaluates the allowance for loan and lease lossess  and the components of the allowance for loan and lease losses throughout the year  based on changes in external conditions and other factors  and makes changes to the allowance accordingly 
the determination of the adequacy of the allowance for loan and lease losses the allowance and the periodic provisioning for estimated losses included in the consolidated financial statements is the responsibility of management 
the evaluation process is undertaken on a monthly basis 
the methodology employed for assessing the adequacy of the allowance consists of the following two criteria the establishment of allowance amounts for all specifically identified criticized loans  including those arising from business combinations  that have been designated as requiring attention by management s internal loan review program 
the establishment of allowances for pools of homogenous types of loans not subject to specific review  including family residential mortgages  consumer loans  and credit card accounts  based upon historical loss rates an allocation of the allowance for the non criticized loans in each portfolio is determined based upon the historical average loss experience of those portfolios 
consideration is also given to the changed risk profile brought about by the aforementioned business combinations  customer knowledge  the results of ongoing credit quality monitoring processes  the adequacy and expertise of the company s lending work out and collection staffs  underwriting policies  loss histories  delinquency trends  the cyclical nature of economic and business conditions and the concentration of real estate related loans located within the company s footprint 
since many of the loans depend upon the sufficiency of collateral as a secondary source of repayment  any adverse trend in the real estate markets could affect underlying values available to protect the company from loss 
other evidence used to determine the amount of the allowance and its components are as follows regulatory and other examinations the amount and trend of criticized loans actual losses peer comparisons with other financial institutions economic data associated with the real estate market in the company s area of operations opportunities to dispose of marginally performing loans for cash considerations based upon the process employed and giving recognition to all attendant factors associated with the loan portfolio  management considers the allowance for loan and lease losses to be adequate at december  the following is a summary of the activity in the allowance for possible loan and lease losses  by loan category  for the years indicated in thousands allowance for loan and lease losses amount of loans outstanding at end of year daily average amount of loans outstanding allowance for loan and lease losses balance at beginning of year loans charged off real estate mortgages commercial and industrial consumer credit other accelerated disposition assets held for sale total loans charged off recoveries real estate mortgages commercial and industrial consumer credit other total recoveries net loans charged off provision for loan and lease losses portfolio loans provision for loan and lease losses non performing loans held for accelerated disposition or for sale allowance acquired through mergers and acquisitions balance at end of year provision for loan and lease losses as a percentage of average loans outstanding net charge offs as a percentage of average loans outstanding allowance for loan and lease losses as a percentage of loans outstanding at year end the writedown of assets held for sale pertains to the planned disposal of million of nonaccrual loans in and million of nonaccrual loans and oreo properties in the following is the allocation of the allowance for loan and lease losses by loan category in thousands allocation of the allowance for loan and lease losses as of december  allowance category percent of loans allowance category percent of loans allowance category percent of loans allowance category percent of loans allowance category percent of loans real estate mortgages commercial and industrial consumer credit unallocated total deposits as of december   hudson had branch offices in new jersey  branch offices in new york state  branch offices in connecticut  and branch offices in pennsylvania  for a total of branches

the company s credit ratings are as follows moody s s p fitch bank short term deposits p a f long term deposits baa bbb bbb subordinated debt baa bbb bbb company subordinated debt not rated bb bbb capital trust securities not rated not rated bbb any downgrading of the company s unsecured credit ratings would not cause the interest rate on any of its subordinated debt or capital trust securities to increase  or cause the principal amount to be putable by the holders to the company 
a downgrading of the company s unsecured credit ratings could make it difficult for the company to issue additional subordinated debt or capital trust securities on attractive terms  if at all

the securities were redeemed on february  interest and liquidity rate sensitivity management the primary objectives of asset liability management are to provide for the safety of depositor and investor funds  assure adequate liquidity  maintain an appropriate balance between interest sensitive earning assets and interest sensitive liabilities and enhance earnings 
interest rate sensitivity management ensures that the company maintains acceptable levels of net interest income throughout a range of interest rate environments 
the company seeks to maintain its interest rate risk within a range that it believes is both manageable and prudent  given its capital and income generating capacity 
liquidity risk is the risk to earnings or capital that would arise from a bank s inability to meet its obligations when they come due  without incurring unacceptable losses 
liquidity management is a planning process that ensures that the company has ample funds from operations  cash flow from interest  prepayments and principal repayment of loans and investment securities  proceeds from sales of assets  and cash flow from increases in deposits from customers to satisfy operational needs  potential deposit outflows  repayment of borrowings  loan commitments  and the projected credit needs of its customer base 
in addition  the company has a number of collateralized borrowing facilities with the federal home loan bank and federal reserve  primary broker dealers and other sources that are or can be used as sources of liquidity without having to sell assets to raise cash 
the company has an asset liability management committee  which manages the risks associated with the volatility of interest rates and the resulting impact on net interest income  net income and capital 
the management of interest rate risk at the company is performed by income simulation analysis which analyzes the effects of interest rate changes on net interest income  net income and capital over specific periods of time and captures the dynamic impact of interest rate changes on the company s mix of assets and liabilities 
the asset liability committee of the company believes that financial simulation modeling reasonably estimates the effects and exposure on net interest income to changes in interest rates 
it attempts to measure the degree to which the interest income and interest expense on certain assets and liabilities which are directly linked to market indices  such as fed funds or the prime rate or libor  may change as market interest rate changes 
it also attempts to measure the degree to which interest expense on deposits  the rates which are administered by the bank s management  but which need to be generally competitive with the administered deposit rates established by other banks  may change as market interest rates change  and the degree to which balances in deposit accounts may change due to changes in administered rates implemented by the bank s management 
it additionally attempts to measure how changes in the composition of the investment portfolio may change the potential interest income and cash flow of the bank  and how hedging instruments such as interest rate derivatives may be used to change the interest sensitivity of certain assets and liabilities 
as such  net interest income simulation is designed to address the likely probability of changes in net interest income as a result of interest rate changes and behavioral response of the components of the balance sheet to those changes 
the market value of portfolio equity represents the estimated fair values of the net present value of assets  liabilities  and off balance sheet items 
the estimated fair value of many loans and other assets  and of deposits and many other liabilities  may not be based on public market prices if markets do not readily exist for trading and valuing such assets and liabilities 
financial modeling is performed under several scenarios including a regulatory interest rate shock scenario which measures changes in net interest income over the next twelve months and market value of portfolio equity given instantaneous and sustained changes in interest rates 
the company enters into interest rate derivative contracts interest rate swaps  interest rate floors  and interest rate caps from time to time for asset liability management purposes 
the purpose of these contracts is to limit the volatility in the company s net interest income and net interest margin in the event of changes in interest rates  in the context of the management of the company s overall asset liability risk 
management did not enter into these contracts for speculative purposes 
the company s derivative contracts include prime rate indexed interest rate swaps and floors and caps entered into to limit the variability of the interest income of a specified pool of prime rate indexed loans 
the company s derivative contracts also include libor indexed interest rate swaps entered into in connection with certain fixed rate certificates of deposits and with a specified amount of the company s fixed rate borrowings  to effectively convert those fixed rate liabilities into libor indexed liabilities 
the notional amount of the derivative contracts totals million at december  under sfas no  the company has adopted hedge accounting for these contracts 
the derivative contracts hedging the pool of prime rate based loans are being accounted for as cash flow hedges under sfas no  whereby the net payments under the contracts are recorded in interest income and the change in valuation of the contracts are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income loss in total stockholders equity 
changes in interest rates will impact the cash flows and valuation of the derivative contracts  but management does not expect the overall financial statement impact to be material under any interest rate scenario 
the derivative contracts hedging the fixed rate certificates of deposit and the fixed rate subordinated debt are accounted for as fair value hedges using the short cut method under sfas no 
under the short cut method  any changes in value of the hedged item is assumed to be exactly as much as the change in the value of the derivative contract 
therefore  in a fair value hedge  the hedged item is adjusted by exactly the same amount as the derivative  with no impact on earnings 
the company s policies for the use of interest rate derivative contracts  its actual use of interest rate derivative contracts  and the effectiveness of the interest rate derivative contracts as hedges are reviewed throughout the year by the company s asset liability committee
