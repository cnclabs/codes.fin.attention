item management s discussion and analysis of results of operations and financial condition this discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes 
all references to earnings per share included in this discussion are to diluted earnings per share 
critical accounting policies and estimates management s discussion and analysis of the company s financial condition and results of operations are based on the company s consolidated financial statements that have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires the company to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses 
the company bases its estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable and consistent with industry practice 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
the company believes the following critical accounting policies affect its more significant judgments and estimates in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements 
the company records reductions to selling prices as products are shipped 
these reductions are based on competitive and market conditions  in addition to specific customer contracts in some instances 
these reductions are estimated and recorded at the time of shipment either through a reduction to invoice or the establishment of an accrual for payment at a later date 
the amount accrued may increase or decrease prior to payment due to customer performance and market conditions 
the company maintains an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of its customers to make payments 
such allowance is based on an ongoing review of customer payments against terms and a review of customers financial statements and conditions through monitoring services 
based on these reviews  additional allowances may be required and are recorded in the appropriate period 
specific industry market conditions can significantly increase or decrease the level of inventory on hand in any of the company s business units 
the company will adjust for changes in demand by reducing or increasing production levels 
the company estimates the required inventory reserve by assessing inventory turns and market selling prices on a product by product basis 
the company will maintain such reserves until product is sold or market conditions require an increase in the reserves 
the company offers certain warranties with the sale of its products 
the warranty obligation is recorded as a liability on the balance sheet and is estimated through historical customer claims  supplier performance  and new product performance 
should a change in trend occur in customer claims  an increase or decrease in the warranty liability may be necessary 
the company incurs expenses in the form of product liability claims as a result of alleged product malfunctions or misuse 
the company maintains insurance for a portion of this exposure and records a liability for its non insured obligations 
the company estimates its product liability obligations on a case by case basis in addition to a review of product performance trends 
these estimated obligations may be increased or decreased as more information on specific cases becomes available 
the company determines its post retirement obligations on an actuarial basis that requires management to make certain assumptions 
these assumptions include the long term rate of return on plan assets  the discount rate to be used in calculating the page applicable benefit obligation and the anticipated trend in health care costs 
these assumptions are reviewed on an annual basis and consideration is given to market conditions as well as the requirements of statement of financial accounting standards no 
 employers accounting for pensions and no 
 employers accounting for post retirement costs other than pensions 
the assumed rate of return on plan assets was for and the company anticipates the same rate to be utilized in the company believes this rate is reasonable given the asset composition and historical trends 
the company lowered its discount rate assumption to to determine its plan liabilities at december  from in the previous year due to the market declines in benchmark interest rates 
the company assumed that health care costs in would increase by per year and future increases would decline by per year until is reached 
the company s annual post retirement expenses can be impacted by changes in assumptions 
a change in the return on assets will change annual pension expense by million 
a change in the discount rate as of december  results in million in increased pension expenses in and a change in health care costs will change annual post retirement medical costs by million a year

this note requires semi annual interest payments and the term loan facilities under the credit facilities require payments of principal payments of million annually through and million in in addition to the required annual payment of million  and in conjunction with the transition of corporate operations from montgomery  alabama to portland  oregon  the company sold certain assets and used proceeds to reduce the term loan facilities by an additional million in interest on the term loan facilities and amounts outstanding under the revolving credit facility are payable in arrears according to varying interest periods

as part of these arrangements  the company may be required to repurchase certain equipment from the third party financing companies should the customer default on payment 
as of december   the maximum repurchase obligation was million 
additionally  under its agreement  another third party financing company may require the company to reimburse the third party financing company for its net loss 
the maximum exposure with respect to this net loss position is  these arrangements have not had a material effect on the company s operating results in the past since  with respect to the repurchase obligations  any equipment repurchased has historically been resold with minimal  if any  loss recognized 
the company does not expect to incur any material charges related to these agreements in future periods 
the company intends to fund working capital  capital expenditures and debt service requirements through cash flows generated from operations and from the revolving credit facility 
the revolving credit facility has an availability of up to million 
letters of credit issued under the revolving credit facility which reduce the amount available under the facility were million at december  the revolving credit facility will mature august  management believes that cash generated from operations  together with amounts available under the revolving credit facility  will be sufficient to meet the company s working capital  capital expenditure and other cash needs in the foreseeable future 
there can be no assurance  however  that this will be the case 
the company may also consider other options available to it in connection with future liquidity needs 
the company will be required to repay certain outstanding borrowings with the maturity of the term loans and senior notes in the company does not expect to generate funds for these obligations through operating cash flow 
although there can page be no guarantee  the company expects to fund these obligations through either the refinancing of such debt  the sale of non strategic assets or the issuance of additional shares of company stock  or any combination of these actions 
in conjunction with the sale of seg  the company and its lenders amended the credit agreement relating to the outstanding term loans 
among other things  this amendment adjusted the financial coverage ratios covenants to reflect the sale of seg and cured any event of default under the credit agreement that had been communicated to the lenders on october  the company does not have any rating triggers that would accelerate repayment of outstanding debt

accounts receivable within the industrial and power equipment segment declined from last year due to improved collection efforts partially offset by an increase in extended term receivables offered in response to market and competitive factors 
at december   there were approximately million in receivables with extended terms compared to million at december  the company expects the cash flow from operations and the amounts available under its revolving credit agreements will be sufficient to cover any additional increases in working capital 
while there can be no assurance  management believes the company will comply with all debt covenants during should the company not comply with the covenants during  additional significant actions will be required 
these page actions may include  among others  attempting to renegotiate its debt facilities  sales of assets  additional restructuring and reductions in capital expenditures 
the covenant ratios in have not been adjusted to reflect the sale of the sporting equipment group and therefore will need to be renegotiated prior to march  immediately after the merger and recapitalization transaction described in note of notes to consolidated financial statements  the company became substantially leveraged which may adversely affect its operations 
this substantial leverage could have important consequences for the company  including the following the ability to obtain additional financing for working capital  capital expenditures or other purposes may be impaired or may not be available on favorable terms  a substantial portion of cash flows available from operations will be dedicated to the payment of principal and interest expense  which will reduce the funds that would otherwise be available for operations and future business opportunities  a substantial decrease in net income and cash flows or an increase in expenses may make it difficult to meet debt service requirements or force the company to modify operations  and substantial leverage may make the company more vulnerable to economic downturns and competitive pressure 
market risk the company is exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates  foreign currency exchange rates and commodity prices 
the company manages its exposure to these market risks through its regular operating and financing activities  and  when deemed appropriate  through the use of derivatives 
when utilized  derivatives are used as risk management tools and not for trading purposes 
see interest rate risk and commodity price risk below for discussion of expectations as regards to future use of interest rate and commodity price derivatives 
interest rate risk the company manages its ratio of fixed to variable rate debt with the objective of achieving a mix that management believes is appropriate 
historically  the company has  on occasion  entered into interest rate swap agreements to exchange fixed and variable interest rates based on agreed upon notional amounts and has entered into interest rate lock contracts to hedge the interest rate of an anticipated debt issue 
at december  and  no significant derivative financial instruments were outstanding to hedge interest rate risk 
a hypothetical immediate increase in interest rates would decrease the fair value of the company s fixed rate long term debt outstanding at december   by million 
a hypothetical increase in the interest rates on the company s variable rate long term debt for a duration of one year would increase interest expense by approximately million in foreign currency exchange risk approximately of oregon s sales and of its operating costs and expenses were transacted in foreign currencies in as a result  fluctuations in exchange rates impact the amount of oregon s reported sales and operating income 
historically  the company s principal exposures have been related to local currency operating costs and expenses in canada and brazil  and local currency sales and expenses in europe principally france and germany 
during the past three years  the company has not used derivatives to manage any foreign currency exchange risk and  at december   no foreign currency exchange derivatives were outstanding 
page the table below illustrates the estimated effect of a hypothetical immediate change in major currencies defined for the company as euro  canadian dollar  and brazilian real would have in millions effect of weaker us dollar sales cost of operating sales income major currencies euro canadian dollar brazilian real commodity price risk the company purchases certain raw materials for the manufacture of products 
some of these raw materials are subject to price volatility over periods of time 
the company has not hedged against the price change within its continuing operations segments with any derivative instruments 
a hypothetical immediate change in the price of steel would have the estimated effect of million on pre tax income in new accounting pronouncements in august  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no
