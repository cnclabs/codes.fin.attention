item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations liquidity and capital resources at december   scl s cash balances totalled  additionally  there were undrawn working capital bank lines amounting to approximately  of which  was undrawn under secured revolving credit facilities 
changes in the cash position over the last three years can be summarized as follows dollars in thousands net cash provided by operating activities    proceeds from sale of fixed assets and other    issuance of long term debt    issuance of shares  issuance of oeh shares by oeh  sale of oeh shares by scl    capital expenditures    acquisitions and investments  net of cash acquired   cash reduction from deconsolidation of oeh  principal payments under long term debt   debentures and senior notes retired   dividends on shares    purchase and retirement of oeh shares  working capital facilities and redrawable loans repaid drawn  effect of exchange rate on cash    increase in cash    in  scl had a positive cash flow from operations after interest of    and proceeds from the sale of fixed assets and other of    all of which were principally utilized to make loan repayments and fund capital expenditures  acquisitions and dividends  as was the case in and cash flow from operations increased in from mainly due to increased earnings from passenger transport  including the effect of consolidating silja from may   increased gains from the sale by scl of oeh shares and decreases in net finance costs and working capital  all partly offset by decreased earnings from container operations and leisure operations  including the effects of deconsolidating oeh in the fourth quarter of cash flow from operations increased in from mainly due to increased earnings from passenger transport operations and decreased working capital  offset in part by reduced earnings from container operations and leisure operations including the beneficial effect of acquisitions in and  an increase in net finance costs resulting from a reduction in interest and related income which in included a foreign currency swap gain of  partially offset by reduced interest expense due to lower rates on floating rate debt  and undistributed earnings of affiliates including silja and ge seaco investments 
proceeds from bank borrowings in amounted to approximately    of which nil   was drawn under loans secured by containers and related factory and depot assets  repayable mainly over five to ten years     was drawn under loans secured by passenger transport assets  repayable over five to ten years  and    was drawn under term loans mainly secured by leisure and other assets and investments  repayable over five to seven years 
also in  scl sold in an sec registered public offering a total of  shares of oeh that scl owned  shares realizing net proceeds of  
this included the sale on november  of  oeh shares that resulted in the deconsolidation of oeh 
see note to the financial statements item below 
scl used the sale proceeds principally to repay debt and fund capital expenditures 
in january  oeh filed a registration statement with the sec relating to a further offering by scl of all of its remaining  shares in oeh 
in  scl made capital expenditures totalling approximately  relating primarily to the purchase and improvement of passenger transport and leisure assets 
the majority of these expenditures was financed from medium or long term bank borrowings 
scl acquired the remaining of silja which it did not already own for approximately  which was satisfied by the issue of  of scl class a common shares and payment of the balance in cash which was largely funded by bank loans 
also in  oeh acquired three hotels at a total price of about  funded in part by bank loans 
the following table summarizes scl s material known payment obligations  excluding accounts payable and accrued liabilities  in and later years as of december  the data are derived from notes assets under capital lease  working capital facilities  long term debt  senior notes and subordinated debentures  redeemable preferred shares and commitments and contingencies to the financial statements below dollars in thousands year ended december  thereafter total working capital facilities   long term debt      senior notes   senior notes   senior notes   senior notes   senior subordinated debentures  capital leases    redeemable preferred shares  operating leases      purchase commitments   operating lease payments include  relating to gner rental payments in respect of rolling stock and access charges for railway infrastructure 
these commitments are payable only while gner holds the passenger rail franchise which currently expires in proposed restructuring of debt the following portions of scl s long term indebtedness included in the table above come due in and  of senior notes due july    of senior notes due july    under a revolving credit loan from a syndicate of banks secured by container equipment  due october   and  including  of unamortized discount of senior subordinated debentures due december  scl management anticipates that scl s cash flow from operations will not be sufficient to discharge these four upcoming payment obligations and possibly other debt obligations in and accordingly  scl is proposing to restructure part of this indebtedness to extend the maturity dates of some of it and to sell or refinance certain assets to raise cash to repay the balance  to the extent it cannot be paid from cash flow from operations 
as part of scl s effort to extend the maturity dates  scl plans to initiate exchange offers of senior notes due july  for scl s and senior notes shown above  and senior notes due december  for scl s senior subordinated debentures shown above  plus in each case a cash exchange fee based on every  principal amount of notes or debentures tendered and accepted for exchange 
management also intends to seek to extend the maturity of its revolving credit container loan shown above 
to the extent that scl is unable to extend the maturities of this indebtedness and is required to make cash repayments  including with respect to other debt maturing in and  scl management intends to utilize the cash flow from scl s operations and the proceeds from one or more of the following asset sales or refinancing transactions currently under consideration sales by scl from time to time in one or more public offerings of remaining common shares of oeh that scl owns  sales of other scl assets  including its iomspc ferry unit in the irish sea  its remaining port interests in the uk  and its charleston  south carolina container factory  a refinancing of the silja ships  and sales by scl from time to time of its own newly issued class a common shares or indebtedness of scl or its subsidiaries 
management may also consider other transactions in order to raise funds 
management believes that the available cash from operations and readily saleable assets will be sufficient to service its obligations 
the ultimate success of this proposed restructuring of debt will depend on the successful and timely consummation of the various components of the plan 
those components are being undertaken over a period of several months  and there can be no assurance that any component will be consummated  or consummated on a timely basis  or that scl will raise funds or extend maturities to the extent necessary 
the plan is subject to various risks  such as uncertain market conditions  fluctuation in interest rates and currency values  the uncertainty of negotiating and completing proposed transactions and unacceptability of terms offered to scl 
in addition  even if maturities of indebtedness are successfully extended  scl will have to repay the debt when due and may not have sufficient cash flow from operations  or refinancing ability  to do so 
as indicated in the summary table above  scl has substantial additional debt coming due in and later years 
any failure by scl to repay any indebtedness when due would result in a default under the indebtedness and cause cross defaults under other indebtedness 
certain financial requirements scl is party to material credit financing agreements described in notes and to the financial statements which impose certain financial requirements 
one is a  revolving credit facility secured by container equipment with a group of banks 
this facility imposes financial covenants on scl  including i a requirement to maintain a minimum consolidated tangible net worth including preferred shares  ii a requirement not to exceed a specified leverage ratio  iii requirements to maintain a minimum debt service coverage ratio and minimum interest coverage ratios  iv a requirement that scl not suffer losses in any two consecutive years  and v limitations on the payment of dividends  redemption of capital stock or subordinated indebtedness  and investments in third parties  which limitations are calculated by reference to the sum of a base amount  one half of cumulative net earnings from  and the net proceeds from certain capital stock offerings  less the cumulative amounts of certain restricted payments and repurchases of preferred shares and subordinated debt  and less certain investments in unrelated parties 
the  principal amount of unsecured senior subordinated debentures due contain covenants restricting i the incurrence by scl of indebtedness unless scl meets a minimum cash flow coverage ratio  as defined  ii the payment of dividends  redemption of capital stock or subordinated indebtedness  and investments in third parties which restriction is similar to the equivalent one in the container facility described above  iii transactions between scl and its affiliates unless they are on arm s length terms  iv limitations on the ability of certain material subsidiaries of the company to restrict payments to the company  v the disposition of proceeds of asset sales by scl  vi any lines of business that are not similar or related to scl s existing businesses  and vii the ability of scl to amalgamate  consolidate or merge with or into another entity or to dispose of its assets substantially as an entirety 
if scl fails to maintain a specified amount of consolidated tangible net worth  or if a change of control of scl occurs  the company is obligated to make an offer to purchase of the debentures at par in the case of the net worth test and of the debentures at of the principal amount in the case of a change of control 
the  principal amount of senior notes due   principal amount of senior notes due   principal amount of senior notes due and  principal amount of senior notes due all unsecured obligations and including  of unamortized discount on the notes contain restrictive covenants substantially the same as those in the debentures described above 
in addition  the notes contain covenants restricting i incurrence by scl of liens on its assets or property unless the notes are secured equally  subject to certain exceptions  and ii sale and leaseback transactions by scl  subject also to certain exceptions 
a consolidated subsidiary of the company has a  container securitization facility 
under it  the subsidiary  a bankruptcy remote company formed to facilitate asset securitization  issued a senior note and the company issued an effectively subordinated note 
the senior note requires the subsidiary to maintain a minimum interest coverage ratio  and requires scl to maintain a minimum cash flow coverage ratio  as well as to comply with the covenants in the subordinated note 
failure to comply with these requirements would result in accelerated amortization  but not default  of the senior note 
upon a change of control of the company  the senior note would come due 
the subordinated note requires that scl i not exceed a specified leverage ratio  ii maintain a minimum consolidated tangible net worth  and iii maintain a minimum interest coverage ratio 
silja has a  euro  term and revolving credit loan facility containing financial covenants that apply to silja and its subsidiaries  including maintenance of i minimum liquidity levels  ii minimum debt service coverage and iii minimum net worth 
except with assistance to maintain the required silja liquidity  the company and its other subsidiaries are not a party to this facility 
silja is planning to refinance this facility and the ships that secure it during see proposed restructuring of debt above 
at december   the company and its subsidiaries were in full compliance with all of the foregoing credit financing agreements as well as less material ones to which they are party 
although management believes that scl s current operating plans will not be restricted by the various financial covenants described above  changes in economic or business conditions  results of operations or other factors may in the future result in circumstances in which the covenants restrict scl s plans or business operations 
leverage  foreign currency fluctuations at december   scl s consolidated long term indebtedness was   and its redeemable preferred shares and consolidated shareholders equity totalled  
redeemable preferred shares amounted to  
the terms of scl s indebtedness described above permit scl to incur substantial additional indebtedness from time to time 
the degree to which scl is leveraged may affect its ability to obtain additional financing in the future for working capital  capital expenditures  product and service development and general corporate purposes  to utilize cash flow from operations for purposes other than debt service  and to overcome seasonal or cyclical variations in its business 
the ability of scl to satisfy its obligations and to reduce its debt is dependent upon the future performance of scl  which will be subject to prevailing economic conditions and to financial  business and other factors  including factors beyond the control of scl 
the acquisition by scl of new assets and properties  both for growth as well as for replacement  is capital intensive 
the availability of new capital to finance these expenditures depends on prevailing market conditions and the acceptability of financing terms offered to scl 
assuming the success of the proposed restructuring of debt described above  management believes that capital expected to be available to scl under various lines of credit  financing agreements and other sources  and from dispositions of existing assets and properties  as well as cash generated from operations  should be sufficient to meet scl s capital requirements for the foreseeable future 
no assurance  however  can be given that financing will continue to be available  or available on acceptable terms 
approximately of scl s consolidated long term indebtedness at december  accrued interest at rates that fluctuate with prevailing interest rates and  accordingly  increases in such rates may increase scl s interest payment obligations 
at december   scl had entered into interest rate swaps with financial institutions in order to manage its floating interest rate exposure  thereby reducing the fluctuating interest rate indebtedness to 
see item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk and note to the financial statements 
substantial portions of scl s revenues and expenses are denominated in foreign currencies  especially the british pound sterling and the euro 
a large part of scl s passenger transport business operates in and around great britain and certain corporate costs and selling  general and administrative expenses of scl relate to its london offices 
fluctuations in the values of these currencies in us dollar terms may affect scl s financial condition and results of operations 
the impact of these fluctuations is mitigated to the extent that scl has both revenue and expenses denominated in the same currencies 
if revenue and expense items become imbalanced  scl may enter into forward foreign exchange contracts from time to time in order to hedge the imbalance 
see item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk and note to the financial statements 
results of operations compared to and compared to revenue and other the total revenue and other increase of  in and decrease of  in included a decrease of  and an increase of  respectively  from equity in the earnings losses of unconsolidated companies and  in  increased asset sale losses of  including an increased gain of  from the sale by the company of oeh shares while in  gains of  from the heysham and newhaven port sales and  in  a  gain from the sale by the company of oeh shares were included

the preparation of those financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amount of assets and liabilities  revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
critical accounting policies are those that reflect significant judgments or uncertainties  and potentially result in materially different results under different assumptions and conditions 
management believes the following are scl s most critical accounting policies 
revenue recognition scl s revenues are primarily derived from its three main business segments  passenger transport operations  container operations and leisure operations 
generally  revenues are recognized when the services have been rendered 
the following is a description of the composition of revenues of scl passenger transport revenues are recognized when the transportation is provided rather than when a ticket is sold 
the amount of ticket sales not yet recognized as revenue is reflected as a liability in the consolidated balance sheet 
periodic evaluations are performed of this estimated liability and any adjustments are included in results of operations for the periods in which the evaluations are completed 
container revenues consist of earnings from containers under operating leases and sales type leases 
revenues from operating leases are straight lined over the respective lease period 
with respect to sales type leases  a gain or loss is calculated in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for leases and is included in revenue 
leisure revenues consist of earnings from oeh 
oeh revenue is recognized when rooms are occupied  services have been rendered or upon commencement of tourist train and cruise journeys 
oeh management fees represent fees earned under long term management contracts 
base fee revenues are recognized when earned in accordance with the terms of the contract 
commencing in the fourth quarter of  scl s economic interest in oeh fell below 
as a result  leisure revenues are principally accounted for under the equity method of accounting for investments 
see note to the financial statements 
carrying values of long lived assets management periodically evaluates the recoverability of long lived assets  including containers  ships  property and intangible assets  whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable 
these evaluations include analyses based on the cash flows generated by the underlying assets  profitability information  including estimated future operating results  trends or other determinants of fair value 
if the value of the asset determined by these evaluations is less than its carrying amount  a loss is recognized for the difference between the fair value and the carrying value of the asset 
future adverse changes in market conditions or poor operating results of the related business may indicate an inability to recover the carrying value of the assets  thereby possibly requiring an impairment charge in the future 
depreciation containers and ships are recorded at cost and  after allowance for salvage value  are depreciated over their estimated useful lives by the straight line method 
the estimated useful lives and salvage values for containers are generally years and  respectively  and for ships generally to years and to  respectively 
real estate and other fixed assets are recorded at cost and are depreciated over their estimated useful lives by the straight line method 
the depreciation rates on freehold buildings range from to years and on machinery and other remaining assets from to years 
leasehold improvements are depreciated over the shorter of the estimated useful life or the respective lease terms 
acquisitions scl records a preliminary purchase price allocation for acquisitions based on preliminary information received at the date of acquisition and based on scl s historical acquisitions 
these allocations are subject to adjustments and are finalized once additional information concerning asset and liability valuations is obtained 
the final asset and liability fair values may differ from those currently set forth in the consolidated financial statements 
if the final allocations for the acquisitions differ from the preliminary allocations  scl may need to increase or decrease depreciation and or amortization expenses 
pensions scl s pension plans are accounted for using actuarial valuations required by sfas no 
 employers accounting for pensions  and sfas no 
 employers accounting for post retirement benefits other than pensions 
scl s minimum pension liability was approximately  as of december  management considers accounting for retirement plans critical to all of scl s operating segments because management is required to make significant subjective judgments about a number of actuarial assumptions  which include discount rates  health care cost trends and rates  salary growth  long term return on plan assets and mortality rates 
depending on the assumptions and estimates used  the pension and post retirement benefit expense could vary within a range of outcomes and have a material effect on scl s consolidated financial statements 
see note to the financial statements 
deferred maintenance costs scl s vessels and train rolling stock are required to incur major repairs and maintenance which cannot be performed while the assets are operating 
scl capitalizes the costs associated with the major repairs and maintenance and amortizes these costs on a straight line basis over a two year period 
management believes that these criteria are consistent with industry practice and that scl s policy of capitalization reflects the economics and market values of the related assets 
tax assets scl maintains a valuation allowance to reduce its gross deferred tax assets to reflect the amount  based upon scl s estimates of income  that would likely be realized 
if scl s future operations differed from those in the estimates  scl may need to increase or decrease the valuation allowance  which could affect its reported operations 
contingencies scl is subject to the possibility of various loss contingencies arising in the ordinary course of business 
scl considers the likelihood of a loss or impairment of an asset or the incurrence of a liability as well as its ability reasonably to estimate the amount of loss in determining loss contingencies 
an estimated loss contingency is accrued when it is probable that a liability has been incurred or an asset has been impaired and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated 
management regularly evaluates current available information to determine whether such accruals should be adjusted 
see note to the financial statements for a discussion of accounting policies with respect to these and other items 
recent accounting pronouncements scl s adoption of recent accounting pronouncements is described in note t to the financial statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk as noted under leverage  foreign currency fluctuations in item management s discussion and analysis above  scl is exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates 
these exposures are monitored and managed by scl as part of its overall risk management program which recognizes the unpredictability of financial markets and seeks to mitigate potentially material adverse effects on scl s consolidated earnings and cash flow 
as part of this management  scl enters into interest rate and foreign currency swap contracts and foreign currency forward exchange contracts from time to time 
see note to the financial statements item below 
scl does not use market risk sensitive financial instruments for trading purposes 
the market risk relating to interest rates arises mainly from scl s financing activities 
scl s earnings are affected by changes in interest rates on borrowings  principally based on us dollar libor  and on short term cash investments 
management assesses scl s market risk based on changes in interest rates utilizing a sensitivity analysis 
if interest rates increased by  with all other variables held constant  scl s annual net finance costs would have increased by approximately  based on borrowings and interest rate swap agreements outstanding at december  
changes in interest rates also impact the fair value of scl s fixed rate debt 
if interest rates increased by  with all other variables held constant  the fair value of scl s fixed rate debt would have decreased by approximately  based on amounts outstanding at december  
the market risk relating to foreign currencies arises from buying  selling and financing in currencies other than the us dollar  principally uk sterling and euro 
management anticipates this foreign currency exchange rate risk will remain a market exposure for the foreseeable future 
certain non us subsidiaries of the company borrow in local foreign currencies  and scl may enter into forward exchange contracts relating to purchases denominated in foreign currencies in order to manage and mitigate exchange rate risk 
scl had no currency swap agreement in place at december  management uses a sensitivity analysis to assess the changes in the values of the us dollar on foreign currency denominated monetary assets and liabilities 
the primary assumption used in these models is a hypothetical weakening or strengthening of the us dollar against scl s currency exposure at december  as a result of this analysis  management determined that the impact on monetary assets and liabilities of a change in foreign currency exchange rates in relation to the us dollar would not be material
