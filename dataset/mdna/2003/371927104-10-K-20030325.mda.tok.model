item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations included in management s discussion and analysis are the following sections o highlights of o outlook for and beyond o liquidity and capital resources o results of operations o other matters o new accounting pronouncements o critical accounting policies highlights of we believe that the most important event of was the sale of our general partner by salomon to a subsidiary of denbury resources inc denbury on may  genesis owns and operates a mile pipeline system in mississippi adjacent to several of denbury s existing and prospective oil fields 
denbury is the largest oil and natural gas operator in the state of mississippi 
there may be mutual benefits to denbury and genesis due to this common production and transportation area 
because of this relationship  we may obtain certain commitments for increased crude oil volumes  while denbury may obtain the certainty of transportation for its oil production at competitive market rates 
as denbury continues to acquire and develop old oil fields using carbon dioxide co based tertiary recovery operations  denbury would expect to add crude oil gathering and co supply infrastructure to these fields 
we may be able to provide or acquire this infrastructure and provide support to denbury s development of these fields 
further  as the fields are developed over time  it may create increased demand for our crude oil transportation services 
during  average daily throughput on the mississippi system where denbury is a significant source of production near the pipeline increased from approximately  barrels per day during may   the month denbury acquired our general partner  to approximately  barrels per day during december 
we expect this trend of increased throughput on these segments of the system to continue 
however  we can make no assurances that such increased throughput will continue or predict that it will increase at this rate 
as a result of its acquisition by denbury  the general partner  genesis energy  inc genesis amended section of the second amended and restated agreement of limited partnership of genesis energy  lp the partnership agreement to broaden the right of the common unitholders to remove the general partner of genesis energy  lp gelp 
prior to this amendment  the general partner could only be removed for cause and with approval by holders of two thirds or more of the outstanding limited partner interests in gelp 
as amended  the partnership agreement provides that  with the approval of at least a majority of the limited partners in gelp  the general partner also may be removed without cause 
any limited partner interests held by the general partner and its affiliates are to be excluded from such a vote 
the amendment further provides that if it is proposed that the removal is without cause and an affiliate of denbury is the general partner to be removed and not proposed as a successor  then any action for removal must also provide for denbury to be granted an option effective upon its removal to purchase gelp s mississippi pipeline system at a price that is percent of its fair market value at that time 
fair value is to be determined by agreement of two independent appraisers  one chosen by the successor general partner and the other by denbury or if they are unable to agree  the mid point of the values determined by them 
the amendment was negotiated on behalf of gelp by the audit committee of the board of directors of genesis 
upon determination of its fairness  including obtaining an opinion from the investment banking firm of the gulfstar group as to the amendment s fairness to the common unitholders of gelp  and an opinion from delaware legal counsel as to the form of the amendment  the audit committee recommended approval of the amendment to the board of directors of genesis 
during  we reached agreement in principal with the us environmental protection agency epa and the mississippi department of environmental quality mdeq for the payment of fines under federal and state environmental laws with respect to the leaf river spill in december  see other matters crude oil spill 
based on the discussions leading to this agreement in principal  we have recorded accrued liabilities totaling of million during and while we are pleased with the progress we have made toward resolving the uncertainty of this environmental liability during  no assurance can be made that we will reach final agreement with the federal and mississippi governments or the specific terms of a final agreement if one is reached 
we successfully completed a major transformation of our gathering and marketing business model during the primary driver compelling us to change our gathering and marketing business model was the december  replacement of the million guaranty facility from salomon with a million credit facility with citicorp north america  inc see note to consolidated financial statements and credit resources and liquidity 
as a result of this change  we reduced credit support from a daily average of million in salomon guarantees in to a daily average of million in letters of credit from citicorp 
we also reduced the direct cost of trade credit by half from million in to million in to achieve this result  we reduced our average bulk and exchange volumes by percent and our average wellhead volumes by percent from the levels 
we also actively redirected the focus of our lease gathering business to eliminate all volumes that required letters of credit but did not generate sufficient gross margin to support the cost of such credit support 
as a result of these and other changes  gathering and marketing gross margin per barrel increased from in to in the financial performance of the gathering and marketing business exceeded our expectations under the new business model 
we were pleased to be able to generate gross margin from the gathering and marketing business in that was percent of the gross margin generated in while reducing volumes by percent and credit support by percent 
we also were able to make permanent reductions to general and administrative expenses of million by this change to our business model 
as a result of the changes in our business activities described above  we were able to reduce inventory volumes at some locations that had been purchased in prior periods at prices significantly less than the prices at the time we sold those volumes 
these volumes had been necessary to ensure efficient and uninterrupted operations in our gathering and marketing activities 
prices for crude oil rose significantly during as is evidenced by the increase in the price of west texas intermediate crude oil wti on the new york mercantile exchange nymex  which rose from at december  to at december  by reducing this inventory in a period of increasing prices we recognized million of increased gross margin from the sale of this crude oil 
during  we took several steps to improve the profitability of our pipeline operations 
our strategy involved three key initiatives 
first  we evaluated our pipeline systems to determine which segments  if any  should be sold  idled or abandoned to reduce cost or risk of operation 
second  we increased our tariffs wherever feasible to achieve an acceptable risk adjusted rate of return 
third  we adjusted our pipeline loss allowances to levels consistent with our peers 
we idled or abandoned miles of pipeline on the texas system during we expect to sell  idle or abandon more of the texas system during while we have made progress evaluating strategic opportunities with respect to the texas and jay systems  these projects are still in progress and we have no substantial information to report at this time 
we increased most tariffs on the texas system by percent effective may  we were pleased that this tariff increase did not result in a significant decrease in volumes on the system 
for the jay system we increased tariffs by percent effective august  for all three systems we increased the pipeline loss allowance that we charge our shippers for assuming the operational risk of volumetric losses from to effective september  this adjustment placed us in line with most of our peers in the liquids pipeline transportation business 
this change is important to us since it reduces the risk of incurring economic loss from operational anomalies and creates some opportunity to profit from operating the pipeline in an effective manner 
we developed and implemented a plan during to place the mississippi system in condition to handle increased throughput expected from production increases in the area 
we implemented operational changes that will allow us to operate much of this pipeline at significantly reduced pressures and will allow us to monitor and evaluate activity on the system in a more effective manner 
we also completed the work necessary to restore the segment idled as a result of the leaf river spill 
we expect to complete testing and restart this segment early in financial results for were negatively impacted by the effects of sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities as amended and interpreted 
with the significant reduction in our bulk and exchange activities at december   combined with a review of existing contracts  we determined that we had only one contract meeting the requirement for treatment as a derivative contract under sfas no 
at december  as a result  the fair value of the net asset for derivatives decreased by million 
during  we did not make a regular quarterly distribution 
in december  we obtained a credit facility from citicorp north america to replace our guaranty facility and our credit agreement with bnp paribas 
see note this facility  however  includes a provision that does not allow us to pay a distribution for any quarter unless the borrowing base under the facility exceeded the usage under the facility for every day of the quarter by at least million plus the total amount of the distribution 
for the first and second quarters of  we did not pay distributions as the excess of the borrowing base over the usage was less than the required amount 
during the third and fourth quarters of  we met the test and were not restricted from making a distribution under the credit facility 
however  we did not make a regular quarterly distribution for these periods because of reserves established for future needs of the partnership 
such future needs include  but are not limited to the payment of fines imposed by regulatory agencies for the december crude oil spill and future expenditures that will be required for pipeline management integrity programs required by federal regulations 
because some of the partnership s unitholders were allocated taxable income for  we did make a special distribution in the amount of per unit on december  to unitholders of record as of december  the amount of taxable income allocated to each unitholder varied  depending on the timing of the unit purchases and the amount of each unitholder s basis in their units 
the distribution was made to mitigate the burden of incurring a tax liability without receiving a cash distribution 
more detailed discussion of the financial results for can be found below in liquidity and capital resources and results of operations 
more detailed discussion of the expectations for restoring the distribution can be found below in outlook for and beyond 
outlook for and beyond gathering and marketing operations the key drivers affecting our gathering and marketing gross margin include production volumes  volatility of p margins  volatility of grade differentials  inventory management  and credit costs 
a significant factor affecting our gathering and marketing gross margins is changes in the domestic production of crude oil 
short term and long term price trends impact the amount of capital that producers have available to maintain existing production and to invest in developing crude reserves  which in turn impacts the amount of crude oil that is available to be gathered and marketed by us and our competitors 
the volatility in prices over the last four years makes it very difficult to estimate the volume of crude oil available to purchase 
we expect to continue to be subject to volatility and long term declines in the availability of crude oil production for purchase by us 
oil prices rose in the latter half of such that the nymex price for wti was at december  international factors such as the strike by oil workers in venezuela and the potential for war with iraq as well as domestic influences such as the supply of crude oil in the united states have contributed to the price increase 
an increase in the market price of crude oil does not impact us to the extent many people expect 
when market prices for oil increase  we must pay more for crude oil  but we normally are able to sell it for more 
most of our contracts for the purchase and sale of crude oil have components in the pricing provisions such that the price paid or received is adjusted for changes in the market price for crude oil 
often the pricing in a contract to purchase crude oil will consist of the market price component and a bonus  which is generally a fixed amount ranging from a few cents to several dollars 
typically the pricing in a contract to sell crude oil will consist of the market price component and a bonus that is not fixed  but instead is based on another market factor 
this floating bonus is usually the price quoted by platt s for wti p plus 
because the bonus for purchases of crude oil is fixed and p plus floats in the sales contracts  the margin on an individual transaction can vary from month to month depending on changes in the p plus component 
p plus does not necessarily move in correlation with the price of oil in the market 
p plus is affected by numerous factors such as future expectations for changes in crude oil prices  such that crude oil prices can be rising  but p plus can be decreasing 
the table below shows the average p plus and the average posted price for west texas intermediate wti as posted by koch supply trading  lp for each month in month average p plus wti posting january february march april may june july august september october november december as can be seen from this table  changes in p plus do not necessarily correspond to changes in the market price of oil 
this unpredictable volatility in p plus can create volatility in our earnings 
a few purchase contracts and some sale contracts also include a component for grade differentials 
the grade refers to the type of crude oil 
crude oils from different wells and areas can have different chemical compositions 
these different grades of crude oil will appeal to different customers depending on the processing capabilities of the refineries who ultimately process the oil 
we may buy oil under a contract where we considered the typical grade differences in the market when we set the fixed bonus 
if we then sell the oil under a contract with a floating grade differential in the formula  and that grade differential fluctuates  then we can experience an increase or decrease in our gross margin from that oil purchase and sale 
the table below shows the grade differential between west texas intermediate grade crude oil and west texas sour grade crude oil for each month of and the differential between west texas intermediate grade crude oil and light louisiana sweet grade crude oil for each month of wti wts wti lls month differential differential january february march april may june july august september october november december as can be seen from this table  the wti wts market differential varied from in august to per barrel in december  the wti lls market differential varied from a negative in june to a positive in may this volatility in grade differentials can affect the volatility of our gathering and marketing gross margins 
the purchase and sales contracts are primarily evergreen contracts which means they continue from month to month unless one of the parties to the contract gives days notice of cancellation 
in order to change the pricing in a fixed bonus contract  we would have to give days notice that we want to cancel and renegotiate the contract 
this notice time requirement  therefore  means that at least a month will pass before the fixed bonus can be reduced to correspond with a decrease in the p plus component of the related sales contract 
in this case our margin would be reduced until such a change is made 
because of the volatility of p plus  it is not practical to renegotiate every purchase contract for every change in p plus 
so margins from the sale of the crude oil can be volatile as a result of these timing differences 
another factor that can contribute to volatility in our earnings is inventory management 
generally contracts for the purchase of crude oil will state that we will buy all of the production for the month from a particular well 
we generally aggregate the volumes purchased from numerous wells and deliver it into a pipeline where we sell the crude oil to a third party 
while oil producers can make estimates of the volume of oil that their wells will produce in a month  they cannot state absolutely how much oil will be produced 
our sales contracts typically state a specific volume to be sold 
consequently  if a well produces more than expected we will purchase volumes in a month that we have not contracted to sell 
these volumes are then held as inventory and are sold in a later month 
should the market price of crude oil fluctuate while we have these inventory volumes  we may have to record a loss in our financial statements should the market price fall below the cost of the inventory 
should market prices rise  then we will experience a gain when we sell the unexpected volume of inventory in a later month at higher prices 
we believe we have successfully changed our business model for our gathering and marketing activities to consume less credit support and working capital 
we expect this business to continue to perform well during  although not as well as in both volumes and margins are expected to be lower during as this business is likely to be subject to volatility and increased trade credit costs 
additionally  this business may be constrained by the need for trade credit if crude oil prices increase above current levels 
during  we expect gathering and marketing gross margins to decline due to an expected decrease in the volume of crude oil to be gathered during pipeline operations as discussed above in highlights of  volumes on our pipeline systems declined in additionally  operating and maintenance costs increased 
for  we expect that volumes may decline in some areas our pipelines serve  but overall average volumes to transport will likely increase from levels 
we also expect to expend funds on additional testing under the integrity management regulations and other large maintenance projects 
volumes on our texas system averaged  barrels per day in we expect that these volumes will decline in slightly  however the effect of the volume decline on tariff revenues for the year should be mitigated as the increase in tariffs that took effect in may will be in effect for all of in  we expect to test the webster to texas city segment as well as the cullen junction to webster sections under the integrity management regulations 
see discussion of the integrity management regulations in safety regulation under in item this testing in is expected to add over million to routine operating and maintenance expenses 
the results of the testing will likely result in upgrades to the pipeline which we have estimated will cost approximately million 
additional discussion of expectations for capital expenditures for the texas system can be found in capital expenditures in liquidity and capital resources below 
in  we stopped using segments of the texas system from bryan to satsuma and from satsuma to cullen junction 
in september  we entered into a joint tariff agreement with teppco crude pipeline company  lp for teppco to transport oil from satsuma to cullen junction 
during  we plan to idle these segments that are no longer in use 
to idle a segment of pipeline  we must purge the crude oil in the line and replace it with inert gas 
this process will add maintenance costs that we estimate to total less than million 
we are currently reviewing strategic opportunities for the texas system 
while the tariff increases in have improved the outlook for this system  we continue to examine opportunities for every part of the system to determine if each segment should be sold  abandoned or invested in for further growth 
as part of this examination  we must consider the ability to increase tariffs  which involves reviewing the alternatives available to shippers to move the oil on other pipelines or by truck  production and drilling in the area around the pipeline  the costs to test and improve our pipeline under integrity management regulations  and other maintenance and capital expenditure expectations 
the mississippi system is best analyzed in three segments 
the first segment is the portion of the pipeline that begins in soso  ms and extends to gwinville  ms where the spill occurred in we spent million in upgrading the pipeline from soso to gwinville 
we expect this segment of the pipeline to be fully operational during the first half of the second segment from gwinville to liberty has also been improved to handle the increased volumes produced by denbury and transported on the pipeline 
volumes on this segment have risen from a low of  barrels per day in february to almost  barrels per day in december in order to handle this higher volume  we have made capital expenditures for tank  station and pipeline improvements and we will need to make more 
see capital expenditures under liquidity and capital resources below 
the third segment of the pipeline from liberty to near baton rouge  la has been out of service since february  while a connecting carrier performs maintenance on its pipeline 
the connecting carrier expects to complete their maintenance activities in the second quarter of at that time we will need to determine if there are sufficient volumes available to be transported on this segment of pipeline to justify the costs to perform the integrity testing and possible upgrading that may be identified in that testing 
in  this segment of pipeline contributed million to pipeline revenues 
in  this segment contributed million to pipeline revenues 
as discussed above  denbury is the largest oil and natural gas producer in mississippi 
our mississippi pipeline is adjacent to several of denbury s existing and prospective oil fields 
there may be mutual benefits to denbury and us due to this common production and transportation area 
because of this relationship  we may be able to obtain certain commitments for increased crude oil volumes  while denbury may obtain the certainty of transportation for its oil production at competitive market rates 
as denbury continues to acquire and develop old oil fields using carbon dioxide co based tertiary recovery operations  denbury would expect to add crude oil gathering and co supply infrastructure to these fields 
further  as the fields are developed over time  it may create increased demand for our crude oil transportation services 
we believe that the highest and best use of the jay pipeline system in florida alabama would be to convert it to natural gas service 
we have entered into strategic alliances with parties in the region to explore this opportunity 
part of the process will involve finding alternative methods for us to continue to provide crude oil transportation services in the area 
while we believe this initiative has long term potential  it is not expected to have a substantial impact on us during or pipeline gross margins should decline slightly in we expect to obtain the benefit of the tariff increases for the full year as well as continued increases to throughput 
offsetting these revenue increases will be increased costs for maintenance  insurance and safety 
general and administrative expenses general and administrative expenses are expected to remain stable 
offsetting permanent cost reductions from the changed business model will be a one time adjustment for replacing the citicorp agreement with a new bank facility with fleet national bank as agent  and cost increases for insurance and other costs to comply with sec regulations mandated by the sarbanes oxley act 
capital expenditures an important factor affecting our outlook is capital expenditures 
in our form k  we indicated that we may need to increase capital expenditures as a result of complying with imp regulations and other regulatory requirements 
based on our preliminary experience with the imp program during  we have established a capital budget of million for for  we expect to make capital expenditures of million 
after  capital expenditures are expected to return to a normal pattern of approximately million per year 
access to capital in the first quarter of  we replaced the credit facility from citicorp north america  inc citicorp agreement with a three year million revolving loan and letter of credit facility with fleet national bank as agent fleet agreement 
the fleet agreement has terms similar to the terms in the citicorp agreement 
the details of those terms are described more fully below in liquidity and capital resources 
the main differences from the citicorp agreement are as follows a the new facility permits us to make acquisitions of assets that are used in our existing business  b the new facility does not have the million limitation on capital expenditures per year and c the new facility includes a restriction on our ability to make distributions that requires a difference of million between the borrowing base and utilization of the facility plus distributions  as measured once each month 
in the citicorp agreement  the borrowing base had to exceed utilization working capital borrowings plus outstanding letters of credit plus the amount of the distribution by million every day of the quarter in order for us to make a distribution 
as a result of the replacement of the citicorp agreement  the unamortized fees paid in december to obtain the citicorp agreement will be charged to expense in the first quarter of the amount of fees to be charged to expense is million 
our outlook will also be impacted by our access to capital for growth 
in march  we entered into the million three year revolving credit facility led by fleet bank to replace our existing facility 
the combination of obtaining this new facility and our relationship with denbury should improve our ability to grow the business 
however  based on our experience in obtaining this facility  we believe that it will be important for us to further strengthen our balance sheet and improve our financial metrics to be able to improve our access to significant capital for growth 
distribution expectations as a master limited partnership  the key consideration of our unitholders is the amount of our distribution  its reliability and the prospects for distribution growth 
as stated above  we made no regular distribution during we made no distribution with respect to the first two quarters of because of a restrictive covenant in our credit facility with citicorp 
we made no regular distribution for the third and fourth quarters as we added to reserves for the future needs of the partnership 
we did make a special distribution to our unitholders in december  to mitigate the burden of incurring a tax liability without receiving a cash distribution 
during we generated million of available cash before reserves  required debt payments and the special distribution 
during  we expect available cash before distributions to be less 
we expect to resume regular quarterly distributions during with an anticipated first quarter distribution of at least per unit on may   to unitholders of record as of april  based on the need for larger than normal capital expenditures to comply with the pipeline regulations during and and the need to strengthen our balance sheet to improve our access to capital for growth  and considering the restrictive covenant in our new credit facility  we do not expect to restore the regular distribution to the targeted minimum quarterly distribution amount of per quarter for the next year or two 
however  if we exceed our expectations for improving the performance of the business  if our capital projects cost less than we currently estimate  or if our access to capital allows us to make accretive acquisitions  we may be able to restore the targeted minimum quarterly distribution sooner 
liquidity and capital resources cash flows during  we generated cash flows from operating activities of million as compared to million for in  we reduced our current liabilities by million while our current assets declined by million 
in  we reduced our current liabilities by million while our current assets declined by million 
factors related to the timing of cash receipts and payments related to the bulk and exchange business were the primary reasons for the fluctuation in our current assets and liabilities in these periods 
cash flows used in investing activities in were million as compared to million in in we expended million for property and equipment additions 
these expenditures included replacement of pipe in mississippi and texas and upgrades to pipeline stations in mississippi to handle larger volumes of crude oil throughput  including building new tanks 
offsetting these expenditures in  were sales of surplus assets from which we received million 
in early  we sold our two seats on the nymex for million 
these seats had become surplus assets when the business model was changed to reduce bulk and exchange activities  reducing the level of nymex activity that genesis would need 
we also received million from the sale of excess land with a building 
in  we expended million for property and equipment  primarily in the pipeline operations 
we received million from the sale of tractors and trailers that were no longer needed as the fleet was replaced with new equipment leased from ryder transportation inc net cash expended for financing activities was million in as compared to million in in we reduced long term debt outstanding at year end by million from the balance at december  we also paid a special distribution of per unit in december  which utilized million of cash 
in  we reduced debt by million from the balance at december   and paid four quarterly distributions in the amount of per unit each  which utilized million of cash 
capital expenditures as discussed above  we expended million in for property and equipment 
we spent million for capital expenditures on the mississippi pipeline system  million on the texas pipeline system  and million for computer hardware  software  communication and other technological equipment used for pipeline and trucking operations 
the million spent for the mississippi pipeline system was for two purposes 
first  we made improvements to the pipeline from soso to gwinville where the crude oil spill had occurred in december to restore this segment to service 
this project was part of the imp program discussed below 
second  we improved the pipeline from gwinville to liberty to be able to handle increased volumes on that segment by adding tankage and making other improvements to station equipment 
in texas  we upgraded the west columbia segment of the pipeline and improved station equipment 
complying with department of transportation pipeline integrity management program imp regulations has been and will be a significant driver in determining the amount and timing of our capital expenditure requirements 
on march   the department of transportation promulgated the imp regulations 
the imp regulations require that we perform baseline assessments of all pipelines that could affect a high consequence area 
the integrity of these pipelines must be assessed by internal inspection  pressure test  or equivalent alternative new technology 
a high consequence area hca is defined as a a commercially navigable waterway  b an urbanized area that contains  or more people and has a density of at least  people per square mile  c other populated areas that contain a concentrated population  such as an incorporated or unincorporated city  town or village  and d an area of the environment that has been designated as unusually sensitive to oil spills 
due to the proximity of all of our pipelines to water crossings and populated areas  we have designated all of our pipelines as affecting hcas 
in accordance with the imp regulations  we prepared a written integrity management plan by march   that details our plans for testing and assessing each segment of the pipeline 
the imp regulations require that the baseline assessment be completed within seven years of march   with of the mileage assessed in the first three and one half years 
reassessment is then required every five years 
we expect to spend million in and million in for pipeline integrity testing that will be charged to pipeline operating expense as incurred 
as testing is complete  we are required to take prompt remedial action to address all integrity issues raised by the assessment 
the rehabilitation action required as a result of the assessment and testing is expected to impact our capital expenditure program by requiring us to make improvements to our pipeline 
this creates a difficult budgeting and planning challenge as we cannot predict the results of pipeline testing until they are completed 
based on estimated improvements required from assessments made during  we have estimated capital expenditures to be made during the imp assessment period from through these capital expenditure projections are based on very preliminary data regarding the cost of rehabilitation 
such capital expenditure projections will be updated as improved data is obtained 
during  million of the million in capital expenditures were for rehabilitation of the mississippi and texas pipeline systems 
based on actual experience during applied to our written imp plan  we expect to spend significant amounts in and for capital expenditures 
in  we estimate our capital expenditures will be approximately million 
we expect million of the million will be spent for capital improvements to our pipeline systems as result of the imp assessments 
of the remaining million in capital expenditures  substantially all of it will be spent on other pipeline improvements such as tankage  equipment upgrades  and corrosion control 
in  we expect the level of capital expenditures to be approximately million with million for pipeline integrity improvements and the balance of million for tankage and other improvements 
at the end of  we expect that we will have incurred most of the significant costs related to the imp regulatory compliance and expect to only spend million in for capital items  with million related to imp 
expenditures in years after should remain in the million to million level as the expected integrity improvements should not be as great on the segments of the pipelines with the lower risk 
capital resources in december  we entered into a two year million senior secured revolving credit facility citicorp agreement with citicorp to provide letters of credit and working capital borrowings 
in may  we elected  under the terms of the citicorp agreement  to amend the citicorp agreement to reduce the maximum facility amount to million 
the citicorp agreement contains a sublimit for working capital loans of million with the remainder available for letters of credit to support crude oil purchases 
in march  we replaced our citicorp agreement with a million three year credit facility with a group of banks with fleet national bank as agent fleet agreement 
the fleet agreement also has a sublimit for working capital loans in the amount of million  with the remainder of the facility available for letters of credit 
the key terms of the fleet agreement are as follows o letter of credit fees are based on the applicable usage level aul and will range from to 
during the first six months of the facility  the rate will be 
the aul is a function of the facility usage to the borrowing base on that day 
o the interest rate on working capital borrowings is also based on the aul and allows for loans based on the prime rate or the libor rate at our option 
the interest rate on prime rate loans can range from the prime rate plus to the prime rate plus 
the interest rate for libor based loans can range from the libor rate plus to the libor rate plus 
during the first six months of the facility  the rate will be the libor rate plus 
o we will pay a commitment fee on the unused portion of the million commitment 
this commitment fee is also based on the aul and will range from to 
during the first six months of the facility  the commitment fee will be 
o the amount that we may have outstanding cumulatively in working capital borrowings and letters of credit is subject to a borrowing base calculation 
the borrowing base as defined in the fleet agreement generally includes our cash balances  net accounts receivable and inventory  less deductions for certain accounts payable  and is calculated monthly 
o collateral under the fleet agreement consists of our accounts receivable  inventory  cash accounts  margin accounts and property and equipment 
o the fleet agreement contains covenants requiring a current ratio as defined in the fleet agreement  a leverage ratio as defined in the fleet agreement  a cash flow coverage ratio as defined in the fleet agreement  a funded indebtedness to capitalization ratio as defined in the fleet agreement  minimum ebitda  and limitations on distributions to unitholders 
under the citicorp agreement  distributions to unitholders and the general partner could only be made if the borrowing base exceeded the usage working capital borrowings plus outstanding letters of credit under the citicorp agreement for every day of the quarter by at least million plus the distribution 
under the fleet agreement  this provision is changed to require that the borrowing base exceed the usage under the fleet agreement by at least million plus the distribution measured once each month 
see additional discussion below under distributions 
at december   we had million outstanding under the citicorp agreement 
due to the revolving nature of loans under the citicorp agreement  additional borrowings and periodic repayments and re borrowings may be made until the maturity date of december  at december   we had letters of credit outstanding under the citicorp agreement totaling million  comprised of million and million for crude oil purchases related to december and january  respectively 
as a result of our decision to reduce the level of bulk and exchange transactions  credit support in the form of letters of credit has been less in than it was in however  any significant decrease in our financial strength  regardless of the reason for such decrease  may increase the number of transactions requiring letters of credit  which could restrict our gathering and marketing activities due to the limitations of the fleet agreement and borrowing base 
this situation could in turn adversely affect our ability to maintain or increase the level of our purchasing and marketing activities or otherwise adversely affect our profitability and available cash 
working capital our balance sheet reflects negative working capital of million 
the majority of this difference can be attributed to the accrual for the fines and penalties that we expect to pay to state and federal regulators related to the december mississippi oil spill 
that accrual is million 
as we have a working capital sublimit under the fleet agreement of million and have only borrowed million at december   we have the ability to borrow the funds to make the necessary payments 
contractual obligation and commercial commitments in addition to the citicorp agreement discussed above  we have contractual obligations under operating leases as well as commitments to purchase crude oil 
the table below summarizes these obligations and commitments at december  in thousands 
payments due by period less than after contractual cash obligations total year years years years operating leases      unconditional purchase obligations   total contractual cash obligations      the unconditional purchase obligations included above are contracts to purchase crude oil  generally at market based prices 
for purposes of this table  market prices at december   were used to value the obligations  such that actual obligations may differ from the amounts included above 
distributions the partnership agreement for genesis energy  lp provides that we will distribute of our available cash within days after the end of each quarter to unitholders of record and to the general partner 
available cash consists generally of all of our cash receipts less cash disbursements adjusted for net changes to reserves 
a full definition of available cash is set forth in the partnership agreement 
the partnership agreement indicates that the target minimum quarterly distribution mqd for each quarter is per unit 
under the terms of the citicorp agreement  we could not pay a distribution for any quarter unless the borrowing base exceeded the usage under the citicorp agreement working capital loans plus outstanding letters of credit for every day of the quarter by at least million plus the total amount of the distribution 
for the first and second quarters of  we did not pay a distribution as the excess of the borrowing base over the usage dropped below the required total 
during the third quarter of  we met this test and thus were not restricted from making a distribution under the citicorp agreement 
however  we did not make a distribution for the third quarter of because of a reserve established for future needs of the partnership 
these reserves exceeded available cash for the third quarter of similarly  we did not make a regular distribution for the fourth quarter of as reserves again exceeded available cash 
such future needs of the partnership include  but are not limited to  the fines that are being imposed in connection with the crude oil spill that occurred on the mississippi system in december and future expenditures that will be required for pipeline integrity management programs required by federal regulations that are described above under capital expenditures 
available cash before reserves for the year ended december   is as follows in thousands net income  depreciation and amortization  increase to environmental accrual  change in fair value of derivatives  net gain from asset sales  maintenance capital expenditures  available cash before reserves  special distribution paid in december  reduction of debt required in as a result of asset sales  remaining available cash before reserves  as discussed above in outlook for and beyond above  we expect to resume regular quarterly distributions during of at least per unit 
any decision to restore the distribution to the targeted minimum quarterly distribution will take into account our ability to sustain the distribution on an ongoing basis with cash generated by our existing asset base  capital requirements needed to maintain and optimize the performance of our asset base  and our ability to finance our existing capital requirements and accretive acquisitions 
for each of the first three quarters of  the partnership paid a distribution to the common unitholders and the general partner of per unit 
some of the partnership s unitholders were allocated taxable income for the amount of taxable income allocated to each unitholder varied  depending on the timing of unit purchases and the amount of each unitholder s tax basis in their units 
in order to mitigate the burden of incurring a tax liability without receiving a cash distribution  we made a special distribution in the amount of per unit on december  to unitholders of record as of december  industry credit market disruptions over the last eighteen months there have been an unusual number of business failures and large financial restatements by small as well as large companies in the energy industry 
because the energy industry is very credit intensive  these failures and restatements have focused attention on the credit risks of companies in the energy industry by credit rating agencies  producers and counterparties 
this focus on credit has affected us in two ways requests for credit from producers and extension of credit to counterparties 
while we have seen some increase in requests for credit support from producers primarily in the first quarter of  we have been relatively successful in obtaining open credit from most producers 
because we are an aggregator of crude oil  sales of crude oil tend to be large volume transactions 
in transacting business with our counterparties  we must decide how much credit to extend to each counterparty  as well as the form and amount of financial assurance to obtain from counterparties when credit is not extended 
we have modified our credit arrangements with certain counterparties that have been adversely affected by recent financial difficulties in the energy industry 
our accounts receivable settle monthly and collection delays generally relate only to discrepancies or disputes as to the appropriate price  volume or quality of crude oil delivered 
of the million aggregate receivables on our consolidated balance sheet at december   approximately million  or  were less than days past the invoice date 
ferc notice of proposed rulemaking on august   the federal energy regulatory commission ferc issued a notice of proposed rulemaking that  if adopted  would amend its uniform system of accounts for public utilities  natural gas companies and oil pipeline companies by requiring specific written documentation concerning the management of funds from a ferc regulated subsidiary by a non ferc regulated parent 
under the proposed rule  as a condition for participating in a cash management or money pool arrangement  the ferc regulated entity would be required to maintain a minimum proprietary capital balance stockholder s equity of percent  and the ferc regulated entity and its parent would be required to maintain investment grade credit ratings 
if either of these conditions is not met  the ferc regulated entity would not be eligible to participate in the cash management or money pool arrangement 
this proposed rule was subject to a comment period of days after its publication in the federal register 
a significant number of comments were received by the ferc 
hearings have been held by the ferc and industry organizations have submitted suggestions of changes to the proposed rule 
at this time  it is unclear when  or if  the rule will be enacted 
we believe that  if enacted as proposed  this rule may affect the manner in which we manage our cash  however  we are unable to predict the full impact of this proposed regulation on our business 
results of operations the following review of the results of operations and financial condition should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto 
selected financial data for this discussion of the results of operations follows  in thousands 
years ended december  revenues gathering marketing    pipeline    gross margin gathering marketing    pipeline    general and administrative expenses    depreciation and amortization    impairment of long lived assets  other operating charges    operating income loss   interest income expense  net   change in fair value of derivatives   cumulative effect of adoption of fas net gain on disposal of surplus assets  our profitability depends to a significant extent upon our ability to maximize gross margin 
gross margins from gathering and marketing operations are a function of volumes purchased and the difference between the price of crude oil at the point of purchase and the price of crude oil at the point of sale  minus the associated costs of aggregation and transportation 
the absolute price levels for crude oil do not necessarily bear a relationship to gross margin as absolute price levels normally impact revenues and cost of sales by equivalent amounts 
because period to period variations in revenues and cost of sales are not generally meaningful in analyzing the variation in gross margin for gathering and marketing operations  such changes are not addressed in the following discussion 
in our gathering and marketing business  we seek to purchase and sell crude oil at points along the distribution chain where we can achieve positive gross margins 
we generally purchase crude oil at prevailing prices from producers at the wellhead under short term contracts 
we then transport the crude along the distribution chain for sale to or exchange with customers 
additionally  we enter into exchange transactions with third parties 
we generally enter into exchange transactions only when the cost of the exchange is less than the alternate cost we would incur in transporting or storing the crude oil 
in addition  we often exchange one grade of crude oil for another to maximize margins or meet contract delivery requirements 
prior to the first quarter of  we purchased crude oil in bulk at major pipeline terminal points 
these bulk and exchange transactions were characterized by large volumes and narrow profit margins on purchases and sales 
generally  as we purchase crude oil  we simultaneously establish a margin by selling crude oil for physical delivery to third party users  such as independent refiners or major oil companies 
through these transactions  we seek to maintain a position that is substantially balanced between crude oil purchases  on the one hand  and sales or future delivery obligations  on the other hand 
it is our policy not to hold crude oil  futures contracts or other derivative products for the purpose of speculating on crude oil price changes 
year ended december  compared with year ended december  gross margin 
gathering and marketing gross margins decreased million or to million for the year ended december   as compared to million for the year ended december  the factors affecting gross margin were o an increase in gross margin of million due to an increase in the average difference between the price of crude oil at the point of purchase and the price of crude oil at the point of sale  o a percent decrease in wellhead  bulk and exchange purchase volumes between and  resulting in a decrease in gross margin of million  o a decrease of million in credit costs primarily due to the reduction in bulk and exchange transactions  o a million increase in gross margin in the period as a result of the sale of crude oil that is no longer needed to ensure efficient and uninterrupted operations  and o an increase of million in field operating costs  primarily from a million increase in payroll and benefits  a million increase in repair costs  and a million increase in insurance costs 
the increased payroll related costs and fuel costs can be attributed to an approximate percent increase in the miles driven in our trucks 
the increase in repair costs is attributable primarily to repairs at truck unloading stations 
the increased insurance costs reflect a combination of changes in the insurance market and the partnership s loss history 
as discussed previously  we changed our business model in to substantially eliminate our bulk and exchange activity due to the relatively low margins and high credit requirements for these transactions 
additionally  we reviewed our wellhead purchase contracts to determine whether margins under those contracts would support higher credit costs 
in some cases  contracts were cancelled 
these volume reductions were the primary reasons gathering and marketing volumes decreased by 
pipeline gross margin increased million or to million for the year ended december   as compared to million for the year ended december  the factors affecting pipeline gross margin were o an increase in revenues from sales of pipeline loss allowance barrels of million primarily as a result of revising pipeline tariffs to increase the amount of the pipeline loss allowance imposed on shippers  and the recognition of pipeline loss allowance volumes  measurement gains net of measurement losses  and crude quality deductions as inventory  o an increase of percent in the average tariff on shipments resulting in an increase in revenue of million  o a decrease in throughput of percent between the two years  resulting in a revenue decrease of million  and o an increase in pipeline operating costs of million in primarily due to greater expenditures for personnel and benefits  for maintenance of right of ways including clearing of tree canopies and costs associated with residential and commercial development around our pipelines  for testing under the pipeline integrity management regulations  for tank and station maintenance projects  for safety  training and related projects  for liability and property damage insurance  and for other operating costs  offset by reduced power costs and lower costs for remote monitoring and control 
personnel and benefits costs increased million primarily as a result of additions to the operations staff in mississippi and costs associated with work vehicles for the new staff added million 
costs associated with maintenance of right of ways and testing under pipeline integrity regulations increased a combined million 
tank and station maintenance expenses increased million 
in  we increased safety training for our pipeline operations personnel at a cost of million 
additionally we undertook a project to add global positioning satellite information to our pipeline maps as required pursuant to pipeline safety regulations 
expenses incurred on this project in totaled million 
insurance costs increased by million due to the combination of insurance market conditions and our loss history 
other operating costs  including corrosion control and tank rentals  increased by million 
power costs were lower by million due to electricity deregulation in texas 
our remote monitoring and control costs were lower by million as we completed the transition in early from a more expensive service 
general and administrative expenses 
general and administrative expenses decreased million in from the level 
changes in personnel costs primarily due to the elimination of bulk and exchange activities reduced generaland administrative expenses million  and charges from our bonus program were million less in the remaining decrease of million is attributable to decreases in expenses for legal  tax and other professional services  offset by small increases in administrative insurance costs and contract labor costs 
depreciation and amortization 
depreciation and amortization expense decreased million in from the level 
as a result of the impairment of the pipeline assets in  the value to be depreciated was reduced 
other operating charge 
in  we reached an agreement in principle with the federal and state regulatory authorities regarding the fines we would pay related to the spill that occurred in december in mississippi 
the cost to us under the agreement is expected to be million 
in the fourth quarter of we accrued million for this potential fine and in the third quarter of another million was accrued 
interest income expense  net 
in  the partnership had an increase in its net interest expense of million 
in  the partnership paid commitment fees on the unused portion of its million facility with bnp paribas 
in the period  the partnership paid commitment fees on the unused portion of the credit agreement with citicorp 
from january   until may   that facility maximum was million 
at may   the credit agreement was reduced to a maximum of million 
the larger amount of the credit facility resulted in substantially higher commitment fees in change in fair value of derivatives 
as a result of the significant reduction in our bulk and exchange activities at december   and a review of contracts existing at december   we determined that substantially all of our contracts do not meet the requirement for treatment as derivative contracts under sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities as amended and interpreted 
the contracts were designated as normal purchases and sales under the provisions for that treatment in sfas no 
as a result  the fair value of the partnership s net asset for derivatives decreased by million for the nine months ended september  at december   the only contracts qualifying as a derivative under sfas no 
were a cash flow hedge of inventory 
the change in the fair value of these contracts at december  was a loss of  which is reflected as a reduction of consolidated comprehensive income 
the consolidated balance sheet includes  in other current liabilities as a result of recording the fair value of derivatives 
the fair value of our derivative contracts at december   was determined using the sources for fair value as shown in the table below in thousands 
fair value of contracts at period end maturity maturity maturity in less than excess of total source of fair value months months months fair value prices actively quoted prices provided by other external sources prices based on models and other valuation methods total net gain on disposal of surplus assets 
in  we disposed of our seats on the nymex for million  resulting in a gain of million 
the changes we made in our business model to reduce our bulk and exchange activities eliminated our reasons for owning the nymex seats 
additionally  in  we sold surplus land and a building and surplus used vehicles resulting in additional cumulative net gains of million 
in  we made the decision to lease our tractor trailer fleet from ryder transportation services 
the majority of the existing fleet was sold in and cash proceeds of million and a gain of million in were realized in from this sale 
year ended december  compared with year ended december  gross margin 
gathering and marketing gross margins increased million or to million for the year ended december   as compared to million for the year ended december  the factors affecting gross margin were o a percent increase in the average difference between the price of crude oil at the point of purchase and the price of crude oil at the point of sale  which increased gross margin by million  o a decrease of percent in wellhead  bulk and exchange purchase volumes between and  resulting in a decrease in gross margin of million  o a decrease of million in credit costs primarily due to a percent decrease in the average absolute price level of crude oil and the decrease in purchase volumes  and o an increase of million in field operating costs  primarily from a million increase in rental costs due to the replacement of the tractor trailer fleet with a leased fleet in the fourth quarter of  a million increase in payroll and benefits  and a million increase in insurance costs  offset by million decrease in repair costs 
the increased payroll related costs and fuel costs can be attributed to an approximate increase in the number of barrels transported by the partnership in trucks 
the increased insurance costs reflect a combination of changes in the insurance market and the partnership s loss history 
the decline in repair costs is attributable to the change to the use of leased vehicles under a full service maintenance lease 
in addition  gross margin in included an unrealized loss on written option contracts of million 
in the latter half of  genesis began making changes to its business operations to prepare for the change from the million guaranty facility with salomon to a smaller letter of credit facility 
these changes resulted in a substantial decrease in the partnership s bulk and exchange activity due to the relatively low margins and high credit requirements on these transactions 
additionally  the partnership began reviewing its wellhead purchase contracts to determine whether margins under those contracts would support higher credit costs 
in some cases  contracts were cancelled 
these volume reductions were the primary reasons gathering and marketing volumes decreased by 
see outlook below for additional discussion of these changes to business operations 
pipeline gross margin decreased million or to million for the year ended december   as compared to million for the year ended december  pipeline revenues declined million as a result of small declines in throughput and average tariffs 
revenues from sales of pipeline loss allowance barrels decreased million as a result of lower crude prices 
pipeline operating costs were million higher in the period primarily due to a million increase in maintenance costs  a million increase in insurance costs  a million increase in payroll and related benefits and a increase in general operating costs 
the increased insurance costs reflect the combination of changes in the insurance market and the partnership s loss history 
general and administrative expenses 
general and administrative expenses increased million in from the level 
in  the partnership s costs for professional services and contract labor increased million  primarily as a result of the proposed sale of the general partner and related legal and consulting costs 
see termination of proposed general partner sale below 
also contributing to the increase in general and administrative costs was a million increase in salaries and benefits and million of severance costs incurred as a result of a reduction in personnel 
the number of personnel was reduced to reflect the reduced bulk purchases planned by the partnership  as well as the overall decline in operating income 
offsetting the increases that total million was a reduction in expenses of million related to the restricted unit plan 
depreciation and amortization 
depreciation and amortization expense decreased million in from the level 
this decrease is primarily attributable to the sale in the last quarter of of the partnership s tractor trailer fleet  thereby reducing depreciation  combined with the completion of depreciation on assets of the partnership that had reached the end of their depreciable lives 
impairment of long lived assets 
as a result of declining revenues and significant increases in costs for operations and maintenance combined with regulatory changes requiring additional testing for pipeline integrity  the partnership determined that its estimated undiscounted future cash inflows from the pipeline assets is less than the carrying value of those assets 
as a result  the partnership wrote the assets down to their estimated fair value in accordance with statement of financial accounting standard no 
 accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and long lived assets to be disposed of fas 
an impairment charge of million was recorded  with million recorded to accumulated depreciation of the pipeline assets and million recorded to accumulated amortization of goodwill 
other operating charge 
in  the partnership recorded a charge of million related to environmental matters  including the mississippi spill that occurred in december in  other operating charges included million of costs related to the restructuring of the partnership in december this million of costs consisted primarily of legal and accounting fees  financial advisor fees  proxy solicitation expenses and the costs to print and mail a proxy statement to common unitholders 
interest income expense  net 
in  the partnership had a decrease in its net interest expense of million 
interest expense decreased million and interest income decreased million 
average daily debt outstanding declined by million  resulting in the decrease in interest expense 
interest income decreased primarily as a result of lower interest rates 
change in fair value of derivatives 
the partnership utilizes crude oil futures contracts and other financial derivatives to reduce its exposure to unfavorable changes in crude oil prices 
on january   the partnership adopted the provisions of sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  which established new accounting and reporting guidelines for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
sfas no 
established accounting and reporting standards requiring that every derivative instrument including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts be recorded in the balance sheet as either an asset or liability measured at its fair value 
sfas no 
requires that changes in the derivative s fair value be recognized currently in earnings unless specific hedge accounting criteria are met 
under sfas no 
 the partnership marks to fair value all of its derivative instruments at each period end with changes in fair value being recorded as unrealized gains or losses 
such unrealized gains or losses will change  based on prevailing market prices  at each balance sheet date prior to the period in which the transaction actually occurs 
in general  sfas no 
requires that at the date of initial adoption  the difference between the fair value of derivative instruments and the previous carrying amount of those derivatives be recorded in net income or other comprehensive income  as appropriate  as the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle 
on january   recognition of the partnership s derivatives resulted in a gain of million  which was recognized in the consolidated statement of operations as the cumulative effect of adopting sfas no 
certain derivative contracts related to written option contracts had been recorded on the balance sheet at fair value at december   so no adjustment was necessary for those contracts upon adoption of sfas no 
net gain on disposal of surplus assets 
in  management of the general partner made the decision to lease its tractor trailer fleet from ryder transportation services 
the majority of the existing fleet was sold  resulting in cash proceeds of million and a gain of million in and proceeds of million and a net gain of million in the partnership sold additional surplus assets  which resulted in proceeds of million and a gain of million in other matters crude oil contamination the partnership was named one of the defendants in a complaint filed on january   in the th district court of harris county  texas  cause no 
pennzoil quaker state company pqs seeks property damages  loss of use and business interruption suffered as a result of a fire and explosion that occurred at the pennzoil quaker state refinery in shreveport  louisiana  on january  pqs claims the fire and explosion was caused  in part  by genesis selling to pqs crude oil that was contaminated with organic chlorides 
we believe that the suit is without merit and intend to vigorously defend ourselves in this matter 
we believe that any potential liability will be covered by insurance 
pqs is also a defendant in five suits brought by neighbors living in the vicinity of the pqs shreveport  louisiana refinery in the first judicial district court  caddo parish  louisiana  cause nos 
 a 
 b   a   a  and  c 
pqs has brought third party demand against genesis and others for indemnity with respect to the fire and explosion of january  we believe that the demand against genesis is without merit and intend to vigorously defend ourselves in this matter 
we believe that any potential liability will substantially be covered by insurance 
insurance we maintain insurance of various types that we consider adequate to cover our operations and properties 
the insurance policies are subject to deductibles that we consider reasonable 
the policies do not cover every potential risk associated with operating our assets  including the potential for a loss of significant revenues 
consistent with the coverage available in the industry  our policies provide limited pollution coverage  with broader coverage for sudden and accidental pollution events 
additionally  as a result of the events of september  the cost of insurance available to the industry has risen significantly  and insurers have excluded or reduced coverage for losses due to acts of terrorism and sabotage 
since september   warnings have been issued by various agencies of the united states government to advise owners and operators of energy assets that those assets may be a future target of terrorist organizations 
any future terrorist attacks on our assets  or assets of our customers or competitors could have a material adverse affect on our business 
we believe that we are adequately insured for public liability and property damage to others as a result of our operations 
however  no assurances can be given that an event not fully insured or indemnified against will not materially and adversely affect our operations and financial condition 
additionally  no assurance can be given that we will be able to maintain insurance in the future at rates that we consider reasonable 
new accounting pronouncements sfas in june   the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for asset retirement obligations 
this statement requires entities to record the fair value of a liability for legal obligations associated with the retirement obligations of tangible long lived assets in the period in which it is incurred 
when the liability is initially recorded  a corresponding increase in the carrying amount of the related long lived asset would be recorded 
over time  accretion of the liability is recognized each period  and the capitalized cost is depreciated over the useful life of the related asset 
upon settlement of the liability  an entity either settles the obligation for its recorded amount or incurs a gain or loss on settlement the standard is effective for genesis on january  with respect to our pipelines  federal regulations will require us to purge the crude oil from our pipelines when the pipelines are retired 
our right of way agreements do not require us to remove pipe or otherwise perform remediation upon taking the pipelines out of service 
many of our truck unload stations are on leased sites that require that we remove our improvements upon expiration of the lease term 
for our pipelines  we expect that we will be unable to reasonably estimate and record liabilities for the majority of our obligations that fall under the provisions of this statement because we cannot reasonably estimate when such obligations would be settled 
for the truck unload stations  the site leases have provisions such that the lease continues until one of the parties gives notice that it wishes to end the lease 
at this time we cannot reasonably estimate when such notice would be given and when the obligations to remove our improvements would be settled 
we will record asset retirement obligations in the period in which we determine the settlement dates

the adoption of this statement did not have a material effect on our results of operations 
sfas in june  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities  which addresses accounting for restructuring and similar costs 
sfas no 
supersedes previous accounting guidance  principally eitf issue no 
we will adopt the provisions of sfas no 
for restructuring activities initiated after december  sfas no 
requires that the liability for costs associated with an exit or disposal activity be recognized when the liability is incurred 
under issue no 
 a liability for an exit cost was recognized at the date of commitment to an exit plan 
sfas no 
also establishes that the liability should initially be measured and recorded at fair value 
accordingly  sfas no 
may affect the timing of recognizing future restructuring costs as well as the amounts recognized 
the impact that sfas no 
will have on our consolidated financial statements will depend on the circumstances of any specific exit or disposal activity 
interpretation no 
in november  the fasb issued interpretation no 
 guarantor s accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees  including indirect guarantees of indebtedness of others 
this interpretation of sfas no 
 and  and rescission of fasb interpretation no 
elaborates on the disclosures to be made by a guarantor in its interim and annual financial statements about its obligations under certain guarantees that it has issued 
it also clarifies that a guarantor is required to recognize  at the inception of a guarantee  a liability for the fair value of the obligation undertaken in issuing the guarantee 
the initial recognition and initial measurement provisions of this interpretation are applicable on a prospective basis to guarantees issued or modified after december  the disclosure requirements in this interpretation are effective for financial statements of interim or annual periods after december  sfas in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure  which provides alternative methods of transition from a voluntary change to the fair value based method of accounting for stock based employee compensation 
in addition  sfas no 
amends the disclosure requirements of sfas no 
in both annual and interim financial statements 
sfas no 
is effective for financial statements for fiscal years ending after december   and financial reports containing condensed financial statements for interim periods beginning after december  at this time  there are no outstanding grants of partnership units under our restricted unit plan see note 
therefore  we do not believe that the adoption of this statement will have a material effect on either our financial position  results of operations  cash flows or disclosure requirements 
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities  if any  at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
although we believe these estimates are reasonable  actual results could differ from those estimates 
the critical accounting policies and estimates that we have identified are discussed below 
depreciation  amortization and impairment of long lived assets we calculate depreciation and amortization based on useful lives estimated at the time the assets are placed in service 
events in future periods  however  can cause us to change our estimates  thus impacting the future calculation of depreciation and amortization 
when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable  we compare the carrying value of the fixed asset to the estimated undiscounted future cash flows from that asset 
should the undiscounted future cash flows be less than the carrying value  we record an impairment charge to reflect the asset at fair value 
fair value is determined by discounting the future estimated cash flows 
determination as to whether and how much an asset is impaired involves numerous management estimates 
impairment reviews and calculations are based on assumptions that are consistent with our business plans 
in  we recorded an impairment charge to our pipeline assets and goodwill totaling million 
additionally we adjusted the remaining useful lives of our pipeline assets to be consistent with the determination of the period of time when we would expect future estimated cash flows from the assets 
revenue and expense accruals we routinely make accruals for both revenues and expenses due to the timing of compiling billing information  receiving third party information and reconciling our records with those of third parties 
additionally the provisions of sfas no 
 require estimates to be made of the effectiveness of derivatives as hedges and the fair value of derivatives 
the actual results of the transactions involving the derivative instruments will most likely differ from the estimates 
we base these estimates on information obtained from third parties and our internal records 
we believe our estimates for revenue and expense items are reasonable  but there can be no assurance that actual amounts will not vary from estimated amounts 
liability and contingency accruals we accrue reserves for contingent liabilities including  but not limited to  environmental remediation and potential legal claims 
when our assessment indicates that it is probable that a liability has occurred and the amount of the liability can be reasonably estimated  accruals are made 
our estimates are based on all known facts at the time and our assessment of the ultimate outcome  including consultation with external experts and counsel 
these estimates are revised as additional information is obtained or resolution is achieved 
in  we recorded an estimate of million for the potential liability for fines related to the crude oil spill in december  from our mississippi pipeline system 
based on new information obtained in meetings with regulators  this estimate was increased to a total of million in item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our primary price risk relates to the effect of crude oil price fluctuations on our inventories and the fluctuations each month in grade and location differentials and their affect on future contractual commitments 
we utilize nymex commodity based futures contracts and forward contracts to hedge its exposure to these market price fluctuations 
we believe the hedging program has been effective in minimizing overall price risk 
at december   we used futures contracts exclusively in its hedging program with the latest contract being settled in february information about these contracts is contained in the table set forth below 
sell short buy long contracts contracts crude oil inventory volume  bbls carrying value in thousands  fair value in thousands  commodity future contracts contract volumes  bbls weighted average price per bbl contract value in thousands mark to market change in thousands market settlement value in thousands the table above presents notional amounts in barrels  the weighted average contract price  total contract amount in us dollars and the market settlement value amount in us dollars 
the market settlement value was determined by using the notional amount in barrels multiplied by the december  closing prices of the applicable nymex futures contract adjusted for location and grade differentials  as necessary
