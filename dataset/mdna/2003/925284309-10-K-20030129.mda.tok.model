we caution investors that forward looking statements are only predictions or estimates based upon our current expectations about future events 
the forward looking statements are not guarantees of future performance and are subject to significant risks and uncertainties that are difficult to predict 
our actual results and performance may differ materially from the results and performance anticipated by any forward looking statements due to these risks and uncertainties  some of which are discussed below in this item under the heading risk factors 
readers are urged to carefully review and consider the various disclosures made by us in this report and in our other reports filed with the securities and exchange commission that attempt to advise interested parties of the risks and factors that may affect our business 
overview we were incorporated in august our principal products are the versant developer suite  or vds  a sixth generation object database management system  and versant enjin  a database management product suite for e business that accelerates transactions for application servers 
we commenced commercial shipment of vds in and commercially released versant enjin in we license vds  versant enjin and peripheral products  and sell associated maintenance support and training and consulting services to end users through our direct sales force and through value added resellers  systems integrators and distributors 
substantially all of our revenue has been derived from sales of licenses for vds and versant enjin  related maintenance and support  training and consulting services nonrecurring engineering fees received in connection with providing services associated with vds and versant enjin  sales of peripheral products for vds and versant enjin  and the resale of licenses  maintenance  training and consulting for third party products that complement vds and versant enjin 
throughout  we continued to focus on three major sales and product development initiatives enhancement of and revenue growth for vds  enhancement of and revenue growth for versant enjin  and growth in our consulting programs 
shortly after the end of our fiscal year ended october   we also announced our intention to pursue a new real time business initiative  which we commenced with our november acquisition of mokume software 
we expect that licenses of vds  versant enjin  related products  new products we develop in our real time business and third party products and sales of associated services will be our principal sources of revenue for the foreseeable future 
while it will continue to be important for us to derive revenue from customers we have historically served in the telecommunications and financial services industries  we believe that our future performance will depend to a significant degree on both the continued growth of the e business market and our ability to successfully pursue the market we believe exists for real time computing products 
success in the e business marketplace and in the market for real time products will depend on both the successful growth and emergence of these markets and their continued need for highly scalable  high performance and reliable object based technologies such as ours 
our business will likely be materially and adversely affected if the e business and real time computing markets fail to grow and develop as quickly as we have anticipated  or if our products fail to perform favorably in  or fail to become an accepted component of  either of these markets 
critical accounting policies the preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amount of our assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and of our revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
we base these estimates on historical experience and trends  our projections of future results  and on industry  economic and seasonal fluctuations 
although we believe these estimates are reasonable under the circumstances  and based on the information reasonably available to us  there can be no assurances that this is so given that the application of these accounting policies necessarily involves the exercise of judgment and the use of assumptions as to future uncertainties 
we consider critical those accounting policies that require our most difficult  subjective  or complex judgments  and that are the most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations 
these critical accounting policies relate to revenue recognition  goodwill valuation and the determination of our reserve for doubtful accounts 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue in accordance with the provisions of statement of position sop  software revenue recognition and sop  modification of sop  software revenue recognition  with respect to certain transactions 
revenue consists mainly of revenue earned under software license agreements and maintenance support agreements and agreements for consulting and training activities 
we license our products to end users  value added resellers and distributors through two types of perpetual licenses development licenses and deployment licenses 
development licenses are typically sold on a per seat basis and authorize a customer to develop an application program that uses vds or versant enjin 
before that customer may deploy an application that it has developed under our development license  it must purchase deployment licenses based on the number of computers connected to the server that will run the application using our database management system 
for certain applications  we offer deployment licenses priced on a per user basis 
pricing of vds and versant enjin varies according to several factors  including the number of computer servers on which the application will run and the number of users that will be able to access the server at any one time 
customers may elect to simultaneously purchase development and deployment licenses for an entire project 
these development and deployment licenses may also provide for prepayment of a nonrefundable amount for future deployment 
revenue from software license arrangements  including prepayment revenue  is recognized when all of the following criteria are met persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred  the fee is fixed and determinable  and collection is probable 
if an acceptance period or other contingency exists  revenue is recognized upon satisfaction of the contingency  customer acceptance or expiration of the acceptance period 
resellers  including value added resellers and distributors  purchase development licenses from us on a per seat basis  on terms similar to those of development licenses sold directly to end users 
resellers are authorized to sublicense deployment copies of vds or versant enjin that are either bundled or embedded in the resellers applications and sold directly to end users 
resellers are required to report their distribution of versant software and are charged a royalty that is based either on the number of copies of application software distributed or computed as a percentage of the selling price charged by the reseller to its end user customers 
revenue from royalties is recognized when reported by the reseller  assuming collection is probable 
revenue from our resale of third party products is recorded at total contract value with the corresponding cost included in cost of sales when we act as a principal in these transactions and assume the risks and rewards of ownership  including the risk of loss for collection  delivery or returns 
when we do not assume the risks and rewards of ownership  revenue from our resale of third party products or services is recorded at contract value net of the cost of sales 
probability of collection is assessed using the following customer information credit service reports  bank and trade references  public filings  and or current financial statements 
prior payment experience is reviewed on all existing customers 
payment terms in excess of our standard payment terms of days net  are granted on an exception basis  typically in situations where customers elect to purchase development and deployment licenses simultaneously for an entire project and are attempting to align their payments with deployment schedules 
extended payment terms are generally only granted to customers with a proven ability to pay at the time the order is received  and with prior approval of our senior management 
we use the residual method to recognize revenue when a license agreement includes one or more elements to be delivered at a future date 
if there is an undelivered element under the license arrangement  we defer revenue based on vendor specific objective evidence of the fair value of the undelivered element  as determined by the price charged when the element is sold separately 
if vendor specific objective evidence of fair value does not exist for all undelivered elements  we defer all revenue until sufficient evidence exists or all elements have been delivered 
we defer revenue from license arrangements that require significant modification of the software and or non recurring engineering agreements requiring future obligations not yet performed and record it as revenue using contract accounting 
we defer revenue from maintenance and support arrangements and recognize it ratably over the term of the arrangement  which is typically twelve months 
training and consulting revenue is recognized when a purchase order is received  the services have been performed and collection is deemed probable 
consulting services are billed on an hourly  daily or monthly rate 
training classes are billed based on group or individual attendance 
goodwill valuation we periodically evaluate whether events and circumstances have occurred which indicate that the remaining carrying value of goodwill may not be recoverable 
when factors indicate that goodwill should be evaluated for possible impairment  we will use an estimate of undiscounted future net cash flows to determine if the impairment has occurred 
if we determine that goodwill has been impaired  we will record an impairment loss equal to the excess of the carrying amount of the goodwill over its fair value 
reserve for doubtful accounts our reserve for doubtful accounts includes the specific identification of bad debts and an unallocated reserve for doubtful accounts receivable 
the unallocated reserve is an estimate based on our collection experience  bad debt write off history  economic factors that may effect customers abilities to pay  and accounts receivable aging trends 
results of operations in  we filed a report on form k reporting the decision by our board of directors to change our fiscal year end from december to october this change was made to better align our sales and financial reporting cycle with our customers procurement cycles 
consequently  the consolidated financial statements in
