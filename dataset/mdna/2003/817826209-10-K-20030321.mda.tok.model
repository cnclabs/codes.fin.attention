item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations this report includes certain statements that are forward looking statements within the meaning of the private securities litigation reform act of any statement in this report that is not a statement of historical fact may be deemed to be a forward looking statement 
we often use these types of statements when discussing our plans and strategies  our anticipation of revenues from designated markets and statements regarding the development of our businesses  the markets for our services and products  our anticipated capital expenditures  operations  support systems  changes in regulatory requirements and other statements contained in this report regarding matters that are not historical facts 
when used in this report  the words expect  anticipate  intend  plan  believe  seek  estimate  and other similar expressions are generally intended to identify forward looking statements 
because these forward looking statements involve risks and uncertainties  actual results may differ materially from those expressed or implied by these forward looking statements 
there can be no assurance that i we have correctly measured or identified all of the factors affecting us or the extent of their likely impact  ii the publicly available information with respect to these factors on which our analysis is based is complete or accurate  iii our analysis is correct  or iv our strategy  which is based in part on this analysis  will be successful 
we do not assume any obligation to update or revise any forward looking statements  whether as a result of new information  future events or otherwise 
general we are the world s largest operator  franchisor and licensor of convenience stores and the world s largest convenience store chain 
our revenues principally consist of retail sales of merchandise and gasoline 
to a lesser extent  we generate royalty revenues  mainly from international licensed stores 
our primary expenses consist of cost of goods sold  operating  selling  general and administrative expense  interest expense and taxes 
we seek to meet the changing needs of convenience customers and maintain a leadership position in the convenience store industry by leveraging our scale  technology  people and widely recognized brand 
in  we will continue to focus on our traditional convenience store business as well as our growth strategy to further our competitive advantage and improve our financial results 
critical accounting policies and estimates estimates our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of our consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
the results of these estimates form the basis for our judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ materially from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
see note to the consolidated financial statements 

table of contents franchisees we consolidate all merchandise sales and cost of goods sold from stores operated by franchisees with the results of company operated stores 
we split the merchandise gross profit of franchise stores between our franchisees  who generally receive of the gross profit  and ourselves 
our share of the merchandise gross profit of franchise stores represents the ongoing royalty 
with regard to gasoline sales  our franchise agreements in most instances require us to pay the franchisee one cent per gallon sold as compensation for the services our franchisees perform related to gasoline 
by practice  in recent years we have paid our franchisees of the gasoline gross profit if that sum is higher than one cent per gallon sold  but we are not required to continue doing so 
the franchisees share of the merchandise and gasoline gross profit is presented as franchisee gross profit expense in the accompanying consolidated statements of earnings 
if we did not consolidate the franchisee merchandise revenues and cost of goods sold into our consolidated financial results  our net earnings would not change  our consolidated statements of earnings  however  would not reflect any franchise gross profit expense and would reflect significantly lower merchandise revenues and cost of goods sold 
instead  our share of the earnings from franchised stores would be reflected as other income in our consolidated statements of earnings 
we include the franchise stores merchandise sales and cost of sales in our financial statements because we believe that we retain a more significant financial and merchandising advisory role in the franchise business than is present in most other franchisor franchisee relationships 
for example  unlike most franchise models  we own or lease the stores and equipment used by the franchisees as well as provide accounting  merchandising and other services 
due to this significant level of involvement and our retention of certain business risks associated with the ownership or leasing of franchised locations and the equipment used by franchisees  we believe that our financial statement presentation appropriately reflects the substance of this combined economic relationship 
see note to the consolidated financial statements 
environmental we accrue for the estimated future costs related to remediation activities at existing and previously operated gasoline storage sites and other operating and non operating properties where releases of regulated substances have been detected 
our estimates of the anticipated future costs for remediation activities at such sites are based on our prior experience with remediation sites 
in addition  we consider factors such as the condition of the site contamination  location of tank sites and our experience with contractors who perform environmental assessment and remediation work 
we determine the reserve on a site by site basis and record a liability for remediation activities when it is probable that corrective action will be taken and the cost of the remediation activities can be reasonably estimated 
a portion of the environmental expenditures we incur for remediation activities is eligible for reimbursement under state trust funds and reimbursement programs 
we record a receivable for estimated probable refunds at the same time that we record the liability 
the amount of the receivable is based on our historical collection experience with the specific state fund or other state funds  the financial status of the state fund and our priority ranking for reimbursement from the state fund 
we discount the receivable if the amount relates to remediation activities that have already been completed 

table of contents the estimated future remediation expenditures and related state reimbursement amounts could change within the near future as governmental requirements and state reimbursement programs continue to be implemented or revised 
such revisions could have a material impact on our operations and financial position

store closings and asset impairment the results of operations of certain owned and leased stores are presented as discontinued operations in accordance with the provisions of statement of financial accounting standard sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets sfas no 

since the results of operations of owned stores have been presented as discontinued operations beginning in the quarter in which management commits to a plan to close the related store and actively markets the store 
the results of operations of a leased store are presented as discontinued operations beginning in the quarter in which the related store ceases operations 
the results of operations of these owned and leased stores include related write downs of stores to estimated net realizable value and accruals for future estimated rent and other expenses in excess of estimated sublease rental income 
we write down property and equipment of stores we are closing to estimated net realizable value at the time we commit to a plan to close such stores and begin to actively market the store 
if we lease the store  we also accrue for related future estimated rent and other expenses if we believe the expenses will exceed estimated sublease rental income 
we adopted the provisions of sfas no 
 accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities  and as a result  effective january   if we lease the store  we will accrue for related future estimated rent and other expenses if we believe the expenses will exceed estimated sublease rental income at the time the store ceases operations 
we base the estimated net realizable value of property and equipment on our experience in utilizing and or disposing of similar assets and on estimates provided by our own and or third party real estate experts 
we also use our experience in subleasing similar property to estimate future sublease income 
if there is a significant change in the real estate market  our net realizable value estimates and or our estimated future sublease income could change materially

table of contents we review our long lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
in accordance with the provisions of sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets sfas no 
 we also conduct an annual impairment test of our goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives 
the impairment test for goodwill is comprised of two steps 
step one compares the fair value of the reporting unit with its carrying amount  including goodwill 
if the carrying amount exceeds the fair value  then goodwill is impaired and step two is required to measure the amount of impairment loss 
step two compares the implied fair value of the reporting unit s goodwill with the carrying amount of that goodwill 
if the carrying amount is greater than the implied fair value of the goodwill  an impairment loss is recognized for the excess 
see note to the consolidated financial statements 
the impairment test for intangible assets with indefinite lives consists of a comparison of the fair value of the intangible asset with its carrying amount 
if the carrying amount is greater than fair value  an impairment loss is recognized for the excess

underground gasoline storage tanks since we have recognized the estimated future cost to remove an underground storage tank over the estimated useful life of the storage tank in accordance with the provisions of sfas no 
 accounting for asset retirement obligations sfas no 

we record a discounted liability for the fair value of an asset retirement obligation with a corresponding increase to the carrying value of the related long lived asset at the time an underground storage tank is installed 
we amortize the amount added to property and equipment and recognize accretion expense in connection with the discounted liability over the remaining life of tank 
we base our estimates of the anticipated future costs for removal of an underground storage tank on our prior experience with removal 
we also consider factors such as the type of tank  location of tank sites and our experience with contractors who perform removal work 
see note to the consolidated financial statements 
yen loans we use our license royalty receipts from seven eleven japan co  ltd 
seven eleven japan to service the monthly principal and interest payments on our outstanding yen loans 
this provides us with an economic hedge against fluctuations in the japanese yen to us dollar exchange rate 
since our adoption of sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities sfas no 
 on january   we have adjusted the balance of the yen loans at each reporting date to reflect the then current japanese yen to us dollar exchange rate  and we recognize the resulting noncash foreign currency exchange gain or loss in earnings 
in addition  we record the seven eleven japan royalty and interest expense on the yen loans at the average japanese yen to us dollar exchange rate for the respective periods

table of contents inventories inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market 
cost is generally determined by the last in  first out lifo method for company operated stores in the united states and by the first in  first out fifo method for stores in canada 
although the lifo method generally matches the most recent product cost with related revenues  decreases in inventory quantities can result in a liquidation of lifo inventory layers recorded at costs that are lower than the current costs  which would lower cost of goods sold and increase our margin 
see notes and to the consolidated financial statements 
workers compensation  general liability and medical reserves we have third party insurance for workers compensation and general liability losses  with predetermined deductibles 
we record our share of workers compensation and general liability losses based on independent actuarial estimates of the aggregate liabilities for claims incurred 
a significant change in claims experience or in the criteria which the actuary utilizes could result in a material revision to our liability 
effective january   we changed our medical coverage from a fully insured plan to a self insured plan 
in lieu of paying fully insured premiums  which cover incurred claims plus administrative expenses  we will pay claims and administrative expenses as they become due and establish reserves for incurred but unpaid claims as determined by an independent actuary 
this decision to change to self insurance is designed to mitigate the impact of rising healthcare costs 
off balance sheet lease financing we have utilized off balance sheet lease financing programs to diversify our funding sources for new store growth 
we have in place lease financing programs that we used to construct new stores and acquire operating convenience stores from third parties not affiliated with us 
under these programs  we have not included the costs incurred in constructing or acquiring the stores or any related financing obligations in our consolidated balance sheets 
if we were to account for the stores covered under these programs as owned assets or capital leases  our balance sheet would include the costs incurred in constructing the stores or acquiring the operating convenience stores and any related financing obligations

key contributors to the merchandise sales growth in were increases in cigarettes  beer  prepaid cards  noncarbonated beverages  fresh food items and candy 
partially offsetting these increases was a decrease in our sales of caf cooler frozen beverages 
increases in the retail price of cigarettes due to wholesale cost increases accounted for less than of the increase in same store sales in and gasoline sales for increased million  or  over we attribute this increase to a increase in per store gallons sold  partially offset by a cent decline in the average retail price of gasoline in the increase in per store gallons sold is primarily due to the addition of new higher volume gasoline stores  which typically have more gasoline pumps than existing stores

some of our faster growing products were beer  prepaid cards  noncarbonated beverages  fresh food items and candy 
during the third quarter of  we signed a new primary wholesale agreement with mclane company  which supports our cost containment efforts and has increased service levels to our stores 
gasoline gross profit for was million  basically flat with our gasoline gross profit per gallon decreased to cents for compared to cents for this translated into a decrease in our gasoline gross profit per store for these declines were primarily due to difficult market conditions in the first quarter of when retail prices fell faster than wholesale costs  causing lower retail margins 
we manage retail gasoline prices through a centralized monitoring process to minimize the effect of gasoline margin volatility and maximize our gross profit per gallon 
increases or decreases in the wholesale cost of gasoline will generally cause similar increases or decreases in the retail price of gasoline 
an increase in the wholesale cost of gasoline generally results in higher retail prices within five to days after the cost increase 
conversely  a decrease in the wholesale cost of gasoline generally results in lower retail prices within to days after the cost decrease 
competitive conditions in the retail marketplace can cause these time periods to vary considerably on a market by market basis  which can have a significant impact on gasoline gross profit margin 
over the last years  however  our annual gasoline gross profit margins have remained comparatively stable and range from to cents per gallon 
other income other income consists primarily of area license royalties and initial franchise fees 
other income for was million  a decrease of million  or  from million in royalty income from our area licensees was million in  a decrease of million from million in the decrease is primarily due to a million decrease in the royalties received from our licensing agreement with seven eleven japan under which seven eleven japan pays us a royalty fee based on a percentage of its total revenues 
under the terms of a amendment to that agreement  seven eleven japan reduced its royalty payments to us by approximately beginning in august in addition  we experienced an unfavorable impact from changes in the japanese yen to us dollar exchange rate during the royalty rate reduction and the impact of the exchange rate changes were partially offset by increases in franchise fees  other area license royalties and vcom placement fees 
we expect that our seven eleven japan royalty receipts will decrease in by approximately million compared to we do not anticipate any further reductions in the amount of the license fee percentage

vcom vcom is our proprietary kiosk solution to meet consumer demands for convenient and continuously available financial and e commerce services 
we believe that the deployment of these web enabled  integrated services kiosks represents a significant market opportunity to offer financial and e commerce services to a large segment of our current and future customers who have little or no access to banks or the internet 
we believe we are uniquely positioned to capitalize on this opportunity because of the demographics of our existing customer base and the large number of our conveniently located stores

as of december   we had installed vcom kiosks 
we anticipate that we will have the first  kiosks rolled out by the end of the second quarter of our longer range plans anticipate further expanding vcom to a total of  stores 
we estimate our capital investment for the expansion to  kiosks at approximately million 
we will fund this expansion through a capital lease program 
in connection with the  store rollout  we estimate that we will need approximately million to fund the amount of cash in the kiosks necessary for check cashing and atm transactions 
our current plans are to obtain these funds through our commercial paper program 
in exchange for our granting strategic partners exclusive rights to offer their services or products on our vcom kiosks  they will pay us placement fees  a percentage of the transaction fees and  in certain circumstances  expense reimbursement 
as of december   we have received million of placement fee commitments based on a  store rollout from our strategic partners  although most of such commitments are funded as vcom kiosks are deployed

capital lease obligations 
we utilize capital leases as a means of funding our property and equipment 
generally  real estate leases are for primary terms from to years with options to renew for additional periods and equipment leases are for terms from one to years 
these obligations and related assets are included in our consolidated balance sheet 
operating lease obligations 
we also lease a substantial portion of our property and equipment using traditional operating leases 
generally  real estate leases are for primary terms up to years with options to renew for additional periods and equipment leases are for terms from one to years 
these obligations and related assets are not included in our consolidated balance sheet 
store leases 
as of december   we operated or franchised a total of  stores in the united states and canada 
we own fewer than one third of these stores  and we lease the remainder 
over the next five years  leases covering more than half of our total leased stores will expire  including more than  leases that lack rent renewal options or contain negotiable rent options and more than  leases that have fixed rent options 
we have devoted  and will continue to devote  considerable efforts to extending and or renegotiating these leases 

table of contents total lease expiring or with negotiable rent options fixed rent options total we originally signed many of the expiring leases or leases with negotiable options in the s and s 
some of these leases had primary terms of to years  with as many as three options to renew for additional five year terms 
for those sites where we need to negotiate a a new lease to replace an expiring lease or b a new rental for those leases that have negotiable rent renewal options  we expect that we will pay prevailing market rates when the new lease term or option term commences  which will likely significantly increase our operating costs 
if we are unable to agree on an appropriate rent for any one of these stores  we may decide to forego renewal of the lease and close the store 
if we have a fixed rent option  in most cases the rent will increase either to a specific predetermined dollar amount or as calculated based on a predetermined formula  such as an increase in the consumer price index 
these rent increases will increase our operating costs

table of contents thereafter total distribution services gasoline supply it commitments product and other commitments total we have estimated our future purchase commitments based on volumes purchased and our average cost for increased annually by approximately we have estimated our future purchase commitments based on our contracted volume at prices 
distribution services 
in july we signed a new month service agreement with mclane company  inc  a wholly owned subsidiary of wal mart stores  inc  under which mclane is the primary distributor of traditional grocery products to our us stores and designated combined distribution centers in the united states 
the new agreement became effective in september and replaces a prior year agreement that was set to expire in november under the terms of the agreement  we are required to purchase a minimum percentage of eligible purchases from mclane 
we exceeded the minimum percentage in and expect to exceed it in our failure to purchase the minimum percentage of eligible purchases could result in a change in pricing of certain products 
gasoline supply 
we are currently in the th year of a year product purchase agreement with citgo petroleum corporation 
this agreement  which expires in september  permits us to purchase gasoline from parties other than citgo  but obligates us to purchase specified quantities of gasoline at market prices from citgo 
the minimum required annual purchases under this agreement are generally the lesser of million gallons or of all of the gasoline we purchased for retail sale 
we have exceeded the minimum required annual purchases in all material respects in each year of the contract and expect to continue doing so in the future 
see note to the consolidated financial statements 
it commitments 
we have various information technology commitments that require us to purchase minimum amounts of products and services annually 
we have exceeded such minimum purchase requirements in the past in all material respects and expect to continue doing so for the foreseeable future 
our failure to satisfy the minimum purchase requirements could cause us to make payments to the applicable provider s equal to the commitment s or a predetermined percentage of the commitment s 
product commitments

off balance sheet items we are party to two lease facilities that have  as of december   provided us with million in off balance sheet financing that we used for constructing new stores and acquiring operating convenience stores from third parties not affiliated with us 
under the agreements  trusts funded by a group of senior lenders either acquired land and undertook construction projects for which we were the construction agent or acquired operating

see note to the consolidated financial statements for discussion regarding our participation in the facilities  borrowing costs of the facilities  and covenants and guarantees under the facilities 
we account for the leases as operating leases 
the trusts are substantive entities in which a major financial institution is the primary equity holder 
we have no management control or equity interest in the trusts 
we do not intend to use this type of financing program in the future and instead expect to rely on other sources to fund future expansion 
we have guaranteed million of a five year  million note between one of our equity affiliates and a third party lending institution 
the affiliate obtained the loan to restructure existing debt 
the guaranteed amount is the maximum potential amount that we could be required to pay in the event of default by the affiliate 
we have contracts with our combined distribution center operators that require us to provide a certain level of financial support 
we estimate that we will pay approximately million in support over the next three years 
cash flows from operating activities net cash provided by operating activities for was million  an increase of million  or  from million in we attribute this increase to changes in working capital items  primarily as a result of timing of the funding for money orders and the timing of payment of merchandise payables and increases in employee payables and deferred income 
these were partially offset by increases in franchisee and credit card receivables and receivables for vendor promotional allowances 
cash flows from investing activities net cash used in investing activities was million  an increase of million  or  from million in a portion of this increase is due to increased capital expenditures to million in from million in capital expenditures were used for maintaining  remodeling and upgrading stores  developing new stores  enhancing our retail information system  purchasing new equipment to support merchandising initiatives and complying with environmental regulations 
also contributing to the increase was the change in restricted cash of million in compared to the change of million in restricted cash represents funds escrowed for the semiannual payment on our yen denominated debt

expansion into china 
there are currently approximately eleven stores in hong kong and approximately eleven stores in the south china province of guangdong operated by subsidiaries of dairy farm international ltd 
pursuant to a licensing arrangement 
during the third quarter of  we announced plans to explore additional licensing arrangements to expand the development and operation of eleven stores in additional provinces of china 
we have evaluated the possibility of entering into a licensing arrangement for at least one additional market area in china with a joint venture formed by seven eleven japan  president chain store corporation and the two chinese participants referenced below 

table of contents president chain store corporation is our current licensee in taiwan  where it operates approximately  eleven stores  and seven eleven japan is our current licensee in japan  where it operates approximately  eleven stores 
we have focused on the possibility of negotiating a licensing arrangement with seven eleven japan and president chain store corporation because of their financial strength  business experience in china and proven ability to develop and operate eleven stores 
we are considering entering into a licensing arrangement with a joint venture that includes seven eleven japan  which together with ito yokado owns of our common stock 
therefore  our board of directors has appointed a special committee comprised of three directors  none of whom is affiliated with seven eleven japan  ito yokado or any of the proposed joint venture partners  to review and consider the proposed licensing arrangement for approval 
the special committee met four times in following the committee s evaluation of potential joint venture partners based on criteria that the committee has deemed important to the joint venture s success  during the third quarter of the special committee approved seven eleven japan and president chain store corporation as the foreign partners in the chinese joint venture  with seven eleven japan holding a controlling interest in the venture 
chinese law requires that one or more chinese entities collectively have at least a ownership interest in the joint venture 
during the third quarter of  the special committee gave conditional approval to two chinese partners to be included in the joint venture beijing shoulian commercial group co 
ltd 
and china national sugar alcohol group 
during the fourth quarter of  the conditions to the approval of the chinese partners were satisfied  and a draft of a letter of intent was approved 
the letter of intent is currently being reviewed by seven eleven japan  president chain store corporation and the chinese partners 
the special committee s approval of all partners to the joint venture is subject to the committee s receipt and review of certain additional documentation relating to the joint venture partners and to the committee s approval of the final terms of the license agreement that will be negotiated between the company and the joint venture 
environmental at december   our estimated undiscounted liability for our environmental costs related to remedial action at existing and previously operated gasoline storage sites and other operating and non operating properties where releases of regulated substances have been detected was million 
we anticipate that substantially all of the future remediation costs for detected releases of regulated substances at remediation sites of which we are aware  as of december   will be incurred within the next five to six years 
the estimated liability could change within the near future for several reasons  including revisions to or the creation of governmental requirements  existing remediation projects become fully defined and revised cost to closure estimates become available  and unplanned future failures of underground gasoline storage tank systems 
under state reimbursement programs  we are eligible to be reimbursed for a portion of remediation costs previously incurred 
at december   we had recorded a net receivable of million for the estimated state reimbursements  of which million relates to remediation costs incurred in the state of california 
in assessing the probability of state reimbursements  we take into consideration each state s fund balance  revenue sources  
table of contents existing claim backlog  historical payments and claim ranking 
as a result of these assessments  the recorded receivable amounts at december   are net of allowances of million 
the estimated future state reimbursement amounts could change within the near future as governmental requirements and state reimbursement programs continue to be revised or extended 
our estimated reimbursement amounts could change materially as remediation costs are incurred and as receipts of state trust funds are recorded 
while we cannot be certain of the timing of our receipt of state reimbursement funds  based on our experience we expect to receive the majority of state reimbursement funds within one to three years after our payment of eligible remediation expenses 
this time period assumes that the state administrative procedures for processing such reimbursements have been fully developed 
one exception to our assumption is california  where we estimate that we will receive reimbursement funds within one to years after our payment of eligible remediation expenses 
as a result of the timing for reimbursements  we have present valued the portion of the recorded receivable amount that relates to remediation activities that have already been completed at a discount rate of approximately 
thus  in addition to the allowance set forth in the preceding paragraph  the recorded receivable amount is also net of a discount of million 
the estimated future remediation expenditures and related state reimbursement amounts could change within the near future as governmental requirements and state reimbursement programs continue to be implemented or revised 
such revisions could have a material impact on our operations and financial position 
see notes and to the consolidated financial statements 
franchise agreement renewal as of december   we had approximately  franchised stores in the united states 
about of those franchised stores are subject to franchise agreements that are scheduled to expire on december  we are in the process of finalizing a new franchise agreement that we plan to offer to franchisees whose franchise agreements expire at that time 
we do not anticipate that the terms of the new agreement will have a material impact on the franchisees or us 
the economics of the new agreement will be evaluated according to a procedure set forth in a court approved settlement agreement 
this procedure provides for extension of the existing franchise agreements until such time as all steps in the procedure have been completed 
recently issued accounting standards effective january   we adopted the provisions of sfas no 
 accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities  which was issued in july and is effective for exit or disposal activities initiated after december  the statement requires that costs associated with exit or disposal activities must be recognized when they are incurred rather than at the date of a commitment to an exit or disposal plan 
such costs include lease termination costs and certain employee severance costs associated with a restructuring  discontinued operation or other exit or disposal activity 
these costs generally arise from store closings and will be recorded at the time the store is closed 
sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure an amendment of fasb statement no 
 was issued in december to provide 
table of contents alternative methods of transition for a voluntary change to the fair value based method of accounting for stock based employee compensation 
in addition  sfas no 
amends the disclosure requirements of sfas no 
to require prominent disclosures in both annual and interim financial statements about the method of accounting for stock based employee compensation and the effect of the method used on reported results 
the transition guidance and annual disclosure provisions of sfas no 
are effective for fiscal years ending after december  the interim disclosure provisions are effective for financial statements for interim periods beginning after december  at the present time  we do not intend to adopt the fair value based method of accounting for our stock compensation plans 
for additional information about our stock compensation plans  see notes and to the consolidated financial statements 
financial accountant standards board fasb interpretation no 
 guarantor s accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees  including indirect guarantees of indebtedness to others  was issued in november the interpretation elaborates on the disclosures to be made by a guarantor in its interim and annual financial statements about its obligations under certain guarantees that it has issued see note to the consolidated financial statements 
it also clarifies that a guarantor is required to recognize  at the inception of a guarantee  a liability for the fair value of the obligation undertaken in issuing the guarantee 
the interpretation incorporates  without change  the guidance in fasb interpretation no 
 disclosure of indirect guarantees of indebtedness of others  which is being superseded 
the initial recognition and measurement provisions of the interpretation are to be applied on a prospective basis to guarantees issued or modified after december   irrespective of the guarantor s fiscal year end 
we anticipate that the adoption of this statement will not have a material impact on our financial statements 
fasb interpretation no 
 consolidation of variable interest entities an interpretation of arb no 
 was issued in january the interpretation addresses consolidation of variable interest entities vies to which the usual condition for consolidation described in accounting research bulletin no 
 consolidated financial statements  does not apply because the vies have no voting interests or otherwise are not subject to control through ownership of voting interests 
it requires existing unconsolidated vies to be consolidated by their primary beneficiaries if the entities do not effectively disperse risks among parties involved 
the provisions of the interpretation are effective immediately for vies created after january   and to vies in which an entity obtains an interest after that date 
an entity with a variable interest in a vie created before february   must apply the provisions no later than the first reporting period beginning after june  the interpretation may be applied prospectively with a cumulative effect adjustment as of the date on which it is first applied or by restating previously issued financial statements 
we expect to include the assets  liabilities  noncontrolling interests and results of activities of the trusts discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements in our consolidated financial statements effective july  we estimate that this will result in an after tax  one time cumulative effect charge of approximately million to million 
on an annual basis  we expect the after tax impact on earnings from continuing operations to be a charge of approximately million to million 

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk the following discussion summarizes the financial and derivative instruments we held as of december  these instruments are sensitive to changes in interest rates  foreign exchange rates and equity prices 
we use interest rate swaps to manage the primary market exposures associated with underlying liabilities and anticipated transactions 
we use these instruments to reduce risk by essentially creating offsetting market exposures 
in addition  our two yen denominated loans effectively serve as an economic hedge of our exposure to yen dollar currency fluctuations resulting from our significant yen based royalty from seven eleven japan 
we do not leverage the instruments we hold  and we hold the instruments for purposes other than trading 
in the normal course of business  we also face risks that are either non financial or non quantifiable  such as country risk  credit risk and legal risk  and we have not addressed these risks in this discussion 
interest rate risk management the following table presents descriptions of the floating rate financial instruments and interest rate derivative instruments we held at december  we entered into interest rate swaps to achieve the levels of variable and fixed rate debt approved by senior management 
under the interest rate swaps  we agreed with other parties to exchange the difference between fixed rate and floating rate interest amounts on a quarterly basis 
the following table presents the principal cash flows by maturity date for our floating rate debt and the related estimated average interest rate 
for the interest rate swaps  the table presents the notional amounts outstanding and expected interest rates that exist by contractual dates 
we used the notional amount to calculate the contractual payments to be exchanged under the contract  and we estimated the variable rates based on implied forward rates in the yield curve as of december  dollars in millions there after total fair value floating rate financial instrument commercial paper average interest rate interest rate derivatives notional amount average pay rate average receive rate see liquidity and capital resources contractual obligations and commercial commitments long term debt 
the negative million fair value of the interest rate swap represents an estimate of the amount we would pay if we had chosen to terminate the swap as of december  see note to the consolidated financial statements 
as of december   approximately of our debt contained floating rates that will be impacted by changes in 
table of contents interest rates 
we have effectively eliminated of our exposure to variable rates through the interest rate swap agreement 
the weighted average interest rate for such debt  including the impact of the interest rate swap agreement  was for the year ended december   as compared to for the year ended december  foreign exchange risk management our million of royalty income in was impacted by fluctuating exchange rates 
approximately of such royalties were from area license agreements with seven eleven japan 
although sfas no 
nullified the hedge accounting treatment we were applying to the seven eleven japan royalty and our yen denominated loans  we continue to have an economic hedge by using the seven eleven japan royalty receipts to make principal and interest payments on our yen denominated loans 
however  since january   we have adjusted the balance of the yen loans at each reporting date to reflect the current japanese yen to us dollar exchange rate  and the resulting foreign currency exchange gain or loss is recognized in earnings 
based on our yen denominated debt balance as of december   a one point increase or decrease in the japanese yen to us dollar exchange rate would result in an increase or decrease in pretax earnings of approximately million 
see critical accounting policies and estimates yen loans and notes and to the consolidated financial statements 
in addition  we are exposed to fluctuating exchange rates on the portion of our royalties earned in foreign currencies that are not attributable to our license agreement with seven eleven japan  but we do not believe future risk is material based on current estimates 
we also have several wholly or partially owned foreign subsidiaries and are susceptible to exchange rate risk on earnings from these subsidiaries  based on current estimates  however  we do not consider future foreign exchange risk to be material 
equity price risk management we hold equity securities of other companies 
we classify these securities as available for sale and carry them on our consolidated balance sheet at fair value 
at december   we held shares of affiliated computer services  inc common stock the acs shares  which had no cost basis but had a fair value of million 
we obtained the acs shares in as part of our mainframe data processing contract with acs 
at that time  acs was a privately held start up company 
accordingly  the stock was valued with no cost 
changes in fair value are recognized as other comprehensive earnings  net of tax  as a separate component of shareholders equity
