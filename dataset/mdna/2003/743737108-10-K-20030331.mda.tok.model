overview the company is a regional freight railroad operating in massachusetts  rhode island  connecticut and new york 
the company generates operating revenues primarily from the movement of freight in both conventional freight cars and in intermodal containers on flat cars over its rail lines 
freight revenues are recorded at the time delivery is made to the customer or the connecting carrier 
modest non freight operating revenues are derived from demurrage  switching  weighing  special train and other transportation services as well as from services rendered to freight customers and other outside parties by the company s maintenance of way  communications signals  and maintenance of equipment departments 
operating revenues also include amortization of deferred grant income 
the company s operating expenses consist of salaries and wages and related payroll taxes and employee benefits  depreciation and amortization  insurance and casualty claim expense  diesel fuel  car hire  property taxes  materials and supplies  purchased services and other expenses 
many of the company s operating expenses are of a relatively fixed nature and do not increase or decrease proportionately with increases or decreases in operating revenues unless the company s management were to take specific actions to restructure the company s operations 
when comparing the company s results of operations from one year to another  the following factors should be taken into consideration 
first  the company has historically experienced fluctuations in operating revenues and expenses due to unpredictable events such as one time freight moves and customer plant expansions and shut downs 
second  the company s freight volumes are susceptible to increases and decreases due to changes in international  national and regional economic conditions 
third  the volume of capitalized track or recollectable projects performed by the company s maintenance of way and communications signals departments can vary significantly from year to year thereby impacting total operating expenses 
ii the company also generates income through sales of properties  grants of easements and licenses  and leases of land and tracks 
income or loss from sale  condemnation and disposal of property and equipment and grants of easements is recorded at the time the transaction is consummated and collectibility is assured 
this income varies significantly from year to year 
one of the company s customers  tilcon connecticut  inc  which ships construction aggregate from three separate quarries on the company s system to asphalt production plants in connecticut and new york  accounted for approximately  and of its operating revenues in   and  respectively 
the company does not believe that this customer will cease to be a rail shipper or will significantly decrease its freight volume in the foreseeable future 
in the event that this customer should cease or significantly reduce its rail freight operations  management believes that the company could restructure its operations to reduce operating costs by an amount sufficient to substantially offset the decrease in operating revenues
