background organization through a series of mergers and acquisitions  we have grown substantially since our inception in patriot american hospitality  inc  or patriot  was formed on april  as a self administered real estate investment trust  or reit  to acquire equity interests in hotel properties 
on october   patriot completed an initial public offering of its common stock and commenced its operations 
between october  and july   patriot acquired interests in hotel properties and leased them to various third party lessees 
on july   patriot merged into california jockey club  or cal jockey 
as part of this merger  cal jockey and bay meadows operating company  or bay meadows  entered into a paired share arrangement under which both of their common stocks were paired and traded together 
also  cal jockey changed its name to patriot  and bay meadows changed its name to patriot american hospitality operating company 
in january  wyndham hotel corporation merged into patriot and  as part of that merger  patriot american hospitality operating company changed its name to wyndham international  inc we will refer to wyndham international  inc as it existed before june  as old wyndham 
during  patriot and old wyndham grew primarily by acquiring hotels and other related businesses 
they financed these acquisitions with funds drawn on their revolving credit facilities and capital raised by issuing paired shares and by having their two operating partnerships issue limited partnership interests 
these acquisitions included the acquisition of wyndham hotel corporation in january referred to above  as a result of which patriot acquired wyndham hotels  clubhouse hotels  management and franchise contracts  the wyndham and clubhouse proprietary brand names  and the wyndham hotel management company  three resort hotels in puerto rico and a majority interest in a related hotel company

on june   we restructured our organization 
as part of this restructuring patriot became a wholly owned subsidiary of ours  we and patriot terminated the paired share arrangement  each outstanding paired share was converted into one share of our class a common stock  and patriot terminated its status as a reit effective january  and became a taxable corporation as of that date 
also on june   we completed a billion series b preferred stock equity investment and closed a new credit facility comprised of a senior credit facility and an increasing rate loans facility and closed on additional mortgage debt 
holders of our series b preferred stock are entitled to a quarterly dividend on a cumulative basis at a rate of per year  a portion of which is payable in cash and a portion of which is payable in additional shares of series b preferred stock 
our series b preferred stock is convertible  at the holders option  into shares of our class b common stock 
also in  we completed a rights offering of our series a preferred stock  which  except for voting rights  has substantially similar terms to our series b preferred stock 
we used the proceeds of our series a preferred stock offering to redeem some of our series b preferred stock 
the january  amendment to our credit facility prohibits us from paying the cash portion of the preferred dividend until expiration or further amendment of our credit facility 
under the terms of our preferred stock  if cash dividends are in arrears and unpaid for a period of days or more  then an additional amount of dividends accrue at a rate per annum of of the stated amount of each share of preferred stock then outstanding from the last payment date on which cash dividends were to be paid in full until all cash dividends in arrears have been paid in full 
such additional dividends are cumulative and payable in additional shares of preferred stock 
as of december   we had issued an additional stock dividend of  shares of series a and b preferred stock with a value of million because cash dividends totaling million on the preferred stock had been in arrears and unpaid for a period of more than days 
during  we agreed to the redemption of our aggregate non voting economic interest in interstate hotels  llc  a principal operating subsidiary of interstate 
interstate hotels  llc transferred to us a management agreement for one hotel owned by us and amended management agreements with respect to six other hotels owned by us to reduce the management fees and to permit termination by the owner upon days notice 
in addition  approximately of our interest was redeemed by interstate hotels  llc and substantially all of the remainder was converted into a preferred membership interest in interstate hotels  llc 
as additional consideration for the redemption and conversion of our interest  we caused our representative on interstate s board of directors to resign and relinquished our right to appoint a member to interstate s board of directors in the future 
in addition  we granted interstate an option exercisable within days of october   to acquire 
table of contents all of interstate s stock owned by us at a weighted average trading price per share  provided that the purchase price not be less than per share nor more than per share 
on december   the common stock was acquired by interstate hotels  llc for approximately  on july   interstate hotels  llc  pursuant to a redemption agreement  called for the redemption of our preferred interest in interstate hotels  llc 
in consideration for the redemption  we received million in cash and two promissory notes in the amounts of  and million  respectively 
the notes  were repaid in may and june  respectively 
we recorded a gain of million  net of previously recorded impairment of million 
the portion of our interest that was not converted into a preferred membership interest will remain outstanding 
thereafter  at any time on or after july   both we and interstate hotels  llc have the right to require interstate hotels  llc to redeem the remaining common interest at an amount that is the lesser of a the product of i five times interstate hotels  llc s ebitda as of december  and ii the percentage of total equity interest in interstate hotels  llc which is represented by the remaining interest  or b approximately  in  we sold the following assets the sierra suites hotel brand  one owned and three leased properties  franchise and management contracts for sierra suites  and nine management contracts for summerfield suites for net cash proceeds of approximately million  million of which was used to relieve future payment obligations related to the sf hotel company  lp acquisitions  hotels two of which were leased back to us and the clubhouse inn proprietary brand for net cash proceeds of approximately million  after we repaid approximately million of mortgage debt  and investments in three hotels  two parcels of land  retail space  and a garage for net cash proceeds of approximately million  after we repaid approximately million of debt and a note receivable of million 
in  we sold the following assets two hotels and a sewer company  in separate transactions for aggregate net cash proceeds of approximately million  after we repaid approximately million of debt  one hotel in which we retained a preferred equity interest for net cash proceeds of approximately million  three hotels and investments in four additional hotels in a single transaction for net cash proceeds of approximately million  and six hotels  which were exchanged for one hotel 
in  we sold the following assets seven hotels and an investment in a restaurant venture  in separate transactions for aggregate net cash proceeds of approximately million  after we repaid approximately million of debt 
also  million of the net cash proceeds from the sale of the assets was used by us to pay down the balance of our term loans  increasing rate loans and revolver under our credit facility  and thirteen hotels in a single transaction for net cash proceeds of approximately million  after we repaid approximately million of debt and placed million in escrow under the terms of our senior credit facility for application by the company in the future to make payments on existing mortgage indebtedness 
also  million of the net cash proceeds from the sale of the assets was used by us to pay down the balance of our senior credit facility and increasing rate loan facility 
as of march   we had sold or entered into a contract to sell the following assets investments in a hotel entity  certain undeveloped land and a golf venture for net proceeds of million after payment of debt of million 
million of the net cash proceeds was used to pay 
table of contents down a portion of the senior credit facility and the increasing rate loan facility  and the company retained the rest of the net cash proceeds in accordance with the terms of the senior credit facilities 
a contract to sell eight wyndham garden hotels for million 
the eight hotels had a combined mortgage debt of million as of january  as part of the sale agreement  the eight garden hotels will retain the wyndham flag for a term of up to five years under a franchise agreement  which term may be terminated by us on days prior written notice or by the franchisee on days prior written notice 
these properties have been classified as assets held for sale in the balance sheet as of december  and the results of operations have been reported separately as discontinued operations 
included in the discontinued operations is an impairment charge of million taken against the net book value of the eight garden hotels 
at december   we had approximately million of assets classified as held for sale  net of impairment 
we classify certain assets as held for sale based on our management having the authority and intent of entering into commitments for sale transactions expected to close in the next twelve months 
a sluggish economy  a lack of consumer confidence in the stock market and other national and world events have created a significant amount of uncertainty about future prospects of national and world economies 
the overall long term effect on us and the lodging industry is also uncertain 
in the face of such uncertainty  we have developed and implemented a contingency plan focused particularly on cost management 
at the present time  however  it is not possible to predict either the severity or duration of such declines  but weaker hotel performance will  in turn  have an adverse impact on our business  financial condition  and results of operations 
on january   we amended and restated our senior credit facility and increasing rate loans facility 
under the terms of the amendment and restatement  all financial covenants  other than the interest coverage ratio test  have been eliminated 
the minimum interest coverage ratio has been reduced from to until december  at which time it will increase to thereafter 
pursuant to the amendment and restatement  we provided additional collateral to the lenders  agreed to an increase in the interest rates payable under the senior credit facility  and agreed to limit our capital expenditures to million per year  plus million per year for emergency capital expenditures 
we also agreed that we would apply the net cash proceeds from asset sales and refinancings of existing mortgage indebtedness other than the credit facilities in the following manner first  the initial million of such proceeds each year may be retained by us  second  the next million of such proceeds each year are applied to scheduled term loan prepayments  third  subject to certain limitations set forth in the credit facilities  of such proceeds must be applied to repay indebtedness under the credit facilities and of such proceeds may be retained by us up to a maximum of million so retained during the period between january  and january  and up to a maximum of million so retained during the period between january  and january   fourth  after we have retained million of such proceeds in the year or million during the year  as applicable  of such proceeds must be applied to repay indebtedness under the credit facilities pro rata basis 
we also agreed to use of the net cash proceeds from new debt issuances other than refinancings of existing mortgage indebtedness other than the credit facilities the proceeds from which are to be applied in accordance with the previous sentence to reduce debt outstanding under the credit facilities on a pro rata basis 
on may   we entered into a third amendment and restatement of our credit facilities 
the third amendment and restatement permits the issuance of certain debt securities and  in the event that we issue such debt securities  the maturity of the outstanding revolving loans held by the lenders who have consented to the third amendment and restatement would be extended from june  to june  this amendment and restatement directs the net cash proceeds we receive from any such offering of debt securities to be applied as follows first  to repay all of the amounts outstanding under the increasing rate loans facility and to cancel the increasing rate loans facility  and 
table of contents second  to repay the outstanding revolving loans the maturity of which has been extended to june  and the term loans on pro rata basis  based on their outstanding principal amounts  with the revolving commitment of these repaid revolving loans reduced by the amount of the principal repayment thereof 
the proceeds from any such offering of debt securities would not be used to repay any of the revolving loans whose maturity remains june  in the event that we issue certain debt securities  the third amendment and restatement will also change the application of proceeds from asset dispositions  exchanges and certain incurrences of indebtedness among the various loan facilities 
the third amendment and restatement also specifically permits us to refinance two or more of our existing mortgages in a single transaction 
in such a transaction  the refinancing of the mortgaged properties may be cross collateralized with the properties that secured the mortgage being refinanced and or certain specified unencumbered properties 
upon our receipt of the proceeds from any offering of debt securities and repayment of the term loans and the revolving loans whose maturity has been extended to june   the outstanding amounts of the revolving loans held by the lenders who consent to the third amendment and restatement would be converted to term loans and would constitute a new class of loans under the senior credit facility having the same interest rate and term as the existing senior credit facility 
the new term loans would be amortized semi annually by with the balance paid on the maturity date 
the extended revolving loans and the revolving loans which maintain a maturity of june  would have the same interest rate  but would be treated differently for purposes of prepayments due to asset sales and incurrence of debt 
on june   we withdrew a proposed offering of debt securities due to unfavorable market conditions 
on march   we entered into a fourth amendment and restatement of our credit facilities 
the fourth amendment and restatement includes the following an increase in the letter of credit availability under our revolving facility from million to million  waivers and consents by the lenders to any resolution of issues surrounding certain under performing properties  extension of the outside date by which the company must grant mortgage liens to the lenders on certain excluded properties under the credit facilities  and authorization to effect certain administrative organizational changes to the company s corporate structure 
despite our successful efforts to amend our credit facilities  there can be no assurance that we will be able to meet our debt service obligations and  to the extent that we cannot  we may lose some or all of our assets  including hotel properties 
continuing adverse economic conditions could cause the terms on which we borrow to worsen 
those circumstances  if we are in need of funds to repay indebtedness  could force us to liquidate one or more investments in properties at times that may not permit realization of the maximum return on those investments 
the foregoing risks associated with our debt obligations may inhibit our ability to raise capital in both the public and private markets and may have a negative impact on our credit rating 
during  we have scheduled principal payments and debt maturities of approximately million 
of that amount  we can elect to extend million for three additional twelve month periods 
we are seeking to refinance the remaining mortgages prior to their maturities in  however  there can be no assurance that we will be able to do so 

table of contents critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to impairment of assets  assets held for sale  bad debts  income taxes  insurance reserves  derivatives  and contingencies and litigation 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
we periodically review the carrying value of our assets  including intangible assets  to determine if events and circumstances exist indicating that assets might be impaired 
if facts and circumstances support this possibility of impairment  our management will prepare undiscounted and discounted cash flow projections which require judgments that are both subjective and complex 
our management uses its judgment in projecting which assets will be sold by us within the next twelve months 
these judgments are based on our management s knowledge of the current market and the status of current negotiations with third parties 
if assets are expected to be sold within months  they are reclassified as assets held for sale on the balance sheet 
we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
we record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
while we have considered future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for the valuation allowance  in the event we were to determine that we would be able to realize our deferred tax assets in the future in excess of its net recorded amount  an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would increase income in the period such determination was made 
likewise  should we determine that we would not be able to realize all or part of our net deferred tax asset in the future  an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would be charged to income in the period such determination was made 
we maintain a paid loss deductible insurance plan for commercial general liability  automobile liability  and workers compensation loss exposures related to our hotel operations 
the primary loss deductible retention limit is currently  per occurrence for general liability and  per occurrence for automobile liability and workers compensation loss 
the estimates of the ultimate liability for losses and associated expenses are based upon a third party actuarial analysis and projection of actual historical development trends of loss frequency  severity and incurred but not reported  or ibnr  claims as well as traditional issues that affect loss cost such as medical and statutory benefit inflation 
in addition  the actuarial analysis compares our trends against general insurance industry development trends to develop an estimate of ultimate costs within the deductible retention 
large claims or incidents that could potentially involve material amounts are also monitored closely on a case by case basis 
as of december   our balance sheet included an estimated liability with respect to this self insurance program of  our objective in using derivatives is to add stability to interest expense and to manage our exposure to interest rate movements 
during  such derivatives were used to hedge the variable cash flows associated with a portion of our variable rate debt 
as of december   we did not have any derivatives designated as fair value hedges 
additionally  we do not use derivatives for trading or speculative purposes 
we use a variety of methods and assumptions that are based on market conditions and risks existing at each balance sheet date to determine the fair value of our derivative instruments 
for the majority of financial instruments including most derivatives  standard market conventions and techniques such as discounted cash flow analysis  option pricing models  replacement cost  and termination cost are used to determine fair value 
all methods of assessing fair 
table of contents value result in a general approximation of value  and such value may never actually be realized 
future cash inflows or outflows from our derivative instruments depend upon future borrowing rates 
if assumptions about future borrowing rates prove to be materially incorrect  the recorded value of these agreements could also prove to be materially incorrect 
because we use the derivative instruments to reduce our exposure to increases in variable interest rates  thus effectively fixing a portion of our variable interest rates  the impact of changes in future borrowing rates could result in our interest expense being either higher or lower than might otherwise have been incurred on our variable rate borrowings had the rates not been fixed 
a reduction in interest rates could result in a competitive advantage for companies in a position to take advantage of a lower cost of capital 
we are a defendant in lawsuits that arise out of  and are incidental to  the conduct of our business 
our management uses its judgment  with the aid of legal counsel  to determine if accruals are necessary as a result of any pending actions against us 
results of operations year ended december  compared with year ended december  our hotel revenues were  and  for the years ended december  and  respectively 
approximately  of the decrease in our hotel revenues is attributable to those hotels that were sold in and the remaining decrease is attributable to declining revenues throughout our owned and leased hotel portfolio 
revpar decreased for the year ended december  as compared to the same period in our hotel expenses were  and  for the years ended december  and  respectively 
as with revenues  our hotel expenses were impacted by the hotel sales discussed above 
approximately  of the decrease in our hotel expenses can be attributed to hotels that were sold in and this decrease was offset in part by an increase of approximately  in our property insurance premiums in due to the changes in the insurance industry 
in addition  hotel expenses increased by  due to additional paid losses in our general liability  automobile liability and workers compensation insurance plans 
the remaining decrease is attributable to staffing reductions at the hotels and other cost saving initiatives we implemented as our hotel revenues declined 
our management fee and service fee income was  and  for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the decrease is primarily a result of reductions in hotel revenue upon which the fees are based and the termination of certain contracts during and our interest and other income was  and  for the years ended december  and  respectively 
approximately  of the decrease in interest income can be attributed to hotels that were sold in and the remaining decrease is attributable to the payment of certain note receivables in our general and administrative expenses were  and  for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the decrease in our general and administrative expenses for the year ended december  is due to expenses not incurred in as follows conversion costs of  resulting from the implementation of brand standards in our portfolio of hotels  write off of a receivable deemed not collectible for   of costs associated with the termination of management and leasehold contracts   in reservation and marketing funds not reimbursed by the hotels and  of severance costs 
this decrease was offset in in part by an increase in debt restructuring costs of  and amortization of retention bonuses of  during the year ended december   our bond offering cancellation costs were  we withdrew a proposed offering of debt securities during the second quarter of due to unfavorable market conditions 
our interest expense was  and  for the years ended december  and  respectively 
this decrease is primarily a result of a reduction in the amount of our total debt 
at december  
table of contents and  we had approximately billion and billion of debt  respectively 
also  the one month libor rate was and as of december  and  respectively  and the weighted average interest rate as of december  was as compared to as of december our depreciation and amortization expense was  and  for the years ended december  and  respectively 
during the fourth quarter of  we transferred back to held for use certain assets that were previously held for sale thus increasing depreciation expense for the year ended december  by  the remainder of the increase is due to asset additions subsequent to the year ended december  this increase was offset by our adopting of sfas during the first quarter of which impaired our goodwill by  thus reducing amortization expense by  for the year ended december  in addition  depreciation expense was reduced by  due to asset sales in during the years ended december  and  we classified nine and five assets  respectively  as held for sale based on our management having the authority and intent of entering into commitments for sale transactions expected to close in the next twelve months 
based on the estimated net sales proceeds  we recorded a reserve for impairment for loss on real estate assets held for sale of  in and  in the provision reduced the carrying value of the owned hotels to the estimated net sales proceeds less estimated costs to sell 
during  of the assets held for sale as of december   we sold four hotels and continue to carry one asset as held for sale 
in addition  during  we recorded a reserve for impairment on three assets held for use of  the benefit for income taxes was  and  for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the increase in the tax benefit is in part due to operating losses and in part due to depreciation of certain assets that were previously held for sale during the year ended december   resulting in differences in general accepted accounting principle  or gaap  and tax depreciation 
minority interests share of income in consolidated subsidiaries was  and  for the years ended december  and  respectively 
approximately  of the decrease in minority interest is attributable to those hotels that were sold in and in addition  the decrease in the allocation of income used in the computation of minority interest was due to depreciation expense now being recorded for assets previously held for sale in and due to lower operating income 
we recorded a loss of  and  for the years ended december  and  respectively  for the change in the fair market value of interest rate hedge contracts 
in addition  a reduction of  net of taxes of  and a charge of  net of taxes of  were recorded against other comprehensive income as of december  and  respectively  for such change 
also  during the years ended december  and  we paid  and  respectively  in settlement payments for ineffective hedges 
in addition  we recorded amortization of  net of taxes of  and  net of taxes of  for the years ended december  and  respectively  to earnings as a reduction of the transitional adjustment that was recorded in other comprehensive income in loss from discontinued operations was  for the year ended december  and income from discontinued operations was  for the year ended december  the decrease in income was due primarily to depreciation in on assets that were previously held for sale during the year ended december   impairment charge on the nine garden hotels identified as held for sale and the loss on sale of assets sold in our adoption of sfas no 
during the year ended december  resulted in the cumulative effect of an accounting change of  to reflect an adjustment to goodwill being recognized in our 
table of contents consolidated statement of operations as compared to  net of taxes of  for the adoption of sfas no 
to reflect an adjustment to the derivative financial instruments for the year ended december  during the year ended december   we recorded a charge of  net of taxes  as an extraordinary item resulting from the write off of the unamortized deferred financing costs for debt that has been repaid 
our resulting net loss for the year ended december  was  compared to a net loss of  for the year ended december  results of operations year ended december  compared with year ended december  our hotel revenues were  and  for the years ended december  and  respectively

our management fee and service fee income was  and  for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the decrease is primarily a result of reductions in hotel revenue upon which the fees are based and the sale and termination of certain contracts since december  our interest and other income was  and  for the years ended december  and  respectively 
in  we recognized a termination fee of  resulting from the termination of a portfolio of management contracts and  from the termination of another contract 
our general and administrative expenses were  and  for the years ended december  and  respectively 
our general and administrative expenses in were impacted by increases in conversion costs of  resulting from our implementation of brand standards  the write off of  for receivables deemed not collectible and  in reservation and marketing funds not reimbursed by hotels 
this increase was offset in part by a reduction in legal costs  training costs and the size of our corporate staff during our interest expense was  and  for the years ended december  and  respectively 
this decrease is primarily a result of a reduction in interest rates 
at december  and  we had approximately billion of debt 
the average one month libor rate was and for the years ended december  and  respectively 
this reduction of interest rates was partially offset by derivatives we put in place that fixed the interest rate on a portion of our debt 
our depreciation and amortization expense was  and  for the years ended december  and  respectively 
during the third and fourth quarters of  we identified certain assets held for sale 
in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 once we identify an asset for sale  depreciation is no longer recorded 
thus  depreciation for the year ended december  was reduced 
in addition  in december  certain intangible assets were written off  thus reducing amortization expense for the year ended december  
table of contents during the year ended december   we classified five assets as held for sale based on our management having the authority and intent of entering into commitments for sale transactions expected to close in the next twelve months 
based on the estimated net sales proceeds  we recorded a reserve for impairment for loss on real estate assets held for sale of  the provision reduces the carrying value of the five owned hotels to the estimated net sales proceeds less estimated costs to sell 
due to the events of september   which delayed certain sales transactions  other than the five assets  all remaining assets classified as held for sale as of december  have been reclassified as held for use as of december  in addition  we recorded a reserve for impairment on three assets held for use of  the benefit for income taxes was  and  for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the decrease in the tax benefit is in part due to increased operating profitability and in part to the classification of certain assets as held for sale in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles  or gaap  resulting in differences in gaap and tax depreciation 
minority interests share of income in consolidated subsidiaries was  and  for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the increase in the allocation of income is due to the increased profitability of certain partnerships  which resulted from the fact that no depreciation expense was recorded because assets in these partnerships were held for sale 
the increase was partially offset by the sale of one of those partnership interests in june the adoption of the statement of financial accounting standards no 
 as amended  on january  resulted in the cumulative effect of an accounting change of  being recognized in the consolidated statement of operations and a charge of  in other comprehensive income 
in addition  for the year ended december   we recorded a loss of  for the change in the fair value through earnings  and a charge of  through other comprehensive income 
also  during  we paid  in settlement payments for the ineffective hedges

the decrease in both revenue and operating income is due in part to the sale of non proprietary branded assets since also  operating results were impacted by declines in adr and occupancy of and  respectively  and by increases in our fixed expenses  such as property insurance 
non proprietary branded hotels were originally identified as non strategic assets that we intend to sell 
we have sold assets and assets remain to be sold 
however  these remaining non strategic assets will be held until such time as the sales price meets or exceeds management s assessment of fair value

total revenue for the segment was  and  for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the overall  decrease in this segment s revenue was primarily the result of lost management fees from contracts sold and terminated in and  including a  termination fee recognized in operating loss for this segment was  and  for the years ended december  and  respectively 
this decrease in operating loss is primarily attributable to decreases in certain expenses such as impairment expense and depreciation expense 
the decrease in depreciation expense of  was primarily a result of the increase in the number of assets held for sale with respect to which depreciation is no longer recorded 
in addition  for the year ended december   we recorded  of impairment charges compared to  recorded for the year ended december  recent events on september   we entered into an employment agreement with mark a

on february   we signed a contract to sell eight wyndham garden hotels for million 
the eight hotels had a combined mortgage debt of million as of january  as part of the sale agreement  the eight garden hotels will retain the wyndham flag for a term of up to five years under a franchise agreement  which term may be terminated by us on days prior written notice or by the franchisee on days prior written notice 
these properties have been classified as assets held for sale in the balance sheet as of december  and the results of operations have been reported separately as discontinued operations 
included in the discontinued operations is an impairment charge of million taken against the net book value of the eight garden hotels 
on march   we entered into a fourth amendment and restatement of our credit facilities 
the fourth amendment and restatement includes the following an increase in the letter of credit availability under our revolving facility from million to million  waivers and consents by the lenders to any resolution of issues surrounding certain under performing properties  extension of the outside date by which the company must grant mortgage liens to the lenders on certain excluded properties under the credit facilities  and authorization to effect certain administrative organizational changes to the company s corporate structure 

table of contents statistical information during  our portfolio of owned and leased hotels experienced a decline in both adr and revpar of approximately and  respectively  as compared to while occupancy increased by

exchange listing on october   our class a common stock began trading on the american stock exchange  or the amex 
our class a common stock was previously listed and traded on the new york stock exchange  or the nyse 
we received notice from the nyse that we were not in compliance with their continued listing standards because the average closing stock price of our class a common stock was below for a consecutive day trading period prior to the date of the notice 
we explored several options to ensure that our class a common stock would continue to be publicly traded and we believe that the amex provided us with the best solution 
no assurance can be given that we will meet the amex s listing standards in the future 
credit facilities as of december   we had approximately million outstanding under our revolving credit facility  billion outstanding on term loans  and million outstanding under increasing rate loans 
additionally  we had outstanding letters of credit totaling million 
also  as of december   we had over million of mortgage debt outstanding that encumbered hotels and capital leases and other debt of million  resulting in total indebtedness of approximately billion 
included in the total indebtedness is approximately million of debt associated with assets held for sale 
as of december   we had million of additional availability under the revolving credit facility 
on january   we successfully reached an agreement with the lenders under our senior credit facility and our increasing rate loans facility to permanently amend these facilities 
the key terms of the amendments are as follows the total leverage ratio and the senior secured leverage ratio requirements have been eliminated from the facilities  the interest coverage ratio decreased from to to to until december   at which time it will increase to to we granted mortgages on of our properties that were not previously encumbered  the interest rate on our term loans increased to libor plus per annum  the interest rate on our revolving credit facility increased to libor plus per annum  the net cash proceeds from asset sales and refinancings of existing mortgage indebtedness other than the credit facilities is applied in the following manner first  the initial million of such proceeds each year may be retained by us  second  the next million of such proceeds  each year must be applied to the scheduled term loan prepayment  third  subject to certain limitations set forth in the credit facilities  of such proceeds must be applied to repay indebtedness under the credit facilities and of such proceeds may be retained by us up to a maximum of million so retained in the year or million during the year  fourth  after we have retained million of such proceeds during the period between january  and january  and up to a maximum of million so retained during the period between january  and january   of such proceeds must be applied to repay indebtedness under the credit facilities on a pro rata basis  of the net cash proceeds from new debt issuances other than refinancings of existing mortgage indebtedness  other than the credit facilities the proceeds from which are to be applied in accordance with the previous sentence is applied to reduce debt outstanding under the credit facilities on a pro rata basis  
table of contents our capital and development spending cannot exceed million per annum  with million available for use in certain emergencies  and we cannot pay the cash portion of the regular quarterly dividends on our series a and series b preferred stock 
on may   we entered into a third amendment and restatement of our senior credit facility and our increasing rate loans facility 
the third amendment and restatement permits the issuance of certain debt securities and  in the event that we issue such debt securities  the maturity of the outstanding revolving loans held by the lenders who have consented to the third amendment and restatement would be extended from june  to june   as of the date of the issuance of the debt securities 
this amendment and restatement directs the net cash proceeds we receive from any such offering of debt securities to be applied as follows first  to repay all of the amounts outstanding under the increasing rate loans facility and to cancel the increasing rate loans facility  and second  to repay the outstanding revolving loans the maturity of which has been extended to june  and the term loans on a pro rata basis  based on their outstanding principal amounts  with the revolving commitment of these repaid revolving loans reduced by the amount of the principal repayment thereof 
the proceeds from any such offering of debt securities would not be used to repay any of the revolving loans whose maturity remains june  in the event that we issue certain debt securities  the third amendment and restatement will also change the application of proceeds from asset dispositions  exchanges and certain incurrences of indebtedness among the various loan facilities 
the third amendment and restatement also specifically permits us to refinance two or more of our existing mortgages in a single transaction 
in such a transaction  the refinancing of the mortgaged properties may be cross collateralized with the properties that secured the mortgage being refinanced and or certain specified unencumbered properties 
upon our receipt of the proceeds from any offering of debt securities and repayment of the term loans and the revolving loans whose maturity has been extended to june   the outstanding amounts of the revolving loans held by the lenders who consent to the third amendment and restatement would be converted to term loans and would constitute a new class of loans under the senior credit facility having the same interest rate and term as the existing senior credit facility 
the new term loans would be amortized semi annually by with the balance paid on the maturity date 
the extended revolving loans and the revolving loans which maintain a maturity of june  would have the same interest rate  but would be treated differently for purposes of prepayments due to asset sales and incurrence of debt 
on june   we withdrew a proposed offering of debt securities due to unfavorable market conditions 
on march   we entered into a fourth amendment and restatement of our credit facilities 
the fourth amendment and restatement includes the following an increase in the letter of credit availability under our revolving facility from million to million  waivers and consents by the lenders to any resolution of issues surrounding certain under performing properties  extension of the outside date by which the company must grant mortgage liens to the lenders on certain excluded properties under the credit facilities  and 
table of contents authorization to effect certain administrative organizational changes to the company s corporate structure 
we have considered our short term liquidity needs and the adequacy of adjusted estimated cash flows and other expected liquidity sources to meet these needs 
we believe that our principal short term liquidity needs are to fund our normal recurring expenses and our debt service requirements 
we anticipate that these needs will be fully funded from our cash flows provided by operating activities and  when necessary  from our revolving credit facility 
in the past  we have generally met our long term liquidity requirements for the funding of activities  such as development and scheduled debt maturities  major renovations  expansions and other non recurring capital improvements  through long term secured and unsecured indebtedness and the proceeds from the sale of our assets 
under the terms of the applicable credit facilities  loan agreements  and lease agreements  as of december   our principal amortization and balloon payment requirements and our future five year minimum lease payments are summarized as follows payments due by year total and thereafter in thousands long term debt and capital lease obligations a b office leases b hotel and ground leases b total a subsequent to december   the mortgage debt was paid down by a total of million due to the sale of assets 
in addition  the company entered into a contract to sell eight wyndham garden hotels which when closed will result in a million pay down of mortgage debt 
b office  hotel and ground leases are operating leases and are included in operating expenses 
during  we have scheduled principal payments and debt maturities of approximately million 
of that amount  we can elect to extend million for three additional twelve month periods 
we are seeking to refinance the remaining mortgages prior to their maturities in  however  there can be no assurance that we will be able to do so 
during  we have scheduled principal payments and debt maturities of approximately million 
we are seeking to extend or refinance these debt maturities  however  there can be no assurance that we will be able to do so

although occupancies have improved from very depressed levels following the events of september   at present  it is not possible to predict either the severity or the duration of declines in the medium or long term on operations  liquidity  and capital resources see risks related to our indebtedness on page 
dividends we do not anticipate paying a dividend to our common shareholders and we are prohibited under the terms of our senior credit facility and increasing rate loans facility from paying dividends on our class a common stock 
for the six year period beginning september   dividends on our series a and series b preferred stock are payable partly in cash and partly in additional shares of our series a and series b preferred stock  with the cash portion aggregating million per year  so long as there is no redemption or conversion of our series a and series b preferred stock 
for the following four years  dividends are payable in cash or additional shares of our series a or series b preferred stock  as the case may be  as determined by our board of directors 
after year ten  dividends are payable solely in cash 

table of contents we are prohibited under the terms of the january  amendments to the senior credit facility and increasing rate loans facility from paying cash dividends on the series a and b preferred stock 
as of december   we have deferred payments of the cash portion of the preferred stock dividend totaling approximately million 
this amount has been included in accounts payable and accrued expenses as of december  in addition  according to the terms of our series a and b preferred stock  if the cash dividends on the preferred stock are in arrears and unpaid for at least days  then an additional amount of dividends will accrue at an annual rate of of the stated amount of each share of preferred stock then outstanding from the last payment date on which cash dividends were to be paid in full until the cash dividends in arrears have been paid in full 
these additional dividends are cumulative and payable in additional shares of preferred stock 
as of the year ended december   we issued an additional stock dividend of  shares of series a and series b preferred stock with a value of million 
renovations and capital improvements during  we invested approximately million in capital improvements and renovations 
these capital expenditures included i costs related to enhancing the revenue producing capabilities of our hotels and ii costs related to recurring maintenance 
during  we anticipate spending approximately million in capital expenditures primarily for recurring maintenance capital expenditures and technological initiatives 
we are limited to capital expenditures of million per year  plus million per year for emergency capital expenditures under the terms of the january  amendments to the senior credit facility and increasing rate loans facility 
we attempt to schedule renovations and improvements during traditionally lower occupancy periods in an effort to minimize disruption to the hotel s operations 
therefore  we do not believe such renovations and capital improvements will have a material effect on the results of operations of the hotels 
capital expenditures will be financed through capital expenditure reserves or with working capital 
inflation operators of hotels in general possess the ability to adjust room rates quickly 
however  competitive pressures may limit our ability to raise room rates in the face of inflation 
seasonality the hotel industry is seasonal in nature  however  the periods during which our hotel properties experience higher revenues vary from property to property and depend predominantly on the property s location 
our revenues typically have been higher in the first and second quarters than in the third or fourth quarters 
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of our consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to impairment of assets  assets held for sale  bad debts  income taxes  insurance reserves  derivatives  and contingencies and litigation 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
we periodically review the carrying value of our assets  including intangible assets  to determine if events and circumstances exist indicating that assets might be impaired 
if facts and circumstances support this possibility of impairment  our management will prepare 
table of contents probability weighted undiscounted and discounted cash flow projections which require judgments that are both subjective and complex 
our management uses judgment in projecting which assets will be sold by us within the next twelve months 
these judgments are based on our management s knowledge of the current market and the status of current negotiations with third parties 
if assets are expected to be sold within months  they are reclassified as assets held for sale on the balance sheet 
we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
we record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
while we have considered future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for the valuation allowance  should we determine that we would be able to realize our deferred tax assets in the future in excess of its net recorded amount  an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would increase income in the period such determination was made 
likewise  should we determine that we would not be able to realize all or part of our net deferred tax asset in the future  an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would be charged to income in the period such determination was made 
we maintain a paid loss deductible insurance plan for commercial general liability  automobile liability  and workers compensation loss exposures related to our hotel operations 
the primary loss deductible retention limit is currently  per occurrence for general liability and  per occurrence for automobile liability and workers compensation loss 
the estimates of the ultimate liability for losses and associated expenses are based upon a third party actuarial analysis and projection of actual historical development trends of loss frequency  severity and incurred but not reported  or ibnr  claims as well as traditional issues that affect loss cost such as medical and statutory benefit inflation 
in addition  the actuarial analysis compares our trends against general insurance industry development trends to develop an estimate of ultimate costs within the deductible retention 
large claims or incidents that could potentially involve material amounts are also monitored closely on a case by case basis 
as of december   our balance sheet included an estimated liability with respect to this self insurance program of  our objective in using derivatives is to add stability to interest expense and to manage our exposure to interest rate movements 
during  such derivatives were used to hedge the variable cash flows associated with a portion of our variable rate debt 
as of december   we did not have any derivatives designated as fair value hedges 
additionally  we do not use derivatives for trading or speculative purposes 
we use a variety of methods and assumptions that are based on market conditions and risks existing at each balance sheet date to determine the fair value of our derivative instruments 
for the majority of financial instruments including most derivatives  standard market conventions and techniques such as discounted cash flow analysis  option pricing models  replacement cost  and termination cost are used to determine fair value 
all methods of assessing fair value result in a general approximation of value  and such value may never actually be realized 
future cash inflows or outflows from our derivative instruments depend upon future borrowing rates 
if assumptions about future borrowing rates prove to be materially incorrect  the recorded value of these agreements could also prove to be materially incorrect 
because we use the derivative instruments to reduce our exposure to increases in variable interest rates  thus effectively fixing a portion of our variable interest rates  the impact of changes in future borrowing rates could result in our interest expense being either higher or lower than might otherwise have been incurred on our variable rate borrowings had the rates not been fixed 
a reduction in interest rates could result in a competitive advantage for companies in a position to take advantage of a lower cost of capital 
we are a defendant in lawsuits that arise out of  and are incidental to  the conduct of our business 
our management uses its judgment  with the aid of legal counsel  to determine if accruals are necessary as a result of any pending actions against us 

table of contents newly issued accounting standards in june  the financial accounting standards board  or fasb  issued statement of financial accounting standards  or sfas   business combinations  and sfas  goodwill and other intangible assets  collectively referred to as the standards 
sfas supersedes apb  business combination 
the provisions of sfas require that we use the purchase method of accounting for all business combinations initiated after june   provide specific criteria for the initial recognition and measurement of intangible assets apart from goodwill  and require that unamortized negative goodwill be written off immediately as an extraordinary gain instead of being deferred and amortized 
sfas also requires that  upon adoption of sfas  we reclassify carrying amounts of certain intangible assets into or out of goodwill  based on certain criteria 
sfas supersedes apb  intangible assets  and is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  sfas primarily addresses the accounting for goodwill and intangible assets subsequent to their initial recognition 
the provisions of sfas prohibit the amortization of goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets  require that goodwill and indefinite lived intangibles assets be tested annually for impairment and in interim periods if certain events occur indicating that the carrying value of goodwill and or indefinite lived assets may be impaired  require that reporting units be identified for the purpose of assessing potential future impairments of goodwill  and remove the forty year limitation on the amortization period of intangible assets that have finite lives 
on january   we completed the two step process prescribed by sfas for testing for impairment and determining the amount of impairment loss related to goodwill associated with the reporting unit 
accordingly  in the first quarter of  we recorded an impairment charge of  as a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle 
in connection with the adoption of sfas  we did not record  of amortization in and will not record  annually in future years 
upon implementation of sfas  we identified finite lived intangible assts related to our tradenames and determined that there was no indication of impairment on these finite lived intangible assets 
the impact of the adoption of sfas on our net loss  and basic and diluted loss per share is presented in the following tables year ended december  year ended december  reported net loss add back goodwill amortization adjusted net loss reported basic and diluted loss per share goodwill amortization adjusted basic and diluted loss per share the changes in the carrying amount of goodwill for the year ended december  were as follows other segment balance net of amortization as of january  reclassification to franchise costs impairment losses balance as of december  the fair value of the reporting unit was estimated using the expected present value of future cash flows 
the hotel management subsidiaries  which is where goodwill is recorded  are included in the other segment as described on page under results of reporting segments 
the other segment includes management fee and service fee income  interest and other income  general and administrative costs  interest expense  depreciation and amortization  and other charges 

table of contents in october  the fasb issued sfas accounting for the impairment and disposal of long lived assets 
sfas supersedes sfas accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of 
sfas primarily addresses significant issues relating to the implementation of sfas and develops a single accounting model for long lived assets to be disposed of  whether previously held and used or newly acquired 
the provisions of sfas are effective for fiscal years beginning after december  in the first quarter of  we adopted sfas as a result of the implementation of sfas  the results of operations of sixteen assets sold during have been reported separately as discontinued operations 
four other assets sold during were accounted for under sfas as they were held for sale prior to adoption of sfas in april  the fasb issued sfas  recission of fasb statements no 
  and  amendment of fasb statement no 
 and technical corrections 
sfas  which is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after may  and interim periods within those fiscal years  updates  clarifies and simplifies existing accounting pronouncements 
sfas rescinds sfas  which required all gains and losses from extinguishment of debt to be aggregated and  if material  classified as an extraordinary item  net of the related income tax effect 
as a result of this recission  the criteria in apb will now be used to classify those gains and losses  which could result in the gains and losses being reported in income before extraordinary items 
also  sfas amends sfas to require that certain lease modifications that have economic effects similar to sale leaseback transactions be accounted for in the same manner as sale leaseback transactions 
we believe that adoption of sfas will not have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations 
in july  the fasb issued sfas  accounting for exit or disposal activities 
sfas addresses significant issues regarding the recognition  measurement  and reporting of costs that are associated with exit and disposal activities  including restructuring activities that are currently accounted for pursuant to the guidance that the emerging issues task force  or eitf has set forth in eitf issue no 
 liability recognition for certain employee termination benefits and other costs to exit an activity including certain costs incurred in a restructuring 
the scope of sfas also includes costs related to terminating a contract that is not a capital lease and termination benefits that employees who are involuntarily terminated receive under the terms of a one time benefit arrangement that is not an ongoing benefit arrangement or an individual deferred compensation contract 
the provisions of sfas are effective for exit or disposal activities initiated after december  we believe that adoption of sfas will not have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations 
in november  the fasb issued interpretation  guarantor s accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees  including indirect guarantees of indebtedness of others 
the interpretation elaborates on the existing disclosure requirements for most guarantees  including loan guarantees such as standby letters of credit 
it also clarifies that at the time a company issues a guarantee  the company must recognize an initial liability for the fair value  or market value  of the obligations it assumes under the guarantee and must disclose that information in its interim and annual financial statements 
the provisions related to recognizing a liability at inception of the guarantee for the fair value of the guarantor s obligations does not apply to product warranties or to guarantees accounted for as derivatives 
the initial recognition and initial measurement provisions apply on a prospective basis to guarantees issued or modified after december  we believe that adoption of the recognition and measurement provisions of interpretation will not have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations 
in december  the fasb issued sfas  accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure  which amends sfas  accounting for stock based compensation 
in response to a growing number of companies announcing plans to record expenses for the fair value of stock options  sfas provides alternative methods of transition for a voluntary change to the fair value based method of accounting for stock based employee compensation 
in addition  sfas amends the disclosure requirements of sfas to require more prominent and more frequent disclosures in financial statements about the effects of stock based compensation 
sfas also amends the disclosure provisions of sfas to require more prominent disclosure about the effects of an entity s accounting policy decisions with respect to stock based employee compensation on reported net income 
finally  sfas amends apb  interim financial reporting  to 
table of contents require disclosure about those effects in interim financial information 
the amendments to sfas are effective for financial statements for fiscal years ending after december  we are currently evaluating the provisions of sfas  but believe its adoption will not have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations 
in january  the fasb issued interpretation  consolidation of variable interest entities 
in general  a variable interest entity is a corporation  partnership  trust  or any other legal structure used for business purposes that either a does not have equity investors with voting rights or b has equity investors that do not provide sufficient financial resources for the entity to support its activities 
interpretation requires a variable interest entity to be consolidated by a company if that company is subject to a majority of the risk of loss from the variable interest entity s activities or entitled to receive a majority of the entity s residual returns or both 
the consolidation requirements of interpretation apply immediately to variable interest entities created after january  the consolidation requirements apply to older entities in the first fiscal year or interim period beginning after june  certain of the disclosure requirements apply in all financial statements issued after january   regardless of when the variable interest entity was established 
we are currently evaluating the provisions of the interpretation  but believe its adoption will not have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations 
item a 
qualitative and quantitative disclosures about market risks our primary market risk exposure is to future changes in interest rates related to our derivative financial instruments and other financial instruments  including debt obligations  interest rate swaps  interest rate caps  and future debt commitments 
we manage our debt portfolio by periodically entering into interest rate swaps and caps to achieve an overall desired position of fixed and floating rates or to limit our exposure to rising interest rates 
the following table provides information about our derivative and other financial instruments that are sensitive to changes in interest rates 
for fixed rate debt obligations  the table presents principal cash flows and related weighted average interest rates by expected maturity date and contracted interest rates at december  for variable rate debt obligations  the table presents principal cash flows by expected maturity date and contracted interest rates at december  for interest rate swaps and caps  the table presents notional amounts and weighted average interest rates or strike rates by expected contractual maturity dates 
notional amounts are used to calculate the contractual cash flows to be exchanged under the contract 
weighted average variable rates are based on implied forward rates in the yield curve at december  thereafter face value fair value dollars in thousands long term debt obligations including current portion fixed rate average interest rate variable rate average interest rate interest rate derivative financial instruments related to debt interest rate swaps pay fixed receive variable average pay rate average receive rate interest rate caps notional amount strike rate forward rate 
table of contents we can elect to extend million for three additional twelve month periods 
we can elect to extend million for two additional twelve month periods 
the debt portfolio as of december  was as follows thereafter face value fair value dollars in thousands long term debt obligations including current portion fixed rate average interest rate variable rate average interest rate interest rate derivative financial instruments related to debt interest rate swaps pay fixed receive variable average pay rate average receive rate interest rate caps notional amount strike rate forward rate from december  to december   the liability for derivative instruments increased by million 
our derivative portfolio consists entirely of interest rate protection agreements which are sensitive to interest rate fluctuations 
accordingly  the market value of the portfolio has declined with the decrease in forward interest rates during the period from december  to december  this decrease in market value resulted in the increase to the liability for derivative instruments
