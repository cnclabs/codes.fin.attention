item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the company reports on a week fiscal year 
references to fiscal year are for the fifty two weeks ended december   fiscal year are for the fifty two weeks ended december  and fiscal year are for the fifty three weeks ended december  critical accounting policies the company has identified the most critical accounting policies upon which its financial status depends 
the company determined the critical policies by considering accounting policies that involve the most complex or subjective decisions or assessments 
the company states these accounting policies in the notes to the consolidated financial statements and at relevant sections in this discussion and analysis 
this discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the company s consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this report 
the company s most critical accounting policies are those relating to revenue recognition  allowance for doubtful accounts  inventory valuation  restructuring reserves  valuation of deferred tax assets and valuation of long lived and intangible assets 
the company summarizes its most critical accounting policies below 
revenue recognition 
the company recognizes revenues and freight billed to customers upon shipment and after the transfer of all substantial risks of ownership 
allowances for estimated returns  discounts and retailer programs are recognized when sales are recorded and are based on various market data  historical trends and information from customers 
although the best available information is used to establish the allowances  such information is often based on estimates of retailer recovery rates 
retailer recovery can sometimes take up to several years depending on the particular program 
allowances are reviewed quarterly and are adjusted based on current estimates of retailer recovery 
due to changes in estimates  changes in retailer activity and the length of time required for many programs to run their course  it is possible for allowance activity to impact earnings in either a positive or negative manner in any given period 
allowance for doubtful accounts 
the company evaluates the collectibility of its accounts receivable based upon an analysis of historical trends  aging of accounts receivable  write off experience and credit evaluations of selected high risk customers 
delinquent accounts are written off to selling  general and administrative expense when circumstances make further collection unlikely 
in the event of a specific customer bankruptcy or reorganization  specific allowances are established to write down accounts receivable to the level of anticipated recovery 
the company may consult with third party purchasers of bankruptcy receivables when establishing specific allowances 
inventory valuation 
the company values inventory at cost not in excess of market determined by the first in  first out fifo method 
inventory costs are based on standard costs  adjusted for actual manufacturing and material purchase price variances 
the company includes materials  labor and manufacturing overhead in the cost of inventories 
management regularly reviews inventory for salability and has established obsolescence allowances to absorb expected losses 
the company also maintains allowances for inventory shrinkage 
at a minimum  the company takes an annual physical inventory verifying the items on hand and adjusting its inventory to physical counts 
periodic cycle counting procedures are used to verify inventory accuracy between physical inventories 
in the interim periods  an allowance for shrinkage is established based upon historical experience and recent physical inventory results 
inventory obsolescence and shrinkage are charged to cost of sales 
restructuring reserves 
the company s historical policy has been to record restructuring charges for certain costs associated with plant closures and business reorganization activities upon approval by management with the appropriate level of authority in accordance with emerging issues task force eitf issue no 
 liability recognition for costs to exit an activity including certain costs incurred in a restructuring 
such costs were recorded as a liability and included lease termination costs  employee severance and certain employee termination benefits 
these costs were neither associated with nor do they benefit continuing business activities 
inherent in the determination of these costs were assessments related to the most likely expected outcome of the significant actions to accomplish the restructuring 
the company reviews the status of restructuring activities on an ongoing basis and  if appropriate  records changes in estimates based on such activities 
in july  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities 
this standard requires costs associated with exit or disposal activities to be recognized when they are incurred 
the requirements of sfas no 
apply prospectively to activities that are initiated after december   and as such  the company cannot reasonably estimate the impact of adopting these new rules until and unless it undertakes relevant activities in future periods 
valuation of deferred tax assets 
the company regularly evaluates its ability to recover the reported amount of our deferred tax assets 
the evaluation considers several factors  including our estimate of the likelihood that we will generate sufficient taxable income in future years in which temporary differences reverse 
this evaluation is based primarily on our historical earnings and projected operating results  applicable net operating loss carryforward expiration dates  and identified actions under the control of the company in realizing the associated carryforward benefits 
in the event that actual results differ from our estimates or we revise future projections  we may need to adjust the valuation allowance 
valuation of long lived and intangible assets 
the company assesses the recoverability of long lived assets and intangible assets whenever it determines that events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying amount may not be recoverable 
the company s assessment is primarily based upon its estimate of future cash flows associated with these assets 
based on the company s assessments  we have determined that there has not been a material impairment of any of our long lived assets 
however  should the company s operating results deteriorate  we may determine that some portion of our long lived tangible or intangible assets are impaired 
such determination could result in non cash charges to income that could materially affect the company s consolidated financial position or results of operations for that period

these actions are fully described below under the captions special  restructuring and other charges and special  restructuring and other charges 
on a quarterly basis  we review remaining accrual balances related to these actions and adjust them to our best estimate of remaining cost 
these adjustments resulted in the recognition of income in both the third and fourth quarters of in the third quarter  a change in management estimates resulted in a million reversal to income 
the change in management estimates resulted in a decrease to inventory liquidation allowances due to higher recovery values on disposed inventory

components of the asset impairment charges included million to reduce the carrying value of goodwill and million to reduce the carrying value of equipment and product molds 
during  the company experienced margin erosion due to continued increases in the cost of plastic resin 
in addition  competitive pressures led to price reductions on the plastic storage product lines 
while plastic resin costs were rising most of the year  the most significant selling price reductions occurred in the third and fourth quarters 
during the company s annual operating and strategic planning process  a review of the future financial prospects of the business was completed 
as part of this process  management determined the need to review the recoverability of the long lived assets of its plastic storage business  including intangible assets  pursuant to sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of 
it was determined that the carrying value of the plastic storage business intangible and long lived assets  specifically goodwill and product molds  exceeded the estimated undiscounted future cash flows of the related product lines 
accordingly  the company was required to reduce the carrying value of the net assets of its plastic storage business to fair market value 
the company s estimate of fair market value was based on various methodologies including a discounted value of the estimated future cash flows and a fundamental analysis of the business value 
considerable management judgement was necessary to estimate fair value

management outlook and business risks the company s largest customer  kmart  is currently operating in bankruptcy 
in  the company had net sales to kmart of approximately million 
in january  kmart announced the closure of stores  approximately of their total store count 
in addition  kmart announced that it had secured financing of billion for utilization when they emerge from bankruptcy later this year 
our business with kmart increased million during the store closings announced in january will likely result in a reduction in sales in as compared to as in  opportunities exist to further expand our business with kmart 
these will be considered in light of kmart s financial situation and our manufacturing capacity levels 
given the dynamic nature and size of the kmart bankruptcy filing  future results may be either favorably or unfavorably impacted by any number of factors related to kmart 
plastic resin currently represents approximately to of the company s cost of goods sold 
during  resin prices started the year at cost levels that were to pound less than historic averages 
costs increased all year and finished the year about pound above historical averages 
as a result  resin costs at the beginning of are above historical averages and to pound higher than a year ago 
we expect that first quarter results in as compared to the first quarter of will be negatively affected 
there is no assurance that future resin price increases can be passed on to customers 
plastic resin costs are impacted by several factors outside the control of the company including supply and demand characteristics  oil and natural gas prices and the overall health of the economy 
any of these factors could potentially have a positive or negative impact on plastic resin prices and the company s profitability 
in  the company purchased million pounds of plastic resin 
the company currently manufacturers the majority of its laundry products in the us and mexico 
management believes that its current manufacturing structure provides increased flexibility to meet customer needs 
all of the company s laundry competitors rely heavily on foreign sourced products 
such products are sourced from several countries  including a significant portion from china 
these foreign sourced competitive products have been introduced at selling prices below ours 
this has caused our profit margins and market share to decline 
we have initiated many cost cutting and other steps to protect our market share and profit margins and have begun to aggressively explore our increased importation of certain laundry products 
we will continue to analyze our north american based laundry manufacturing operations 
the company is highly leveraged with total debt representing nearly two times our net tangible assets 
although all of the company s debt at december  is at fixed rates  any deterioration in our business could lead to additional borrowings at adjustable rates 
thus a deterioration of our business combined with a significant change in interest rates could materially impact earnings and cash flow 
furthermore  the financial and operating covenants related to the company s debt agreements place some restrictions on operations 
during all of the company operated well within its financial and operating covenants and expects to operate within the covenants during the company s financing arrangements and financial covenants with fleet capital take into account seasonal fluctuations and changes to the company s collateral base 
because the financing is asset based  availability of funds to borrow is dependent on the quality of the company s asset base  primarily its receivables and inventory 
should fleet capital determine that such assets do not meet the bank s credit tests  availability can be restricted 
given the company s retail customer base  it is possible that certain customers could be excluded from the asset base thus reducing credit availability 
steel tariffs announced in had a negative impact on the company s steel costs in the second half of the tariffs had the effect of not only raising foreign steel prices  but domestic steel prices as well 
we expect steel prices in to exceed prior year levels 
we do not expect that this cost increase can be passed on to customers 
in  our highest sales occurred in the fourth quarter 
this was due to large promotional orders related to the post christmas retail selling season and line fill to kmart 
normally  our primary selling season is during the second and third quarters of the calendar year in connection with the back to school retail season 
our profitability was higher in the second and third quarters due to the mix of product sold and also due to lower raw material costs 
raw material costs increased in the fourth quarter 
there is no assurance that our seasonality of sales or profits in is indicative of future seasonality 
as a result of operating losses and restructuring charges incurred in  the company has significant tax loss carryforwards 
these carryforwards can be used to reduce taxable income in future periods 
the company has tax loss carryforwards of million amount includes carryforwards of million subject to annual limitation as of december  the company s primary raw materials are plastic resin  steel  fabric and corrugated packaging 
fluctuations in the cost of these materials can have a significant impact on reported results 
during  congress enacted legislation designed to provide higher standards of corporate governance 
while the legislation provides many good measures to protect shareholders  it also will add to our cost of operations and the cost of retaining competent board members 
we estimate that the cost of compliance with the new legislation and the increased costs associated with our board of directors will add about million to our operating expenses in given the company s fixed debt position and positive cash flows  management may from time to time look at opportunities to buy its common stock or high yield bonds 
a buyback might be done if such transactions are accretive to shareholders through either a reduction of interest expense or elimination of shares 
management believes that acquisitions provide an opportunity to meaningfully grow the company s sales and profits 
given our improved financial position  we expect to consider acquisition opportunities that are synergistic to existing operations
