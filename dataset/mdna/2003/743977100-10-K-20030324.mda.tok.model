item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes  appearing elsewhere in this report 
overview we are a healthcare services company focused on acquiring and operating hospitals in attractive non urban markets in the united states 
as of december   we owned or leased general acute care hospitals in states with a total of  licensed beds  and managed hospitals in states with a total of  licensed beds 
impact of acquisitions and divestitures an integral part of our strategy is to acquire non urban acute care hospitals 
because of the financial impact of our recent acquisitions  it is difficult to make meaningful comparisons between our financial statements for the fiscal periods presented 
in addition  because of the relatively small number of owned and leased hospitals  each hospital acquisition can materially affect our overall operating performance 
upon the acquisition of a hospital  we typically take a number of steps to lower operating costs 
the impact of such actions may be offset by cost increases to expand services  strengthen medical staff and improve market position 
the benefits of these investments and of other activities to improve operating margins generally do not occur immediately 
consequently  the financial performance of a newly acquired hospital may adversely affect overall operating margins in the near term 
as we make additional hospital acquisitions  we expect that this effect will be mitigated by the expanded financial base of existing hospitals and the allocation of corporate overhead among a larger number of hospitals 
we also may divest certain hospitals in the future if we determine a hospital no longer fits within our strategy 

table of contents industry trends the federal medicare program accounted for approximately  and of net patient revenue in  and  respectively 
the state medicaid programs accounted for approximately  and of net patient revenue in  and  respectively 
the payment rates under the medicare program for inpatients are prospective  based upon the diagnosis of a patient 
the medicare payment rate increases historically have been less than actual inflation 
both federal and state legislatures are continuing to scrutinize the healthcare industry for the purpose of reducing healthcare costs 
while we are unable to predict what  if any  future healthcare reform legislation may be enacted at the federal or state level  we expect continuing pressure to limit expenditures by governmental healthcare programs 
the balanced budget act of imposed certain limitations on increases in the inpatient medicare rates paid to acute care hospitals 
as required by the balanced budget act of  payments for hospital outpatient  psychiatric sub acute  home health and rehabilitation sub acute services have converted to prospective payment systems  instead of payments being based on costs 
most hospital outpatient services are now reimbursed under an outpatient prospective payment system based on a system of ambulatory payment classification 
rehabilitation and psychiatric sub acute services began transitioning to a prospective payment system in the balanced budget act of also includes a managed care option that could direct medicare patients to managed care organizations 
the medicare  medicaid  and schip benefits improvement and protection act of bipa amended the balanced budget act of by giving hospitals a full market basket increase in fiscal years and in addition  bipa contains provisions delaying scheduled reductions in payment for home health agencies and other provisions designed to lessen the impact on providers of spending reductions contained in the balanced budget act of further changes in the medicare or medicaid programs and other proposals to limit healthcare spending could have a material adverse effect on the healthcare industry and our company 
the hospital industry and some of our hospitals continue to have significant unused capacity 
the result is substantial competition for patients and physicians 
inpatient utilization continues to be affected negatively by payor required pre admission authorization and by payor pressure to maximize outpatient and alternative healthcare delivery services for less acutely ill patients 
we expect increased competition and admission constraints to continue in the future 
the ability to respond successfully to these trends  as well as spending reductions in governmental healthcare programs  will play a significant role in determining the ability of our hospitals to maintain their current rate of net revenue growth and operating margins 
we expect the industry trend towards the provision of more services on an outpatient basis to continue 
this trend is the result of increased focus on managed care and advances in technology 
the billing and collection of accounts receivable by hospitals are complicated by a number of factors  including the complexity of the medicare and medicaid regulations  increases in managed care  hospital personnel turnover  the dependence of hospitals on physician documentation of medical records  and the subjective judgment involved 
these factors  or any combination of them  may impact our ability to bill and collect our accounts receivable at the rates we have anticipated  which could negatively affect our future cash flows 
the federal government and a number of states are increasing the resources devoted to investigating allegations of fraud and abuse in the medicare and medicaid programs 
at the same time  regulatory and law enforcement authorities are taking an increasingly strict view of the requirements imposed on providers by the social security act and medicare and medicaid regulations 
although we believe that we are in material compliance with such laws  a determination that we have violated such laws  or even the public announcement that we were being investigated concerning possible violations  could have a material adverse effect on our company 

table of contents our historical financial trend has been impacted favorably by our success in acquiring acute care hospitals 
while we believe that the healthcare industry trends described above may create future acquisition opportunities  our future financial growth rates will be impacted by our ability to acquire hospitals and to successfully integrate them into our system 
results of operations the following table presents  for the periods indicated  information expressed as a percentage of net operating revenue 
such information has been derived from our consolidated statements of income included elsewhere in this report 
the results of operations for the periods presented include hospitals from their acquisition dates  as previously discussed 
year ended december  net operating revenue operating expenses ebitda depreciation and amortization interest  net minority interest gain loss on sale income before income taxes provision for income taxes net income year ended december  revenues salaries and benefits supplies other operating expenses provision for doubtful accounts ebitda operating expenses represent expenses before depreciation and amortization  interest expense  minority interest  gain loss on sale of assets and income taxes 
ebitda represents the sum of income before income taxes  interest  depreciation and amortization and minority interest and gain loss on sale of assets 
ebitda is commonly used as an analytical indicator of operating performance within the healthcare industry and also serves as a measure of leverage and debt service capacity 
province management considers ebitda to be one measure of our ability to service existing debt  sustain potential increases in debt in the future and to satisfy capital requirements 
ebitda  however  is not a measure of financial performance under accounting principles generally accepted in the united states  and should not be considered an alternative to net income as a measure of operating performance or to cash flows from operating  investing or financing activities as a measure of liquidity 
because ebitda is not a measurement determined in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states and is susceptible to varying calculations  ebitda as presented may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other companies 

table of contents the company adopted statement of financial accounting standards no 
sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  effective january  under sfas no 
 goodwill is no longer amortized  but is subject to annual impairment tests  or more frequently if certain indicators arise 
had the company been accounting for its goodwill under sfas no 
for all periods presented  the company s pro forma net income  as a percentage of net revenue  would have been and  for the years ended december  and  respectively 
hospital revenues are received primarily from medicare  medicaid and commercial insurance 
the percentage of revenues received from the medicare program is expected to increase with the general aging of the population 
the payment rates under the medicare program for inpatients are based on a prospective payment system  based upon the diagnosis of a patient 
while these rates are indexed for inflation annually  the increases historically have been less than actual inflation 
in addition  states  insurance companies and employers are actively negotiating the amounts paid to hospitals as opposed to paying standard hospital rates 
the trend toward managed care  including health maintenance organizations  preferred provider organizations and various other forms of managed care  may affect our hospitals ability to maintain their current rate of net operating revenue growth 
we continuously monitor the cost benefit relationship of services provided at our hospitals  and make decisions related to adding new services or discontinuing existing services 
net patient service revenue is reported net of contractual adjustments and policy discounts 
the adjustments principally result from differences between our hospitals customary charges and payment rates under the medicare  medicaid and other third party payor programs 
customary charges generally have increased at a faster rate than the rate of increase for medicare and medicaid payments 
operating expenses of our hospitals primarily consist of salaries  wages and benefits  purchased services  supplies  provision for doubtful accounts  rentals and leases  and other operating expenses  principally consisting of utilities  insurance  property taxes  travel  physician recruiting  telephone  advertising  repairs and maintenance 
other revenue is comprised of fees from management and professional consulting services provided to third party hospitals pursuant to management contracts and consulting arrangements  reimbursable expenses and miscellaneous other revenue items 
management and professional services revenue plus reimbursable expenses total less than of our consolidated net operating revenue for the year ended december  operating expenses for the management and professional services business primarily consist of salaries  wages and benefits and reimbursable expenses 
year ended december  compared to year ended december  net operating revenue increased to million in from million in  an increase of million  or 
cost report settlements and the filing of cost reports had a minimal effect on net revenue in  and resulted in a positive revenue adjustment of million  or of net operating revenue  in net patient service revenue generated by the hospitals owned during both periods increased million 
price increases for these hospitals were offset by a slight decrease in inpatient admissions less than and a decline in surgeries of 
the decline in admissions and surgeries were attributable to the departure of physicians at the hospitals during total net patient service revenue increased during  primarily related to the hospitals acquired in the fourth quarter of and during our operations were adversely affected by the loss of physicians 
during  we lost physicians who were major contributors  with the majority leaving in the last six months of the year 
we define a major contributor as a physician generating  or more in revenues annually 
all of these physicians left for reasons unrelated to hospital operations 
we recruited physicians in  of whom only started their practices in the third and fourth quarters of the year 
therefore  the new practices were unable to generate sufficient volume to replace the lost revenues generated by the departing physicians 
as the new physicians practices move along the timeline toward full  mature practices  lost revenues will be replaced 
of the recruited physicians  are admitting physicians 
based on historic practice patterns of physicians recruited to our hospitals  to date  these physician practices are tracking in line with historic trends and our expectations 

table of contents our operations were adversely impacted by increased competition from ambulatory surgery centers in two of our markets 
we have been proactive in the only other markets large enough to support full service ambulatory surgery centers that currently do not have these services  by either pursuing a certificate of need for a full service ambulatory surgery center ourselves  or working with physicians in the market to address the community need for outpatient surgery services 
operating expenses increased to million  or of net operating revenue  in from million  or of net operating revenue  in the increase in operating expenses of hospitals owned during both periods resulted primarily from new services and increased physician recruiting 
the consolidated provision for doubtful accounts decreased to of net operating revenue in from of net operating revenue in  primarily related to improvement in days in accounts receivable and increased up front cash collections 
the majority of the increase in total operating expenses was attributable to the acquisition of additional hospitals in the fourth quarter of and in ebitda was million  or of net operating revenue  in  compared to million  or of net operating revenue  in depreciation and amortization expense increased to million  or of net operating revenue  in from million  or of net operating revenue in the increase in depreciation and amortization resulted primarily from the acquisition of additional hospitals in and  and capital expenditures at hospitals owned during both periods  offset by non amortization of goodwill in  which had an impact of approximately million 
interest expense increased to million in from million in  an increase of million or 
this was a result of increased borrowings to finance the acquisition of additional hospitals in the fourth quarter of and in  and interest on the million  convertible subordinated notes issued in october income before provision for income taxes was million for the year ended december   compared to million in  an increase of million or

net income was million  or of net operating revenue  in  compared to million  or of net operating revenue  in year ended december  compared to year ended december  net operating revenue increased from million in to million in  an increase of million or 
we divested two hospitals in the fourth quarter of  which prevents meaningful total revenue comparisons 
net patient service revenue generated by hospitals owned during both periods increased million  or  resulting from inpatient and outpatient volume increases  new services and price increases 
cost report settlements and the filing of cost reports resulted in negative revenue adjustments of million  or of net operating revenue  in  and a positive revenue adjustment of million  or of net revenues in the remaining increase was primarily attributable to the acquisitions of additional hospitals in and operating expenses increased from million  or of net operating revenue  in to million  or of net operating revenue in the increase in operating expenses of hospitals owned during both periods resulted primarily from new services  volume increases  changes in case mix and increased recruiting expenses 

table of contents ebitda increased from million  or of net operating revenue  in to million  or of net operating revenue  in  primarily as a result of improved operations at hospitals owned during both periods 
depreciation and amortization expense increased from million  or of net operating revenue  in  to million  or of net operating revenue in the increase in depreciation and amortization resulted primarily from capital expenditures and the acquisitions in  and a full year of expense for acquisitions made in interest expense as a percent of net operating revenue decreased from in to in proceeds from the sale of convertible notes in november and december and in october were used to reduce the higher rate of indebtedness under the revolving credit facility

the increase resulted primarily from improved operations at hospitals owned during both periods 
provision for income taxes was million in  compared to million in these provisions reflect effective income tax rates of in compared to in see note of the notes to our consolidated financial statements for information regarding differences between effective tax rates and statutory rates 
net income was million  or of net operating revenue  in  compared to million  or of net operating revenue in liquidity and capital resources capital resources total long term obligations  less current maturities  increased to million at december   from million at december  the increase resulted primarily from the borrowings to finance the two hospitals acquired in the second quarter of in november  we reduced the size of our credit facility to million  which includes million for capital leases and a million revolving line of credit 
at december   we had outstanding letters of credit of million  million outstanding and million available under our revolving line of credit 
the loans under the credit facility bear interest  at our option  at the adjusted base rate or at the adjusted libor rate 
the interest rate ranged from to during we pay a commitment fee  which varies from one half to three eighths of one percent of the unused portion  depending on compliance with certain financial ratios 
the principal amount outstanding under the revolving credit agreement may be prepaid at any time before the maturity date of may  the credit facility contains limitations on our ability to incur additional indebtedness including contingent obligations  sell material assets  retire  redeem or otherwise reacquire our capital stock  acquire the capital stock or assets of another business  and pay dividends 
the credit facility also requires that we maintain a specified net worth and meet or exceed certain coverage  leverage  and indebtedness ratios 
indebtedness under the credit facility is secured by substantially all assets of our company 
we are in compliance with all covenants or other requirements set forth in our credit agreements or indentures 
interest rate swap agreements are used to manage our interest rate exposure under our credit facility 
in  we entered into an interest rate swap agreement that effectively converted for a five year period million of floating rate borrowings to fixed rate borrowings at 
in september  we amended the swap 
table of contents agreement and secured a fixed interest rate and extended the term of the agreement to september  all other terms and conditions of the swap agreement remain unchanged 
cash flows year ended december  compared to year ended december  working capital decreased to million at december   from million at december   resulting primarily from decreased cash  used for the acquisition of memorial hospital of martinsville and henry county in the ratio of current assets to current liabilities was to at december  our cash flows from operating activities increased by million to million in from million in this primarily related to improvements in our cash collection cycle and an increase in deferred taxes 
the use of our cash in investing activities increased to million in from million in  resulting primarily from smaller outlays of cash for acquisition of property  plant and equipment and increased use of cash for hospital acquisitions in  compared to our cash flows provided by financing activities decreased to million in from million in  resulting from a decrease in net borrowings 
cash flows year ended december  compared to year ended december  working capital increased to million at december  from million at december   resulting primarily from increased business volumes  growth in accounts receivable from acquired hospitals  and effective management of our working capital 
our cash flows from operating activities increased by million from million provided in to million provided in offsetting our improved profitability was a large increase in accounts receivable  both at hospitals owned during both periods  resulting from volume increases  new services and price increases  and a build up of accounts receivable at newly acquired hospitals 
the use of our cash in investing activities increased from million in to million in  reflecting more acquisitions during our cash flows provided by financing activities increased million from million in  to million in  primarily because of increased borrowings related to acquisitions and the sale of convertible notes 
capital expenditures capital expenditures  excluding acquisitions  in  and  were million  million  and million  respectively  inclusive of construction projects 
capital expenditures for our owned hospitals may vary from year to year depending on facility improvements and service enhancements undertaken by the hospitals 
we expect to make total capital expenditures in of approximately million  exclusive of any acquisitions of businesses 
planned capital expenditures for consist principally of capital improvements and revenue generating capital expenditures to owned and leased hospitals 
we expect to fund these expenditures through cash provided by operating activities and borrowings under our revolving credit facility 
if pre determined operating levels are achieved  we have agreed to build replacement facilities for eunice community medical center  currently expected to cost approximately million  and glades general hospital  currently expected to cost approximately million 
we do not know whether and when each hospital will achieve its individual pre determined operating levels  but we believe it will take approximately months to complete construction from such date 
in connection with certain acquisitions we have made  we have committed and may commit in the future to make specified capital expenditures 
based upon our current level of operations and anticipated growth  we believe that cash generated from operations and amounts available under our credit facility will be adequate to meet our anticipated debt service requirements  capital expenditures and working capital needs for the next months 
we cannot assure you  however  that our business will generate sufficient cash flow from operations or that future borrowings will be available under our credit facility  or otherwise  to enable us to grow our business  service our indebtedness  including the credit facility and our convertible subordinated notes  or make anticipated capital expenditures 
one element of our business strategy is expansion through the acquisition of hospitals in existing and new markets 
the completion of acquisitions may result in the incurrence of  or assumption by us  of additional indebtedness 
our future operating performance  ability to service or refinance the convertible subordinated notes and ability to service and extend or refinance the credit facility will be subject to future economic conditions and to financial  business and other factors  many of which are beyond our control 

table of contents the following table reflects a summary of obligations and commitments outstanding as of december  payments due by period less than year years years thereafter total in millions contractual cash obligations long term debt capital lease obligations operating leases subtotal amount of commitment expiration per period less than year years years thereafter total in millions other commitments letters of credit total obligations and commitments critical accounting policies our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
in preparing our financial statements  we are required to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
we evaluate our estimates and judgments on an ongoing basis 
we base our estimates and judgments on historical experience and on various other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
our actual results may differ from these estimates  and different assumptions or conditions may yield different estimates 
allowance for doubtful accounts our ability to collect outstanding receivables from third party payors is critical to our operating performance and cash flows 
the primary collection risk lies with uninsured patient accounts or patient accounts for which a balance remains after primary insurance has paid 
we estimate the allowance for doubtful accounts primarily based upon the age of the accounts since patient discharge date 
the allowance for doubtful accounts increased  as a percentage of accounts receivable net of contractual adjustments  to in from in we continually monitor our accounts receivable balances and utilize cash collections data and other analytical tools to support the basis for our estimates of the provision for doubtful accounts 
significant changes in payor mix or business office operations  or deterioration in aging accounts receivable could result in a significant increase in this allowance 
allowance for contractual discounts the percentage of our patient service revenue derived from medicare and medicaid patients continues to be high 
for the year ended december   medicare and medicaid combined was of net revenue  
table of contents compared to in the medicare and medicaid contracts are often complex and may include multiple reimbursement mechanisms for different types of services provided in our hospitals  and cost settlement provisions requiring complex calculations and assumptions subject to interpretation 
we use an exhibit system to estimate the allowance for contractual discounts on a payor specific basis  given our interpretation of the applicable regulations or contract terms 
we have invested significant human resources and information systems to improve the estimation process  however  the services authorized and provided and related reimbursement are often subject to interpretation that could result in payments that differ from our estimates 
additionally  updated regulations and contract negotiations occur frequently  necessitating our continual review and assessment of the estimation process 
general and professional liability reserves we purchased a professional liability claims made reporting policy effective january  this coverage is subject to a  deductible per occurrence for general and professional liability and an additional million self insured retention for professional and general liability 
the policy provides coverage up to million for claims incurred during the annual policy term 
we maintain a reserve for the anticipated claims within these deductible and self insured retentions 
as of january   we increased our self insurance retention to million 
this increase in retention amount increases our exposure for claims occurring prior to december   and reported in in we maintained insurance for individual malpractice claims exceeding  per medical incident  subject to an annual maximum of  for claims occurring and reported in we estimate our self insured retention portion of the malpractice risks using historical claims data  demographic factors  severity factors and other actuarial assumptions 
the estimated accrual for malpractice claims could be significantly affected should current and future occurrences differ from historical claims trends 
the estimation process is also complicated by the relatively short period of time in which we have owned some of our healthcare facilities  as occurrence data under previous ownership may not necessarily reflect occurrence data under our ownership 
while management monitors current claims closely and considers outcomes when estimating our insurance accruals  the complexity of the claims and wide range of potential outcomes often hampers timely adjustments to the assumptions used in the estimates 
workers compensation reserves workers compensation claims are insured with a large deductible with stop loss limits of  per accident and a million and million minimum cap on total losses for the and years  respectively 
our arrangement with the insurance provider allows us to prepay the expected amounts of annual workers compensation claims  which is based upon claims experience 
the claims processor tracks payments for the policy year 
at the end of the policy year  the claims processor compares the total amount prepaid by us to the actual amount paid by the claims processor 
this comparison ultimately will result in a receivable from or a payable to the claims processor 
we are fully insured in the commercial marketplace for workers compensation claims prior to january  we utilize loss run reports provided by the claims administrator to determine the appropriate range of loss reserves for the and subsequent years 
our accruals are calculated to cover the risk from both reported claims and claims that have been incurred but not yet reported 
medical claims reserves we maintain self insured medical and dental plans for employees 
claims are accrued under these plans as the incidents that give rise to them occur 
we use a third party administrator to process all such claims 
unpaid claim accruals are based on the estimated ultimate cost of settlement  including claim settlement expenses  in accordance with an average lag time and past experience 
we have entered into a reinsurance agreement with an independent insurance company to limit our losses on claims 
under the terms of this agreement  the insurance company will reimburse us a maximum of  on any individual claim 
while management believes that its estimation methodology effectively captures trends in medical claims costs  actual payments could differ significantly from our estimates  given changes in the healthcare cost structure or adverse experience 

table of contents goodwill and long lived assets  including impairment our consolidated financial statements primarily include the following types of long lived assets property  plant and equipment  goodwill and other intangible assets 
property  plant and equipment purchased in the normal course of business are recorded at the cost of the purchase and a useful life is assigned based upon the nature of the asset in comparison to our company s policy 
we also  in connection with our acquisition of businesses  acquire property  plant and equipment  goodwill and other intangible assets 
we use outside firms to perform a valuation of these acquired assets for the purpose of allocating the purchase price of the acquisition 
as a result of the adoption of statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets sfas no 
 we have obtained valuation reports to identify property  plant and equipment  as well as any intangible assets purchased in our acquisitions 
based on the valuation reports completed to date  the only identifiable intangible assets valued have been non compete agreements and licenses and accreditations  which have had minimal associated value  the remainder was goodwill 
in accordance with the new standard  we have not recognized amortization of goodwill during the year 
impairment of goodwill is governed by sfas no 
in accordance with the adoption of sfas no 
 we completed our transitional impairment test prior to june  as of the beginning of the results of our review indicated that no impairment was present related to the adoption of this accounting standard 
additionally  we completed our annual impairment test as of october  our annual impairment test is based upon a combination of market capitalization and projected ebitda run rate adjusted for a multiple of earnings for the consolidated company 
the results of this annual impairment test indicated no impairment has occurred 
impairment of long lived assets other than goodwill are governed by sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
we adopted this statement effective january  the adoption of this statement did not have an impact on our results of operations or financial condition for the year 
inflation the healthcare industry is labor intensive 
wages and other expenses increase  especially during periods of inflation and labor shortages 
in addition  suppliers pass along to us rising costs in the form of higher prices 
we generally have been able to offset increases in operating costs by increasing charges for services  expanding services  and implementing cost control measures to curb increases in operating costs and expenses 
in light of cost containment measures imposed by government agencies and private insurance companies  we do not know whether we will be able to offset or control future cost increases  or be able to pass on the increased costs associated with providing healthcare services to patients with government or managed care payors  unless such payors correspondingly increase reimbursement rates 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our policy is not to hold or issue derivatives for trading purposes and to avoid derivatives with leverage features 
our primary market risk involves interest rate risk 
our interest expense is sensitive to changes in the general level of interest rates 
to mitigate the impact of fluctuations in interest rates  we generally maintain of our debt at a fixed rate  either by borrowing on a long term basis or entering into an interest rate swap 
at december   of our outstanding debt was effectively at a fixed rate 
our interest rate swap contract allows us to periodically exchange fixed rate and floating rate payments over the life of the agreement 
floating rate payments are based on libor  and fixed rate payments are dependent upon market levels at the time the interest rate swap was consummated 
our interest rate swap is a cash flow hedge  which effectively converted an aggregate notional amount of million of floating rate borrowings to fixed rate borrowings at december  we are exposed to credit losses in the event of nonperformance by the counterparty to the financial instrument 
we anticipate that the counterparty will fully satisfy its obligations under the contract 
the carrying amount of our total long term debt  less current maturities  of million and million at december  and  respectively  approximated fair value 
at the december  borrowing level  a hypothetical adverse change in interest rates  considering the effect of the interest rate hedge agreement  would have no significant impact on our net income and cash flows 
a hypothetical adverse change in interest rates on the fixed rate debt would not have a material impact on the fair value of such debt
