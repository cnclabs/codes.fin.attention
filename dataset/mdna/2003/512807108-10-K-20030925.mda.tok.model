all references to fiscal years apply to our fiscal years  which ended june   june   and june  item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations results of operations lam research corporation lam or the company is a major supplier of semiconductor capital equipment 
our product offerings include single wafer plasma etch systems with a wide range of applications  cmp and cmp wafer cleaning systems  and an array of services designed to optimize the utilization of these systems by our customers 
the semiconductor industry is cyclical in nature and has historically experienced periodic downturns and upturns 
over the past business cycles  their severity has increased  and today s leading indicators of changes in customer investment patterns are no more reliable than in prior years 
demand for our equipment can fluctuate significantly from period to period as a result of various factors  including  but not limited to  economic conditions  supply  demand  and price for semiconductors  customer capacity requirements  and our ability to develop and market competitive products 
for these and other reasons  our results of operations for fiscal   and may not necessarily be indicative of future operating results 

table of contents total revenue year ended percent change june  june  june  versus versus in thousands revenue the sequential decrease in revenue for fiscal year and fiscal year compared to fiscal year reflects our customers response to excess capacity in the semiconductor industry  which was significantly influenced by the continued retrenchment of the global economy and levels of end user demand for products servicing telecommunications  computer  and consumer electronics markets 
semiconductor manufacturers have selectively invested in leading edge technology equipment through fiscal and are in the early stages of ramping these new capabilities at production volumes 
overall  demand has remained relatively flat during fiscal as reflected in the pattern of our quarterly revenues 
our current estimate for the september quarter is for revenues to be approximately at the same levels as the june quarter revenues 
the downturn that began in the second half of fiscal resulted in decreased revenues across nearly all product lines in fiscal the reduction in revenue for fiscal compared to fiscal was due to a worldwide decline in demand for integrated circuits which resulted in excess capacity in the semiconductor industry and severe contraction in capital investments 
we changed our revenue recognition policy in the fourth quarter of fiscal  effective june   based on guidance provided in sec staff accounting bulletin no 
sab  revenue recognition in financial statements 
refer to our discussion of critical accounting policies for additional information about our revenue recognition policy 
based on the guidance provided by sab  we generally recognize new systems revenue upon customer acceptance 
as a result  the fiscal period in which we are able to recognize systems revenue is subject to the length of time that our customers require to evaluate the performance of our equipment to agreed standards and specifications  after system installation 
systems revenue recognition generally occurs from two to seven months after the date of shipment 
spares revenues generally are recognized on the date of shipment  and service revenues are recognized generally upon performance of the activities requested by the customer  including training  upgrades  and extended warranty support 
regional geographic breakdown of revenue is as follows year ended june  june  june  north america europe asia pacific japan the growth of asia pacific revenues reflects expanded foundry operations and investments by memory chip manufacturers to lower their operating costs by introducing latest generation manufacturing equipment 

table of contents gross margin percent change year ended june  june  june  versus versus in thousands gross margin percent of total revenue the increase in gross margin as a percent of total revenues of percentage points in fiscal compared to fiscal was accomplished with an approximate percent reduction in revenues over the same periods 
we have focused on implementing strategies to outsource manufacturing activities in order to lower our breakeven point to approximately million in quarterly revenues at the end of fiscal further outsourcing of manufacturing assembly activities was accomplished throughout fiscal  continuing the trend toward achieving a more variable cost structure  by establishing transaction based pricing agreements with vendors  and  additionally enabling the elimination of infrastructure costs such as facilities 
the same strategy has provided opportunities to achieve lower material and assembly costs through improved systems design and leverage from a more focused supplier base 
the manufacturing assembly outsourcing model has required fundamental changes within the supply chain and within our business processes 
one objective of this strategy is to minimize certain costs related to holding inventories and managing product lifecycles 
specifically related to this point  in fiscal  we incurred incremental excess and obsolete inventory charges of million in the second fiscal quarter of  and in addition we incurred million of inventory restructuring expenses  contributing to approximately a basis points improvement in the gross margin percentage compared to fiscal the charges in fiscal reflected the known and anticipated impact of the downturn on our business at that point in time 
the reduction in excess and obsolete inventory costs in fiscal reflects more stability in quarter on quarter business levels during the year and other inventory management efforts 
our current outlook for the september quarter is for essentially flat gross margin as a percentage of revenues compared to the june quarter 
approximately basis points of the improvement in gross margin as a percentage of revenues for fiscal compared to the corresponding period a year ago is a result of million of charges to cost of goods sold related to a patent litigation settlement in fiscal in the second fiscal quarter of  we signed a final settlement agreement in connection with a patent infringement claim by varian semiconductor equipment associates  inc varian 
we agreed to pay varian million in cash and issued varian a warrant to purchase  shares of our common stock with a fair value of million 
in connection with this settlement  we recorded a charge of million  and the remaining amount of the settlement  million  represented the value of future licensed use of patents we received 
the million relating to the license will continue to be amortized ratably over the subsequent quarters as a charge to cost of goods sold 
accumulated amortization as of the end of fiscal was million 
additionally  our restructuring plans  combined with ongoing cost management activities have supported improved utilization rates in our manufacturing operations  contributing to the improvement in gross margin as a percentage of revenue in fiscal over fiscal the decrease in gross margin percentage in fiscal compared to fiscal stems from 
table of contents patent litigation settlement charges and obsolete inventory charges within cost of goods sold as well as unabsorbed manufacturing overhead costs due to lower production volumes 
in the second fiscal quarter of  we recorded a charge for excess and obsolete inventory of million 
we recorded the charge based on the results of our customary quarterly analysis of inventories and their net realizable value based on current market conditions and forecasted customer demand for related products 
this analysis highlighted limited anticipated consumption of our older generation equipment due to accelerated technological and product design changes 
research and development percent change year ended june  june  june  versus versus in thousands research development percent of total revenue the reduction in absolute dollars in fiscal  compared to fiscal  illustrates ongoing efforts to focus expenditures primarily on the development of critical next generation products 
spending in fiscal decreased compared to fiscal and included a reduction in employee related expenses and supplies expenses of approximately million  and lower infrastructure costs  principally reflected in reduced depreciation and amortization of another million 
additionally  r d expenses in fiscal of approximately million related to impairment charges and write downs in the value of selected laboratory equipment  which was determined to be no longer useful due to technological changes 
the increase in r d expenses as a percentage of revenues in fiscal compared to fiscal is the result of the lower sales volume in fiscal the decrease in r d expenses in absolute dollars in fiscal compared to fiscal results from alignment of spending on general r d programs with the downturn in the business cycle 
approximately  of fiscal systems revenues are derived from products introduced over the previous two years 
we believe that in order to remain competitive  we must continue to invest substantially in engineering and technology development 
accordingly  we devote a significant portion of our personnel and financial resources to these programs  which will result in sizeable levels of investment in next generation products and enhancement of existing products 
selling  general and administrative percent change year ended june  june  june  versus versus in thousands selling general administrative percent of total revenue the reduction in selling  general and administrative sg a expenses in fiscal  compared to the prior year  reflects the structural change in the targeted administrative functions that have been outsourced 
reduced salaries and benefits and supply costs have been significantly substituted with variable  largely transaction based pricing from selected providers 

table of contents infrastructure rationalization  including reduced facilities  has contributed the majority of the annual cost reduction from fiscal to fiscal in addition  sg a expenses in fiscal included a million impairment charge related to the write down in value of certain demonstration equipment used in sales and marketing activities  which was determined to be no longer useful due to technological changes 
in the quarter ended december   we modified the contractual life of and added additional vesting requirements to one of our chairman and chief executive officer s stock option awards 
as a result of the modification  we recorded deferred stock based compensation of million  which is being amortized ratably over the vesting period of the modified options  or quarters 
as of june   approximately million remained in deferred compensation within stockholders equity 
as modified  the option award provided for accelerated vesting triggered when the nasdaq national market closing price of our common stock reaches or exceeds per share 
at such time when vesting is accelerated  all unvested shares will immediately vest and become exercisable  and all remaining deferred compensation would then be recognized as compensation expense within sg a 
in the quarter ended september we modified the vesting requirements to this same option award by adding a second condition to the accelerated vesting provision 
refer to the subsequent event discussion included in this item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
the decrease in absolute dollars of sg a expenses in fiscal compared to fiscal was largely due to manpower reductions  lower incentive payments to employees  shutdown days  and other cost reduction programs in response to the contraction in our levels of revenue 
the increase in sg a expenses as a percentage of revenue for the same periods comparison was primarily the result of lower sales volume in fiscal restructuring charges we have developed and implemented restructuring plans in response to changes in business outlook with the intent to align our cost structure with anticipated revenue levels 
the frequency of our restructuring plans has been driven by the unpredictable and substantial changes in the semiconductor industry as a whole and the market for semiconductor processing equipment in particular 
these dynamic changes in the semiconductor industry and our business have required multiple integrated responses  including those activities within our restructuring plans  based on the best information and industry expert forecasts available at that point in time 
although management makes every attempt to consolidate all known restructuring activities into one plan  the extreme nature of our industry s business cycles and the rapidly changing forecasting environment places practical limitations on achieving this objective 
the implementation of restructuring activities and recognition of their impact in our financial statements does not preclude similar but unrelated actions from being necessary in future periods 
we distinguish regular operating cost management activities from restructuring activities 
accounting for restructuring activities requires an evaluation of formally committed and approved plans 
restructuring activities have comparatively greater strategic significance and materiality and may involve exit activities  whereas regular cost containment activities are more tactical in nature and are rarely characterized by formal and integrated action plans or exiting a particular product  facility  or service 

table of contents during fiscal  we incurred million of restructuring charges  net  associated with our fiscal   and restructuring plans 
as of june   the remaining restructuring reserve consisted of approximately million related to restructurings implemented during fiscal and approximately million related to restructurings implemented during fiscal fiscal restructuring activities we have developed programs and incurred restructuring charges in response to the depressed levels of capital investment by the semiconductor industry 
this situation has caused us to evaluate our revenue outlook and forecasts  employment levels  facilities utilization and outsourcing activities and the impact on manufacturing and administrative facilities 
based on these evaluations  our senior management committed to cost reduction and exit activities in the quarters ended june  the june plan  march  the march plan  and december  the december plan 
prior to the end of the june   march   and december  quarters  management with the proper level of authority approved specific actions under the respective plans and communicated the severance packages to potentially impacted employees in enough detail such that the employees could determine their type and amount of benefits 
none of the severance payments were contingent on employee s future service to the company 
the termination of the impacted employees occurred as soon as practical after the restructuring plans were announced 
the amount of remaining future lease payments for facilities we ceased to use and included in the restructuring charges are based on management s estimates using known prevailing real estate market conditions at that time 
leasehold improvements relating to the vacated buildings were written off  as these items will have no future economic benefit to us and have been abandoned 
we applied the accounting provisions of statement of financial accounting standards no 
accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities fas to the fiscal restructuring activities as we early adopted fas during the december quarter 
under the provisions of fas  the restructuring charges for the remaining contractual lease payments  computed as the present value of remaining contractual payments less estimated sublease income  on vacated facilities were recognized in the quarter in which the company ceased to use the facility 
as a result of the fiscal restructuring activities  we expect quarterly savings in total expenses of approximately million from the june plan  million from the march plan  and million from the december plan 
these estimated savings from the plans discrete actions are primarily related to lower employee payroll  facilities  and depreciation expenses 
actual savings may vary from anticipated savings  depending upon future events and circumstances  such as differences in actual sublease income versus estimated amounts 
through june   we believe actual savings are largely consistent with estimated savings 
however  other activities and factors may significantly 
table of contents influence our future cost structure and may offset savings from the plans

in addition  a tax expense of approximately million associated with implementing strategies to  in the longer term  limit our tax liability on the sale of our products worldwide  was recorded in the fourth quarter of fiscal these tax strategies are structured to align the asset ownership and functions of our various legal entities around the world  with our expectations of the level  timing  and sources of future revenues and profits 
in fiscal  we recorded an income tax benefit of million related to net losses incurred 
in addition  in the first quarter of fiscal  we increased our tax benefit rate to 
the increase resulted from the tax benefit of the r d credit being proportionately greater in subsequent quarters due to lower projected pretax income and investment in engineering and development programs qualifying for r d tax benefits 
for fiscal year  we recorded an income tax expense of million  which was of income before taxes 
deferred tax assets we had gross deferred tax assets arising from non deductible temporary differences  net operating losses  and tax credit carryforwards of million and million in fiscal and the gross deferred tax assets are offset by valuation allowances of million and million and deferred tax liabilities of million and million in fiscal and realization of our net deferred tax assets is dependent on future taxable income 
we believe it is more likely than not that such assets will be realized  however  ultimate realization could be negatively impacted by market conditions and other variables not known or anticipated at this time 
we evaluate the realizability of the deferred tax assets quarterly and will continue to assess the need for additional valuation allowances  if any 
outsourcing we define aspects of our business as either core or critical capabilities and those that are in support of these activities 
we have identified as critical for success in the marketplace our ability to develop leading edge products  to market and sell what we develop  and to service and 
table of contents support directly what we sell 
most other activities in the company are in support of product development  marketing and selling and customer service 
consequently  in the fourth quarter of fiscal  we began implementation of an outsourcing strategy to obtain certain support services from third parties 
accordingly  during fiscal  we began to enter into agreements to outsource elements of our manufacturing  warehousing  logistics  facilities management and information technology functions 
during fiscal  we continued to enter into agreements to outsource certain elements of our transactional general and administrative functions 
we believe that entering into these outsourcing programs will provide us with more flexibility to scale our operations in a more timely manner to respond to the cyclical nature of our business 
implementing this outsourcing strategy is intended to lead to proportionally more of our employees supporting core activities and decrease our reliance on temporary workforce during peak business cycles as well as reduce the fluctuation in employment that occurs due to the cyclical nature of our business 
related party transactions during fiscal year  our president and chief operating officer signed a promissory note with lam entitling him to borrow up to million dollars at simple interest 
at june   the entire principal amount  million  and accrued interest was outstanding 
the loan is secured by a mortgage on his personal residence and is repayable  in full  together with accrued interest  at any time  but no later than may  subsequent events during the quarter ending september  we added a second condition to the accelerated vesting provision contained in one of our chairman and chief executive officer s stock option awards that was previously modified in the december quarter 
when and if the vesting of the award is accelerated  all unvested shares shall immediately become fully vested and exercisable  and any remaining deferred compensation would then be recognized as compensation expense within sg a 
the award now provides for accelerated vesting when each of the following conditions is met the nasdaq national market closing price of lam common stock reaches or exceeds per share  and applying us generally accepted accounting principles  lam s fiscal quarter net income exceeds million after deducting any incremental amortization expense that results from acceleration of these same options 
the two conditions need not be met simultaneously nor in a specific order 
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america  requires management to make certain judgments  estimates and assumptions that could affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period 
we based our estimates and assumptions on historical experience and on various other assumptions believed to be applicable  and evaluated them on an on going basis to ensure they remained reasonable under current conditions 
actual results could differ significantly from those estimates 
the significant accounting policies used in the preparation of our financial statements are described in note of our notes to consolidated financial statements 
some of these significant accounting polices are considered to be critical accounting policies 
a critical accounting policy is defined as one that has both a material impact on our financial condition and results of operations and requires us to make difficult  complex and subjective judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates about matters that are inherently uncertain 
we believe that the following critical accounting policies reflect the more significant 
table of contents judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition we recognize all revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred or services have been rendered  the selling price is fixed or determinable  collectibility is reasonably assured  and we have completed our system installation obligations  received customer acceptance  or are otherwise released from our installation or customer acceptance obligations 
in the event that terms of the sale provide for a lapsing customer acceptance period  we recognize revenue upon the expiration of the lapsing acceptance period or customer acceptance  whichever occurs first 
in circumstances where the practices of a customer do not provide for a written acceptance and in addition  the terms of sale do not include a lapsing acceptance provision  we recognize revenue where it can be reliably demonstrated that the delivered system meets all of the customer specifications 
revenue related to sales of spare parts  system upgrade kits  and remanufactured systems is generally recognized upon shipment 
revenue related to services is generally recognized upon completion of performance of the services requested by a customer order 
revenue for extended maintenance service contracts with a fixed payment amount and a term more than one month is recognized on a straight line basis over the term of the contract 
we changed our revenue recognition policy in the fourth quarter of fiscal  effective june   based on guidance provided in sab inventory valuation inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market using standard costs  which approximate actual cost on a first in  first out basis 
we maintain a perpetual inventory system and continuously record the quantity on hand and standard cost for each product  including purchased components  subassemblies and finished goods 
we maintain the integrity of perpetual inventory records through periodic physical counts of quantities on hand 
finished goods are reported as inventories until the point of title transfer to the customer 
generally  title transfer is documented in the terms of sale 
when the terms of sale do not specify when title transfers  we assume title transfers when we complete physical delivery of the products unless other customer practices prevail 
standard costs are generally re assessed at least annually and reflect achievable acquisition costs  generally the most recent vendor contract prices for purchased parts  currently obtainable assembly and test labor  and overhead for internally manufactured products 
manufacturing labor and overhead costs are attributed to individual product standard costs at a level planned to absorb spending at average utilization volumes 
all intercompany profits related to the sale and purchase of inventory between our legal entities are eliminated from our consolidated financial statements 
management evaluates the need to record adjustments for impairment of inventory at least quarterly 
our policy is to assess the valuation of all inventories  including manufacturing raw materials  work in process  finished goods and spare parts in each reporting period 
obsolete inventory or inventory in excess of management s estimated usage requirements over the next to months is written down to its estimated market value  if less than cost 
inherent in the estimates of market value are management s forecasts related to our future manufacturing schedules  customer demand  technological and or market obsolescence  general semiconductor market conditions  possible alternative uses and ultimate realization of excess inventory 
if future customer demand or market conditions are less favorable than our projections  additional inventory write downs may be required  and would be reflected in cost of sales in the period the revision is made 
warranty typically  marketing and selling semiconductor capital equipment includes providing parts and service warranty to customers as part of the overall price of the system 
we provide standard warranties for our systems that run generally for a period of months from 
table of contents system acceptance  not to exceed months from shipment of the system to the customer 
we record a provision for estimated warranty expenses to cost of sales for each system upon revenue recognition 
the amount recorded is based on an analysis of historical activity  which uses factors such as type of system  customer  geographic region  and any known differences such as tool reliability improvements 
all actual parts and labor costs incurred in subsequent periods are charged to those established reserves through the application of detailed project record keeping 
actual warranty expenses are incurred on a system by system basis  and may differ from our original estimates 
while we periodically monitor the performance and cost of warranty activities  if actual costs incurred are different than our estimates  we may recognize adjustments to provisions in the period in which those differences arise or are identified 
accordingly  actual costs that exceed the estimates are expensed as incurred  and at the same time  additional probable and estimable liabilities may be recorded 
we do not maintain general or unspecified reserves  all warranty reserves are related to specific systems 
historically  including the most recent months ended june   all warranty obligations have been determined with reasonable estimates 
in addition to the provision of standard warranties  we offer customer paid extended warranty services 
revenues for extended maintenance and warranty services with a fixed payment amount and a term of more than one month are recognized on a straight line basis over the term of the contract 
related costs are recorded either as incurred or when related liabilities are determined to be probable and estimable

our espp is a non compensatory plan  and our stock option plans are accounted for using the intrinsic value method under the provisions of apb pro forma net income loss and pro forma net income loss per share disclosed in the footnotes to our annual consolidated financial statements are estimated using a black scholes option valuation model 
the black scholes option valuation model was developed for use in estimating the fair value of traded options which have no vesting restrictions and which are fully transferable 
in addition  the black scholes model requires the input of highly subjective assumptions  including expected stock price volatility and the estimated life of each option 
because our stock based awards to employees have characteristics significantly different from those of traded options  and because changes in the subjective input assumptions can materially affect the fair value estimate  in management s opinion the existing models do not necessarily provide a reliable measure of the fair value of our stock based awards to employees 
deferred income taxes we record a valuation allowance to reduce our net deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
realization of our net deferred tax assets is dependent on future taxable income 
we believe it is more likely than not that such assets will be realized  however  ultimate realization could be negatively impacted by market conditions and other variables not known or anticipated at this time 
in the event that we determine that we would not be able to realize all or part of our net deferred tax assets  an adjustment would be charged to earnings in the period such determination is made 
likewise  if we later determine that it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets would be realized  then the previously provided valuation allowance would be reversed 
our current valuation allowance of million covers the tax benefit from the exercise of employee stock options and foreign tax credits 
when the stock option tax benefits are realized  a portion of the valuation allowance will be reversed and credited to capital in excess of par value 
when the foreign tax credits are realized  the remaining portion of the valuation allowance will be reversed through the tax provision benefit in the statement of operations as a reduction of income tax expense

 liability recognition for certain employee termination benefits and other costs to exit an activity including certain costs incurred in a restructuring eitf 
the principal difference between fas and eitf relates to fas s requirements for the timing of recognizing a liability for a cost associated with an exit or disposal activity 
fas requires that a liability for a cost associated with an exit or disposal activity be recognized when the liability is incurred

fin establishes accounting guidance for consolidation of a variable interest entity vie  sometimes formerly referred to as a special purpose entity 
in general  a vie is a corporation  partnership  trust  or any other legal structure used for business purposes that either a does not have equity investors with voting rights or b has equity investors that do not provide sufficient financial resources for the entity to support its activities 
fin applies to any business enterprise  both public and private  that has a controlling interest  contractual relationship  or other business relationship with a vie 
fin provides guidance for determining when an entity  the primary beneficiary  should consolidate another entity  a vie  that functions to support the activities of the primary beneficiary 
fin will require the consolidation of a vie by a company if that company is subject to a majority of the risk of loss from the vie s activities or entitled to receive a majority of the vie s residual returns or both

fas amends statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities fas for decisions made as part of the derivatives implementation group dig and changes financial reporting by requiring that contracts with comparable characteristics be accounted for similarly 
specifically  fas clarifies under what circumstances a contract with an initial net investment meets the characteristic of a derivative as discussed in fas  clarifies when a derivative contains a financing component that requires reporting as cash flows from financing activities in the statement of cash flows  and amends the definition of an underlying to include a variable such as the occurrence or nonoccurrence of a specified event to correspond to the language in fin these changes will result in more consistent reporting of contracts that are derivatives in their entirety or that contain embedded derivatives that require separate accounting 
fas is effective for contracts entered into or modified after june   and for hedging relationships designated after june  however  the provisions of fas that codify the previous decisions made by the dig are already effective and should continue to be applied in accordance with their prior respective effective dates

 accounting for certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and 
table of contents equity  fas 
fas establishes standards for how an issuer classifies and measures certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity 
fas represents a significant change in practice in the accounting for a number of financial instruments including mandatorily redeemable equity instruments and certain equity derivatives that frequently are used in connection with share repurchase programs 
fas generally requires liability classification for two broad classes of financial instruments instruments that represent  or indexed to  an obligation to buy back the issuer s shares  regardless of whether the instrument is settled on a net cash or gross physical basis  obligations that can be settled in shares but meet one of the following conditions a derive their value predominately from some other underlying  or b have a fixed value  or have a value to the counterparty that moves in the opposite direction as the issuer s shares 
many of the instruments within the scope of fas were previously classified by the issuer as equity or temporary equity 
fas is effective for financial instruments entered into or modified after may  and otherwise is effective in the first quarter of fiscal the adoption of fas is not anticipated to have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations 
off balance sheet arrangements and contractual obligations we have certain obligations  some of which are recorded on our balance sheet and some which are not  to make future payments under various contracts such as debt agreements  lease agreements  consignment materials and outsourcing agreements

the lessor is a substantive independent leasing company that does not have the characteristics of a vie as defined by fin  and  therefore  we do not consolidate its operations 
in june  two lease agreements relating to four properties land and buildings at our fremont  california campus were transferred to a new lessor and amended and restated the lease agreement 
in connection with this transaction  the leases were combined and transferred from the existing lessors to a new lessor  under a single lease structure 
as part of the lease agreement  we have the option to purchase the buildings at any time for approximately million

purchase obligations during the second half of fiscal  we began to enter into agreements with third parties to outsource certain elements of our manufacturing  warehousing  logistics  facilities maintenance  and information technology functions 
during fiscal  we continued to enter into agreements to outsource certain elements of our transactional  general and administrative functions 
we believe that these outsourced services will provide us with more flexibility to scale our operations in a more timely manner to respond to the cyclical nature of our business 
in addition to minimum spending commitments  certain of these agreements provide for potential cancellation charges including the potential assumption of leases  assets and employees 
refer to note of our consolidated financial statements  included in item in this form for additional information

at june   our outstanding purchase obligation for these agreements was approximately million 
consignment inventories  which are owned by vendors but located in our discrete storage locations and warehouses  are not reported as inventory until title is transferred to us  or our purchase obligation is determined 
at june   vendor owned inventories held at lam and not reported as inventory were approximately million 
guarantees the transferred lease agreements relating to various properties at our fremont  california campus and discussed above under operating leases require us to guarantee residual values of the leased properties to the lessors at the end of the lease terms of up to million 
the terms of these guarantees  five years  are equal to the remaining terms of the related lease agreements 
under the accounting provisions of fin  we recognized a liability of approximately million for the related residual value guarantees under these leases 
this liability  determined by computing the present value of estimated probability weighted cash flows to be paid by us over 
table of contents the term of the guarantees  was recorded as prepaid rent  with the offset recorded as a liability  and the amount is being amortized to rent expense for the prepaid rent and to income for the liability on a ratable basis over the five year period of the leases 
refer to note of our consolidated financial statements  included in item in this form k  for further information concerning our guaranteed residual values 
we have issued certain indemnifications to our lessors under certain of our operating lease agreements  such as  indemnification for certain environmental matters 
we have entered into certain insurance contracts to minimize our exposure related to such indemnifications 
as of june   we have not recorded any liability on our financial statements in connection with these indemnifications  as we do not believe  based on information available  that it is probable that any amounts will be paid under these guarantees 
we have agreements with two financial institutions where our us operating company guarantees payment of our japanese subsidiary s overdraft protection obligation 
the maximum potential amount of future payments that we could be required to make under these agreements at june   is approximately million  the amount available under the overdraft protection agreement 
as of june   our japanese subsidiary did not owe any amounts under this agreement

we have an agreement with a financial institution to sell certain us dollar denominated receivables generated from the sale of our systems  subject to recourse provisions 
we insure these sold receivables for approximately of their value and guarantee payment of the remaining uninsured receivable value in the event that the payment obligation is not satisfied 
based on historical payment patterns  we have experienced negligible default on payment obligations and therefore  believe the risk of loss from default is minimal 
the terms of these guarantees are from days past the due date of the receivable  until collected

liquidity and capital resources as of june   we had million in cash  cash equivalents  short term investments  and restricted cash compared with million at june  net cash provided by operating activities was million in fiscal  which consists of a net loss for the year of million  adjusted for non cash charges of million and sources of working capital of million 
non cash charges include items such as depreciation and amortization  restructuring charges  deferred income taxes  and the adjustment for the loss on equity derivative contracts in our stock 

table of contents significant changes in current assets and liabilities include a million improvement in accounts receivable resulting from continued improvement in accounts receivable turnover 
additionally  our outsourcing strategy and asset management efforts contributed to reduction of inventory levels of approximately million 
trade payables declined by million due to reduced spending resulting from our cost containment activities and lower inventory purchases 
accrued liabilities declined by million due in part to tax payments and lower interest payable resulting from the redemption of our convertible subordinated notes 
deferred profits for shipments not yet recognized as revenue fell million  due to lower rates of shipments and the reduced cycle time in customer acceptances 
net cash provided by investing activities during fiscal was million 
we sold million  net  of short term investments that were primarily used to repay our convertible subordinated notes notes in september net capital expenditures were million  and our restricted cash increased million primarily due to increased cash collateralization requirements under certain of our operating lease agreements 
net property and equipment was million at june   compared to million at june  the decrease in property and equipment in fiscal compared to fiscal is primarily due to minimized expenditures for capital projects during fiscal and write offs of leasehold improvements and certain fixed assets related to buildings that we have vacated due to restructuring activities 
net cash used by financing activities in fiscal was million and consisted primarily of the repayment of our notes in the amount of million and repayment of our japanese subsidiary s long term loan for approximately million 
in connection with the settlement of our equity derivative contract  we repurchased approximately million shares of our common stock for million 
we also reissued million from treasury stock through our employee stock purchase program 
net proceeds from the issuance of our common stock from stock option exercises totaled million 
during fiscal  we settled our outstanding equity derivative contracts that were recorded in other short term assets 
based on the market price of our common stock at the contract settlement date august   the fair value of the equity derivative contracts decreased by million to million from their june  fair value of million 
currently outstanding debt obligations primarily consist of our notes 
details of the notes are offering date may offering amount million maturity date june  offering expenses million incurred at the time of offering  ratably amortized to other expense over the term of the notes

during the third quarter of fiscal  we entered into an interest rate swap agreement the swap with a notional amount of million in order to hedge changes in the fair value of our notes  attributable to changes in the benchmark interest rate 
the transaction swapped fixed interest payments for variable interest payments based on the london interbank offered rate libor  resulting in interest expense savings of approximately million for the fiscal year ended june  should month libor interest rates rise above approximately per annum in future periods  we would incur incremental interest expense 
under the terms of the transaction  we must provide collateral to match any unfavorable mark to market exposure fair value on the swap 
the amount of collateral required totals a minimum of million plus an amount equal to the unfavorable mark to market exposure fair value on the swap 
therefore  the amount of cash collateral we will have to post in the future will fluctuate from quarter to quarter commensurate with the mark to market exposure fair value on the swap instrument 
generally  the required collateral will rise as interest rates rise 
at the end of fiscal  we have posted million of collateral under this swap agreement which is included in restricted cash on our balance sheet classified as a long term asset 
we have designated this swap as a fair value hedge under the provisions of fas this discussion should be read in conjunction with note of our consolidated financial statements  included in item of this form k 
during the second quarter of fiscal  we signed a final settlement agreement with varian semiconductor equipment associates  inc varian in connection with the patent infringement litigation filed by varian in october under the terms of the settlement agreement  varian granted us a nonexclusive license to the patents involved in the litigation 
we agreed to pay varian million in cash million in december and the remainder to be paid in equal quarterly installments of million over a three year period 
these payments began in the third quarter of fiscal as of june   a total amount of million had been paid to varian  which included the initial million in december and six additional quarterly installment payments of million each  totaling million as of june  the total obligation remaining as of june  is million  which will be paid through december given the cyclical nature of the semiconductor equipment industry  we believe that maintaining sufficient liquidity reserves is important to ensure our ability to sustain levels of investment in r d and capital infrastructure through ensuing business cycles 
based upon our current business outlook  our levels of cash  cash equivalents  and short term investments at june   combined with cash conservation activities  are expected to be sufficient to support our presently anticipated levels of operations  investments  and capital expenditures  through at least the next months 
in the longer term  liquidity will depend to a great extent on our future revenues and our ability to appropriately size our business based on demand for our products 

table of contents risk factors our quarterly revenues and operating results are unpredictable our revenues and operating results may fluctuate significantly from quarter to quarter due to a number of factors  not all of which are in our control 
we manage our expense levels based in part on our expectations of future revenues 
if revenue levels in a particular quarter do not meet our expectations  our operating results may be adversely affected 
because our operating expenses are based in part on anticipated future revenues  and a certain amount of those expenses are relatively fixed  a change in the timing of recognition of revenue and or the level of gross profit from a single transaction can unfavorably affect operating results in a particular quarter 
factors that may cause our financial results to fluctuate unpredictably include  but are not limited to economic conditions in the electronics and semiconductor industry generally and the equipment industry specifically  the extent that customers use our products and services in their business  timing of customer acceptances of equipment  the size and timing of orders from customers  customer cancellations or delays in our shipments  installations  and or acceptances  changes in average selling prices and product mix  our ability in a timely manner to develop  introduce and market new  enhanced and competitive products  our competitors introduction of new products  legal or technical challenges to our products and technology  changes in import export regulations  transportation  communication  demand  information technology or supply disruptions based on factors outside our control such as acts of god  wars  terrorist activities and natural disasters  legislative  tax  or regulatory changes or changes in their interpretation  procurement shortages  manufacturing difficulties  the failure of our suppliers or outsource providers to perform their obligations in a manner consistent with our expectations  new or modified accounting regulations  exchange rate fluctuations  and exposure on interest rate swap agreements 

table of contents further  because a significant amount of our r d and administrative operations and capacity is located at our fremont  california  facility  natural  physical  logistical or other events or disruptions affecting this facility including labor disruptions  earthquakes and power failures could adversely impact our financial performance 
we derive our revenues primarily from a relatively small number of high priced systems system sales constitute a significant portion of our total revenue 
our systems can range in price from approximately  to million per unit  and our revenues in any given quarter are dependent upon the acceptance of a rather limited number of such systems 
as a result  the inability to declare revenue on even a few systems can cause a significant adverse impact on our revenues for that quarter 
variations in the amount of time it takes for our customers to accept our systems may cause fluctuation in our operating results we generally recognize revenue for new system sales on the date of customer acceptance or the date the contractual customer acceptance provisions lapse 
as a result  the fiscal period in which we are able to recognize new systems revenues is subject to the length of time that our customers require to evaluate the performance of our equipment after shipment and installation  which could cause our quarterly operating results to fluctuate 
the semiconductor equipment industry is volatile and reduced product demand has a negative impact on shipments our business depends on the capital equipment expenditures of semiconductor manufacturers  which in turn depend on the current and anticipated market demand for integrated circuits and products using integrated circuits 
the semiconductor industry is cyclical in nature and historically experiences periodic downturns 
during calendar year and the first half of calendar year  semiconductor manufacturers canceled or delayed delivery of orders as a result of overcapacity 
the resulting demand contraction had a negative impact on the level of system shipments during fiscal compared to fiscal the semiconductor industry is experiencing a continued and prolonged downturn  and as of the end of fiscal  our customers continue to remain cautious about their levels of capital expenditures 
fluctuating levels of investment by the semiconductor manufacturers could continue to materially affect our aggregate shipments  revenues and operating results 
we will attempt to respond to these fluctuations with cost management programs aimed at aligning our expenditures with anticipated revenue streams  which sometimes result in restructuring charges 
even during periods of reduced revenues  we must continue to invest in research and development and maintain extensive ongoing worldwide customer service and support capabilities to remain competitive  which may temporarily harm our financial results 
we depend on new products and processes for our success 
consequently  we are subject to risks associated with rapid technological change rapid technological changes in semiconductor manufacturing processes subject us to increased pressure to develop technological advances enabling such processes 
we believe that our future success depends in part upon our ability to develop and offer new products with improved capabilities and to continue to enhance our existing products 
if new products have reliability or quality problems  our performance may be impacted by reduced orders  higher manufacturing costs  delays in acceptance of and payment for new products  and additional service and warranty expenses 
we may be unable to develop and have new products manufactured successfully  or new products that we introduce may fail in the marketplace 
our 
table of contents failure to complete commercialization of these new products in a timely manner could result in unanticipated costs and inventory obsolescence  which would adversely affect our financial results 
in order to develop new products and processes  we expect to continue to make significant investments in r d and to pursue joint development relationships with customers or other members of the industry 
we must manage product transitions and joint development relationships successfully  as introduction of new products could adversely affect our sales of existing products 
future technologies  processes or product developments may render our current product offerings obsolete  leaving us with non competitive products  or obsolete inventory  or both 
we are subject to risks relating to product concentration and lack of product revenue diversification we derive a substantial percentage of our revenues from a limited number of products  and we expect these products to continue to account for a large percentage of our revenues in the near term 
continued market acceptance of our primary products is  therefore  critical to our future success 
our business  operating results  financial condition  and cash flows could therefore be adversely affected by a decline in demand for even a limited number of our products  a failure to achieve continued market acceptance of our key products  an improved version of products being offered by a competitor in the market we participate in  technological change that we are unable to address with our products  and a failure to release new enhanced versions of our products on a timely basis 
we have a limited number of key customers sales to a limited number of large customers constitute a significant portion of our overall revenue 
as a result  the actions of even one customer may subject us to revenue swings that are difficult to predict or prepare for 
similarly  significant portions of our credit risk may  at any given time  be concentrated among a limited number of customers 
we are dependent upon a limited number of key suppliers we obtain certain components and sub assemblies included in our products from a single supplier or a limited group of suppliers 
we have established long term contracts with many of these suppliers 
these long term contracts can take a variety of forms 
we may renew these contracts periodically 
in some cases  these component suppliers sold us products during at least the last four years  and we expect that we will continue to renew these contracts in the future or that we will otherwise replace them with competent alternative source suppliers 
however  several of our outsourced assembly suppliers are new providers to us so that our experience with them and their performance is limited 
where practical  our intent is to establish alternative sources to mitigate the risk that the failure of any single supplier will adversely affect our business 
nevertheless  a prolonged inability to obtain certain components could impair our ability to ship products  lower our revenues and thus adversely affect our operating results and result in damage to our customer relationships 
our outsource providers may fail to perform as we expect 
table of contents we are expanding the roles that outsource providers play in our business 
we anticipate that these outsource providers will play key roles in our manufacturing operations and in many of our transactional and administrative functions 
although we aim at selecting reputable providers and secure their performance on terms documented in written contracts  it is possible that one or more of these providers could fail to perform as we expect and such failure could have an adverse impact on our business 
in addition  the expanded role of outsource providers has and will require us to implement changes to our existing operations and to adopt new procedures to deal with and manage the performance of these outsource providers 
any delay or failure in the implementation of our operational changes and new procedures could adversely affect our customer relationships and or have a negative effect on our operating results 
once a semiconductor manufacturer commits to purchase a competitor s semiconductor manufacturing equipment  the manufacturer typically continues to purchase that competitor s equipment  making it more difficult for us to sell our equipment to that customer semiconductor manufacturers must make a substantial investment to qualify and integrate wafer processing equipment into a semiconductor production line 
we believe that once a semiconductor manufacturer selects a particular supplier s processing equipment  the manufacturer generally relies upon that equipment for that specific production line application 
accordingly  we expect it to be more difficult to sell to a given customer if that customer initially selects a competitor s equipment 
we are subject to risks associated with our competitors introduction of new products and we may lack the financial resources or technological capabilities of certain of our competitors needed to capture increased market share we expect to face significant competition from multiple current and future competitors 
we believe that other companies are developing systems and products that are competitive to ours and are planning to introduce new products  which may affect our ability to sell our existing products 
we face a greater risk if our competitors enter into strategic relationships with leading semiconductor manufacturers covering products similar to those we sell or may develop  as this could adversely affect our ability to sell products to those manufacturers 
we believe that to remain competitive we will require significant financial resources to offer a broad range of products  to maintain customer service and support centers worldwide  and to invest in product and process r d 
certain of our competitors have substantially greater financial resources and more extensive engineering  manufacturing  marketing  and customer service and support resources than we do and therefore have the potential to increasingly dominate the semiconductor equipment industry 
these competitors may deeply discount or give away products similar to those that we sell  challenging or even exceeding our ability to make similar accommodations and threatening our ability to sell those products 
for these reasons  we may fail to continue to compete successfully worldwide 
in addition  our competitors may provide innovative technology that may have performance advantages over systems we currently  or expect to  offer 
they may be able to develop products comparable or superior to those we offer or may adapt more quickly to new technologies or evolving customer requirements 
in particular  while we currently are developing additional product enhancements that we believe will address future customer requirements  we may fail in a timely manner to complete the development or introduction of these additional product enhancements successfully  or these product enhancements may not achieve market acceptance or be competitive 
accordingly  we may be unable to continue to compete in our markets  competition may intensify  or future competition may have a material adverse effect on our revenues  operating results  financial condition  and or cash flows 

table of contents our future success depends on international sales non us sales accounted for approximately of our total revenue in fiscal  in fiscal  and in fiscal we expect that international sales will continue to account for a significant portion of our total revenue in future years 
international sales are subject to risks  including  but not limited to foreign exchange risks  changing import export requirements  foreign trade disputes  and economic  political  banking and currency problems in the relevant region 
we currently enter into foreign currency forward contracts to minimize the short term impact of exchange rate fluctuations on japanese yen denominated assets and will continue to enter into hedging transactions for the purposes outlined in the foreseeable future 
a failure to comply with environmental regulations may adversely affect our operating results we are subject to a variety of governmental regulations related to the discharge or disposal of toxic  volatile or otherwise hazardous chemicals 
we believe that we are in general compliance with these regulations and that we have obtained or will obtain or are otherwise addressing all necessary environmental permits to conduct our business 
these permits generally relate to the disposal of hazardous wastes 
nevertheless  the failure to comply with present or future regulations could result in fines being imposed on us  suspension of production  cessation of our operations or reduction in our customers acceptance of our products 
these regulations could require us to alter our current operations  to acquire significant equipment or to incur substantial other expenses to comply with environmental regulations 
our failure to control the use  sale  transport or disposal of hazardous substances could subject us to future liabilities 
if we are unable to adjust the scale of our business in response to rapid changes in demand in the semiconductor equipment industry  our operating results and our ability to compete successfully may be impaired the business cycle in the semiconductor equipment industry is characterized by frequent periods of rapid change in demand that challenge our management to adjust spending on operating activities 
during periods of rapid growth or decline in demand for our products and services  we face significant challenges in maintaining adequate financial and business controls  management processes  information systems and procedures on a timely basis and training  managing  and appropriately sizing our work force 
our success will depend  to a significant extent  on the ability of our executive officers and other members of our senior management to identify and respond to these challenges effectively 
if we do not adequately meet these challenges  our gross margins and earnings may be impaired during periods of demand decline  and we may lack the infrastructure and resources to scale up our business to meet customer expectations and compete successfully during periods of demand growth 
if we choose to acquire or dispose of product lines and technologies  we may encounter unforeseen costs and difficulties that could impair our financial performance an important element of our management strategy is to review acquisition prospects that would complement our existing products  augment our market coverage and distribution ability  or enhance our technological capabilities 
as a result  we may make acquisitions of 
table of contents complementary companies  products or technologies  or we may reduce or dispose of certain product lines or technologies  which no longer fit our long term strategies 
managing an acquired business  disposing of product technologies or reducing personnel entails numerous operational and financial risks  including difficulties in assimilating acquired operations and new personnel or separating existing business or product groups  diversion of management s attention away from other business concerns  amortization of acquired intangible assets and potential loss of key employees or customers of acquired or disposed operations among others 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to achieve and manage successfully any such integration of potential acquisitions  disposition of product lines or technologies  or reduction in personnel or that our management  personnel  or systems will be adequate to support continued operations 
any such inabilities or inadequacies could have a material adverse effect on our business  operating results  financial condition  and cash flows 
in addition  any acquisitions could result in changes such as potentially dilutive issuances of equity securities  the incurrence of debt and contingent liabilities  the amortization of related intangible assets  and goodwill impairment charges  any of which could materially adversely affect our business  financial condition  and results of operations and or the price of our common stock 
the market for our common stock is extremely volatile  which may affect our ability to raise capital or make acquisitions the market price for our common stock is extremely volatile and has fluctuated significantly over the past years 
the trading price of our common stock could continue to be highly volatile and fluctuate widely in response to factors  including but not limited to the following general market  semiconductor  or semiconductor equipment industry conditions  global economic fluctuations  variations in our quarterly operating results  variations in our revenues or earnings from levels that securities analysts forecast  announcements of restructurings  technological innovations  reductions in force  departure of key employees  consolidations of operations  or introduction of new products  government regulations  developments in  or claims relating to  patent or other proprietary rights  disruptions with key customers or suppliers  or political  economic  or environmental events occurring globally or in any of our key sales regions 
in addition  the stock market experiences significant price and volume fluctuations 
historically  we have witnessed significant volatility in the price of our common stock due in part to the actual or anticipated movement in interest rates and the price of and markets for semiconductors 
these broad market and industry factors have and may again adversely affect the price of our common stock  regardless of our actual operating performance 
in the past  following volatile periods in the price of stock  many companies became the object of securities class action litigation 
if we are sued in a securities class action  we could incur substantial costs  and it could divert a management s attention and resources and have an unfavorable impact on the 
table of contents price for our common stock 
we rely upon certain critical information systems for the operation of our business we maintain and rely upon certain critical information systems for the effective operation of our business 
these information systems include telecommunications  the internet  our corporate intranet  various computer hardware and software applications  network communications  and email 
these information systems may be owned by us or by our outsource providers or even third parties such as vendors and contractors and may be maintained by us or by such providers and third parties 
these information systems are subject to attacks  failures  and access denials from a number of potential sources including viruses  destructive or inadequate code  power failures  and physical damage to computers  hard drives  communication lines  and networking equipment 
we have security procedures  such as virus protection software and emergency recovery processes  that are believed to be adequate to cover the outlined risks  however  our inability to use or access these information systems at critical points in time could unfavorably impact the timely and efficient operation of our business 
risk associated with our interest rate swap agreement we aim to limit the impact of interest rate exposure associated with our interest rate sensitive investments and debt obligations 
to minimize the effect of the interest rate exposure associated with our convertible subordinated notes  we have entered into an interest rate swap agreement with a notional amount of million 
we entered into the swap in order to hedge changes in the fair value of our notes  attributable to changes in the benchmark interest rate  by swapping fixed interest payments for variable interest payments based on the libor based interest rate 
if month libor based interest rates remain at current levels or decrease we expect the swap will result in interest savings 
however  a rise in month libor based interest rates above approximately per annum in future periods would result in incremental levels of interest expense 
the potential anti takeover effects of our bylaws provisions and the rights plan we have in place may affect our stock price and inhibit a change of control desired by some of our stockholders in  we adopted a rights plan the rights plan in which rights were distributed as a dividend at the rate of one right for each share of our common stock  held by stockholders of record as of the close of business on january   and thereafter 
in connection with the adoption of the rights plan  our board of directors also adopted a number of amendments to our bylaws  including amendments requiring advance notice of stockholder nominations of directors and stockholder proposals 
our rights plan may have certain anti takeover effects 
our rights plan will cause substantial dilution to a person or group that attempts to acquire lam in certain circumstances 
accordingly  the existence of the rights plan and the issuance of the related rights may deter certain acquirers from making takeover proposals or tender offers 
the rights plan  however  is not intended to prevent a takeover 
rather it is designed to enhance the ability of our board of directors to negotiate with a potential acquirer on behalf of all of our stockholders 
in addition  our certificate of incorporation authorizes issuance of  shares of undesignated preferred stock 
our board of directors  without further stockholder approval  may issue this preferred stock on such terms as the board of directors may determine  which also could have the effect of delaying or preventing a change in control of lam 
the issuance of preferred stock could also adversely affect the voting power of the holders of our common stock  including causing the loss of voting control 
moreover  section of the delaware general corporation law restricts certain business combinations with interested stockholders  as defined by that statute 
intellectual property and other claims against us can be costly and could result in the loss of significant rights which are necessary to our continued business and profitability third parties may assert infringement  unfair competition or other claims against us 
from time to time  other parties send us notices alleging that our products infringe their patent or other intellectual property rights 
in addition  our bylaws and indemnity agreements with certain officers  directors and key employees provide that we will indemnify officers and directors against losses that they may incur in legal proceedings resulting from their service to lam 
in such cases  it is our policy either to defend the claims or to negotiate licenses on commercially reasonable terms 
however  we may be unable in the future to negotiate necessary licenses on commercially reasonable terms  or at all  and any litigation resulting from these claims by other 
table of contents parties may materially adversely affect our business and financial results 
we may fail to protect our proprietary technology rights  which would affect our business our success depends in part on our proprietary technology 
while we attempt to protect our proprietary technology through patents  copyrights and trade secret protection  we believe that our success also depends on increasing our technological expertise  continuing our development of new systems  increasing market penetration and growth of our installed base  and providing comprehensive support and service to our customers 
however  we may be unable to protect our technology in all instances  or our competitors may develop similar or more competitive technology independently 
we currently hold a number of united states and foreign patents and pending patent applications 
however  other parties may challenge or attempt to invalidate or circumvent any patents the united states or foreign governments issue to us or these governments may fail to issue pending applications 
in addition  the rights granted or anticipated under any of these patents or pending patent applications may be narrower than we expect or  in fact provide no competitive advantages 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our investment portfolio and long term debt obligations 
we maintain a conservative investment policy  which focuses on the safety and preservation of our invested funds by limiting default risk  market risk  and reinvestment risk 
the table below presents principal amounts and related weighted average interest rates by year of maturity for our investment portfolio  long term assets and long term debt obligations at june  and june  
table of contents june  june  there fair after total value total in thousands cash equivalents fixed rate average rate short term investments fixed rate average rate auction rate preferreds variable rate average rate restricted cash fixed rate average rate total investment securities average rate long term debt fixed rate average rate variable rate average rate total long term debt average rate we mitigate default risk by investing in high credit quality securities and by constantly positioning our portfolio to respond appropriately to a significant reduction in a credit rating of any investment issuer or guarantor 
the portfolio includes only marketable securities with active secondary or resale markets to achieve portfolio liquidity and maintain a prudent amount of diversification 
we have no foreign exchange cash flow exposure related to our fixed rate million convertible subordinated notes 
we conduct business on a global basis in several major international currencies 
as such  we are potentially exposed to adverse as well as beneficial movements in foreign currency exchange rates 
for this reason  we enter into foreign currency forward contracts to minimize the impact of exchange rate fluctuations on the value of our japanese yen denominated assets 
the changes in the fair value of these contracts are recorded in other income and expense 
in addition  we periodically hedge anticipated cash flow transactions with foreign currency forward contracts 
we defer the gains and losses on these contracts and recognize them in income during the same period as the hedged transaction is recognized in income 
on june   the notional amount of outstanding japanese yen forward contracts that are designated as cash flow hedges was million 
the unrealized loss on the contracts on june   was million 
a appreciation of the japanese yen would result in an unrealized loss of million  while depreciation in the exchange rate of the japanese yen of approximately would result in an unrealized gain of million 
on june   the notional amount of outstanding japanese yen forward contracts that are designated as balance sheet hedges was million 
the unrealized gain on the contracts on june   was million 
a appreciation of the japanese yen would result in an unrealized loss of million 
depreciation in the exchange rate of the japanese yen of 
table of contents approximately would result in an unrealized gain of million 
during the third quarter of fiscal  we entered into an interest rate swap agreement with a notional amount of million in order to hedge changes in the fair value of the company s notes  attributable to changes in the benchmark interest rate  by swapping fixed interest payments for variable interest rates payments based on libor 
at june   the fair value of the swap  million  was recorded in other long term assets 
an increase in rates by would result in a decline in the fair value of the swap of million 
a decrease in rates by would result in an increase in the fair value of the swap of million
