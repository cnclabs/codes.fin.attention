item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations you should read this discussion in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements  notes and tables included in part ii  item of this form k 
management s discussion and analysis may contain forward looking statements that are provided to assist in the understanding of anticipated future financial performance 
however  this performance involves risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed in the forward looking statements 
some of the important factors that could cause our actual results or outcomes to differ from those discussed are listed under forward looking statements 
results of operations through our subsidiaries  we operate primarily in four reportable segments friction products  precision components  performance automotive and motors 
our results of operations are affected by a variety of factors  including but not limited to  general economic conditions  customer demand for our products  competition  raw material pricing and availability  labor relations with our personnel and political conditions in the countries in which we operate 
we sell a wide range of products that have a corresponding range of gross margins 
our consolidated gross margin is affected by product mix  selling prices  material and labor costs as well as our ability to absorb overhead costs resulting from fluctuations in demand for our products 
in  our income from operations increased to million  or percent  over the prior year 
this increase was attributable primarily to sales volume increases in most of the end markets we serve in our friction and precision component segments with the notable exception of aircraft  improved absorption of fixed costs as a result of the volume increases  cost reduction initiatives and decreased goodwill amortization expense 
partially offsetting these improvements were higher than expected operating costs incurred at our mexican facility 
despite the sales increases we achieved during  we expect that early will continue to be challenging in most of the markets we serve 
based on discussions with our customer base  we expect our revenue growth during the year will be weighted toward the second half of we believe that the aerospace market will decline approximately for the full year compared to  as a result of the continuing softness in that market 
other than aerospace  we expect that our overall sales growth will continue primarily from new product introductions across our segments and sales made from our international facilities 
for the full year of  with a gradually improving economy  we are anticipating our segments to provide revenue growth of approximately percent 
although we anticipate improvement in our motor segment as we continue to take steps to improve manufacturing efficiency  we expect that the margins in this segment will continue to lag significantly behind our other segments 
critical accounting policies hawk s critical accounting policies  including the assumptions and judgments underlying them are more fully described in note b significant accounting policies of the notes to the accompanying consolidated financial statements beginning on page of this form k 
some of our accounting policies require the application of significant judgment by us in the preparation of our financial statements 
in applying these policies  we use our best judgment to determine the underlying assumptions that are used in calculating the estimates that affect the reported values on our financial statements 
we base our estimates and assumptions on historical experience and other factors that we consider relevant 
if these estimates differ materially from actual results  the impact on our consolidated financial statements may be material 
hawk s critical accounting policies include the following revenue recognition 
revenues are recognized when products are shipped and title has transferred to the customer 
allowance for doubtful accounts 
our policy regarding the collectibility of accounts receivables is based on a number of factors 
in circumstances where a specific customer is unable to pay its obligations  we record a specific allowance for bad debts against amounts due to reduce the net recognized receivable 
table of contents to the amount that we reasonably expect to collect 
if circumstances change  estimates of the recoverability of the amounts due us could change 
inventory reserves 
reserves for slow moving and obsolete inventories are developed based on historical experience and product demand 
we continuously evaluate the adequacy of our inventory reserves and make adjustments to the reserves as required 
goodwill 
goodwill represents the excess of the cost of companies we acquired over the fair value of their net assets as of the date of acquisition 
in accordance with statement of financial accounting standard sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets sfas  our policy is to periodically  and in no case less than annually  review our goodwill and other intangible assets based upon the evaluation of such factors as the occurrence of a significant adverse event or change in the environment in which one of our business unit operates would become less than the amount of the asset as reflected in our financial statements 
an impairment loss would be recorded in the period such determination is made based on the fair value of the related assets 
pension and postretirement benefits 
we account for our defined benefit pension plans in accordance with sfas no 
 employers accounting for pensions sfas which requires that amounts recognized in financial statements be determined on an actuarial basis 
the most significant element in determining our pension income expense in accordance with sfas is the expected return on plan assets 
we have assumed that the expected weighted average long term rate of return on plan assets will be percent 
based on our existing and forecasted asset allocation and related long term investment performance results  we believe that our assumption of future returns is reasonable 
the assumed long term rate of return on assets is applied to a calculated value of plan assets  which recognizes changes in the fair value of plan assets in a systematic manner over five years 
this produces the expected return on plan assets that is included in pension income expense 
the difference between this expected return and the actual return on plan assets is deferred 
the net deferral of past asset gains losses affects the calculated value of plan assets and  ultimately  future pension income expense 
we determine the discount rate to be used to discount plan liabilities at their measurement date  december the discount rate reflects the current rate at which the pension liabilities could be effectively settled at the end of the year 
at december   we determined this rate to be percent 
changes in discount rates over the past three years have not materially affected pension income expense  and the net effect of changes in the discount rate  as well as the net effect of other changes in actuarial assumptions and experience  have been deferred as allowed by sfas we expect pension expense to be approximately million in  compared to million in insurance 
we use a combination of insurance and self insurance for a number of risks including property  general liability  directors and officers liability  workers compensation  vehicle liability and employee related health care benefits 
liabilities associated with the risks that are retained are estimated by considering various historical trends and forward looking assumptions 
the estimated accruals for these liabilities could be significantly affected if future occurrences and claims differ from these assumptions and historical trends 
over the past year  the cost and availability of commercial insurance as a result of significant changes in the insurance market have impacted our insurance coverages 
we have renewed all of our insurance policies for  although at additional premium cost  and with increased exposures to losses 
contingencies 
our treatment of contingent liabilities in the financial statements is based on the expected outcome of the applicable contingency 
in the ordinary course of business  we consult with legal counsel on matters related to litigation and other experts both within and outside of the company 
we will accrue a liability if the likelihood of an adverse outcome is probable of occurrence and the amount is estimable 
we will not accrue a liability if either the likelihood of an adverse outcome is only reasonably possible or an estimate is not determinable 

table of contents income taxes 
our effective tax rate  taxes payable and other tax assets and liabilities reflect the current tax rates in the domestic and foreign tax jurisdictions in which we operate 
foreign currency translation and transactions 
assets and liabilities of our foreign operations are translated using year end exchange rates  and revenues and expenses are translated using exchange rates as determined throughout the year 
gains or losses resulting from translation are included in a separate component of our shareholder s equity 
gains or losses resulting from foreign currency transactions are translated to local currency at the rates of exchange prevailing at the dates of the transactions 
accounts receivable or payable in foreign currencies  other than the subsidiary s local currency  are translated at the rates of exchange prevailing at the balance sheet date 
the effect of the transaction s gain or loss is included in other income expense in our statement of operations 
year ended december  compared to year ended december  net sales

friction segment 
net sales in the friction segment  our largest  were million in  an increase of percent compared to as a result of improved operating environments in the united states and europe  we experienced increases in most of our major markets  including construction  agriculture and automotive 
the notable exception was our aerospace market 
as a result of the continuing softness in the commercial aerospace market during  our sales to this market were down percent from the comparable period in this segment also experienced strong sales growth out of our international operations in net sales  exclusive of any translation gains  at our italian facility increased percent compared to  as a result of new product introductions and market share gains 
net sales at our chinese facility were up percent compared to precision component segment 
net sales in the precision components segment were million  an increase of percent compared to the increase in net sales was primarily attributable to gradually improving conditions in the general industrial segments of the domestic economy 
we experienced sales increases in nearly all of the major markets served by this segment  including pump and motor  lawn and garden  truck and appliance 
performance automotive 
net sales in our performance automotive segment were million  a decrease of percent compared to net sales of million in the decrease in revenues was primarily attributable to the softness in the end markets we serve from our clutch manufacturing operation 
net sales at our transmission and driveline systems manufacturing facility benefited from the continued popularity of racing  particularly in the nascar racing series 
motor segment 
net sales in our motor segment were million  an increase of percent from the same period in while a majority of the sales growth came as a result of the production ramp up at our monterrey  mexico facility  the segment benefited from the establishment of a number of new customer relationships serviced from our us and mexican facilities

our friction segment reported gross profit of million or percent of net sales in compared to million or percent of net sales in the flat gross profit margin was primarily the result of product mix  especially in our aerospace market  as older aircraft  which have higher margins for us  were retired or put out of service by the commercial airlines 
we also continued to support our new facility in china during although the facility operated at negative margins for the 
table of contents full year  it achieved break even results for the last half of the decline in gross margin was partially offset by reductions in incentive compensation costs 
precision components segment 
gross profit in our precision components segment was million or percent of net sales in compared to million or percent of net sales in the increase in this segment s margins was primarily the result of the volume increases and our ability to leverage and absorb the fixed charges generated by the segment and reductions in incentive compensations costs 
performance automotive segment 
our performance automotive segment reported gross profit of million or percent of net sales in compared to million or percent of net sales in the decline in gross profit was primarily the result of volume declines at our performance clutch manufacturing facility 
motor segment 
our motor segment reported break even gross profit in this compared to a gross margin loss of million in despite ongoing manufacturing inefficiencies at our facilities  the improvement in our gross margin was primarily the result of the sales volume increases and the resulting absorption of fixed costs at our mexican facility in selling  technical and administrative expenses 
selling  technical and administrative st a expenses increased million  or percent  to million in from million during as a percentage of net sales  st a remained stable at percent in and the increase in st a expenses resulted primarily from continuing start up expenditures incurred at our mexican rotor manufacturing and chinese friction material facilities  increased insurance and personnel costs associated with our long term sales and growth initiatives 
additionally  we incurred legal expenses in our performance automotive segment related to litigation that was resolved in the second quarter of these cost increases were partially offset by reductions in incentive compensation costs 
we spent million  or percent of our net sales on product research and development compared to million in amortization of intangibles 
results for the year ended december  were favorably impacted by the adoption of sfas on january   which eliminated the amortization of goodwill on indefinite life intangible assets 
this accounting change reduced our amortization expense for the year by million compared to income from operations 
income from operations increased million or percent to million in from million in income from operations as a percentage of net sales increased to percent in from percent in the increase was primarily the result of the increased sales volume  improved absorption of fixed costs as a result of the volume increases  cost reduction initiatives and a reduction of amortization expense of million as a result of the adoption of sfas this improvement to income from operations was partially offset by continuing support of our operations in china  higher than anticipated operating costs incurred at our mexican rotor manufacturing facility and continued support of our metal injection molding facility during the year 
during the year ended december   we recognized an expense of million in restructuring charges to adjust our business plan to reflect the economic slowdown 
no such charge was taken in as a result of the items discussed above  results from operations at our segments were as follows our friction segment s income from operations increased million or percent to million in from million in income from operations at our precision components segment was million in  an increase of million  or percent  compared to million in income from operations at our performance automotive segment was million in  an increase of million  compared to million in the loss from operations in our motor segment decreased to million in from million in

in  other expense was primarily comprised of the recognition of the fair value of our then outstanding swap agreement  in addition to foreign currency transaction losses 
interest expense 
interest expense increased million  or percent  to million in from million in the increase is primarily attributable to increased borrowings during the year and an increase in the interest rate on our senior notes 
following our exchange offer in october  the interest rate on our senior notes increased from to 
this increase was partially offset by lower interest rates paid under our new bank facility  which was also entered into in october additionally  we recorded million in interest expense in december  to reflect the issuance of payment in kind pik interest under the terms of the senior notes leverage ratio test for the period ended december  exchange offer costs 
during the year ended december   we incurred third party fees and expenses of million related to the exchange of our senior notes for our then outstanding old senior notes 
income taxes 
we recorded a tax benefit of million  or percent of pre tax loss  in compared to a benefit of million  or percent of pre tax loss in the increase in the effective benefit is primarily the result of the reversal of tax accruals due to the expiration of various statutes of limitations covering periods in which we provided for potential tax liabilities

net sales in the aerospace market showed a decline for the year  most notably in the fourth quarter of  as a result of the events of september precision components segment 
net sales in the precision components segment were million  a decrease of compared to the decrease was primarily attributable to continuing softness in the general industrial segments of the domestic economy 
we experienced sales weakness in nearly all of the markets served by this segment  including heavy truck  lawn and garden  pump and motor  appliance and office equipment 
while net sales in the segment were down as a result of the general softness of economic operating environment  we feel the sales declines were further exacerbated by negative inventory realignments by our customers in the last half of

hawk s primary source of funds for conducting its business activities and servicing its indebtedness has been cash generated from operations and borrowings under our bank credit facility 
in october  we entered into a new senior secured credit facility the bank facility 
the bank facility  which is available for general corporate purposes  has a maximum commitment of million  including a letter of credit facility of up to million  comprised of a million revolving credit component and a million capital expenditure loan component 
the capital expenditure loan component  available to us after december   may be used to finance of the cost of new equipment purchased after october  at the end of each calendar year  beginning with the year ending december   the principal amount of all loans under the capital expenditure facility borrowed during the applicable calendar year will begin to amortize on a seven year  straight line basis

in october  we exchanged million of our million  senior notes due december  old senior notes  for senior notes due december  senior notes 
the senior notes were issued on october  the remaining principal of the old senior notes in the amount of million remain outstanding and will mature on december  in addition  the holders of the old senior notes that participated in the exchange for senior notes received a consent payment of for each  of old senior notes held as of october  the consent payment which totaled million  was issued in the form of additional senior notes and is payable to the holders at maturity of the senior notes 
we incurred million of third party costs in connection with the exchange 
the senior notes are general unsecured senior obligations of hawk and are fully and unconditionally guaranteed  on a joint and several basis  by all of our domestic wholly owned subsidiaries 
the senior notes accrue interest at a rate of per annum on the principal amount commencing october  interest payments are due december and june in addition  in the event that our leverage ratio exceeds to for the most recently ended four quarters beginning with the semi annual period ended december   we will be required to pay additional pik interest at a rate ranging from

the senior notes permit hawk and its subsidiaries to incur additional indebtedness without limitation  provided that we continue to meet a cash flow coverage ratio 
as of december   we did not meet the prescribed ratio 
the failure to meet the ratio does not constitute a default under the senior note indenture 
rather  the senior note indenture continues to permit indebtedness subject to limitations 
our bank facility  which is secured by liens on all of our assets and the assets of our subsidiaries  is permitted 
we do not believe that our operations will be materially impacted by the limitation on indebtedness arising under the senior note indenture 
the senior notes prohibit the payment of cash dividends on the company s class a common stock 
the senior notes also contain other covenants limiting our ability to make certain restricted payments  make certain investments  permit liens  incur dividend and other payment restrictions affecting subsidiaries  enter into consolidation  merger  conveyance  lease or transfer transactions  make asset sales  enter into transactions with affiliates or engage in unrelated lines of business 
these covenants are subject to certain exceptions and qualifications 
the senior notes considers non compliance with the limitations events of default 
in addition to 
table of contents non payment of interest and principal amounts  the senior notes also considers default with respect to other indebtedness in excess of million an event of default 
in the event of a default  the principal and interest could be accelerated upon written notice by or more of the holders of the notes 
net cash used in operating activities was million in compared to cash provided by operating activities of million in cash used in our operations in was primarily attributable to the loss we incurred in  an increase in our receivables  inventories  other working capital assets and the continued operating support of our foreign facilities  partially offset by non cash charges of depreciation and amortization 
cash provided by operations in was primarily attributable to non cash charges of depreciation and amortization partially offset by the loss we experienced in our net working capital  exclusive of the outstanding debt under the bank facility  which is classified as a current liability for accounting purposes  was million at year end compared to million at year end we used cash in investing activities of million in and million in for the purchase of property  plant and equipment 
cash provided by financing activities was million in the increase in was the primarily the result of our additional borrowings to support the increase in working capital assets  the support of our facilities in mexico and china and our purchases of property  plant and equipment during the year 
our net cash used in financing activities was million in primarily for the payment of long term debt 
we believe that cash flow from operating activities and borrowings under our bank facility will be sufficient to satisfy our working capital  capital expenditures and debt requirements and to finance our continued internal growth needs for the next twelve months 
net operating loss carrybacks as of december   we have available to us us net operating loss tax carrybacks which will result in approximately million in federal income tax refunds  which we expect to receive in the first half of forward looking statements statements that are not historical facts  including statements about our confidence in our prospects and strategies and our expectations about growth of existing markets and our ability to expand into new markets  to identify and acquire complementary businesses and to attract new sources of financing  are forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties

effects of recently issued accounting pronouncements in october  the fasb issued sfas no 
accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets sfas 
sfas supersedes sfas no 
accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of  however it retains the fundamental provisions of that statement related to the recognition and measurement of the impairment of long lived assets to be held and used 
in addition  sfas provides more guidance on estimating cash flows when performing a recoverability test  requires that a long lived asset group to be disposed of other than by sale eg abandoned be classified as held and used until it is disposed of  and establishes more restrictive criteria to classify an asset group as held for sale 
sfas was effective for us in the adoption of sfas did not have a material impact on our financial results 
in june  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for exit or disposal activities sfas 
sfas addresses significant issues regarding the recognition  measurement and reporting of costs that are associated with exit and disposal activities  including restructuring activities that are currently accounted for pursuant to the guidance of eitf issue no 
 liability recognition for certain employee termination benefits and other costs to exit an activity including certain costs incurred in a restructuring 
sfas will be effective in the adoption of sfas is not expected to have a material impact on our financial results 
in december  we adopted the disclosure provisions of sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure sfas 
sfas requires prominent disclosure regarding the method used by us to account for stock based employee compensation and the effect of the method used on reported results 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk disclosures 
the following discussion about our market risk disclosures involves forward looking statements 
actual results could differ materially from those projected in the forward looking statements 
we are exposed to market risk related to changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates 
we do not use derivative financial instruments for speculative or trading purposes 
interest rate sensitivity 
at december   approximately percent  or million  of our debt obligations bear interest at a variable rate 
our primary interest rate risk exposure results from floating rate debt 
if interest rates were to increase basis points from december  rates  and assuming no changes in debt from december  levels  our additional annual interest expense would be approximately 
table of contents million 
in october  we terminated a million notional amount interest rate swap 
the cancellation did not have a material impact on earnings 
the interest rates on our long term debt reflect market rates and therefore  the carrying value of long term debt approximates fair value 
the following table presents our total contractual obligations and other commercial commitments as of december  in millions total thereafter contractual cash obligations bank facility senior notes capital lease and other obligations operating leases total contractual cash obligations other commercial commitments stand by letters of credit foreign currency exchange risk 
the majority of our receipts and expenditures are contracted in us dollars  and we do not consider the market risk exposure relating to currency exchange to be material at this time 
we currently do not hedge our foreign currency exposure and  therefore  have not entered into any forward foreign exchange contracts to hedge foreign currency transactions 
we have operations outside the united states with foreign currency denominated assets and liabilities  primarily denominated in euro  canadian dollars  mexican pesos and chinese renminbi 
because we have foreign currency denominated assets and liabilities  financial exposure may result  primarily from the timing of transactions and the movement of exchange rates 
we do not expect that our unhedged foreign currency balance sheet exposure as of december  will result in a significant impact on our earnings or cash flows
