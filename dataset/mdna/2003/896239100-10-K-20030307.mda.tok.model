item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and the related notes 
the following discussion contains forward looking statements that reflect our plans  estimates and beliefs 
our actual results could differ materially from those discussed in the forward looking statements 
factors that could cause or contribute to these differences include  but are not limited to  those discussed below and those listed under risks and uncertainties 
critical accounting policies and estimates our critical accounting estimates and the related assumptions are evaluated periodically as conditions warrant  and changes to such estimates are recorded as new information or changed conditions require revision 
application of the critical accounting policies requires management s judgments  often as the result of the need to make estimates of matters that are inherently uncertain 
if actual results were to differ materially from the estimates made  the reported results could be materially affected 
for a summary of all of our significant accounting policies  including critical accounting policies discussed below  see note summary of significant accounting policies of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition our revenues are recorded in accordance with the securities and exchange commission s sec staff accounting bulletin sab no 
 revenue recognition 
prior to recognizing revenue  we require the following i execution of a written customer order  ii delivery of the product  iii a fixed or determinable fee  and iv probable collectibility of the proceeds 
we recognize revenue from product sales when the products are shipped to the customer  title has transferred  and no significant obligations remain 
we defer revenue if there is uncertainty about customer acceptance 
we reduce product revenue for estimated customer returns and for any discounts that may occur under programs we have with our customers and partners 
our shipment terms are either fob shipping point or fca shipping point 
fob free on board shipping point term means that the seller fulfills the obligation to deliver when the goods have passed over the ship s rail at the named port of shipment 
this means that the buyer has to bear all costs and risks of loss of or damage to the goods from that point 
the fob term requires the seller to clear the goods for export 
fca free carrier shipping point term means that the seller fulfills the obligation to deliver when the goods are handed over  cleared for export  and into the charge of the carrier named by the buyer at the named place or point 
if no precise point is indicated by the buyer  the seller may choose within the place or range stipulated where the carrier shall take the goods into carrier s charge 
our shipment terms for domestic orders are typically fob shipping point 
international orders fulfilled from our european distribution center are typically shipped fca shipping point 
other international orders are shipped fob destination  and accordingly these international orders are not recognized as revenue until the product is delivered and title has transferred 
revenues from purchased extended warranty and support agreements are deferred and recognized ratably over the term of the warranty support period 
substantially all technology licenses and research revenue have consisted of initial license fees and royalties  which were recognized when earned  provided we had no remaining obligations 
sales to distributors and resellers are recognized upon shipment providing that there is evidence of such an arrangement through a distribution agreement or purchase order  title has transferred  no remaining performance obligations exist  the price and terms of the sale are fixed  and collection is probable 
distributors and resellers do not have a right of return 
our software arrangements consist of a license fee and post contract customer support pcs 
we have established vendor specific objective evidence vsoe of fair value for our pcs contracts based on the price of the renewal rate 
the remaining value of the software arrangement is allocated to the license fee using the residual method  which revenue is primarily recognized when the software has been delivered and there are no remaining obligations 
revenue from pcs is recognized ratably over the period of the pcs agreement 
allowance for doubtful accounts we evaluate the collectibility of our trade accounts receivable based on a number of factors 
in circumstances where we are aware of a specific customer s inability to meet its financial obligations to us  a specific allowance for bad debts is estimated and recorded which reduces the recognized receivable to the estimated amount we believe will ultimately be collected 
in addition to specific customer identification of potential bad debts  bad debt charges are recorded based on our recent past loss history and an overall assessment of past due trade accounts receivable amounts outstanding 
inventory valuation our inventory is recorded at the lower of cost or market 
we use a standard cost accounting system to value inventory and these standards are reviewed a minimum of once a year and multiple times a year in our most active manufacturing plants 
we adjust the inventory value for estimated excess and obsolete inventory based on management s assessment of future demand and market conditions 
if actual future demand or market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management  additional inventory write downs may be required 
deferred taxes deferred taxes are provided on a liability method whereby deferred tax assets are recognized for deductible temporary differences and deferred liabilities are recognized for taxable temporary differences 
temporary differences are the differences between the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and their tax bases 
deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance when it is determined to be more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
in evaluating the need for a valuation allowance  we consider future taxable income  resolution of tax uncertainties and prudent and feasible tax planning strategies 
if we determine that we would not be able to realize all or part of our deferred tax assets in the future  an adjustment to the carrying value of the deferred tax assets would be charged to income in the period in which such determination was made 
goodwill and other purchased intangible assets we have significant intangible assets on our balance sheet that include goodwill and other purchased intangibles related to acquisitions 
at the beginning of fiscal  we adopted statement of financial accounting standards no 
sfas  business combinations  and no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets sfas 
application of the non amortization provisions of sfas significantly reduced amortization expense of purchased intangibles and goodwill to approximately million for the fiscal year from million in the prior year 
we reclassified identifiable intangible assets with indefinite lives and net book value of million  as defined by sfas  to goodwill at the date of adoption 
for comparative purposes  the pro forma adjusted net income per share excluding amortization of goodwill  distribution channel  and assembled workforce is as follows january  december  december  in thousands net income loss    add back sfas adjustments amortization of goodwill   amortization of distribution channel   amortization of assembled workforce   adjusted net income loss    weighted average shares outstanding basic    diluted    diluted net income loss per share pro forma adjusted diluted net income loss per share in assessing the recoverability of goodwill and indefinite life intangible assets  we must make assumptions about the estimated future cash flows and other factors to determine the fair value of these assets 
assumptions about future revenue and cash flows require significant judgment because of the current state of the economy  the fluctuation of actual revenue  and the timing of expenses 
for goodwill  the annual impairment evaluation includes a comparison of the carrying value of the reporting unit including goodwill to that reporting unit s fair value 
if the reporting unit s estimated fair value exceeds the reporting unit s carrying value  no impairment of goodwill exists 
if the fair value of the reporting unit does not exceed the unit s carrying value  then an additional analysis is performed to allocate the fair value of the reporting unit to all of the assets and liabilities of that unit as if that unit had been acquired in a business combination and the fair value of the unit was the purchase price 
if the excess of the fair value of the reporting unit over the fair value of the identifiable assets and liabilities is less than the carrying value of the unit s goodwill  an impairment charge is recorded for the difference 
similarly  the impairment evaluation for indefinite life intangible assets includes a comparison of the asset s carrying value to the asset s fair value 
when the carrying value exceeds fair value an impairment charge is recorded for the amount of the difference 
an intangible asset is determined to have an indefinite useful life when there are no legal  regulatory  contractual  competitive  economic or any other factors that may limit the period over which the asset is expected to contribute directly or indirectly to the future cash flows of our company 
in each reporting period  we also evaluate the remaining useful life of an intangible asset that is not being amortized to determine whether events and circumstances continue to support an indefinite useful life 
if an intangible asset that is not being amortized is determined to have a finite useful life  the asset will be amortized prospectively over the estimated remaining useful life and accounted for in the same manner as intangible assets subject to amortization 
we tested goodwill for impairment using the process prescribed in sfas no 
the first step is a screen for potential impairment  while the second step measures the amount of the impairment  if any 
no impairment charge resulted from the impairment tests 
for comparative purposes that depict the effect of adopting sfas no 
and above  we have included the pro forma adjusted net income per share excluding amortization of goodwill  distribution channel  and assembled workforce 
accounting for the long lived assets including intangibles subject to amortization we adopted statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  at the beginning of fiscal the effect of adopting sfas did not have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations 
depreciation and amortization of our long lived assets is provided using accelerated and straight line methods over their estimated useful lives 
changes in circumstances such as the passage of new laws or changes in regulations  technological advances  changes to our business model  or changes in the capital strategy could result in the actual useful lives differing from initial estimates 
in those cases where we determine that the useful life of a long lived asset should be revised  we will depreciate the net book value in excess of the estimated residual value over its revised remaining useful life 
factors such as changes in the planned use of equipment  customer attrition  contractual amendments  or mandated regulatory requirements could result in shortened useful lives 
long lived assets and asset groups are evaluated for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable 
the estimated future cash flows are based upon  among other things  assumptions about expected future operating performance and may differ from actual cash flows 
long lived assets evaluated for impairment are grouped with other assets to the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows of other groups of assets and liabilities 
if the sum of the projected undiscounted cash flows excluding interest is less than the carrying value of the assets  the assets will be written down to the estimated fair value in the period in which the determination is made 
warranties we provide for the estimated cost of product warranties at the time revenue is recognized 
while we engage in extensive product quality programs and processes  including actively monitoring and evaluating the quality of our component suppliers  our warranty obligation is affected by product failure rates  material usage  and service delivery costs incurred in correcting a product failure 
should actual product failure rates  material usage  or service delivery costs differ from our estimates  revisions to the estimated warranty accrual and related costs may be required 
stock compensation as permitted by the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure  and statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  we apply accounting principles board opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees apb and related interpretations in accounting for our stock option plans and stock purchase plan 
accordingly  we do not recognize compensation cost for stock options granted at a price equal to fair market value 
note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements describes the plans we operate  and note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements contains a summary of the pro forma effects to reported net income loss and earnings loss per share for fiscal   and as if we had elected to recognize compensation cost based on the fair value of the options granted at grant date  as prescribed by sfas no 
investment in the caterpillar trimble control technologies llc ctct or joint venture we have adopted the equity method of accounting for our investment in the joint venture 
this requires that we record our share of the joint venture profits or losses in a given fiscal period 
during fiscal year  the joint venture reported a loss of million of which our share is million  which was recorded as a non operating expense under the heading of expense for affiliated operations  net  but which was offset by the amortization of an equal amount of the original deferred gain on the sale of technology to the joint venture 
we have elected to treat the cash distribution of million as a deferred gain  being amortized to the extent that losses are attributable from the joint venture under the equity method described above 
when and if the joint venture is profitable on a sustainable basis and future operating losses are not anticipated  then we will recognize as a gain  the portion of the million  which is un amortized 
to the extent that it is possible that we will have any future funding obligation relating to the joint venture  then the relevant amount of the million will be deferred until such time  the funding obligation no longer exists 
both our share of profits losses under the equity method and the amortization of our million deferred gain are recorded under the heading of expense for affiliated operations  net in non operating income expense 
for further information  see recent business developments caterpillar joint venture section of item in this report 
recent business developments caterpillar joint venture on april   caterpillar trimble control technologies llc  a joint venture formed by trimble and caterpillar  began operations 
the joint venture  percent owned by trimble and percent owned by caterpillar  with equal voting rights  is developing and marketing next generation advanced electronic guidance and control products for earthmoving machines in the construction  mining  and waste industries 
the joint venture is based in dayton  ohio 
under the terms of the joint venture agreement  caterpillar contributed million cash plus selected technology  for a total contributed value of million  and we contributed selected existing machine control product technologies valued at million 
additionally  both companies have licensed patents and other intellectual property from their portfolios to the joint venture 
during the first fiscal quarter of  we received a special cash distribution of million from the joint venture 
during fiscal year  we recorded approximately million of expenses under the heading of expense for affiliated operations  net in non operating income expense related to certain transactions between the joint venture and us 
this was comprised of approximately million of incremental costs incurred by us as a result of purchasing products from the joint venture at a higher transfer price than our original manufacturing costs  offset by approximately million of contract manufacturing fees charged to the joint venture by us 
due to the nature of the transfer price agreements between trimble and the joint venture  a related party  the impact of these agreements is classified under non operating income expense 
in addition  during fiscal year  we recorded lower operating expenses of approximately million due to the transfer of employee related expenses for research and development million  and sales  marketing and administrative functions million to the joint venture 
these employees are devoted to the joint venture and are primarily engaged in developing next generation products and technology for that entity 
acquisition of levelite technology  inc on august   we acquired levelite technology  inc levelite  a california corporation  for approximately million 
this strategic acquisition complements our entry level construction instrument product line 
the purchase price consisted of  shares of our common stock 
the merger agreement provides for trimble to make additional earn out payments not to exceed million in common stock and cash payment based on future revenues derived from existing product sales to a certain customer 
on january   we issued the first earn out payment stock and cash combination with a fair market value of approximately million  related to the earn out for the quarter ended january  also  if we receive any proceeds from a pending litigation  a portion will be paid to the former shareholders of levelite 
the additional payments  if earned  will result in additional goodwill

a summary of financial data by business segment is as follows 
the following table shows revenue and operating income by segment for the periods indicated and should be read in conjunction with the narrative descriptions below 
operating income by segment excludes unallocated corporate expenses  which are comprised primarily of general and administrative costs  amortization of goodwill and other purchased intangibles  as well as other items not controlled by the business segment 
in the first fiscal quarter of fiscal  we realigned two of our reportable segments and therefore the following table shows restated revenue and operating income by segment to reflect this realignment 
the agriculture segment was combined with the mapping and gis business to form field solutions 
mapping and gis were previously part of fleet and asset management 
the mobile positioning business that was part of fleet and asset management is now mobile solutions 
we began breaking out mobile solutions as a separate reporting segment during the first quarter of to address the growing importance of the mobile asset management business and its impact on our profitability 
at the same time  we combined our gis and agriculture businesses to create a new segment called field solutions in order to recognize the synergies and similar product requirements between the two businesses

therefore  the financial results of fiscal year  having the extra week  will not be exactly comparable to the prior and subsequent week fiscal years 
thus  due to the inherent nature of adopting a week fiscal year  trimble  analysts  shareholders  investors and others will have to make appropriate adjustments to any analysis performed when comparing our activities and results in fiscal years that contain weeks  to those that contain the standard weeks 
fiscal years and were both comprised of weeks 
revenue in fiscal  total revenue decreased by million or to million from million in fiscal the decrease in fiscal was primarily due to the reduction of revenue in mobile solutions and portfolio technologies 
total revenue in fiscal increased by million or to million from million in fiscal  primarily due to the full year revenue effect of the spectra precision group  acquired in july engineering and construction revenue engineering and construction revenues increased by million or during fiscal as compared to fiscal due to the following o revenues increased due to the levelite acquisition by million  o strong performance by our machine control product offering as we continue to penetrate the after market for machine guidance on earthmoving equipment  o increased revenues were partially offset by a reduction in revenues in several other product areas due to continued difficult global economic conditions 
engineering and construction revenues increased by million or in fiscal over fiscal due to the following o in fiscal  we recorded a full year of revenues generated from the spectra precision group compared to approximately half year results in fiscal  which accounted for approximately million  o strong demand for our land survey product line primarily due to the introduction of the trimble toolbox tm in the first fiscal quarter of o higher demand for gps machine guidance equipment 
operating income engineering and construction operating income increased by million or in fiscal over fiscal due to the following o a reduction of million of operating expenses  due to the transfer of employee related expenses to caterpillar trimble control technologies  o higher revenues and lower operating expenses were partially offset by a reduction in gross margin as a result of product sales mix during fiscal engineering and construction operating income increased by million or in fiscal over fiscal due to the following o fiscal included a full year of revenue from the spectra precision group acquisition and the benefits of the consolidation of product lines in the engineering and construction business areas  o the worldwide cost reduction program  implemented as part of trimble and the spectra precision group integration  also favorably impacted operating income 
field solutions revenue field solutions experienced a revenue decline in fiscal of million or compared with fiscal due to the following o overall revenue decreased during the year due to the decline in the united states federal  state  and local government spending and a delay in the release of the new geoexplorer r ce series due to component supply issues  o this decrease was partially offset by the increased demand for both the manual and auto guidance product lines 
field solutions revenue decreased by million or in fiscal over fiscal due to the following o small decrease in gis revenues due to lower demand in the second half of fiscal  o significant decrease in price points in the agriculture market on flat demand 
operating income field solutions operating income decreased by million or in fiscal over fiscal due to the following o lower revenues primarily from the decrease in government spending described above  o lower gross margin due to product sales mix  which was more weighted toward the relatively lower margin agricultural business area 
field solutions operating income decreased by million or in fiscal over fiscal due to the following o a product mix shift toward lower priced products with a general reduction in prices  o overall weak demand in the agricultural market in fiscal  o the startup development  selling  and support costs associated with the ramp up of the autopilot product line 
mobile solutions revenue mobile solutions revenues decreased by million or in fiscal over fiscal due to the following o revenue reduction of approximately million in our satellite communications business as a result of our decision to discontinue the galaxy tm inmarsat c product line in early  o slow down in system integration projects due to reduced spending at municipalities  o reduced sales of wireless products of million due to a transition from a sensor provider to a fully integrated service provider  o sales of some product lines were down as a result of the economic slow down and the shift of technology from analog to digital 
mobile solutions revenues decreased by million or in fiscal over fiscal due to the following o a reduction of approximately million in our galaxyt inmarsat c line due to the announcement of our intention to discontinue certain of these product lines in early  mexico s satellite communications systems capacity limitations  and the general economic slow down  o sales of the crosscheck and placer tm receiver product lines were down by approximately million as a result of the economic slow down 
operating loss mobile solutions operating loss increased by million or in fiscal over fiscal due to the following o lower revenues as described above  o increased costs incurred in the development and marketing of a service platform to enable a range of asset management solutions 
mobile solutions operating loss increased by million in fiscal over fiscal due to the following o lower revenues as described above  o decrease in margins due to the sell off of existing satcom inventory at reduced prices  o significant costs incurred in the development of a service platform to enable a range of asset management solutions including an internet delivered  cellular based solution for vehicle fleet management 
component technologies revenue component technologies revenues increased by million or in fiscal over fiscal due to the following o timing revenue increased million in fiscal over fiscal due to significant demand during the second half of fiscal from new and existing wireless infrastructure customers  o in vehicle navigation revenue decreased million in fiscal over fiscal as average selling prices declined by more than  o license revenue decreased million in fiscal over fiscal due to an expired license contract

portfolio technologies revenue portfolio technologies revenues decreased by million or in fiscal over fiscal due to the following o reduction of million due to the sale of our air transport product line to honeywell in fiscal  o revenues from the military business declined by million 
portfolio technologies revenues increased by million or in fiscal over fiscal due to the following o in fiscal  trimble experienced a full year of revenues generated from the purchase of tripod data systems as compared to one and one half months in fiscal  which accounted for an increase of approximately million  o the above increase was partially offset by a million reduction in our commercial aviation product line during fiscal the sale of the air transport product line to honeywell was completed in march operating income portfolio technologies operating income increased by million or in fiscal over fiscal due to the following o increased operating performance from tripod data systems business 
portfolio technologies operating income increased by million or in fiscal over fiscal primarily due to the following o an incremental increase resulting from a full years operating results of tripod data systems acquired on november  international revenues sales to unaffiliated customers outside the united states comprised approximately in  in  and in during the fiscal year  north and south america represented  europe  the middle east and africa represented  and asia represented 
in fiscal  the united states comprised approximately and germany of sales to unaffiliated customers 
we anticipate that sales to international customers will continue to account for a significant portion of our revenue 
for this reason  we are subject to the risks inherent in these foreign sales  including unexpected changes in regulatory requirements  exchange rates  governmental approval  tariffs  or other barriers 
even though the us government announced on march   that it supports and maintains the gps system  and on may   stated that it has no intent to ever again use selective availability sa  a method of degrading gps accuracy  there may be reluctance in certain foreign markets to purchase such products given the control of gps by the us government 
our results of operations could be adversely affected if we were unable to continue to generate significant sales in locations outside the us no single customer accounted for or more of our total revenues in fiscal   and it is possible  however  that in future periods the failure of one or more large customers to purchase products in quantities anticipated by us may adversely affect the results of operations 
gross margin gross margin varies due to a number of factors including product mix  international sales mix  customer type  the effects of production volumes and fixed manufacturing costs on unit product costs  and new product start up costs 
gross margin as a percentage of total revenues was in fiscal and in fiscal the slight increase in gross margin percentage for fiscal  compared with fiscal  was due partially to approximately million of additional charges associated with the write down of excess and obsolete inventory in fiscal  related to the rationalization and simplification of product lines  and partially due to inventories in excess of our forecasted month demand 
because of potential product mix changes within and among the industry markets  market pressures on unit selling prices  fluctuations in unit manufacturing costs  including increases in component prices and other factors  current level gross margins cannot be assured 
in addition  should the global economic conditions deteriorate further  gross margin could be further adversely impacted

research and development spending increased by million during fiscal  and represented of revenue  consistent with in fiscal due primarily to the following o in fiscal  we experienced a full year of operations of the spectra precision group compared with half a year in fiscal  which accounted for approximately million of the increase  o the increase was also due to approximately million related to a full year of operations of tripod data systems in fiscal compared with one and one half months for fiscal  as well as the inclusion of grid data for approximately nine months in fiscal we believe that the development and introduction of new products are critical to the company s future success and expects to continue its active development of new products 
sales and marketing sales and marketing expense decreased by million in fiscal and represents of revenue  compared with in fiscal due primarily to the following o during fiscal  we sold off many of our direct sales offices  which decreased sales and marketing expenses by approximately million for fiscal  o a decrease in overall compensation  travel  advertising  promotional  and trade show expenses of approximately million for fiscal compared to the corresponding period in fiscal sales and marketing expense increased by million in fiscal and represents of revenue  consistent with in fiscal primarily due to the following o inclusion of a full year of operations of the spectra precision group as compared with half a year in fiscal  which accounted for approximately million of the increase 
our future growth will depend in part on the timely development and continued viability of the markets in which we currently compete as well as our ability to continue to identify and exploit new markets for our products 
general and administrative general and administrative expense increased by million in fiscal representing of revenue  compared with in fiscal primarily due to the following o increase in bad debt provisions related to customers in an uncertain economic environment  o bad debt expenses for accounts written off during the year due to customer defaults

on january  as a result  goodwill is no longer amortized and intangible assets with indefinite lives with net book value of million were reclassified to goodwill 
amortization expense of goodwill  purchased and other intangibles decreased in fiscal by approximately million representing of revenue  compared with in fiscal the decrease was primarily due to the adoption of fas that does not require the amortization of goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives 
amortization expense of goodwill and other purchased intangibles increased in fiscal by approximately million representing of revenue  compared with in fiscal the increase was primarily due to the acquisition of the spectra precision group in july  which resulted in a year over year increase of approximately million in goodwill and intangibles amortization

non operating expense  net increased by million during fiscal as compared with fiscal the primary reasons for the increase were as follows o increase in interest expenses related to loans and credit facilities incurred primarily to finance the acquisition of the spectra precision group accounted for approximately million  o decreased interest income resulting from the sale and maturities of short term investments used to finance the acquisition of the spectra precision group accounted for approximately million 
income tax provision our effective income tax rates from continuing operations for fiscal years   and were  and  respectively 
the fiscal and income tax rates differ from the federal statutory rate of  due primarily to foreign taxes and the inability to realize the benefit of net operating losses 
the fiscal income tax rate is less than the federal statutory rate due primarily to the realization of the benefits from prior net operating losses and previously reserved deferred tax assets 
litigation matters in november  qualcomm inc filed a lawsuit against trimble in the superior court of the state of california 
the complaint alleges claims for an unspecified amount of money damages arising out of qualcomm s perceived lack of assurances in early that our products purchased by qualcomm would work properly after a scheduled week number rollover event that took place in august of qualcomm is the only customer to make a claim against us based on the week number rollover event 
in our opinion  the resolution of this lawsuit is not expected to have a material adverse effect on our overall financial position 
we are also a party to other disputes incidental to our business 
we believe that our ultimate liability as a result of such disputes  if any  would not be material to our overall financial position  results of operations  or liquidity

we also used approximately million for capital expenditures 
at january   our debt mainly consisted of million outstanding under senior secured credit facilities  and million outstanding under the subordinated promissory note related to the acquisition of the spectra precision group 
we have relied primarily on cash provided by operating activities to fund capital expenditures and other investing activities 
on march   we used million of net proceeds from our private placement to retire accrued interest and principal under our subordinated note with spectra physics holdings  inc  a subsidiary of thermo electron corporation  reducing the outstanding principal amount to million 
in addition  we renegotiated the terms of the subordinated note 
under the revised agreement  the maturity of the note was extended until july   at the current interest rate of approximately per year 
in connection with the amendment  on march  we agreed to issue to thermo electron a five year warrant to purchase  shares of our common stock at an exercise price of 
under the five year warrant  the total number of warrants issued will not exceed  shares 
on a quarterly basis beginning july   spectra physics warrant became exercisable for an additional shares of common stock for every million of principal and interest outstanding until the note is paid off in full 
these shares are purchasable at a price equal to the average of our stock s closing price for the five days immediately preceding the last trading day of each quarter

these additional shares are exercisable over a year period 
the approximate fair value of the warrants of million was determined using the black scholes pricing model with the following assumptions contractual life of year period  risk free interest rate of  volatility of  and no dividends during the contractual term 
the value of the warrants is amortized to interest expense over the term of the subordinated note 
in fiscal  cash provided by operating activities was million  as compared to million in fiscal the increase of million was primarily due to a one time special cash distribution of million from caterpillar trimble control technologies upon its formation in the first quarter of fiscal trimble s ability to continue to generate cash from operations will depend in large part on revenues  the rate of collections of accounts receivable  and profitability 
both the inventory turns and accounts receivable days sales outstanding metrics were similar at the end of fiscal to the fiscal level 
cash flows used in investing activities were million in fiscal as compared to million in fiscal  mostly due to investment activities associated with the acquisition of an additional percent equity interest in terrasat  a german corporation  and the acquisition in property and equipment partially offset by cash acquired through levelite acquisition 
cash used in investing activities in fiscal included amounts paid for the grid data acquisition 
cash used in financing activities was million in fiscal  as compared to million in fiscal during fiscal  we made million of payments against our debt outstanding 
these payments were offset by proceeds from the issuance of common stock to employees pursuant to our stock option plan and employee stock purchase plan of million  as well as issuance of common stock under a private equity placement of million 
in july  we obtained million of senior  secured credit facilities the credit facilities from a syndicate of banks to support our acquisition of the spectra precision group  the company s ongoing working capital requirements  and to refinance certain existing debt see note of the notes to the to the consolidated financial statements 
the credit facilities consisted of million available as a term loan and million available under two revolvers 
on january   trimble executed an amended and restated credit agreement  which restructured the million revolver into four tranches 
tranches a and c belong to the million us dollar revolver and tranches b and d belong to the million multi currency revolver 
allocated to tranche a is  with an expiration date of july  and allocated to tranche c is  with an expiration date of april  allocated to tranche b is  with an expiration date of july  and allocated to tranche d is  with an expiration date of april  as a result  the million revolver will remain in effect through july  and be reduced to million for the period starting july  through april  as of january   outstanding balance under the revolver was million and under the term loan was million 
the credit facilities are secured by all material assets of our company  except for assets that are subject to foreign tax considerations 
financial covenants of the credit facilities include leverage  fixed charge  and minimum net worth tests and all were amended during the third quarter of fiscal at january   and as of the date of this report  we are in compliance with debt covenants 
the amounts due under the revolver loans are paid as the loans mature  and the loan commitment fees are paid on a quarterly basis 
under the five year term loan portion of the credit facility  we are due to make payments excluding interest of approximately million in fiscal and the remaining million in fiscal we believe that our cash and cash equivalents  together with our credit facilities  will be sufficient to meet our anticipated operating cash needs for at least the next twelve months 
at january   we had million of cash and cash equivalents  as well as access to million of cash under the terms of our revolver loans 
under the terms of the credit facilities  we are currently restricted from paying dividends and are limited as to the amount of our common stock that we can repurchase 
we are allowed to pay dividends and repurchase shares of our common stock up to of net income in the previous fiscal year 
we have obligations under non cancelable operating leases for our office facilities see note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
in fiscal  the payments under these non cancelable operating leases are expected to be approximately million 
we expect fiscal capital expenditures to be approximately million to million  primarily for computer equipment  software  and leasehold improvements associated with business expansion 
decisions related to how much cash is used for investing are influenced by the expected amount of cash to be provided by operations 
the following table summarizes our future repayment obligations excluding interest and january  total beyond in thousands credit facilities five year term loan    us and multi currency revolving credit facility    subordinated note   promissory note and other   total contractual cash obligations     our future minimum payments required under non cancelable operating leases are follows operating lease payments in thousands thereafter  total  new accounting standards we adopted statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 business combinations  and sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  at the beginning of fiscal application of the non amortization provisions of sfas no 
significantly reduced amortization expense of purchased intangibles and goodwill to approximately million for the fiscal year from million in the prior year 
we reclassified identifiable intangible assets with indefinite lives with net book value of million  as defined by sfas no 
 to goodwill at the date of adoption 
we tested goodwill for impairment using the two step process prescribed in sfas no 
the first step is a screen for potential impairment  while the second step measures the amount of the impairment  if any 
no impairment charge resulted from the impairment tests 
in october of  the fasb issued sfas no  accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  which amends accounting guidance on asset impairment and provides a single accounting model for long lived assets to be disposed of 
among other provisions  the new rules change the criteria for classifying an asset as held for sale 
the standard also broadens the scope of businesses to be disposed of that qualify for reporting as discontinued operations  and changes the timing of recognizing losses on such operations 
we adopted sfas no 
at the beginning of fiscal the effect of adopting sfas no 
did not have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations 
in july of  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities 
sfas no 
addresses the financial accounting and reporting for obligations associated with an exit activity  including restructuring  or with a disposal of long lived assets 
exit activities include  but are not limited to  eliminating or reducing product lines  terminating employees and contracts  and relocating plant facilities or personnel 
sfas no 
specifies that a company will record a liability for a cost associated with an exit or disposal activity only when that liability is incurred and can be measured at fair value 
therefore  commitment to an exit plan or a plan of disposal expresses only our intended future actions and  therefore  does not meet the requirement for recognizing a liability and the related expense 
sfas no 
is effective prospectively for exit or disposal activities initiated after december   with earlier adoption encouraged 
we do not anticipate that the adoption of sfas no 
will have a material effect on our financial position or results of operations 
in november of  the fasb issued fasb interpretation fin no 
 guarantor s accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees  including indirect guarantees of indebtedness of others 
fin no 
requires that a liability be recorded in the guarantor s balance sheet upon issuance of a guarantee 
in addition  fin no 
requires disclosures about the guarantees that an entity has issued  including a roll forward of the entity s product warranty liabilities 
we will apply the recognition provisions of fin no 
prospectively to guarantees issued after december  while we engage in extensive product quality programs and processes including actively monitoring and evaluating the quality of component suppliers  our warranty obligation is affected by product failure rates  material usage  and service delivery costs incurred in correcting a product failure 
should actual product failure rates  material usage  or service delivery costs differ from the estimates  revisions to the estimated warranty accrual and related costs may be required 
changes in our product warranty liability during the months  ended january  are as follows in thousands balance at december   warranties accrued  warranty claims  balance at january   our product warranty liability is classified as accrued warranty in the accompanying balance sheet 
in november of  the eitf reached a consensus on issue no 
 revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables 
eitf issue no 
provides guidance on how to account for arrangements that involve the delivery or performance of multiple products  services  and or rights to use assets 
the provisions of eitf issue no 
will apply to revenue arrangements entered into in fiscal periods beginning after june  we are currently evaluating the effect that the adoption of eitf issue no 
will have on our results of operations and financial condition 
in december of  fasb issued fasb no 
 accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure 
sfas no 
amends fasb no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  to provide alternative methods of transition for an entity that changes to the fair value method of accounting for stock based employee compensation 
in addition  sfas no 
amends the disclosure provisions of sfas no 
to require expanded and more prominent disclosure of the effects of an entity s accounting policy with respect to stock based employee compensation 
this disclosure is required in the summary of significant accounting policies footnote or its equivalent in annual and interim financial statements 
sfas no 
does not amend sfas no 
to require companies to account for their stock based employee awards using the fair value method 
as discussed in note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements  for purposes of pro forma disclosures  we amortized the estimated fair value of the options to expense over the options vesting period  and the estimated fair value of purchases under the employee stock purchase plan is expensed in the year of purchase as well as the stock based employee compensation cost  net of related tax effects  that would have been included in the determination of net income if the fair value based method had been applied to all awards 
the effects on pro forma disclosure of applying sfas no 
are not likely to be representative of the effects on pro forma disclosure of future years 
in january of  the fasb issued fin no 
 consolidation of variable interest entities 
fin no 
requires a variable interest entity to be consolidated by a company if that company is subject to a majority of the risk of loss from the variable interest entity s activities or entitled to receive a majority of the entity s residual returns or both 
the consolidation requirements of fin no 
apply immediately to variable interest entities created after january  the consolidation requirements apply to older entities in the first fiscal year or interim period beginning after june  we are currently evaluating the provisions of fin no 
 however  we do not believe as of january   the company has any investments in variable interest entities 
risks and uncertainties our inability to accurately predict orders and shipments may affect our revenue  expenses and earnings per share 
we have not been able in the past to consistently predict when our customers will place orders and request shipments  so that we cannot always accurately plan our manufacturing requirements 
as a result  if orders and shipments differ from what we predict  we may incur additional expenses and build excess inventory  which may require additional accruals 
any significant change in our customers purchasing patterns could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and reported earnings per share for a particular quarter 
our operating results in each quarter may be affected by special conditions  such as seasonality  late quarter purchases  and other potential issues 
due  in part  to the buying patterns of our customers  a significant portion of our quarterly revenues occurs from orders received and immediately shipped to customers in the last few weeks and days of each quarter  although our operating expenses tend to remain fairly predictable 
engineering and construction purchases tend to occur in early spring  and governmental agencies tend to utilize funds available at the end of the government s fiscal year for additional purchases at the end of our third fiscal quarter in september of each year 
concentrations of orders sometimes also occur at the end of our other two fiscal quarters 
additionally  a majority of our sales force earns commissions on a quarterly basis  which may cause concentrations of orders at the end of any fiscal quarter 
if for any reason expected sales are deferred  orders are not received  or shipments are delayed a few days at the end of a quarter  our operating results and reported earnings per share for that quarter could be significantly impacted 
we are dependent on a sole manufacturer and assembler for many of our products and on sole suppliers of critical parts for our products 
since august  we have been substantially dependent upon solectron corporation as the exclusive manufacturing partner for many of our gps products previously manufactured out of our sunnyvale facilities 
under the agreement with solectron  we provide to solectron a twelve month product forecast and place purchase orders with solectron sixty calendar days in advance of the scheduled delivery of products to our customers 
although purchase orders placed with solectron are cancelable  the terms of the agreement would require us to purchase from solectron all material inventory not returnable or usable by other solectron customers 
accordingly  if we inaccurately forecast demand for our products  we may be unable to obtain adequate manufacturing capacity from solectron to meet customers delivery requirements or we may accumulate excess inventories  if such inventories are not usable by other solectron customers 
our current contract with solectron expires in august of during the fourth quarter of  solectron began assembling some of our component technology products in china 
although we believe that this initiative in china will bring significant cost savings  we cannot predict potential effects that may result from this program 
in addition  we rely on sole suppliers for a number of our critical components 
we have experienced shortages of components in the past 
as an example  we were affected by the inability of a display supplier to provide adequate quantities to meet our requirements in the third fiscal calendar quarter of that resulted in the deferral of million in orders into the fourth quarter of our current reliance on sole or a limited group of suppliers involves several risks  including a potential inability to obtain an adequate supply of required components and reduced control over pricing 
any inability to obtain adequate deliveries or any other circumstance that would require us to seek alternative sources of supply or to manufacture such components internally could significantly delay our ability to ship our products  which could damage relationships with current and prospective customers and could harm our reputation and brand  which could have a material adverse effect on our business 
our annual and quarterly performance may fluctuate 
our operating results have fluctuated and can be expected to continue to fluctuate in the future on a quarterly and annual basis as a result of a number of factors  many of which are beyond our control 
results in any period could be affected by o changes in market demand  o competitive market conditions  o market acceptance of existing or new products  especially in our mobile solutions business o fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates  o the cost and availability of components  o our ability to manufacture and ship products  o the mix of our customer base and sales channels  o the mix of products sold  o our ability to expand our sales and marketing organization effectively  o our ability to attract and retain key technical and managerial employees  o the timing of shipments of products under contracts and sale of licensing rights  and o general global economic conditions 
in addition  demand for our products in any quarter or year may vary due to the seasonal buying patterns of our customers in the agricultural and engineering and construction industries 
due to the foregoing factors  our operating results in one or more future periods are expected to be subject to significant fluctuations 
the price of our common stock could decline substantially in the event such fluctuations result in our financial performance being below the expectations of public market analysts and investors  which are based primarily on historical models that are not necessarily accurate representations of the future 
our gross margin is subject to fluctuation 
our gross margin is affected by a number of factors  including product mix  product pricing  cost of components  foreign currency exchange rates and manufacturing costs 
for example  since our engineering and construction e c and geographic information systems gis products generally have higher gross margins than our component technologies ct products  absent other factors  a shift in sales toward e c and gis products would lead to a gross margin improvement 
on the other hand  if market conditions in the highly competitive e c and gis market segments forced us to lower unit prices  we would suffer a decline in gross margin unless we were able to timely offset the price reduction by a reduction in production costs or by sales of other products with higher gross margins 
a decline in gross margin could negatively impact our earnings per share 
our business is subject to disruptions and uncertainties caused by war or terrorism 
acts of war or acts of terrorism could have a material adverse impact on our business  operating results  and financial condition 
the threat of terrorism and war and heightened security and military response to this threat  or any future acts of terrorism  may cause further disruption to our economy and create further uncertainties 
to the extent that such disruptions or uncertainties result in delays or cancellations of orders  or the manufacture or shipment of our products  our business  operating results  and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected 
our substantial indebtedness could materially restrict our operations and adversely affect our financial condition 
we now have  and for the foreseeable future expect to have  a significant level of indebtedness 
our substantial indebtedness could o increase our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions  o limit our ability to fund future working capital  capital expenditures  research and development and other general corporate requirements  or to make certain investments that could benefit us  o require us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow to service interest and principal payments on our debt  o limit our flexibility to react to changes in our business and the industry in which we operate  and o limit our ability to borrow additional funds 
our credit agreement contains stringent financial covenants 
two of the financial covenants in our credit agreement with the bank of nova scotia and certain other banks  dated july  as amended the credit agreement  minimum fixed charge coverage and maximum leverage ratio  are extremely sensitive to changes in earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization ebitda 
in turn  ebitda is highly correlated to revenues and costs 
due to uncertainties associated with the downturn in the worldwide economy  our future revenues by quarter are more difficult to forecast and we have put in place various cost cutting measures  including the consolidation of service functions and centers  offices  and of redundant product lines and reductions in staff 
if revenues should decline at a faster pace than the rate of these cost cutting measures  on a quarter to quarter basis we may not be in compliance with the two above mentioned financial covenants 
if we default on one or more covenants  we will have to obtain either negotiated waivers or amendments to the credit agreement 
if we were unable to obtain such waivers or amendments  the banks would have the right to accelerate the payment of our outstanding obligations under the credit agreement  which would have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and viability as an operating company 
in addition  a default under one of our debt instruments may also trigger cross defaults under our other debt instruments 
an event of default under any debt instrument  if not cured or waived  could have a material adverse effect on us 
in september of  we reached an agreement to ease our financial covenants 
these revised covenants will remain in effect through the term of the current credit facility 
on january   trimble executed an amended and restated credit agreement  which restructured the million revolver into four tranches 
tranches a c belong to the million us dollar revolver and tranches b d belong to the million multi currency revolver 
allocated to tranche a is  with an expiration date of july  and allocated to tranche c is  with an expiration date of april  allocated to tranche b is  with an expiration date of july  and allocated to tranche d is  with an expiration date of april  as a result  the million revolver will remain in effect through july  and be reduced to million for the period starting july  through april  we are dependent on key customers 
an increasing amount of our revenue is generated from large original equipment manufacturers such as siemens vdo automotive ag  nortel  mcneilus  caterpillar  cnh global  dewalt  hilti  and blaupunkt 
a reduction or loss of business with these customers could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to continue to realize value from these relationships in the future 
we are dependent on new products 
our future revenue stream depends to a large degree on our ability to bring new products to market on a timely basis 
we must continue to make significant investments in research and development in order to continue to develop new products  enhance existing products and achieve market acceptance of such products 
we may incur problems in the future in innovating and introducing new products 
our development stage products may not be successfully completed or  if developed  may not achieve significant customer acceptance 
if we were unable to successfully define  develop and introduce competitive new products  and enhance existing products  our future results of operations would be adversely affected 
development and manufacturing schedules for technology products are difficult to predict  and we might not achieve timely initial customer shipments of new products 
the timely availability of these products in volume and their acceptance by customers are important to our future success 
a delay in new product introductions could have a significant impact on our results of operations 
we face risks of entering into and maintaining alliances 
we believe that in certain emerging markets our success will depend on our ability to form and maintain alliances with established system providers and industry leaders 
our failure to form and maintain such alliances  or the preemption of such alliances by actions of other competitors or us will adversely affect our ability to penetrate emerging markets 
no assurances can be given that we will not experience problems from current or future alliances or that we will realize value from any such strategic alliances 
we are dependent on the availability of allocated bands within the radio frequency spectrum 
our gps technology is dependent on the use of the standard positioning service sps provided by the us government s global positioning system gps 
the gps sps operates in radio frequency bands that are globally allocated for radio navigation satellite services 
international allocations of radio frequency are made by the international telecommunications union itu  a specialized technical agency of the united nations 
these allocations are further governed by radio regulations that have treaty status and which may be subject to modification every two to three years by the world radio communication conference 
any itu reallocation of radio frequency bands  including frequency band segmentation or sharing of spectrum  may materially and adversely affect the utility and reliability of our products  which would  in turn  cause a material adverse effect on our operating results 
many of our products use other radio frequency bands  together with the gps signal  to provide enhanced gps capabilities  such as real time kinematics precision 
the continuing availability of these non gps radio frequencies is essential to provide enhanced gps products to our precision survey markets 
any regulatory changes in spectrum allocation or in allowable operating conditions may materially and adversely affect the utility and reliability of our products  which would  in turn  cause a material adverse effect on our operating results 
in addition  unwanted emissions from mobile satellite services and other equipment operating in adjacent frequency bands or in band from licensed and unlicensed devices may materially and adversely affect the utility and reliability of our products  which could result in a material adverse effect on our operating results 
the fcc continually receives proposals for novel technologies and services  such as ultra wideband technologies  which may seek to operate in  or across  the radio frequency bands currently used by the gps sps and other public safety services 
adverse decisions by the fcc that result in harmful interference to the delivery of the gps sps and other radio frequency spectrum also used in our products may materially and adversely affect the utility and reliability of our products  which could result in a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition 
we are subject to the adverse impact of radio frequency congestion 
we have certain real time kinematics products  such as our land survey  that use integrated radio communication technology requiring access to available radio frequencies allocated by the fcc 
in addition  access to these frequencies by state agencies is under management by state radio communications coordinators 
some bands are experiencing congestion that excludes their availability for access by state agencies in some states  including the state of california 
an inability to obtain access to these radio frequencies could have an adverse effect on our operating results 
many of our products rely on the gps satellite system 
the gps satellites and their ground support systems are complex electronic systems subject to electronic and mechanical failures and possible sabotage 
the satellites were originally designed to have lives of years and are subject to damage by the hostile space environment in which they operate 
however  of the current deployment of satellites in place  some have already been in operation for years 
to repair damaged or malfunctioning satellites is currently not economically feasible 
if a significant number of satellites were to become inoperable  there could be a substantial delay before they are replaced with new satellites 
a reduction in the number of operating satellites may impair the current utility of the gps system and the growth of current and additional market opportunities 
in addition  there can be no assurance that the us government will remain committed to the operation and maintenance of gps satellites over a long period  or that the policies of the us government for the use of gps without charge will remain unchanged 
however  a presidential decision directive marks the first time in the evolution of gps that access for civilian use free of direct user fees is specifically recognized and supported by presidential policy 
in addition  presidential policy has been complemented by corresponding legislation  signed into law 
because of ever increasing commercial applications of gps  other us government agencies may become involved in the administration or the regulation of the use of gps signals 
any of the foregoing factors could affect the willingness of buyers of our products to select gps based systems instead of products based on competing technologies 
any resulting change in market demand for gps products could have a material adverse effect on our financial results 
for example  european governments have expressed interest in building an independent satellite navigation system  known as galileo 
depending on the as yet undetermined design and operation of this system  there may be interference to the delivery of the gps sps and may materially and adversely affect the utility and reliability of our products  which could result in a material adverse effect on our business and operating results 
we face risks in investing in and integrating new acquisitions 
we are continuously evaluating external investments in technologies related to our business  and have made relatively small strategic equity investments in a number of gps related and laser related technology companies 
acquisitions of companies  divisions of companies  or products entail numerous risks  including o potential inability to successfully integrate acquired operations and products or to realize cost savings or other anticipated benefits from integration  o diversion of management s attention  o loss of key employees of acquired operations  o the difficulty of assimilating geographically dispersed operations and personnel of the acquired companies  o the potential disruption of our ongoing business  o unanticipated expenses related to such integration  o the correct assessment of the relative percentages of in process research and development expense that can be immediately written off as compared to the amount which must be amortized over the appropriate life of the asset  o the impairment of relationships with employees and customers of either an acquired company or our own business  o the potential unknown liabilities associated with acquired business  and o inability to recover strategic investments in development stage entities 
as a result of such acquisitions  we have significant assets that include goodwill and other purchased intangibles 
the testing of these intangibles under established accounting guidelines for impairment requires significant use of judgment and assumptions 
changes in business conditions could require adjustments to the valuation of these assets 
any such problems in integration or adjustments to the value of the assets acquired could harm our growth strategy and have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and compliance with debt covenants 
we face competition in our markets 
our markets are highly competitive and we expect that both direct and indirect competition will increase in the future 
our overall competitive position depends on a number of factors including the price  quality and performance of our products  the level of customer service  the development of new technology and our ability to participate in emerging markets 
within each of our markets  we encounter direct competition from other gps  optical and laser suppliers and competition may intensify from various larger domestic and international competitors and new market entrants  some of which may be our current customers 
the competition in the future  may  in some cases  result in price reductions  reduced margins or loss of market share  any of which could materially and adversely affect our business  operating results and financial condition 
we believe that our ability to compete successfully in the future against existing and additional competitors will depend largely on our ability to execute our strategy to provide systems and products with significantly differentiated features compared to currently available products 
we may not be able to implement this strategy successfully  and our products may not be competitive with other technologies or products that may be developed by our competitors  many of whom have significantly greater financial  technical  manufacturing  marketing  sales and other resources than we do 
we are dependent on proprietary technology 
our future success and competitive position is dependent upon our proprietary technology  and we rely on patent  trade secret  trademark and copyright law to protect our intellectual property 
the patents owned or licensed by us may be invalidated  circumvented  and challenged 
the rights granted under these patents may not provide competitive advantages to us 
any of our pending or future patent applications may not be issued within the scope of the claims sought by us  if at all 
others may develop technologies that are similar or superior to our technology  duplicate our technology or design around the patents owned by us 
in addition  effective copyright  patent and trade secret protection may be unavailable  limited or not applied for in certain foreign countries 
the steps taken by us to protect our technology might not prevent the misappropriation of such technology 
the value of our products relies substantially on our technical innovation in fields in which there are many current patent filings 
we recognize that as new patents are issued or are brought to our attention by the holders of such patents  it may be necessary for us to withdraw products from the market  take a license from such patent holders  or redesign our products 
we do not believe any of our products currently infringe patents or other proprietary rights of third parties  but we cannot be certain they do not do so 
in addition  the legal costs and engineering time required to safeguard intellectual property or to defend against litigation could become a significant expense of operations 
such events could have a material adverse effect on our revenues or profitability 
we must carefully manage our future growth 
growth in our sales or continued expansion in the scope of our operations could strain our current management  financial  manufacturing and other resources and may require us to implement and improve a variety of operating  financial and other systems  procedures and controls 
specifically we have experienced strain in our financial and order management system  as a result of our acquisitions 
we are expanding our sales  accounting  manufacturing  and other information systems to meet these challenges 
these systems  procedures or controls may not be adequate to support our operations and may not be designed  implemented or improved in a cost effective and timely manner 
any failure to implement  improve and expand such systems  procedures and controls in a timely and efficient manner could harm our growth strategy and adversely affect our financial condition and ability to achieve our business objectives 
we are dependent on retaining and attracting highly skilled development and managerial personnel 
our ability to maintain our competitive technological position will depend  in a large part  on our ability to attract  motivate  and retain highly qualified development and managerial personnel 
competition for qualified employees in our industry and location is intense  and there can be no assurance that we will be able to attract  motivate and retain enough qualified employees necessary for the future continued development of our business and products 
we may encounter problems associated with international operations and sales 
our customers are located throughout the world 
sales to unaffiliated customers in foreign locations represented approximately of our revenues in our fiscal year  in our fiscal year and in our fiscal year in addition  we have significant international operations  including manufacturing facilities  sales personnel and customer support operations 
our international sales organization contains offices in foreign countries 
our international manufacturing facilities are in sweden and germany  and we have a regional fulfillment center in the netherlands 
our international presence exposes us to risks not faced by wholly domestic companies 
specifically  we have experienced issues relating to integration of foreign operations  greater difficulty in accounts receivable collection  longer payment cycles and currency fluctuations 
additionally  we face the following risks  among others o unexpected changes in regulatory requirements  o tariffs and other trade barriers  o political  legal and economic instability in foreign markets  particularly in those markets in which we maintain manufacturing and research facilities  o difficulties in staffing and management  o language and cultural barriers  seasonal reductions in business activities in the summer months in europe and some other countries  o war and acts of terrorism  and o potentially adverse tax consequences 
although we implemented a program to attempt to manage foreign exchange risks through hedging and other strategies  there can be no assurance that this program will be successful and that currency exchange rate fluctuations will not have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 
in addition  in certain foreign markets  there may be reluctance to purchase products based on gps technology  given the control of gps by the us government 
we are exposed to fluctuations in currency exchange rates 
a significant portion of our business is conducted outside the united states  and as such  we face exposure to adverse movements in non us currency exchange rates 
these exposures may change over time as business practices evolve and could have a material adverse impact on our financial results and cash flows 
compared to fiscal  in fiscal  the us currency has weakened against other currencies 
currently  we hedge only those currency exposures associated with certain assets and liabilities denominated in nonfunctional currencies and periodically will hedge anticipated foreign currency cash flows 
the hedging activities undertaken by us are intended to offset the impact of currency fluctuations on certain nonfunctional currency assets and liabilities 
our attempts to hedge against these risks may not be successful resulting in an adverse impact on our net income 
the affect of the movement in foreign exchange rates has been reflected in the cumulative translation adjustment included in the accumulative other comprehensive loss under shareholders equity on our consolidated balance sheet statement located in this report 
we are subject to the impact of governmental and other similar certifications 
we market certain products that are subject to governmental and similar certifications before they can be sold 
for example  ce certification for radiated emissions is required for most gps receiver and data communications products sold in the european union 
an inability to obtain such certifications in a timely manner could have an adverse effect on our operating results 
also  our products that use integrated radio communication technology require an end user to obtain licensing from the federal communications commission fcc for frequency band usage 
these are secondary licenses that are subject to certain restrictions 
during the fourth quarter of  the fcc temporarily suspended the issuance of licenses for certain of our real time kinematics products because of interference with certain other users of similar radio frequencies 
an inability or delay in obtaining such certifications or changes to the rules by the fcc could adversely affect our ability to bring our products to market  which could harm our customer relationships and have a material adverse effect on our business 
our stock price may be volatile 
the price of our common stock can be expected to fluctuate substantially as it has in the past 
the price could react to actual or anticipated quarterly variations in results of operations  announcements of technological innovations or new products by us or our competitors  developments related to patents or other intellectual property rights  developments in our relationship with customers  suppliers  or strategic partners and other events or factors 
in addition  any shortfall or changes in revenue  gross margins  earnings  or other financial results from analysts expectations could cause the price of our common stock to fluctuate significantly 
additionally  macro economic factors as well as market climate for the high technology sector could also impact the trading price of our stock 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk we are exposed to market risk related to changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates 
we use certain derivative financial instruments to manage these risks 
we do not use derivative financial instruments for speculative or trading purposes 
all financial instruments are used in accordance with policies approved by our board of directors 
market interest rate risk we are exposed to market risk due to the possibility of changing interest rates under our senior secured credit facilities 
our credit facilities are comprised of a us dollar only revolver  a multi currency revolver both expiring april   and a five year term loan expiring july  borrowings under the credit facility have interest payments based on a floating rate of libor plus a number of basis points tied to a formula based on our leverage ratio 
as of january   our senior debt to ebitda senior leverage ratio was approximately 
at this leverage ratio our pricing on the credit facility is libor plus basis points 
the us dollar and the multi currency revolvers run through april and have outstanding principal balances at january  of million and million  respectively

foreign currency exchange rate risk we transact business in various foreign currencies and hedges identified risks associated with foreign currency transactions in order to minimize the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates on earnings 
we utilize forward contracts to hedge certain trade and inter company receivables and payables 
these contracts reduce the exposure to fluctuations in exchange rate movements as the gains and losses associated with foreign currency balances are generally offset with the gains and losses on the hedge contracts 
these hedge instruments are marked to market through earnings every period 
from time to time  we may also utilize forward foreign exchange contracts designated as cash flow hedges of operational exposures represented by firm backlog orders to specific accounts over a specific period of time 
we record changes in the fair value of cash flow hedges in accumulated  other comprehensive income loss  until the firm backlog transaction ships

all forward contracts have maturity of less than months
