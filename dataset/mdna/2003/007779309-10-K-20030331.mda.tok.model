overview aerogen  inc aerogen  the company or we was incorporated in november we are a specialty pharmaceutical company focusing on respiratory therapy in the acute care setting 
our core technology is based upon our proprietary aerosol generator 
using the technology  we are developing respiratory products for marketing by us  and products in collaboration with  and for marketing by  pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies for both respiratory therapy and for the delivery of drugs through the lungs to the bloodstream 
in  we generated significant revenues from our planned principal operations and exited the development stage 
however  we will continue to devote substantial efforts to the development of current and future products 
we currently have two nebulizer products on the market 
we have an accumulated deficit of approximately million as of december  we expect to incur significant additional operating losses over the next several years and expect cumulative losses to increase  primarily due to the costs associated with the manufacturing and marketing of our products  the expansion of our research and development activities and the general expansion of our business activities 
we anticipate that our quarterly results will fluctuate for the foreseeable future 
therefore  period to period comparisons should not be relied upon as predictive of the results in future periods 
our sources of working capital have been equity financings  product revenues  research and development revenues  interest earned on investments and  to a small extent  equipment lease financings 
in june we launched our first commercial product  the aeroneb portable nebulizer system  a simple  compact and silent nebulizer for use in the home setting 
in june we launched the aeroneb professional nebulizer system aeroneb pro nebulizer  developed for use in a hospital setting including the treatment of patients on ventilators 
both products incorporate our aerosol generator 
since the launch of the first product  we have recorded cumulative revenues of million associated with sales of the aeroneb products and component parts as of december  the aeroneb portable nebulizer system has been promoted in the united states by a small contract sales force under contract from a division of cardinal health  and by several home medical equipment distributors 
the aeroneb pro nebulizer is available in the united states where it is sold by puritan bennett with its newer ventilators and through cardinal health 
the aeroneb pro nebulizer is available in countries worldwide under agreements with puritan bennett and independent distributors in select countries 
we perform feasibility and initial development work to customize our nebulizers and inhalers to deliver specific drugs  for our own account or under agreement with third parties who compensate us for expenses incurred in performing this work 
once feasibility is demonstrated for a potential product  we may seek to enter into a development agreement with the corporate partner holding the commercial rights to the compound to be used in the product 
from february to december  we had such an agreement with pathogenesis acquired by chiron in late to develop an aerodose inhaler to deliver tobi  an inhaled tobramycin therapy for the treatment of cystic fibrosis 
our collaborative agreement with pathogenesis provided for reimbursement of development expenses incurred under an approved work plan  and royalties on future total product sales 
this collaboration was terminated by chiron in december we expect to receive similar payments from other partners for the development of products under similar collaborations  and royalties based on partner sales of products  if and when commercialized 
we also expect to receive revenue from manufacturing of products 
we recognize research and development revenues as reimbursable research and development expenses are incurred 
in may  we acquired cerus limited  now aerogen ireland limited  for  shares of our series e convertible preferred stock 
the total purchase consideration was approximately million  including transaction costs of approximately  cerus was developing products under a license from us using our core aerosol generator technology 
the acquisition of cerus was accounted for using the purchase method of accounting 
the purchase price  which for financial accounting purposes was valued at million  was allocated to the assets acquired and the liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values at the date of acquisition  as determined by management 
as a result of this transaction  we recorded expense associated with the purchase of in process research and development of million  net tangible assets of million  and intangible assets including goodwill of million 
through december  goodwill was amortized on a straight line basis  over six years 
beginning in january  in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
goodwill and other intangible assets sfas  goodwill and other intangible assets were no longer systematically amortized  instead we perform an annual assessment for impairment by applying a fair value based test 
we have incurred stock based compensation expenses of million  million  and million  for the years ended december   and  respectively 
stock based compensation included in research and development expenses was million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
stock based compensation included in selling  general and administrative expenses was million  million and million  respectively  for the years ended december   and as of december   there was approximately million of remaining deferred stock based compensation  which will continue to be amortized to expense on a straight line basis through we anticipate incurring additional stock based compensation expense in the future as a result of fluctuations in the market value of our common stock  which will continue to have a direct impact on the value of common stock options held by employees and non employees 
we had federal and state net operating loss carry forwards of approximately million and million  respectively  as of december  we also had aggregate federal and state research and development tax credit carryforwards of approximately million as of december  the net operating loss and credit carryforwards will expire at various dates through the year  if not utilized 
due to the uncertainty regarding the ultimate utilization of the net operating loss and credit carryforwards  we have not recorded any benefit for losses  and a valuation allowance has been recorded for the entire amount of the net deferred tax asset 
utilization of net operating losses and credits may be substantially limited due to the change in ownership provisions of the internal revenue code of and similar state provisions 
the annual limitation may result in the expiration of net operating losses and credits before they can be used 
during  we had two reductions in force  one in january and one in june  terminating the employment of a total of employees 
the prospective annualized payroll related savings resulting from the reductions in force was million  the majority of which was in research and development 
severance related costs were million  all of which was expensed and paid during in december  we began a restructuring  which included the suspension of further development of our aerodose insulin inhaler  followed by an additional reduction in force in january terminating employees 
we did not incur any expenses in as a result of the january restructuring activities 
critical accounting policies and estimates aerogen s discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates  including inventories  bad debts  intangible assets including goodwill  warranty obligations  contingencies and litigation 
we base our estimates on assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we have an irish subsidiary  which accounted for approximately of our net loss for the year ended december  and of our assets and of our total liabilities as of december  in preparing our consolidated financial statements  we are required to translate the financial statements of the foreign subsidiary from the currency in which it keeps its accounting records into united states dollars 
under the relevant accounting guidance  the treatment of these gains or losses is dependent upon our determination of the functional currency 
the determination of the functional currency is based on our judgment and involves consideration of all relevant economic facts and circumstance affecting the subsidiary 
based on our assessment  we consider our irish subsidiary s local currency  the euro  to be the functional currency 
accordingly we had cumulative translation gains losses of approximately   and  which were in accumulated other comprehensive income loss on our balance sheets at december   and  respectively 
during  and  respectively  translation adjustments of   and  respectively  were recorded as components of other comprehensive loss 
had we determined that the functional currency of our subsidiary was the united states dollar  these gains losses would have affected our net losses for each of the years presented 
the magnitude of these gains or losses is dependent upon movements in the exchange rates of the foreign currencies in which we transact business against the united states dollar 
any future translation gains or losses could be significantly different from those noted in each of these years 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
we write down our inventory for estimated obsolescence or unmarketable inventory in an amount equal to the difference between the cost of inventory and the estimated market value based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions 
if actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management  additional inventory write downs may be required 
we provide for the estimated cost of product warranty at the time revenue is recognized 
while we engage in product quality programs and processes  including actively monitoring and evaluating the quality of our component suppliers  our warranty obligation is affected by product failure rates  material usage and delivery costs incurred in correcting any product failure 
should actual product failure rates or material usage differ from our estimates  revisions to the estimated warranty liability would be required 
we record revenues from product sales at the time of product shipment  provided an enforceable claim exists  any significant rights to return product have expired and collection of the receivable is probable 
to date  we have made minor discounts to revenue for one customer program or incentive offering  which was done at the time of the sale to this customer 
if we determined to take additional actions to initiate such incentive offerings  such action might result in a reduction of revenue at the time the incentive is offered 
our assessment of the facts at a given time may result in revenues being recorded in a period other than what they would have been  based on actual subsequent events 
we review the need for an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the failure of our customers to make required payments 
if conditions change  additional allowances may be required 
results of operations comparison of years ended december   and research and development revenues 
research and development revenues were million in  million in  and million in the revenue decrease in as compared to resulted from decreased development activities for chiron of million partially offset by development activities for other partners of million 
the revenue decrease in as compared to resulted from development activities performed for pathogenesis of million and activities for a biotechnology company of million 
revenues from other customers were not material for these periods 
research and development revenues can be expected to vary from period to period based on the activities requested by partners in any particular period  and therefore are not predictable 
we expect research and development revenues for to be higher than those for as several new programs begin to move forward 
product sales 
product sales were million in  million in and none in we launched our first commercial product  the aeroneb portable nebulizer system  in june and our second commercial product  the aeroneb pro nebulizer in june the increase in product sales for the year ended is due to the successful launch of the aeroneb pro nebulizer in june we expect sales volume will increase in  with a full year of sales 
royalty revenues 
royalty revenues were million in  million in and none in the and revenue represents minimum royalties from a consumer company that licensed our aerosol generator technology for use in the field of air fresheners and insect repellants 
cost of products sold 
cost of products sold were million in  million in  and none in in  the cost of products sold was high as a percentage of product sales due primarily to low yields early in the year associated with start up of the commercial manufacturing processes and the move to the new facility 
during the second half of  we saw improved margins as volumes increased and as we completed our move into our new facility in mountain view  california  which incorporates more automated manufacturing processes and improved environmental controls 
we anticipate that costs per unit will decrease over time as volumes increase  and as we refine our manufacturing processes and focus on cost reductions 
research and development expenses 
research and development expenses were million in  million in  and million in the decrease in research and development expenses in compared with was primarily due to reduction in expenses associated with finalizing the commercial version of the aerodose insulin inhaler and the completion of phase a clinical trials for the insulin program of million 
in addition  in there was a reduction of million in payroll related expenses associated with the reductions in force  reductions in expense with the completion of the development of an aerodose respiratory inhaler of million and other spending reductions of million  partially offset by increased facility and information technology related expenses of million 
research and development expenses increased in as compared to  which was primarily due to the expansion of product development activities for our respiratory products 
research and development expenses also increased in over due to activities for our aerodose insulin inhaler 
the increase was largely attributable to internal salary and related increases of million excluding ireland  increased irish operations of million and machining and tooling costs of million 
research and development expenses relate to our own research and development projects  as well as the costs related to development activities for our partners 
development expenses for partner activities approximate revenues from those partners 
research and development expenses include salaries and benefits for scientific and development personnel  laboratory supplies  consulting services  clinical expenses and the expenses associated with the development of manufacturing processes  in each case including related overhead 
we expect research and development spending to increase over the next several years as we increase clinical activities and expand our research and development activities in support of our products and those which we develop in partner collaborations 
the increase in research and development expenditures cannot be predicted reliably  as it depends in part upon our success in entering into new partnering agreements and the timing of development and clinical activities that are largely controlled by our partners 
selling  general and administrative expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses were million in  million in  and million in the increase in selling  general and administrative expenses for as compared to was primarily due to the increased facility expenses associated with the new mountain view facility of million  an incremental million associated with the outside sales force  and an incremental million of stock compensation expense amortized in partially offsetting the increases were reductions in payroll related expenses associated with the reduction in force of million  reductions in advertising expenses of million  and reductions in consulting expenses of million 
in addition  the amortization of goodwill was discontinued in in accordance with sfas resulting in a million reduction of expenses 
the increase in selling  general and administrative expenses in compared with was due to increases in sales and marketing expenses of million and increases in general and administrative expenses of million 
sales and marketing expenses for increased as compared to primarily due to million in expenses relating to the hiring of a contract sales force for the launch of our first commercial product  the aeroneb portable nebulizer system  in mid  other marketing and sales related personnel costs of million and amortization of deferred stock based compensation of million 
general and administrative expenses for increased over primarily due to payroll related increases of million associated with the general and administrative infrastructure including legal  information technology and investor relations 
general and administrative expenses for also increased due to additional costs of million related to being a public company  such as directors and officers liability insurance  nasdaq fees and the costs associated with filing sec reports 
purchased in process research and development 
in conjunction with the acquisition of our irish subsidiary we recorded a million expense during the second quarter of  which was associated with the purchase of in process research and development 
the purchased research and development represents the value of new technologies that were in various stages of development where no alternative future use was identified 
the value of purchased in process research and development was determined by management utilizing various methods  including the income approach 
litigation settlement 
in october of  we settled a lawsuit brought by us against becton  dickinson and company bd 
under the settlement agreement  we paid bd a total of million  in two equal installments  in october and february as a result of the settlement  we own all of the intellectual property developed by either party under the now terminated agreement  and bd has a non exclusive license to certain technology developed by bd under the agreement for use outside the field of inhaled insulin 
the litigation settlement was immediately expensed to operations  as the technology acquired will be used in conjunction with a product that had not yet been approved for sale by regulatory authorities 
interest and other income  net 
interest income was million in  million in  and million in the decrease in interest income in  as compared to  was primarily due to lower average cash and investment balances  and to a lesser extent  lower interest rates 
the increase in interest income in over was primarily due to higher average cash and investment balances resulting from the completion of equity placements of our common and convertible preferred stock in november  july  may and march of sales of common stock include our initial public offering in november  which resulted in approximately million of net proceeds 
interest expense was  in   in  and  in the decrease in interest expense in  as compared to  was primarily due to repayments of borrowings under an equipment lease financing agreement 
dividends related to beneficial conversion feature of preferred stock 
dividends relating to the beneficial conversion feature of our preferred stock of million were recorded in the year ended december  these dividends arose due to the issuance of  shares of series e convertible preferred stock in may for net proceeds of million  of beneficial conversion and  shares of series f convertible preferred stock in july for net proceeds of million million of beneficial conversion 
liquidity and capital resources since inception  we have financed our operations primarily through equity financings  product revenues  research and development revenues  and the interest earned on related proceeds 
we have received approximately million aggregate net proceeds from sales of our common and preferred stock through december   including approximately million of net proceeds from our initial public offering in november as of december  we had cash  cash equivalents and available for sale securities of approximately million 
during  our expenditures have been approximately million per month 
we will need to raise additional funds through public or private financings  collaborative relationships or other arrangements within the next to days in order to continue as a going concern 
we cannot be certain that such additional funding will be available on terms attractive to us  or at all 
furthermore  additional equity or debt financing may involve substantial dilution to our existing stockholders  restrictive covenants or high interest rates 
collaborative arrangements  if necessary to raise additional funds  may require us to relinquish rights to either certain of our products or technologies or desirable marketing territories  or all of these 
net cash used in operating activities was million  million  and million for the years ended december   and  respectively  and resulted primarily from operating losses adjusted for non cash expenses and changes in accrued liabilities  accounts payable  accounts receivable  inventories and other assets 
net cash provided by investing activities for the year ended december  was million and was due to the maturity of available for sale securities 
for the years ended december  and  cash used by investing activities was million and million  respectively  and resulted primarily from the addition of leasehold improvements  which amounted to million and million  respectively  acquisition of property and equipment  which was million and million  respectively  and the net purchase of available for sale securities 
net cash provided by financing activities was million  million  and million for the years ended december     respectively 
in  approximately million was provided almost equally by repayment of earlier loans to stockholder executives  and purchases of common stock under our employee stock purchase plan 
in  approximately million was provided by purchases of common stock under our employee stock purchase plan 
we raised million from the sale of our common stock in our initial public offering in november of we also had proceeds of million in from the sale of our convertible preferred stock 
the development of our technology and proposed products requires a commitment of substantial funds to conduct the costly and time consuming research and development and clinical trials required to develop and refine our technology and proposed products and to bring those products to market 
our future capital requirements and operating expenses will depend on many factors including  but not limited to  research and development activities  the timing  cost  extent and results of clinical trials  our success in licensing drugs for use in our products  regulatory approvals  the status of competitive products  manufacturing and marketing costs associated with commercialization of products  costs involved in obtaining and maintaining patents  and our ability to enter into and maintain collaborative agreements 
we currently have no material commitment for capital expenditures 
we have a ten year lease for our mountain view facility that was signed in october of our total lease obligation through is approximately million  plus approximately million annually of common area maintenance fees  which may escalate in the future 
in addition  we have a lease commitment on our facility in ireland for approximately million  and a commitment for approximately million anticipated to be paid in to irish investors under a tax advantaged business expansion scheme 
our long term liquidity also depends upon our ability to attract and maintain collaborative relationships  to increase revenues from the sale of our products  to develop and market new products and ultimately  to achieve profitability 
we have no relationship with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships 
we have no debt arrangements with restrictive covenants

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk interest rate risk 
interest rate risk represents the risk of loss that may impact our financial position  operating results or cash flows due to changes in interest rates 
this exposure is directly related to our normal operating activities 
our cash  cash equivalents and short term investments are invested in government notes and money market funds and are generally of a short term nature 
due to the short term nature of these investments  we do not believe that near term changes in interest rates will have a material effect on our future results of operations 
exchange rate risk 
due to our irish operations  we have market risk exposure to adverse changes in foreign exchange rates 
the revenues and expenses of our subsidiary  aerogen ireland limited  are denominated in its local currency 
effective january  the irish subsidiary s functional currency became the euro previously the irish punt 
at the end of each period  the revenues and expenses of our subsidiary are translated into us dollars using the average currency rate in effect for that period  and assets and liabilities are translated into us dollars using the exchange rate in effect at the end of that period 
fluctuations in exchange rates therefore impact our financial condition and results of operations  as reported in us dollars 
to date  we have not experienced any significant negative impact as a result of fluctuations in foreign currency markets 
as a policy  we do not engage in speculative or leveraged transactions  nor do we hold financial instruments for trading purposes 
if we expand our overseas operations  our operating results may become subject to more significant fluctuations based on changes in exchange rates of foreign currencies in relation to the us dollar 
we will periodically analyze our exposure to currency fluctuations and may adjust our policies to allow for financial hedging techniques to minimize exchange rate risk
